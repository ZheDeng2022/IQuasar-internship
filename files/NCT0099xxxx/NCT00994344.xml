      The purpose of this study is to determine the non-inferiority in the efficacy of DRV/r&#xD;
      (900/100 mg) monotherapy at 48 weeks versus LPV/r (400/100 mg) as simplification strategy in&#xD;
      subjects with sustained viral suppression on stable PI or NNRTI-antiretroviral regimens.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pillar of the current standard of care for highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART)&#xD;
      is the use of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs).1 However, these agents&#xD;
      can inhibit the mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma, causing mitochondrial dysfunction, which,&#xD;
      in turn, may cause NRTI-related adverse events such as peripheral neuropathy, pancreatitis,&#xD;
      liver disturbances, lipid profile abnormalities or lipoatrophy.2 As a result, strategies&#xD;
      aimed to avoid the long term exposure to NRTIs and their toxicities are desirable for the&#xD;
      management of HIV-infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy with protease inhibitors (PIs) as a simplification approach therapy after an&#xD;
      induction period with conventional antiretroviral treatment, appears to be of great utility&#xD;
      for minimizing mitochondrial toxicity because of NRTIs. This approach may also increase&#xD;
      patient adherence, reduce costs and preserve future treatment options. However, concerns&#xD;
      remain regarding compartmental HIV replication due to limited drug penetration into the&#xD;
      central nervous system, risk factors associated with monotherapy failure as well as the&#xD;
      extrapolation of results obtained in clinical trial settings to routine clinical practice,&#xD;
      are still not well known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, there are reports that have suggested that lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)&#xD;
      monotherapy may be an effective therapeutic option for treatment of HIV-1 infection in&#xD;
      antiretroviral-naïve patients. 5,6 Moreover, some studies report that despite LPV/r allows&#xD;
      CSF concentrations lower than plasma, its concentrations exceed levels that suppress&#xD;
      wild-type HIV replication.7,8,9 However other authors have reported that LPV/r monotherapy&#xD;
      results in suboptimal HIV suppression in the CSF compartment in approximately 10% of cases.10&#xD;
&#xD;
      Darunavir is the last PI with activity against wild-type and PI-resistant HIV. In ARTEMIS&#xD;
      trial, DRV/r at doses of 800/100 mg once daily have demonstrated that it is non inferior and&#xD;
      statistically superior than LPV/r and it is an effective treatment option for antiretroviral&#xD;
      (ARV)-naïve patients. In this study, patients receiving once-daily DRV/r achieved high&#xD;
      durable virologic response rates, which were comparable in patients with less favourable&#xD;
      baseline characteristics or suboptimal adherence. In addition, they had a low discontinuation&#xD;
      rate due to virologic failure or adverse events or both, did not develop protease inhibitor&#xD;
      resistance upon failure, and had suitable drug exposure. 11,12&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these benefits, coupled with the higher genetic barrier, its favourable safety and&#xD;
      plasmatic pharmacokinetic profile of DRV/r, suggest that DRV/r has the potential to be an&#xD;
      excellent option for monotherapy simplification strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective and randomised clinical trial that compares the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of DRV/r 900/100 mg monotherapy once daily versus LPV/r&#xD;
      400/100 monotherapy twice daily as simplification strategy in HIV-infected patients with&#xD;
      stable NNRTI or PI-based antiretroviral regimen and sustained viral suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside to the main goal of this project, the investigators are going to make use of the&#xD;
      samples obtained from the CSF at 48 weeks of follow-up (as representative of the viruses&#xD;
      replicating in the central nervous system) and genital tract and plasma at the different time&#xD;
      points. The investigators will compare the sequence population of those organs from the&#xD;
      different patients in order to state if viruses not found in plasma at one time point but&#xD;
      found in reservoirs can be found in blood when the infection advance.&#xD;
