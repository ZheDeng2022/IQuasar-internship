      The purpose of this study is to determine whether calcineurin phosphatase in the&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes is up-regulated after long-term treatment with tacrolimus, a calcineurin&#xD;
      inhibitor.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunosuppressive effect of both tacrolimus and cyclosporine is believed to be through&#xD;
      inhibition of the enzyme calcineurin phosphatase (CaN) in T-lymphocytes. We have&#xD;
      demonstrated, that tacrolimus decreases CaN activity in patients early after renal&#xD;
      transplantation. In stable renal transplant patients treated this inhibition was hardly seen&#xD;
      in patients treated with tacrolimus, while it was clearly demonstrated in patients treated&#xD;
      cyclosporine. One explanation to this finding could be, that calcineurin phosphatase is&#xD;
      up-regulated by long-term treatment with tacrolimus. The findings seem to imply, that&#xD;
      tacrolimus has mechanisms of immunosuppression apart from inhibiting CaN. This could have&#xD;
      implications for side-effects due to CaN inhibition. Among side-effects thought to be due to&#xD;
      CaN inhibition is nephrotoxicity. The results may therefore be and indication of tacrolimus&#xD;
      being less nephrotoxic compared to cyclosporine in long-term stable renal transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is find out if long-term treatment with tacrolimus results in&#xD;
      up-regulation of CaN in lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general plan of the investigation is to compare CaN in lymphocytes in two groups of renal&#xD;
      transplant patients treated with tacrolimus. One group just prior and just after&#xD;
      transplantation compared to a group of stable renal transplanted patients a long time after&#xD;
      transplantation. CaN is determined as enzyme activity, amount of protein, and by&#xD;
      gen-activation.&#xD;
