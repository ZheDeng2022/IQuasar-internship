      Combined modality therapy has then emerged as the standard of care for limited-stage&#xD;
      Hodgkin's lymphoma and doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (ABVD)&#xD;
      chemotherapy that is devoid of alkylating agents and associated with a low potential for&#xD;
      gonadal toxicity and leukemogenesis, is currently considered a gold standard. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      the disadvantage to combine radiotherapy to ABVD is represented by late cardiovascular events&#xD;
      (myocardial dysfunction and coronary or valvular disease), especially when the heart is&#xD;
      within the radiation field; bleomycin pulmonary toxicity also is increased in conjunction&#xD;
      with RT and secondary tumors, in particular in the RT fields. This study aims at treating&#xD;
      patients with limited disease with multiagent chemotherapy alone, without irradiation, and&#xD;
      using radiotherapy only for relapses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Limited-stage Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable disease, with expected long-term&#xD;
      disease-free and overall survival rates close to 90% and 95%, respectively. This success has&#xD;
      come at a cost of long-term treatment-related toxicity, such that the patients who live&#xD;
      beyond 10 to 15 years are more likely to die from late complications of treatment than from&#xD;
      the disease itself. In the last decades efforts to improve long-term results have been made&#xD;
      by developing curative strategies aimed to reduce toxicity while maintaining high cure rates.&#xD;
      Based on the observation that systemic chemotherapy can control occult sites of the disease,&#xD;
      thereby eliminating the requirement for staging laparotomy, in the last years the use of&#xD;
      combined modalities that allowed a reduction of number of cycles of chemotherapy and of&#xD;
      radiation field size and doses, thus reducing late toxicity was investigated in various&#xD;
      clinical trials. Combined modality therapy has then emerged as the standard of care for&#xD;
      limited-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine&#xD;
      (ABVD) chemotherapy that is devoid of alkylating agents and associated with a low potential&#xD;
      for gonadal toxicity and leukemogenesis, is currently considered the gold standard.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, optimal treatment is still a question of debate and current investigations are&#xD;
      now taking into consideration to further reduce long-term toxicity. Actually two main options&#xD;
      are available. The first option combines radiotherapy to ABVD chemotherapy, with the aim to&#xD;
      maximize disease control. Using 4 cycles of ABVD followed by involved field radiotherapy at&#xD;
      36 Gy, Bonadonna and coworkers first documented a 94% freedom-from-progression and a 94%&#xD;
      overall survival rate, respectively. The disadvantage with this approach is represented by&#xD;
      late cardiovascular events (myocardial dysfunction and coronary or valvular disease),&#xD;
      especially when the heart is within the radiation field; bleomycin pulmonary toxicity also is&#xD;
      increased in conjunction with RT and secondary tumors, in particular in the RT fields.&#xD;
      Whether these risks will be lower with fewer chemotherapy cycles, lower RT doses, or both has&#xD;
      been studied in many clinical trials that have demonstrated that smaller radiation fields and&#xD;
      lower doses are important, but a key unanswered question is whether RT can be eliminated&#xD;
      completely in limited-stage patients. The second option therefore consists of chemotherapy&#xD;
      with ABVD alone, with the aim to eliminate the late effects of radiotherapy. This approach&#xD;
      have resulted in an absolute increase of the failure rate in the order of 8% (from&#xD;
      approximately 4% up to 12%). However, the majority of relapsing patients achieves a durable&#xD;
      disease control with a second-line radiation-containing combined approach, and shows an&#xD;
      overall survival rate superimposable to that of patients receiving upfront combined strategy&#xD;
      with chemo-radiotherapy. We thus designed a study aimed at treating patients with limited&#xD;
      disease with multiagent chemotherapy alone, without irradiation, and using radiotherapy only&#xD;
      for relapses. In fact, it has recently been reported that the addition of Rituximab (a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 B-cell antigens) to ABVD significantly&#xD;
      increases the antilymphoma activity of ABVD alone in advanced-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma and in&#xD;
      absence of added toxicity. In conclusion, rituximab-supplemented ABVD (R-ABVD) given to&#xD;
      early-stage Hodgkin's lymphoma might represent a radiation-free regimen capable of increasing&#xD;
      long-term disease control of ABVD alone, while avoiding the late effects of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether the R-ABVD therapy (ARM A) is not&#xD;
      worse than the standard therapy of ABVD-RT (ARM B) in patients with limited Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma. In this trial a maximum inferiority of 8% of the 3-year Failure Free Survival rate&#xD;
      (FFS) in ARM A with respect to ARM B is considered acceptable to assess that ARM A is not&#xD;
      worse than ARM B.&#xD;
