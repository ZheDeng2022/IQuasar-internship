  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective is to test a novel paradigm for the inhibition of human preterm uterine&#xD;
      contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is that human preterm contractions can be safely inhibited with a weak&#xD;
      electrical current provided by an electrical inhibition/uterine pacemaker device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preterm birth is still a major problem. Current methods of preventing the uterine&#xD;
      contractions of preterm are limited and associated with many side-effects affecting both the&#xD;
      mother and baby. A reliable method of preventing preterm uterine contractions would be an&#xD;
      important discovery. Such a method could eventually lead to a long-term goal of decreasing&#xD;
      neonatal morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a Pilot Study to confirm the safety of the uterine inhibitor/pacemaker&#xD;
      and measure its effect on women experiencing preterm labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 10 (ten) patients will be enrolled in this pilot study to confirm the methodology&#xD;
      and safety of the device. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study device (EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker) has been classified by FDA as an&#xD;
      Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) number G080036, Class A device. The EI/uterine&#xD;
      inhibitor/pacemaker device is FDA cleared for research of the prevention of the prevention of&#xD;
      the human contractions of preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal is for an initial prospective FDA approved pilot study. After FDA evaluation of&#xD;
      the pilot study findings and approval, the pilot study may lead eventually to a prospective&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only adult women who are experiencing uterine contractions due to the birthing process are&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study patients will be informed about the purpose of the EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker&#xD;
      device and give informed consent prior to its use. The device will be used for only 20&#xD;
      minutes, preceded and followed by a 20 minute control period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the birthing process recordings of the uterine contractions will be recorded.&#xD;
      Comparison will be made of these uterine contraction records pre and post use use of the&#xD;
      EI/uterine inhibitor/pacemaker device. The uterine contraction tracings will be compared and&#xD;
      analyzed for differences in the frequency of contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will also be told how to express the strength of any of their subjective pain in&#xD;
      a manner that can be documented in a questionnaire. Study patients will also have their&#xD;
      record of the type and amount of pain medication they have received noted on their patient&#xD;
      log forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous human and animal studies indicate minimal risk to either baby or mother. Human&#xD;
      studies showed no effect on the fetal or maternal heart rate. Real-time monitoring of the&#xD;
      fetal and maternal heart rate during the study will protect against there potential risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BENEFIT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reducing the frequency of preterm uterine contractions is a first step to preventing preterm&#xD;
      birth,but the proposed investigation is not, itself, expected to prevent any preterm births.&#xD;
      However, the investigation could have great benefit to future mothers and their babies.&#xD;
