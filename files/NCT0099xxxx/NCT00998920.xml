    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating multiple&#xD;
      doses of S-equol administered twice daily (BID) for 14 days to healthy male and female&#xD;
      subjects and to describe the pharmacokinetic profile of S-equol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of doses escalated by&#xD;
      cohort. Volunteers will be randomized to receive active study drug or placebo twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) for 14 days. This study will be staggered in timing with the single rising dose study&#xD;
      (Protocol AUS-CT01) being conducted concurrently, such that the lowest dose cohort of this&#xD;
      multiple rising dose study may begin after evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetic data from&#xD;
      the first 8 subjects randomized to the 10 mg dose cohort of the single rising dose study and&#xD;
      safety data from the 8 Subjects randomized in the 20 mg dose cohort of that study.&#xD;
