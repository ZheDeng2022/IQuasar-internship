    <textblock>
      This study is an open, non- randomized, phase I, dose-escalating study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerance of Amphinex based PCI of bleomycin in patients with local recurrent or&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic, cutaneous or sub-cutaneous malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients will be included in cohorts of 3 patients. The initial starting dose for&#xD;
      Amphinex will be given 4 days prior to the fixed dose of bleomycin administered by&#xD;
      intravenous infusion. The illumination, with red light (laser 652 nm), to the tumour surface&#xD;
      and a margin of 2-3 mm outside the tumour surface, will be performed after bleomycin&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no comparative procedure in this study. Dose escalation will proceed according&#xD;
      to a modification of Simon's accelerated titration design. The number of patients recruited&#xD;
      depends on the DLT experienced. A total of 6 patients will be included at each dose level if&#xD;
      no more than 1 patient experiences DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional cohorts may be added pending the outcome of the previous cohorts and discussions&#xD;
      between the investigators and the Sponsor. The primary goal of the study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerance of the Amphinex and determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of&#xD;
      Amphinex as a PCI therapy in combination with bleomycin treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female aged 18 years or above who have given written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skin type I- IV according to the Fitzpatrick skin classification (see appendix G).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Lesion measurement must not be done more than 2 weeks before the beginning of&#xD;
             treatment. More than one field with lesion can be illuminated, but care must be taken&#xD;
             to avoid overlap of the fields illuminated.&#xD;
