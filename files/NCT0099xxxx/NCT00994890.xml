    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the safety of three fixed dose levels of tanezumab (2.5 mg, 5 mg,&#xD;
      and 10 mg) administered at an 8-week interval by subcutaneous injection multiple (7) times&#xD;
      during the study treatment period.&#xD;

      Safety study of tanezumab in relief of osteoarthritis pain This study was terminated on 6&#xD;
      December 2010 following a US FDA clinical hold for tanezumab osteoarthritis clinical studies&#xD;
      which halted dosing and enrollment of patients on 23 June 2010 for potential safety issues.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. SAE was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 112 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state.</description>

Reflexes included 5 items (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachioradialis), sensation included 4 items each for great toe and index finger (touch pressure, pin prick, vibration, joint position), each item scored as 0=normal, 1=decreased, 2=absent.

        <description>NIS: 74-item, assess cranial nerves, muscle weakness, reflexes, sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs (37 items for each). Cranial nerves included 5 items (3rd nerve, 6th nerve, facial weakness, palate weakness, tongue weakness), muscle weakness included 19 items (respiratory,neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, brachioradialis,elbow extension, wrist flexion,wrist extension,finger flexion,finger spread,thumb abduction,hip flexion,hip extension,knee flexion,knee extension,ankle dorsiflexors,ankle plantar flexors,toe extensors,toe flexors), each item scored on scale 0=normal to 4=paralysis, higher score=greater weakness. Reflexes included 5 items (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachioradialis), sensation included 4 items each for great toe and index finger (touch pressure, pin prick, vibration, joint position), each item scored as 0=normal, 1=decreased, 2=absent.

          <description>NIS: 74-item, assess cranial nerves, muscle weakness, reflexes, sensation; scored separately for left, right limbs (37 items for each). Cranial nerves included 5 items (3rd nerve, 6th nerve, facial weakness, palate weakness, tongue weakness), muscle weakness included 19 items (respiratory,neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion, brachioradialis,elbow extension, wrist flexion,wrist extension,finger flexion,finger spread,thumb abduction,hip flexion,hip extension,knee flexion,knee extension,ankle dorsiflexors,ankle plantar flexors,toe extensors,toe flexors), each item scored on scale 0=normal to 4=paralysis, higher score=greater weakness. Reflexes included 5 items (quadriceps femoris, triceps surae, biceps brachii, triceps brachii, brachioradialis), sensation included 4 items each for great toe and index finger (touch pressure, pin prick, vibration, joint position), each item scored as 0=normal, 1=decreased, 2=absent. Total NIS score range 0-244, higher score=greater impairment.</description>
          <population>ITT analysis set included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of subcutaneous study medication. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure.</population>

        <description>WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in index knee or index hip during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score was 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <description>WOMAC physical function subscale is a 17-item questionnaire used to assess the degree of difficulty experienced due to osteoarthritis in index joint and index hip during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from 17 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicated worse function. Total score range for WOMAC physical function subscale score was 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated worse function.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With At Least 30 Percent (%), 50%, 70% and 90% Reduction in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score</title>
        <description>Percentage of participants with at least 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% reduction from baseline in WOMAC pain subscale score are reported. WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in index knee or index hip during past 48 hours. It was calculated as mean of the scores from the 5 individual questions scored on a 0 to 10 NRS, where higher scores indicated higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicated higher pain.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Cumulative Reduction From Baseline in Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain Subscale Score</title>
        <description>WOMAC pain subscale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to osteoarthritis in index knee or index hip during past 48 hours. It is calculated as mean of the scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS) of 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Total score range for WOMAC pain subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher pain. Participants with specified reduction (as percent) from baseline at Week 16 are reported.</description>

        <population>ITT analysis set. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those participants who were evaluable for this measure. Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Due to implementation of the FDA clinical hold, all ongoing participants were discontinued from treatment and did not have an opportunity to complete the 56-week treatment period and no efficacy data beyond the Week 32 visit (i.e., Weeks 40, 48 and 56) was collected.</population>

        <description>WOMAC stiffness subscale is a 2-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of stiffness experienced due to osteoarthritis in index knee or index hip during past 48 hours. It is calculated as mean of the scores from 2 individual questions scored on NRS of 0 to 10, with higher scores indicate higher stiffness. Total score range for WOMAC stiffness subscale score is 0 to 10, where higher scores indicate higher stiffness. Stiffness is defined as a sensation of decreased ease in movement of knee or hip.</description>

        <description>WOMAC: self-administered, disease-specific 24-item questionnaire which assesses clinically important, participant-relevant symptoms for pain (5 items), stiffness (2 items) and physical function (17 items) in participants with osteoarthritis of knee or hip. Each item was scored on a 0 to 10 NRS scale, where higher scores indicated higher pain/stiffness or worse function. WOMAC average score was the mean of WOMAC pain, physical function and stiffness subscale scores and ranged from 0 to 10, where higher score indicated worse response.</description>

Missing data was imputed using last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. Due to implementation of the FDA clinical hold, all ongoing participants were discontinued from treatment and did not have an opportunity to complete the 56-week treatment period and no efficacy data beyond the Week 32 visit (i.e., Weeks 40, 48 and 56) was collected.</population>
