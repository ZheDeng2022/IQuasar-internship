    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of Civamide Cream 0.075% as a treatment of the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms associated with osteoarthritis of the knee.&#xD;

      To ensure that both subjects and investigators remain blinded, the following design will be&#xD;
      employed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subject Blinding: Randomization Subjects will be blinded to assignment to the placebo or&#xD;
           active study drug: One half of the subjects will be randomized to Civamide Cream 0.075%&#xD;
           to be applied on the Target Knee 3 times daily for 84 days (12 weeks). The other half&#xD;
           will be randomized to Placebo Cream to be applied on the Target Knee 3 times daily for&#xD;
           84 days (12 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
           As both Civamide Cream 0.075% and Placebo Cream can initially produce burning and&#xD;
           stinging in some subjects, blinding to treatment assignment will be maintained. As the&#xD;
           study progresses, the frequency of burning and stinging of both Civamide Cream 0.075%&#xD;
           and Placebo Cream are expected to substantially decrease and be similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigator Blinding: Separate Raters To further maintain the blind, there will be two&#xD;
           separate study staff raters: the Efficacy Rater Physician must be a&#xD;
           physician-investigator who will evaluate efficacy parameters. The Safety Rater Physician&#xD;
           must also be a physician-investigator who will evaluate safety parameters. A&#xD;
           physician-investigator is defined as a physician who is listed as Principal Investigator&#xD;
           or Sub-Investigator on Form FDA 1572. Each may assign a designee (another appropriately&#xD;
           trained study staff member) to perform study procedures (as defined in Section 8.0 or&#xD;
           Appendix E, for the Study Staff Responsibility Chart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      See Study Flow Chart and Schedule of Observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Period (Day -3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures will be conducted: Obtain informed consent; assess eligibility&#xD;
      according to selection criteria; collect demographic data, medical history, osteoarthritis&#xD;
      history and diagnosis, and prior and current medications information. Perform physical&#xD;
      examination and obtain vital signs and laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology &amp; urinalysis).&#xD;
      Female subjects of child-bearing potential will be given a urine pregnancy test. The subject&#xD;
      will complete the Screening Pain Scale for both knees. Either Rater Physician will determine&#xD;
      the subject's Functional Capacity Classification. If the subject is eligible, (i.e.,&#xD;
      Screening Pain Subscale score of ≥ 9 in one knee, subject does not have regular, significant&#xD;
      pain due to OA or other conditions in the other knee, and has a Functional Capacity&#xD;
      Classification score of I-III) the Efficacy Rater Physician or Safety Rater Physician will&#xD;
      identify the knee joint with the most severe symptoms of OA as the &quot;Target Knee&quot;. The subject&#xD;
      must have an x-ray or radiographic report available within the last 3 years in order to meet&#xD;
      the Selection Criteria. If the subject has no prior x-ray or radiographic report an x-ray of&#xD;
      the Target Knee will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline/Randomization Period (Day 1) Either Rater Physician will review laboratory test and&#xD;
      x-ray results of the Target Knee prior to randomization and confirm subject's continued&#xD;
      eligibility including compliance with stability of the oral NSAIDs/COX-2 medications prior to&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete another Screening Pain Scale to confirm that the Target Knee score is&#xD;
      &gt; 9. If eligible, the subject will be randomized into the Double-Blind Treatment Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Screening Pain Scale score is less than 9, the subject may return within 14 days of&#xD;
      the first clinic visit (Visit 1/Day -3) to repeat it. If eligible at that time, the scheduled&#xD;
      Baseline procedures will be performed and completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will complete the WOMAC OA Index, the Subject's Global Evaluation, and the&#xD;
      SF-36® Health Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will apply their first dose of study drug in the clinic. They will be sent home with&#xD;
      diaries to complete everyday, and with study drug that will be applied only on the Target&#xD;
      Knee three times daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period (Days 1-84):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will complete the WOMAC OA Index and Subject's Global Evaluation at clinic visits&#xD;
      on Days 1, 21, 42, 63 and 84 (not Day 3). Concurrent medications, adverse events, and study&#xD;
      drug compliance will be reviewed and recorded by the Safety Rater Physician or designee&#xD;
      throughout the Treatment Period at clinic visits on Days 3, 21, 42, 63 and 84&#xD;
      (End-of-Study/Final Visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also on Day 84 (End-of-Study/Final Visit), the subject will complete the SF-36® Health&#xD;
      Survey, the Efficacy Rater Physician will determine the Functional Capacity Classification,&#xD;
      the Safety Rater Physician or designee will complete a final set of vital signs and collect&#xD;
      laboratory samples. The Safety Rater Physician will perform a complete physical examination&#xD;
      on each subject and will review laboratory results when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Rater Physician or designee will contact the subject by phone on Days 15, 36, 57 and&#xD;
      78 to assess subject compliance with study drug application, maintenance of concurrent&#xD;
      medications, including stable dose of NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors, review adverse events&#xD;
      experienced, determine if subject has enough study drug to last until the next visit, and&#xD;
      remind the subject of the next scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 84 (End-of-Study/Final Visit) the subject will be discharged after all procedures have&#xD;
      been completed.&#xD;
