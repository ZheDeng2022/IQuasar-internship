      The primary hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the introduction of a Promotora to&#xD;
      provide education and proactive follow-up to women with GDM will increase compliance with&#xD;
      postpartum glucose tolerance testing. The secondary hypothesis is that the Promotora will&#xD;
      improve participation in referral visits for diabetes or preventive care. We will develop the&#xD;
      promotora program and begin pilot implementation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center (LAC+USC) serves an&#xD;
      indigent Latino population at increased risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM),&#xD;
      Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) complicated 13% of deliveries at LAC+USC between&#xD;
      2006-2007. While over 50% of GDM patients will develop overt diabetes mellitus within a&#xD;
      decade of the incident pregnancy, less than half of these patients ever return for even one&#xD;
      post-partum follow up visit at this institution (45%). Lifestyle Interventions and&#xD;
      medications have been shown to delay or prevent the onset of T2DM. However, prevention is&#xD;
      only possible if patients follow-up and individual risk assessment is made. While identifying&#xD;
      the 2-hour glucose tolerance test as the appropriate postpartum screening technique for&#xD;
      patients with a history of GDM, the Fifth International Workshop-Conference on Gestational&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus did not identify strategies to improve follow up among this patient&#xD;
      population. Promotoras (bi-lingual, bi-cultural lay community health workers representative&#xD;
      of the Latino community base) have been successful in improving follow up for other areas of&#xD;
      diabetes and women's preventive services but have not been studies in the context of GDM. We&#xD;
      will develop the Es Mejor Saber training materials and program and pilot a randomized control&#xD;
      trial (RCT),a total 216 subjects completing a GDM affected pregnancy will be randomized on&#xD;
      the postpartum ward to the standard-of-care versus proactive follow-up with a Promotora. The&#xD;
      Promotora will provide education, address barriers to follow-up, remind subjects of their&#xD;
      appointments, and call them to reschedule if they miss appointments. In the first phase of&#xD;
      the study, these appointments will include the OGTT and the initial postpartum visit. In the&#xD;
      second phase, these visits will include referrals to internal medicine (for those diagnosed&#xD;
      with T2DM) or nutrition counseling (for those found not to have diabetes). The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis underlying this proposal is that the introduction of a Promotora providing&#xD;
      education and pro-active follow-up into postpartum GDM management will result improve&#xD;
      post-partum follow-up for screening, treatment, and preventive services when compared with&#xD;
      the standard of care.&#xD;

        pregnancy but refuse participation or do not qualify based on the following: elevated&#xD;
