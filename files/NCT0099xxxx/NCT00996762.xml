    <textblock>
      This study will assess alternative formulations of lapatinib for relative bioavailability and&#xD;
      bioequivalence (BE) with the current commercial formulation (reference). Subjects will be&#xD;
      dosed for at least one week (7 days) on each formulation and PK samples will be collected&#xD;
      after each lapatinib formulation dosing Period on Period 1 Day 7 and Period 2 Day7 at&#xD;
      pre-dose and up to 24 hrs post dose. The study may evaluate up to three alternative test&#xD;
      formulations. After subjects complete the PK evaluation at the End of Study Visit, if they&#xD;
      are eligible, they will have the option to enter EGF111767, an open-label, Phase Ib&#xD;
      continuation study of lapatinib monotherapy or lapatinib in combination with other&#xD;
      anti-cancer treatments.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of: Metastatic breast cancer that&#xD;

             advanced, or metastatic solid tumor malignancy (including breast cancer that does not&#xD;
             over-express ErbB2) that is refractory to standard therapies, for which there is no&#xD;
             approved therapy, or for which lapatinib in combination with one of the permitted&#xD;
             anti-cancer regimens specified in the continuation study EGF111767 may provide&#xD;
             clinical benefit.&#xD;
