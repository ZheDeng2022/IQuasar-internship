  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and best dose of a regimen&#xD;
      including bevacizumab and erlotinib in combination with docetaxel and prednisone. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators wish to evaluate how well these drugs might work against this&#xD;
      disease. Bevacizumab and erlotinib are novel drugs that attack the blood vessels supplying&#xD;
      the tumor cells and attack a receptor on the tumor cells, respectively. This study has two&#xD;
      parts. In the first part of the study, eighteen patients will be enrolled. Patients will&#xD;
      receive escalating doses of docetaxel in combination with standard doses of bevacizumab and&#xD;
      erlotinib until the safest dose is determined. An additional 37 patients will enter into the&#xD;
      second part of the study and all will receive the safest dose. In this part of the study, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this regimen against hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) will be&#xD;
      monitored by evaluating prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and objective response of the tumor.&#xD;

      In this Phase I/Phase II study, the primary objectives are to establish the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of docetaxel, erlotinib, bevacizumab, and prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone&#xD;
      refractory prostate cancer and to determine the efficacy of this regimen for treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic HRPC. In the phase I portion of the study, eligible patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      treated using a &quot;3+3&quot; design. Docetaxel will be started at 55 mg/m2 every cycle (21 days) and&#xD;
      dose escalated by 10 mg/m2 at each cohort level. The dose of bevacizumab will be held&#xD;
      constant at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks and erlotinib will be provided at 200 mg PO daily from&#xD;
      days 216 as described in previous safety studies. All patients will receive prednisone 5 mg&#xD;
      PO bid. Eighteen patients will be treated in the phase I portion. The phase II dose for this&#xD;
      combined treatment will be defined as either the highest dosage cohort in which 6 patients&#xD;
      are treated and there are less than 3 dose limiting toxicities (DLTs); or the combination of&#xD;
      docetaxel, erlotinib, and bevacizumab at the cohort 3 dose level, whichever is the lower&#xD;
      dose. Another 37 patients will be enrolled for the phase II study. All patients will receive&#xD;
      the phase II recommended dose as determined by the phase I portion of the study.&#xD;
