      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases is conducting&#xD;
           research investigating how the swine flu (H1N1) vaccine affects the immune system. The&#xD;
           exposure to the new swine flu vaccine gives us a rare opportunity to learn about how the&#xD;
           human immune system responds to a new vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in collecting blood samples from individuals who have&#xD;
           received the vaccine. Participants will be selected from a group of healthy volunteers&#xD;
           who will be receiving the H1N1 vaccine because it is mandatory for their work at the&#xD;
           National Institutes of Health. This protocol will be one of the first studies to&#xD;
           characterize the human innate immune response to H1N1 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect blood samples for research purposes before and after participants receive a&#xD;
      standard non-research vaccination against swine flu (H1N1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals 18 years of age and older who are employees of the National&#xD;
           Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have had confirmed cases of influenza in the past year are not eligible&#xD;
           to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be admitted for a 36-hour inpatient stay, during which blood samples&#xD;
           will be taken frequently. Participants will have a standard intravenous catheter&#xD;
           (similar to the one used for intravenous infusions) put in place to avoid multiple&#xD;
           needle sticks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be assigned into one of two groups; the two groups differ in the&#xD;
           timing of blood draws but not in the overall amount of blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Blood samples 30 minutes before and immediately before vaccination. Additional&#xD;
           samples will be taken 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 24, 30, and 36 hours after&#xD;
           vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Blood samples 30 minutes before and immediately before vaccination. Additional&#xD;
           samples will be taken over the following 36 hours, with exact timing to be determined&#xD;
           based on the findings from group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will provide blood samples 7 days after being released from the&#xD;
           inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Because of the amount of blood being drawn for research, participants should not donate&#xD;
           blood or take part in any other protocols that collect blood while participating in this&#xD;
           study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal influenza is a major health problem whose impact is typically reduced by&#xD;
      vaccination. The H1N1 (swine flu) influenza virus is an emerging pathogen which has the&#xD;
      potential to cause devastating morbidity and mortality in the coming months. In June 2009,&#xD;
      the World Health Organization declared the H1N1 outbreak to be a global pandemic. At present&#xD;
      there are limited data on the early non-specific (innate) immune responses in adult&#xD;
      recipients of the H1N1 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the Center for Human Immunology, Autoimmunity, and Inflammatory Diseases proposes&#xD;
      this protocol designed to investigate the early innate immune response. Healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects (NIH employees) will be admitted as inpatients to receive the FDA-licensed H1N1&#xD;
      vaccine followed by serial blood draws. These samples will be used to perform comprehensive&#xD;
      and detailed analyses of the innate immune system s response to vaccination. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, this protocol will be the first study to characterize the human innate immune&#xD;
      response to H1N1 vaccine. This information may be useful in designing newer, more effective&#xD;
      vaccines to prevent the spread of H1N1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to collect blood to be used strictly for laboratory studies designed&#xD;
      to characterize the innate immune response to H1N1 vaccine. Samples will be collected from&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers (NIH employees) at baseline and serially during the first 36 hours&#xD;
      after vaccination with the H1N1 vaccine.&#xD;
