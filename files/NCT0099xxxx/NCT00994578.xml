  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to improve communication between patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer and their oncologists. A web-based communication intervention will be delivered to&#xD;
      patients to help them to express their negative emotions and elicit empathic responses from&#xD;
      their oncologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Develop a web-based intervention that trains patients with advanced cancer to express&#xD;
      their emotional concerns to their oncologists and to request emotional support during&#xD;
      clinical encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Test whether this intervention can increase patient expression of emotional concerns&#xD;
      and requests for emotional support, as well as improve patient affect by decreasing negative&#xD;
      emotions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited from the practices of participating oncologists; therefore,&#xD;
      physicians will be enrolled prior to their patients. All medical, surgical and radiation&#xD;
      oncology faculty and hematology/oncology fellows who see patients in the participating&#xD;
      clinics will be eligible for the study. We will also enroll the mid-level providers (i.e.,&#xD;
      physician assistants and nurse practitioners) who work with many of these oncologists and any&#xD;
      third party who comes to clinic with the enrolled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biweekly, we will present participating physicians with a list of potentially eligible&#xD;
      patients (those with advanced disease) and ask them to identify those who should not be&#xD;
      approached about study participation. Reasons to not approach include dementia or&#xD;
      inappropriate disease staging. Identified patients will receive a letter from their treating&#xD;
      oncologist inviting them to participate in the study about oncologist-patient communication.&#xD;
      Patients who do not wish to be contacted about the study may call a toll-free number to opt&#xD;
      out. If patients do not respond, a research assistant will contact them by telephone several&#xD;
      days prior to their clinic visit, explain the study in detail, and obtain verbal consent to&#xD;
      conduct a phone screener and baseline interview. It is necessary to conduct the screener and&#xD;
      baseline survey prior to obtaining written consent so that staff may determine eligibility&#xD;
      and then initiate study procedures at the upcoming clinic visit, if appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline survey includes demographic information and several brief scales. Included in&#xD;
      these is the Impact of Events Scale (IES) to determine level of distress, as the COPE study&#xD;
      is interested in the subset of patients who are experiencing emotional difficulty with their&#xD;
      cancer and may be amenable to support in this domain from their provider. The IES is scored&#xD;
      from 0-44, with anything over 8 signifying at least mild levels of distress. Patients who&#xD;
      score 10 or below will be excluded from the study. After completing the survey measures,&#xD;
      arrangements will be made to meet patients in the clinic before their upcoming visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research assistant will meet the patients in clinic, immediately prior to their next&#xD;
      visit, and obtain written informed consent. After engaging in the informed consent process,&#xD;
      the research assistant will place the audio recorder in the exam room, turn it on before the&#xD;
      oncologist enters the room, exit the room, and then turn off the recorder at the end of the&#xD;
      visit. S/he will not be present in the exam room during the visit. Subjects will complete a&#xD;
      survey immediately after the visit to assess affect and quality of communication. Immediately&#xD;
      after the visit, physicians will complete a very brief questionnaire to assess their&#xD;
      perception of the subjects' distress and whether s/he talked about their distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once research assistants determine that participating patients have an appointment with the&#xD;
      same oncologist within 3 months, they will randomly assign subjects to one of four study arms&#xD;
      (Control, CHESS, COPE, or CHESS+COPE), stratified by site and gender. Research assistants,&#xD;
      equipped with laptop computers, will then introduce subjects to the intervention. For&#xD;
      subjects in the Control arm, research assistants will use the intervention portal to review&#xD;
      general Internet search tools (e.g., google). For subjects in the three intervention arms,&#xD;
      research assistants will demonstrate the appropriately modified intervention website and&#xD;
      ensure subjects' abilities to use it. Subjects will be provided written materials on the use&#xD;
      of the website, and instructions will also be sent shortly afterward by email. The research&#xD;
      assistant will call subjects within 7-14 days by phone and administer a 1-week follow-up&#xD;
      survey to assess affect. This process will be repeated until staff record up to three clinic&#xD;
      visits with the patient subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff will email and call patient subjects between clinic visits to remind them how to access&#xD;
      the intervention website and answer technical questions. Also, research assistants will&#xD;
      remind participants that a member of the study team will meet with them at their upcoming&#xD;
      oncology appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last post-visit call with patient subjects, staff will re-administer the IES. Once&#xD;
      patients complete 3 audio-recorded visits, post-visits, and one-week follow-up interviews,&#xD;
      study participation will be complete.&#xD;
