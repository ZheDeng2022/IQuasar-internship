      The primary aim of the study is to determine if non-surgical periodontal therapy (scaling and&#xD;
      root planing and supportive periodontal therapy) is efficacious compared to delayed therapy&#xD;
      in reducing elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 6 months post-randomization in&#xD;
      subjects with type 2 diabetes and untreated, moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate whether 6 month (or shorter-term (3 month)) changes in clinical measures of&#xD;
           chronic periodontitis (gingival index, bleeding on probing, probing depth, clinical&#xD;
           attachment level) are related to changes in HbA1c and fasting glucose or insulin&#xD;
           resistance as measured by the Homeostasis Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess the 3 month and 6 month efficacy of periodontal therapy on all of the above study&#xD;
           outcomes. If a treatment response is observed for any of the study outcomes at 3 months,&#xD;
           then the trial can evaluate whether this response is sustained at 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, controlled, single-masked, Phase III trial to&#xD;
      determine if non-surgical periodontal therapy (scaling and root planing) is efficacious in&#xD;
      reducing elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at 6 months post-randomization in subjects&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes and untreated, moderate to advanced chronic periodontitis. Six hundred&#xD;
      adults with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis will be randomized at&#xD;
      three Clinical Sites; University of Alabama at Birmingham; the University of Minnesota,&#xD;
      Minneapolis; and the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio. The Core&#xD;
      Laboratory will be located at the University of Minnesota and the Study Chair's Office and&#xD;
      Coordinating Center will be located at Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, New York.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to receive either initial non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy with chlorhexidine rinse (treatment subjects) or delayed non-surgical&#xD;
      periodontal therapy (control subjects). Control subjects will be offered delayed periodontal&#xD;
      therapy (scaling and root planing) following the 6 month visit. Participants meeting all&#xD;
      other eligibility criteria and needing essential dental care, i.e., for broken, grossly&#xD;
      carious or abscessed teeth, may enroll only following completion of necessary dental&#xD;
      treatment. Participants in both study arms will receive oral hygiene instruction and healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle information (e.g. diet, exercise) at baseline and at the 3 and 6 month visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal data will be recorded by trained and calibrated examiners at baseline and 3 and 6&#xD;
      months following randomization. Fasting blood will collected at baseline and at 3 and 6&#xD;
      months to measure intermediate links in the putative causal chain between periodontitis and&#xD;
      glycemic control. The periodontal health of all subjects will be monitored, and any subject&#xD;
      who experiences progressive periodontitis during the study will be provided with non-surgical&#xD;
      rescue therapy.&#xD;
