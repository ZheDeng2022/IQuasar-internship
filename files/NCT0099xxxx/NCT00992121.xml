      This study will determine whether blood tests, tumour imaging and tumour tissue analysis can&#xD;
      reveal effects of drugs that block blood vessel growth (angiogenesis) in patients with renal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      This single-centre, two-part, open-label study is designed to evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      effects of bevacizumab and pazopanib in subjects with renal cancer who experience disease&#xD;
      progression following at least one prior therapy of documented clinical benefit. In Part I,&#xD;
      subjects will receive 3 infusions of 10 mg/kg bevacizumab, administered at 2-week intervals.&#xD;
      The PD response to bevacizumab will be evaluated over 6 weeks using imaging techniques&#xD;
      (magnetic resonance imaging; computed tomography [CT]; and positron emission tomography),&#xD;
      intratumoural VEGF signaling by immunohistochemisty, plasma and serum biomarkers, and&#xD;
      circulating tumour cells. Subjects may continue into Part II if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator, the subject would derive continued clinical benefit from anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      therapy. In Part II, each subject will receive sequentially escalating doses of oral&#xD;
      pazopanib in 3-week cycles as follows: 1) 200 mg twice weekly, 2) 200 mg every other day, 3)&#xD;
      200 mg daily, 4) 400 mg daily, 5) 800 mg daily, and 6) 1200 mg daily. Subjects entering Part&#xD;
      II will be randomised to receive treatment either throughout each 3-week cycle (Group 1) or&#xD;
      for the first 2 weeks of each cycle only, followed by a 1 week treatment holiday (Group 2).&#xD;
      After completion of Part II dose escalation subjects will receive continuous pazopanib at a&#xD;
      dose of 800 mg daily in repeating 3-week cycles. These subjects will receive pazopanib until&#xD;
      loss of clinical benefit, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from the study for&#xD;
      other reasons.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically (any histological subtype) or cytologically confirmed unresectable RCC&#xD;
             with a clear cell component.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experienced documented evidence of radiological progression based on Response&#xD;
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] while on first line (or greater) RCC&#xD;
             therapy and within 6 months prior to the first dose of study medication (bevacizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of unidimensionally measurable disease (i.e., at least 1 malignant tumour&#xD;
             mass that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension with the longest diameter&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 20 mm with conventional CT or MRI or V10 mm with spiral CT&#xD;
             scan [if spiral CT scan is used, minimum lesion size should be twice the&#xD;
             reconstruction interval used, e.g., if reconstruction size is 7 mm, lesion size should&#xD;
             be greater than or equal to 14 mm]) Note: Subject should be excluded if all baseline&#xD;
             measurable lesions are within previously irradiated areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Free of any malignant disease other than RCC for at least 5 years prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study medication (bevacizumab) in this study, with the exception of the&#xD;
             following: Cervical carcinoma in situ, Melanoma in situ, Basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resolution of all acute toxic effects of prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgical&#xD;
             procedures to NCI CTCAE Grade 1 or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate organ function as defined by laboratory ranges Note: Laboratory values just&#xD;
             outside of these ranges may be included if in the view of the investigator and medical&#xD;
             monitor, these findings will not interfere with the study or pose an unacceptable risk&#xD;
             to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving written informed consent, and willing and able to comply with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Males and females greater than or equal to 18 years of age at screening. A female&#xD;
             subject is eligible to participate if she is of non-childbearing potential (see below)&#xD;
             or if she is of childbearing potential and agrees to use one of the defined&#xD;
             contraception methods from the time of first dose of study medication (bevacizumab)&#xD;
             until 4 months after the last dose of study medication (bevacizumab or pazopanib).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented bilateral&#xD;
        tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal females with 12&#xD;
        months of spontaneous amenorrhea. If the exact duration of amenorrhea is unknown, a blood&#xD;
        sample with simultaneous follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) greater than or equal to 40&#xD;
        MIU/mL and estradiol less than or equal to 40 pg/mL (less than or equal to 140 pmol/L) will&#xD;
        be required as confirmation. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
        menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the approved contraception&#xD;
        methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
        discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
        For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and&#xD;
        the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation&#xD;
        of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of&#xD;
        a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A male subject is eligible to participate if he agrees to use one of the contraception&#xD;
        methods listed in from the time of first dose of study medication (bevacizumab) until 4&#xD;
        months after the last dose of study medication (bevacizumab or pazopanib).&#xD;

             benefit from anti-angiogenic therapy.&#xD;

             molecular weight heparin for the duration of this study if, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, doing so does not present an undue safety risk to the patient.&#xD;
