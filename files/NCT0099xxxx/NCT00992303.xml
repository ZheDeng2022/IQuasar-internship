      RATIONALE: Collecting and storing samples of tissue from patients with cancer to test in the&#xD;
      laboratory may help the study of cancer in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is collecting tissue samples from patients with cancer&#xD;
      undergoing radiation therapy. Healthy participants will also be allowed on the trial so their&#xD;
      samples can be used in comparison to patients with malignancy&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To maintain and create a University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW)&#xD;
           Radiation Oncology Tissue Resource and Registry/Database that will be used to explore&#xD;
           genetic variations contributing to clinical outcomes through tissue analysis and outcome&#xD;
           correlation. Tissue will be stored by the UTSTR and the database managed by Radiation&#xD;
           Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document disease outcome (local recurrence, distant metastasis, overall survival) by&#xD;
           treatment regimen and disease site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document toxicity by treatment regimen and disease site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a prospective registry/database consisting of patient demographics and&#xD;
           outcomes to be used for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Tissue, including surgical waste, venous blood/serum, urine, bone marrow, and other&#xD;
      body fluids, may be collected (at planned surgery and routine medical visits) and preserved&#xD;
      for future research. Demographic and disease and treatment information is obtained from&#xD;
      patients (by interview or questionnaire), from medical records, and from national datasets.&#xD;
      Patients may also be asked to provide additional blood samples and/or a small skin-punch&#xD;
      biopsy sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are followed up every 6 months for the first two years following treatment and then&#xD;
      yearly thereafter.&#xD;
