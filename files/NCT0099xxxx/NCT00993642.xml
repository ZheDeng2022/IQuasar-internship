  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term objective of this research is to understand the molecular mechanisms of&#xD;
      acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer. Identifying these mechanisms is critical to&#xD;
      the implementation of novel therapeutic strategies that can target and overcome altered gene&#xD;
      networks involved in controlling breast cancer progression. While patients with tumors over&#xD;
      expressing HER1, 2, or 3 have been shown to have reduced survival, patients with those tumors&#xD;
      which overexpressed HER4 (erbB4) had increased survival (Witton 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-randomized, single-arm, proof of principle trial. Selected are patients with&#xD;
      advanced-stage breast cancer whose tumors are ER+, tamoxifen refractory. Histologically&#xD;
      proven diagnosis of recurrent or metastatic breast cancer is advanced cancer for which there&#xD;
      is no treatment available which would have a reasonable chance of cure. Treatment failure is&#xD;
      defined as tumor progression after chemotherapy and tamoxifen therapy. Patients will be given&#xD;
      five 30mg doses of HDAC inhibitor (LBH) over a period of two weeks. A dose will be taken on&#xD;
      Days 1,3,5,8 and 10. Patients will have a diagnostic tumor biopsy prior to drug&#xD;
      administration and a diagnostic biopsy within 48 hours (2 days) of the last dose. Primary&#xD;
      endpoints are measured by biopsy of palpable tumor with immunohistochemical staining for&#xD;
      ERBB4. Secondary end points include the evaluation of cell death, apoptosis, with&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining for DNA breaks by TUNEL assay.&#xD;
