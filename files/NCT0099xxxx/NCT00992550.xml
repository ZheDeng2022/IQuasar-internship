    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare exposure to tobacco smoke toxins in individuals who smoke&#xD;
      both cigarettes and Hookah pipes. Sixteen subjects will be hospitalized on the research ward&#xD;
      for two visits of 4 days each. At one visit they will smoke their usual cigarettes in&#xD;
      approximately normal frequency, and at the other visit they will smoke Hookah at least twice&#xD;
      per day. The order of the visits will be randomized. On the fourth day of each visit (when&#xD;
      nicotine, carbon monoxide (CO), and some carcinogen levels will be in a steady state&#xD;
      condition), circadian blood and urine and expired air samples will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Water pipes have been used to smoke various substances for at least four centuries,&#xD;
      particularly in certain Asian countries, the Middle East, and Northern Africa. It is&#xD;
      estimated that about 100 million people worldwide smoke tobacco in water pipes, which are&#xD;
      also known as hookahs (Indian subcontinent and Africa), shisha, borry, goza (Egypt, Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia), narghile, argilhe (Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, and Israel), shui yan dai (China), or&#xD;
      hubble-bubble.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Water pipes consist of a head (to hold tobacco) which is connected to a body, which in turn&#xD;
      is connected to a bowl containing water. A tobacco preparation is placed in the head, and&#xD;
      burning charcoal is placed on top of the tobacco, often separated by perforated aluminum&#xD;
      foil. The smoker inhales through the mouthpiece, which draws air over the burning charcoal&#xD;
      and through the tobacco, creating an aerosol consisting of volatilized and pyrolized tobacco&#xD;
      components. The smoke passes through the water in the bowl, cooling the smoke, before being&#xD;
      carried through the hose to the smoker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hookah tobacco is different from ordinary tobacco in that it is a moist paste-like&#xD;
      preparation made from about 30% crude, cut tobacco that is fermented with honey, molasses,&#xD;
      and pulp of different fruits to add flavor. Consequently, differences in composition of the&#xD;
      products smoked and different temperatures involved in the smoking process result in&#xD;
      substantial difference in the composition of hookah smoke compared to cigarette smoke. Hookah&#xD;
      smoke is produced at about 450° C compared to about 900° C for cigarettes. In addition,&#xD;
      hookah smoke contains charcoal combustion products, which includes substantial amounts of&#xD;
      carbon monoxide (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one study, Shihadeh and Saleh found that hookah tobacco produced substantially more tar&#xD;
      (100-fold), nicotine (4-fold), carbon monoxide (11-fold), and polycyclic aromatic&#xD;
      hydrocarbons (PAHs, 2 to 5-fold) than did comparable amounts of cigarette tobacco. Shafagoj&#xD;
      et al compared expired CO and plasma nicotine in cigarette and hookah smokers, and found that&#xD;
      the hookah smokers had about 2-fold higher carbon monoxide levels and about 3-fold higher&#xD;
      nicotine levels than cigarette smokers. The high delivery of nicotine is unexpected in light&#xD;
      of its high water solubility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, smoking tobacco in water pipes has gained popularity in the US, particularly in&#xD;
      areas with sizable Arab-American populations, and also among young non-Arab-Americanpeople,&#xD;
      with a number of hookah bars being located near college campuses. A typical session at a&#xD;
      hookah bar involves smoking for 45-60 minutes, often with a group of friends (1). In&#xD;
      addition, hookahs, hookah tobacco, and accessories are advertised over the Internet. Most&#xD;
      users of hookah tobacco believe that it is not addictive, and less harmful than cigarette&#xD;
      smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of published studies indicating high nicotine and carbon monoxide exposures in&#xD;
      hookah smokers, the lack of data on exposure to other toxic substances, and global increases&#xD;
      in the prevalence of hookah tobacco use, it is apparent that further research is needed. In&#xD;
      the August, 2005 newsletter, Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program (TRDRP) invited&#xD;
      research grant applications on all aspects of hookah smoke.&#xD;
