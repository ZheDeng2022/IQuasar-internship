    <textblock>
      In Canada, Addiction Prevention and Treatment Service's (APTS) offer programs specifically&#xD;
      designed to help people withdrawal from psychoactive drugs. While participants of withdrawal&#xD;
      management (Detox) programs generally reach their goals, the process is a difficult one often&#xD;
      exacting an emotional and physical toll. Troublesome symptoms of withdrawal from psychoactive&#xD;
      drugs may include anxiety and sleep disturbances. If untreated these symptoms can lead to&#xD;
      discontinuation of withdrawal and /or affect the introduction of cognitive-behavioral and or&#xD;
      motivational therapy components of Detox programs. In Detox the symptoms of withdraw are&#xD;
      managed pharmacologically. Pharmacological tools for managing anxiety and sleep disturbances&#xD;
      exist and while effective and safe, in many clinical settings, have limitations and liability&#xD;
      in the addiction treatment setting. To address these concerns APTS has incorporated&#xD;
      non-pharmacological anxiety management practices into its programs. Prominent among these is&#xD;
      therapeutic massage (chair massage in the Swedish tradition). While therapeutic massage has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce state and trait anxiety in a variety of clinical settings, no previous&#xD;
      study has assessed its anxiolytic or sleep promoting efficacy in an addiction treatment&#xD;
      setting. In keeping with ATPS's policy on evidence-based practice, evidence in support of&#xD;
      this practice is now required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Objectives: We propose to test the Hypothesis: Therapeutic Massage is an effective&#xD;
      therapy for managing withdrawal-related anxiety and for improving sleep effectiveness in&#xD;
      patients withdrawing from psychoactive drugs. Our specific objective is to perform a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine whether therapeutic massage is effective in&#xD;
      comparison to relaxation control treatment in reducing the levels of state and trait anxiety&#xD;
      associated with withdrawal and in promoting sleep efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design: A RCT of the effects of therapeutic massage will be conducted on 80 patients&#xD;
      (ages 18-65) attending an APTS Detox program. Patients will be assigned to 1 of 2 treatment&#xD;
      groups (n=40/group) and will receive either: therapeutic massage or relaxation control&#xD;
      treatment once a day for 3 consecutive days. Anxiety, state and trait, will be measured pre&#xD;
      and post each treatment through a standardized tool and physiologic measures (heart rate &amp;&#xD;
      blood pre(state and trait) and sleep efficiency will be determined through actigraphy and&#xD;
      daily sleep logs.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) abuse has become a prominent health issue in Canada.&#xD;
      According to a recent drug abuse survey, it can be estimated that approximately 2 million&#xD;
      Canadians may meet the diagnostic criteria for being dependent upon or having abused AOD. At&#xD;
      almost $40 billion/year, the costs of AOD abuse in Canada are substantial. Substance abuse&#xD;
      represents a significant drain (both direct and indirect) on Canada's economy, with the&#xD;
      largest single direct cost being associated with health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact on the citizens of Nova Scotia is equally dramatic, as illustrated by the 10,949&#xD;
      individuals who accessed Addiction Services in this province during the 2005 calendar year.&#xD;
      3,252 of these individuals (29.7%) accessed these services through the Addiction Prevention&#xD;
      and Treatment Services (APTS), Capital Health. Capital Health exists within the largest&#xD;
      integrated academic health district in the Maritimes and provides core health services to&#xD;
      395,000 residents, or 40% of the population of the Nova Scotia and tertiary and quaternary&#xD;
      acute care services to residents of Atlantic Canada. Specialized adult health services are&#xD;
      provided to a referral population of 550,000 from the rest of the province, as well as to&#xD;
      residents of New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island. Of the 3,252 individuals who accessed&#xD;
      APTS, Capital Health in 2005, 2020 were male (62.12%) and 1,232 were female (37.88%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AOD abuse affects people from all walks of life and one prevention and treatment approach&#xD;
      cannot be sufficient for all possible forms of abuse. The harms associated with AOD abuse&#xD;
      have a significant and detrimental effect on the determinants of health which poses a&#xD;
      considerable threat to the social, emotional, physical, and economic well being of Canadian&#xD;
      families and communities. Determinants of health are factors impacting on living and working&#xD;
      conditions conducive to health in its broadest sense, and include housing, education,&#xD;
      genetics, income, employment, culture, physical environment, equity, gender and race.&#xD;
      Canada's Drug Strategy (CDS), which was renewed in May 2003, is the federal government's&#xD;
      response to addressing the problems associated with the harmful use of AOD, and comprises a&#xD;
      series of evidence-based guidelines. Using a comprehensive four-pillar approach, CDS strives&#xD;
      to assist individuals, families and communities impacted by substance abuse through&#xD;
      education, prevention, harm reduction and enforcement initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APTS is committed to Canada's Drug Strategy and strives to help individuals, families, and&#xD;
      communities of Nova Scotia deal with the harm associated with abuses of AOD. It accomplishes&#xD;
      this through a comprehensive range of prevention, intervention and treatment services&#xD;
      designed to promote, maintain, and improve health. Included among the services offered by&#xD;
      APTS are programs designed to assist in: addiction recovery; withdrawal and management&#xD;
      (Detox); tobacco cessation and prevention; substance abuse prevention and community&#xD;
      education; women's services; methadone maintenance treatment; and community support groups&#xD;
      for gamblers&#xD;
      (http://www.cdha.nshealth.ca/programsandservices/addictionprevention/index.html).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Withdrawal and Management (Detox) program was established at APTS in 1975 and provides&#xD;
      care and treatment to approximately 800 individuals each year. This inpatient program&#xD;
      consists of detoxification, assessment and education and employs a biopsychosocial approach&#xD;
      to treat and empower individuals experiencing the physical/emotional stressors associated&#xD;
      with AOD withdrawal. It operates through a supportive community atmosphere that nurtures the&#xD;
      difficult process of change. The length of stay in the Detox program depends upon individual&#xD;
      assessment, with an average stay of 5 days during which residents participate, under the&#xD;
      guidance of nursing staff, in a series of recovery, support and relapse-prevention groups. It&#xD;
      is delivered by a staff of 23 full time employees. Detox is available to all individuals&#xD;
      residing within the Capital Health district with 15 in-patient beds dedicated to this&#xD;
      program. The Detox program integrates a variety of evidence-based pharmacological and&#xD;
      biopsychosocial approaches including, but not limited to, behavioral therapy (Wanberg &amp;&#xD;
      Milkman, 2002), structured relapse prevention and motivational interviewing (Burke et al.,&#xD;
      2003). The participants of the Detox program generally reach their immediate goals, although&#xD;
      the process of recovery itself is a difficult one, often exacting an emotional and physical&#xD;
      toll. Among the many common and troublesome side effects of the withdrawal process are the&#xD;
      development of acute anxiety, sleep disturbances (problems falling asleep or waking&#xD;
      frequently) and slight depression (feeling down) which, if left unmanaged, may detrimentally&#xD;
      influence the recovery process as well as the ability to engage in further addiction&#xD;
      treatment programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for management of the withdrawal symptoms are quite compelling; lack of sleep&#xD;
      exacerbates anxiety and anxiety negatively impacts patient comfort and engagement in working&#xD;
      memory tasks (Eysenck, 1985), social interaction (Strahan &amp; Conger, 1998), and prospective&#xD;
      memory tasks (Harris &amp; Cumming, 2003). Cumulatively, these negative impacts are of concern in&#xD;
      regard to the behavioral therapy attributes of the Detox program. Behavioral therapy is based&#xD;
      on the assertion that undesirable behaviors can be replaced by teaching patients new, more&#xD;
      desirable ones. It focuses on the patient's responsibility for change and is dependent upon&#xD;
      the maintenance of patient comfort and the development of effective, therapeutic&#xD;
      relationships (Wanberg &amp; Milkman, 2002). Unchecked anxiety can, and often does, affect the&#xD;
      development of these effective relationships. Therefore, the participant may not receive the&#xD;
      full benefit of the Detox treatment, potentially leading to decreased overall effectiveness&#xD;
      and an increased risk of relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective pharmacotherapy's are available for the treatment of anxiety and promotion and&#xD;
      maintenance of sleep. Unfortunately, pharmacological therapies are often deemed&#xD;
      inappropriate, insufficient or cost-prohibitive in these patient populations. In addressing&#xD;
      these concerns, APTS uses a holistic approach to the management of anxiety. While biofeedback&#xD;
      techniques and hypnotherapy may be valuable adjuncts for the treatment of anxiety, financial&#xD;
      constraints have limited their use at APTS. APTS has chosen to incorporate therapeutic&#xD;
      massage and auricular acupuncture into its behavioral therapies, practices that both clinical&#xD;
      staff, practitioners and clients report to play an integral role in the success of their&#xD;
      addiction recovery program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chair massage employing Swedish techniques, currently offered to clients at APTS, consists of&#xD;
      continuous systematic strokes including kneading and stretching to loosen and rehabilitate&#xD;
      the soft tissues of the body (muscles, tendons and fascia) and to provide general relaxation.&#xD;
      The manual techniques include, for example, effleurage (smooth gliding movements intended to&#xD;
      evoke the relaxation response), soothing petrissage (lifting, squeezing, wringing, or&#xD;
      kneading of soft tissues to increase circulation and to reduce muscle spasm), repetitive&#xD;
      stroking (a soothing technique used to decrease sympathetic nervous system firing and to&#xD;
      decrease pain perception), rocking (rhythmical side to side motion of a limb or trunk),&#xD;
      squeezing (compression of a muscle) and mild joint mobilization (slight distraction and&#xD;
      stretch of joint capsules and surrounding tissue). Swedish massage is an inexpensive&#xD;
      treatment modality with a low-side effect profile (Ernst, 2003). This treatment has been&#xD;
      studied in the management of alcohol withdrawal (Reader et al. 2005), and a recent meta&#xD;
      analysis of 37 therapeutic massage studies identified significant reductions in anxiety,&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate post massage (Moyer et al., 2004). Clinical opinion suggests&#xD;
      that the most profound benefits accrue to those most in need, e.g. individuals experiencing&#xD;
      physical or emotional stressors (Rattray &amp; Ludwig, 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE For the vast majority of clinical disciplines, the delivery of therapy is defined&#xD;
      by a series of highly structured treatment regimes. In contrast, the delivery of care for the&#xD;
      treatment of addiction is far less structured. This reflects the fact that unlike most other&#xD;
      clinical conditions, the manifestations of addiction are highly variable, both at the level&#xD;
      of patients and communities. As such, the service delivery framework provided by individual&#xD;
      addiction treatment centers possess varying degrees of distinctness, with each centre granted&#xD;
      the freedom to apply combinations of biopsychosocial approaches that they believe best suits&#xD;
      their specific patient population. Health Canada now recommends the application of&#xD;
      evidence-based decision making principles in all areas of research and clinical practice. The&#xD;
      implementation of evidence-based principles has lead clinicians and researchers alike to&#xD;
      identify a variety of challenges in addiction treatment programs in Canada. Included among&#xD;
      these is an absence of defined behavioral outcomes or evidence of efficacy for many of the&#xD;
      programs offered. Even more surprising is the realization that some long entrenched therapies&#xD;
      have never been empirically verified for their general efficacy or the subpopulations which&#xD;
      they might best serve (e.g. alcohol, drugs, gambling and/or combinations there in). Given the&#xD;
      impact that addiction has on the social and economic fabric of Nova Scotia, many in the&#xD;
      addiction treatment field are now asking the question &quot;How effective is our particular&#xD;
      addiction treatment program and can it be improved?&quot; Today therapeutic massage is used in&#xD;
      addiction treatment programs across North America and Europe and was first initiated as an&#xD;
      outreach program to APTS by the Canadian College of Massage and Hydrotherapy in 2005. Among&#xD;
      experienced clinical professionals, the belief is strong that therapeutic massage plays an&#xD;
      important role in managing the level of anxiety in their patients. However, no peer-reviewed&#xD;
      scientific study has ever been performed to test the efficacy of therapeutic chair massage in&#xD;
      reducing acute anxiety and improving sleep quality in patients participating in an addiction&#xD;
      recovery setting. This is of importance in light of the fact that Health Canada now&#xD;
      recommends the use evidence-based decision making principles in all areas of research and&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATEMENT OF RESEARCH QUESTION One area in need of attention at APTS is our use of&#xD;
      complementary and alternative therapies like therapeutic chair massage and auricular&#xD;
      acupuncture. While numerous studies have illustrated the effectiveness of therapeutic massage&#xD;
      in reducing anxiety (Moyer et al., 2004), no experimental study has been designed to test its&#xD;
      anxiolytic or sleep enhancement effects in an addiction treatment setting. Today we are&#xD;
      challenged with the task of substantiating the efficacy of this apparently important&#xD;
      component of our addiction treatment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this application is test the HYPOTHESIS: Therapeutic massage (chair massage&#xD;
      utilizing Swedish techniques) is an effective therapy for the management of acute&#xD;
      recovery-related anxiety and for promoting sleep onset and improved sleep efficiency in&#xD;
      patients attending the Detox program at APTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our Specific Objective is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) To perform a randomized controlled trial to determine whether therapeutic massage is&#xD;
      effective, compared with relaxation control treatment, in reducing the level of state and&#xD;
      trait recovery-related anxiety and in promoting sleep onset and improved sleep efficiency.&#xD;
