    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) in&#xD;
      controlling diabetes in subjects with mild obesity (BMI 26-35). The primary endpoint will be&#xD;
      the reduction of HbA1c (&lt; 7%), a standard measure of diabetes control; the secondary&#xD;
      endpoints will be changes blood sugar , vitamin levels, insulin, c-peptide, and lipids&#xD;
      levels, as well as retinal eye examinations, urinalysis to assess kidney function, carotid&#xD;
      ultrasound as a marker of cardiovascular function, and alterations in diabetic medications.&#xD;
      Fifty subjects with medically documented type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) with BMIs between 26&#xD;
      and 35 will undergo standard laparoscopic RYGB. Prior and after surgery, the subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a clinical evaluation in regard to the primary and secondary endpoints listed. The&#xD;
      pre-surgery evaluation is directed toward establishing the existence of diabetes related&#xD;
      complications prior to surgery. After surgery subjects will be closely monitored for&#xD;
      complications and required changes in their diabetes management. Repeat assessments will be&#xD;
      made at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and at two years.&#xD;

      The primary endpoint will be the reduction of HbA1c and secondary endpoints will be multiple&#xD;
      associated parameters as listed below. A group of 50 subjects with medically documented T2DM&#xD;
      and BMI of 26-35 will undergo standard laparoscopic RYGB. Prior to surgery, the subjects will&#xD;
      undergo the standard pre-operative work up required for conventional bariatric surgery. This&#xD;
      includes full history and physical exam, medical/cardiac clearances as needed, nutrition&#xD;
      consultation and a gastrointestinal consultation for upper endoscopy. After thorough&#xD;
      explanation an approved informed consent will be signed. Baseline parameters, as listed&#xD;
      below, will be measured for each subject to identify possible complications of diabetes prior&#xD;
      to the surgical intervention..&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery perioperative complications will be monitored and required modifications of&#xD;
      diabetes management advised. Followed up measurements at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months is&#xD;
      consistent with standard clinical practice guidelines. Data analysis will be ongoing to&#xD;
      observe the effects of the surgical intervention on glucose homeostasis.&#xD;

    <description>The operation is performed under general anesthesia. It is done laparoscopically, meaning that several small openings are made in the abdomen for insertion of long, thin surgical instruments, one with an attached camera. The operation is video monitored. The top of the stomach is divided across, leaving a small pouch for food. The rest of the stomach remains but can receive no food. The gut is divided just past the stomach, and it is attached to the small stomach pouch so that food can get back into the bowel. A second connection is made so that the bile and digestive juices pass into the bowel with the food.</description>
