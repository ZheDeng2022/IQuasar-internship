      RATIONALE: Studying the genes expressed in samples of tumor tissue from patients with cancer&#xD;
      may help doctors identify biomarkers related to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This research study is looking at tumor tissue samples from patients with stage I,&#xD;
      stage II, or stage III malignant melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the genetic profile of primary melanomas with and without synchronous regional&#xD;
           nodal involvement by examining for 1) activating mutations B-Raf and N-Ras associated&#xD;
           with melanoma development, and 2) allelic imbalances across the genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the genetic profile of primary melanomas from patients with and without lymph&#xD;
           node involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the combinations of genetic lesions that correlate with nodal metastasis by&#xD;
           adopting a statistical machine learning approach to build a lesion-based classifier for&#xD;
           nodal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Laser capture microdissection is performed on the archived tissue samples to isolate&#xD;
      melanoma cells. DNA is then purified from the samples and amplified using PCR.&#xD;
      Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI)-time of flight mass spectrometry&#xD;
      technology is used to detect mutations of B-Raf and N-Ras. Single nucleotide polymorphism&#xD;
      arrays are also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the patient's demographics (e.g., TNM staging, sex, age, and tissue&#xD;
      collection dates) will be gathered by chart review or from the Multidisciplinary Melanoma&#xD;
      Conference at University Hospitals tumor conference report in order to match cases.&#xD;
