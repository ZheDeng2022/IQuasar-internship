    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about a possible new medicine, apremilast, for treating&#xD;
      acute gout and compare how it works to indomethacin, a medication that has been used to treat&#xD;
      gout for over 50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to learn about apremilast, half the participants in this study will receive&#xD;
      apremilast and half the participants in this study will receive indomethacin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will measure the severity and duration of acute gout attacks in research&#xD;
      participants, as well as measures of quality of life and any side effects or adverse&#xD;
      reactions to the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three study visits: a screening/baseline visit on Day 1, a visit to evaluate&#xD;
      response to treatment with study medication at Day 7, and a follow-up visit at Day 21.&#xD;
