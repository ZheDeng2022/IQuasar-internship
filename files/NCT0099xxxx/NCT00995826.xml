    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and tolerability of an investigational&#xD;
      multi-dose inhaled flu medication, CS-8958. Study participants will include 16 males and&#xD;
      females, aged 18-55 years of age, inclusive. Participants will be divided into two treatment&#xD;
      groups (Groups A and B) with each group consisting of 8 subjects. Participants will be&#xD;
      involved in study related procedures for a maximum of 14 weeks from initial screen to the&#xD;
      follow up visit. 6 subjects in Group A will be administered 40 mg of CS-8958 drug and two&#xD;
      subjects will receive placebo (substance containing no medication), once a week for six&#xD;
      weeks. In Group B six subjects will be administered 40 mg of CS-8958 drug and two subjects&#xD;
      will receive placebo, twice a week for six weeks. Study procedures will include blood and&#xD;
      urine samples, ECGs (measure of heart activity), blood pressure, pulse rate and functional&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin. Also continuous cardiac telemetry will be performed&#xD;
      as well as physical examinations and spirometry assessments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza is an acute febrile illness caused by influenza A and B virus affecting all age&#xD;
      groups.Influenza occurs annually and each year it is estimated that influenza epidemics cause&#xD;
      36,000 deaths and 114,000 hospitalizations in the US alone. Control of human influenza virus&#xD;
      infections continues to be a major public health goal.Influenza infects the respiratory tract&#xD;
      with a rapid onset of symptoms typically characterized by fever, chills, myalgia, headache,&#xD;
      malaise, sore throat and cough. Influenza infections are generally self-limiting; however&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality can occur, predominantly in high risk groups such as the&#xD;
      elderly and those suffering from chronic conditions. It is the objective of this clinical&#xD;
      trial to investigate safety and tolerability of multiple doses of CS-8958 administered via&#xD;
      inhalation in healthy adult subjects. The pharmacokinetics required for this dosing regimen&#xD;
      is only achievable by inhalation delivery. Study participants will include 16 males and&#xD;
      females, aged 18-55 years of age, inclusive. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of 40mg CS-8958 once or twice a week (on consecutive days) for 6 weeks in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects after multiple doses administered via inhalation. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess the systemic exposure of CS-8958 and its active metabolite R-125489&#xD;
      after single and multiple doses of CS-8958 in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be divided into two treatment groups (Groups A and B) with each group&#xD;
      consisting of 8 subjects. Participants will be involved in study related procedures for a&#xD;
      maximum of 14 weeks from initial screen to the follow up visit. 6 subjects in Group A will be&#xD;
      administered 40 mg of CS-8958 drug and two subjects will receive placebo (substance&#xD;
      containing no medication, once a week for six weeks. In Group B six subjects will be&#xD;
      administered 40 mg of CS-8958 drug and two subjects will receive placebo, twice a week for&#xD;
      six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded at every visit. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse&#xD;
      rate and functional oxygen saturation of arterial hemoglobin will be measured on admission,&#xD;
      pre-dose and at multiple time points post each dose. ECGs will be performed on admission,&#xD;
      pre-dose and at multiple time points post each dose.Continuous cardiac telemetry will be&#xD;
      performed for 24 hours post first dose each week for cohort A and 60 hours post first dose&#xD;
      each week for cohort B. Spirometry assessments including forced vital capacity, forced&#xD;
      expiratory volume in 1 second, forced expiratory volume percentage in 1 second, forced&#xD;
      expiratory flow rate, and peak expiratory flow rate will be performed on admission, pre-dose&#xD;
      and at multiple time points post dose. Physical examinations will be performed on Day -1 and&#xD;
      at the final visit (and as needed if subject develops symptomatology). Blood samples for&#xD;
      hematology and biochemistry assessments will be taken on admission, and 24 hours post dose&#xD;
      each week. Urine samples for urinalysis tests will be collected on admission, and 24 hours&#xD;
      post dose each week. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic testing will be taken pre-dose and at&#xD;
      multiple time points post each dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data from Cohort A prior to beginning Cohort B.&#xD;
