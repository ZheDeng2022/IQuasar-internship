  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      bromocriptine for improvement of left ventricular function of women with Peripartum&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy (PPCM). A Multi center trial in Germany.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is a serious life threatening heart disease of unknown&#xD;
      etiology in previously healthy women. Only a minority of patients recovers completely while&#xD;
      the majority of PPCM patients develop persistent ventricular dysfunction and may experience&#xD;
      severe heart failure leading to cardiac transplantation. Thus, these young patients are very&#xD;
      sick at a time when the newborn would need a healthy mother. Many of PPCM patients need&#xD;
      lifelong treatment causing a large financial and social burden. Indeed, a better&#xD;
      understanding of the disease and more efficient therapeutic options are urgently needed. To&#xD;
      date, no specific therapy is available so that patients are treated by medical&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy for heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of PPCM is usually made at advanced stages of the disease in severely symptomatic&#xD;
      women but prognosis of affected women is poor with reported mortality rates of 15% and&#xD;
      recovery in only 23% to 54% of PPCM patients despite optimal medical treatment. Therefore&#xD;
      strategies are urgently needed to identify patients at risk and novel therapeutic approaches&#xD;
      are required to improve poor prognosis of affected women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial would establish a new specific therapeutic regimen for PPCM and the investigators&#xD;
      can expect that such a novel approach would be rapidly adopted in the clinical management of&#xD;
      this disease. Since the trial design follows state-of the-art guidelines, the investigators&#xD;
      assume that bromocriptine would shortly be adopted into clinical guidelines of the German&#xD;
      Cardiac Society, European Cardiac Society, and the American Heart Association.&#xD;

    <description>Patients randomized to the study medication have to take bromocriptine orally for the first 14 days at a dose of 5 mg/day (= 2 tablets, 1 in morning, 1 in the evening). From day 15 to day 56 they will take a dose of 2.5 mg (= 1 tablet) orally in the evening. The duration of the intervention is 8 weeks, thereafter the patients continue to be observed in the follow-up part of the study up to month 6. The study medication is taken on top of standard therapy for heart failure. Part of this therapy are ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are potentially harmful for the baby when getting into the breast milk, as bromocriptine stops milk production, no additional drug is needed.</description>

    <description>The control group will receive standard therapy for heart failure. Part of this therapy are ACE inhibitors. Since ACE inhibitors are potentially harmful for the baby when getting into the breast milk, it is necessary to stop lactation in the control group as well.To stop lactation, application of bromocriptine (2.5mg/day) for up to one week.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects in the first 5 months postpartum with new onset of left ventricular&#xD;
             (LV) dysfunction (LV ejection fraction â‰¤35% as assessed by echocardiography) using the&#xD;
             internationally accepted criteria for PPCM 1: absence of an identifiable cause of&#xD;
             heart failure, absence of recognizable heart disease prior to the last month of&#xD;
             pregnancy and LV systolic dysfunction demonstrated by classical echocardiographic&#xD;
             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age equal or greater 18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent of the patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preexisting cardiac disease (except PPCM which had complete resolution in a previous&#xD;
             pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any preexisting serious conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous cardiac surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to the planned therapy (e. g. hypersensitivity to trial medication or&#xD;
             one of its components)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant therapy other than specified in the trial protocol such as products for&#xD;
