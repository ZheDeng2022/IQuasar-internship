    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to shorten the treatment time course for patients who&#xD;
      are scheduled for surgery to have a sinus lift and dental implant(s) placed into the upper&#xD;
      front part of their mouth, and need to have more bone in their jaws and a thicker sinus floor&#xD;
      to support the implant.&#xD;

      The INFUSE® Bone Graft is a device approved by the FDA to be used instead of using your own&#xD;
      bone (from another site on your body) to replace missing bone in your jaw. INFUSE® Bone Graft&#xD;
      is commercially available and is made up of 2 parts - recombinant human Bone Morphogenetic&#xD;
      Protein-2 (rhBMP 2) placed on an absorbable collagen sponge (ACS). The rhBMP-2 is a&#xD;
      genetically altered protein which recruits bone-forming cells to the surgical area and&#xD;
      changes local cells to bone. ACS is made from Type I collagen from bovine (cattle) tendon. It&#xD;
      helps to hold the rhBMP-2 in place and acts as a support for the growing bone. The sponge&#xD;
      itself will reabsorb in time as the new bone forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to shorten the treatment time course for the patients.&#xD;
      This post-market study has been designed to further evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      INFUSE® Bone Graft, along with dental implant placement and a sinus lift, in a single&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be treated with the commercially available INFUSE® Bone Graft material applied to an ACS in the area of the dental implant on Day 0 (Surgery). A follow-up visit will take place 2 weeks after implant of the INFUSE® Bone Graft material, or as regularly scheduled as the standard of care (SOC) for the facility. Patients will return to the facility for final End of Study (EOS) assessments 6 months after surgery for placement of the appropriate prosthetic, and assessment of osseointegration and stability. Between the follow-up visit and the EOS visit, patients will be seen as per the SOC schedule for the facility.</description>
