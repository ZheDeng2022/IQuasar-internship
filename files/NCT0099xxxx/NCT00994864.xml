      The primary working hypothesis is that preoperative chemo-sensitivity testing using&#xD;
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) performed before and after one&#xD;
      course of FOLFOX (folinic acid, fluorouracil, oxaliplatin) can identify the patients that&#xD;
      will least likely have a significant benefit from adjuvant FOLFOX for stage III colon cancer.&#xD;
      The benefit will be analyzed by correlating the preoperative FDG-PET uptake changes to the&#xD;
      disease free and overall survival.&#xD;

      Patients with histological confirmed colon adenocarcinoma compatible with clinical stage II&#xD;
      or III are eligible for study screening. Receipt of a signed informed consent and study&#xD;
      inclusion should be done within 15 days after histological diagnosis. A usual workup for&#xD;
      preoperative staging of colon cancer must be done not more than 1 month before study&#xD;
      inclusion and include CEA assessment, positive histological sample for colon adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      and chest and abdominal CT scan. After receipt of the written consent, the patient undergoes&#xD;
      baseline PET/CT scan and donates blood samples for CTC and SNP analyses. Delay between&#xD;
      baseline examinations and histological diagnosis must not exceed 21 days. The baseline&#xD;
      examinations should be done within 1 week before beginning of the first course of FOLFOX&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Thirteen to 15 days after chemotherapy, the PET/CT and blood sampling for CTC&#xD;
      analysis are repeated. Standard surgery follows after 15 days but no more than 30 days from&#xD;
      Day 1 of preoperative chemotherapy. Two frozen tissue cores are obtained during surgery and&#xD;
      sent immediately in dry ice shipping to the central Tumour Bank (Jules Bordet Institute) or&#xD;
      stored locally at -80°C to be sent in batches to the central tumour bank. Thereafter, the&#xD;
      patient receives standard care, according to tumour pathological stage. In fully eligible&#xD;
      patients, FOLFOX chemotherapy should be started not more than 45 days after surgery. In stage&#xD;
      III patients otherwise ineligible, recommendation is to start FOLFOX chemotherapy within 45&#xD;
      days after surgery although such patients will not be included in the primary analysis.&#xD;
      Treatment in case of stage II or stage IV colon cancer is left at investigator's discretion.&#xD;
      Eleven courses of adjuvant FOLFOX are foreseen, in order to match the usual recommendation&#xD;
      coming from the Mosaic Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up procedures after completion of adjuvant treatment will follow standard European&#xD;
      clinical recommendations for stage II and III patients. Clinical follow-up data will be&#xD;
      obtained for all patients, including those with stage II disease, with a minimum follow-up&#xD;
      time of three years.&#xD;
