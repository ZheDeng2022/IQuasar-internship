    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies calcium and magnesium to see how well they work in&#xD;
      preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by ixabepilone in patients with breast cancer. Giving&#xD;
      calcium together with magnesium may stop or delay the development of peripheral neuropathy in&#xD;
      patients with cancer who are receiving treatment with ixabepilone. It is not yet known&#xD;
      whether calcium and magnesium are effective in preventing peripheral neuropathy caused by&#xD;
      ixabepilone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare ixabepilone-induced peripheral neuropathy (sensory) as measured by European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of life Questionnaire&#xD;
      (QLQ)-Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy (CIPN)20 sensory subscale between calcium&#xD;
      (Ca) Magnesium (Mg) and placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the incidence of CTCAE measured grade 2+ and/or grade 3+ peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
      between CaMg and placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the times to onset of CTCAE measured grade 2+ and/or grade 3+ peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy between CaMg and placebo arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare the proportion of patients requiring ixabepilone dose reductions and/or&#xD;
      stopping ixabepilone secondary to peripheral neuropathy (sensory) between CaMg and placebo&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the toxicity of CaMg in this situation. V. To document the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of the acute pain syndrome (APS, commonly known as arthralgias/myalgias) induced by&#xD;
      ixabepilone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate whether CaMg will decrease the acute pain syndrome (APS). VII. To evaluate&#xD;
      the incidence and characteristics of, and change in, ixabepilone-APS over several cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To evaluate the association between the ixabepilone-APS and eventual&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfate IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      immediately before and after each ixabepilone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IV over 30 minutes immediately before and after each&#xD;
      ixabepilone administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 12 months.&#xD;
