  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2 study of the safety and efficacy of Intravenous (IV) Ribavirin in treating&#xD;
      patients presenting with a probable or suspected case of viral hemorrhagic fever (either&#xD;
      Crimean Congo or Lassa Fever) at a military medical treatment hospital. All patients will be&#xD;
      treated with a 10 day course of IV Ribavirin if they meet all the inclusion and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Department of Defense operations have resulted in the deployment of personnel to areas&#xD;
      endemic for Viral Hemorrhagic Fever (VHF): Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) or Lassa&#xD;
      Fever. Unfortunately, beyond supportive care, there is no approved therapy for treating&#xD;
      either infection. Previous studies with intravenous (IV) Ribavirin have shown IV Ribavirin as&#xD;
      a promising treatment for both infections. This study will provide experience in U.S.&#xD;
      Department of Defense associated treatment facilities in the use of IV Ribavirin for the&#xD;
      experimental treatment of viral hemorrhagic fevers primarily among U.S. Service personnel&#xD;
      deployed to disease-endemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for conducting the study is a) to allow the DoD to gain experience in treating&#xD;
      VHF b) to offer this experimental but promising therapy to patients with probable or&#xD;
      suspected VHF c) to collect safety data while obtaining experience using Ribavirin.&#xD;

             follow-up visits for anemia or other medical conditions as required by the attending&#xD;
             physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Woman of childbearing age must have a pregnancy test performed. If negative, she must&#xD;
             agree not to become pregnant during treatment and for 7 months after receiving&#xD;
             Ribavirin. She also must agree to not breast feed during treatment and for 7 months&#xD;
             after receiving Ribavirin. Two reliable forms of effective contraception must be used&#xD;
             including one barrier method during treatment and during the 7 month post-treatment&#xD;
             period. She will be counseled concerning the risks of IV Ribavirin versus no treatment&#xD;
             if the pregnancy test is positive.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Probable Case of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects will have a history of possible exposure to CCHF, either having:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worked or slept outdoors in the CCHF endemic area within 2 weeks of illness onset,&#xD;
             with or without a history of tick-bite or tick exposure, (Endemic area includes, but&#xD;
             not necessarily limited to: Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Iran,&#xD;
             Iraq, Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, Montenegro, the Kosovo region of Serbia,&#xD;

             Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, the&#xD;
             Crimean region of the Ukraine, Rostov-Don and Astrakhan regions of Russia, and the&#xD;
             Xinjiang [northwestern] region of the People's Republic of China), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Handled blood or freshly butchered meat of domestic livestock in CCHF endemic area&#xD;

             consistent with CCHF as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Acute illness with fever and at least two of these symptoms: myalgia, low back&#xD;
                  pain, and headache,&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  And the appearance of three or more of the following five groups of&#xD;

             these indicators occurring in the first 5 days of illness, predict a mortality greater&#xD;
             than 90% (Swanepoel et al., 1989). Patients with these prognostic indicators may&#xD;
             benefit most from drug therapy, if resources become limiting:&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  By residence or travel in an endemic area where contact with rodents was possible&#xD;
             within 3 weeks of onset of illness, (Endemic area includes, but not necessarily&#xD;
             limited to: Sierra Leone, Liberia, Nigeria, Mali, Central African Republic, and&#xD;
             Guinea.) or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contact with a suspect patient or their body fluids (including laboratory specimens)&#xD;
             within 3 weeks of symptom onset, or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worked with the virus in the laboratory setting. And have&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A negative malaria smear. And have&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs and symptoms compatible with Lassa fever, either:&#xD;
&#xD;

             criteria of a probable case and the patient has an epidemiological history of&#xD;
             potential exposure to the bunyavirus or arenavirus (i.e., recent field duty and/or&#xD;
             other individuals in his troop have CCHF or LF).&#xD;
