  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out how many irradiated natural killer (NK) cells can be&#xD;
      safely given to patients with cancer that has recurred after an autologous stem cell&#xD;
      transplant, and to see what effects (good and bad) it has on the patient and their cancer.&#xD;
      This research is being done because currently, there is no cure or effective treatment for&#xD;
      blood-borne cancers when it has come back after an autologous stem cell transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with hematological malignancies such as acute leukemia, lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease&#xD;
      and myeloma, are generally treated initially with chemotherapy, radiotherapy or a combination&#xD;
      of both. High dose therapy and autotransplantation are often utilized in the management of&#xD;
      such patients, either as part of initial therapy or for treatment of relapsed disease. When a&#xD;
      patient's cancer relapses after transplantation, the prognosis is dismal. Therapeutic options&#xD;
      are usually limited to palliative chemotherapy and/or local radiation, and for persons with&#xD;
      excellent performance status experimental treatments are considered on an ad hoc basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much interest in the last decade has focused on the role of cellular and immunotherapy in&#xD;
      this setting. Cancer vaccines and the administration of adoptive cellular and immunotherapy&#xD;
      have the theoretical advantage of being non cross-reactive with previous treatments (such as&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy) and are currently under investigation using a variety of&#xD;
      methodologies. NK cells comprise roughly 15% of all lymphocytes in the peripheral blood. They&#xD;
      normally function as part of the innate immune system, which provides the body's initial&#xD;
      response to infection and malignancy. However, patients with malignancies frequently have&#xD;
      impaired NK cell function, as evidenced by reduced in vitro proliferative responses and&#xD;
      reduced cytotoxic activity. The infusion of an irradiated NK cell line is appealing as it is&#xD;
      a source of cells that can be expanded to therapeutic quantities, and retains anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
