  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effects of once and twice daily activity performed with patients&#xD;
      who are breathing with the aid of a machine in an intensive care unit. Activity can occur in&#xD;
      bed. Activity can include transfer to a chair and even walking once the patient's condition&#xD;
      allows safe, out-of-bed activity. The investigators hypothesize that early, progressive&#xD;
      activity will reduce inflammatory molecules in the blood, promote muscle and physical health&#xD;
      and help patients to recover more quickly from critical illness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early therapeutic mobility (ETM) activity has been recommended to facilitate recovery and&#xD;
      improve outcomes for the survivors of critical illness who experience prolonged mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation. The effective dose (i.e., type, frequency and duration) of ETM activity is not&#xD;
      known and there are limited reports about the application and effects of ETM in mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Three inflammatory biomarkers, interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein, are potentially altered by a single episode of ETM&#xD;
      activity. Systemic markers of physical health (i.e., vital signs, delirium, muscle strength,&#xD;
      ventilator associated pneumonia, and duration of mechanical ventilation) may also be&#xD;
      positively influenced by ETM. The primary aim of this interdisciplinary study is to compare&#xD;
      the immediate effects of frequency--single and twice daily episodes--of ETM activity and the&#xD;
      effects of type--low and moderate intensity--of ETM activity on molecular biomarkers of&#xD;
      inflammation and systemic markers of physical health in mechanically ventilated adults. This&#xD;
      is an experimental design, using repeated measures; subjects will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either one or two episodes of ETM activity daily during week days while in the ICU. Type of&#xD;
      activity will be determined by patient condition. The research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a. What are the differences between the frequency (once versus twice daily) of ETM&#xD;
           activities on inflammatory biomarkers: interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein&#xD;
           (CRP)? 1.b. What are the differences between the type (low or moderate) of ETM&#xD;
           activities on inflammatory biomarkers: IL-6, IL-10 and CRP?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a. What are the differences between frequency of ETM activities on systemic markers of&#xD;
           physical health: vital signs, delirium, muscle strength, ventilator-associated pneumonia&#xD;
           and duration of mechanical ventilation? 2.b. What are the differences between type of&#xD;
           ETM activities on systemic markers of physical health: vital signs, delirium, muscle&#xD;
           strength, ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected for a maximum of 3 contiguous days in ICU patients who are&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated for &gt;48 hours, then weekly to examine short-term patient responses to&#xD;
      ETM activities in this preliminary study. Daily episodes of activity will be provided by a&#xD;
      study interventionist. Repeated measures MANCOVA and ANCOVA will be used to answer the&#xD;
      research questions. This collaborative study evaluates a biobehavioral methodology within an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team consistent with the biobehavioral methods to improve outcome research&#xD;
      (PA-07-008) and the mission of the National Institute of Nursing Research to improve&#xD;
      treatments and health based on evidence.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24 continuous&#xD;
             hours in the surgical (SICU) or medical ICU (MICU)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  a P:F ratio &gt; 100&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  FiO2 &lt; 60% and PEEP less than 10 cmH20 at baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  resting vital signs of HR 50-110, mean arterial pressure (MAP) 60-110 mmHg, peripheral&#xD;
             oxygenation saturation (SpO2) greater than 88%. Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no exclusions based on gender or minority status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be excluded if they have pre-existing or current neurological, muscular&#xD;
             or orthopedic disorders that require inactivity or immobilization during acute care or&#xD;
             experience paresis/paralysis that will not improve. Examples of exclusionary&#xD;
             conditions include end-stage muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, new quadriplegia,&#xD;
             coma, increased intracranial pressure, unrepaired hip fracture and multiple lower&#xD;
             extremity fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients for high risk of death will also be excluded, using criteria established by&#xD;
             Norton et al.: ICU admission following a hospital stay of &gt;9 days in the past 12&#xD;
             months; age &gt;80 in the presence of 2 or more life-threatening illnesses (e.g.,&#xD;
             end-stage renal disease, severe heart failure (HF); diagnosis of an active stage IV&#xD;
             malignancy; status post cardiac arrest; and diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
             requiring mechanical ventilation.[99].&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects over 400 pounds can be excluded from mobilization based on the judgment of&#xD;
             the bedside nurse or project manager; if the risk for staff or patient harm from&#xD;
             moving a patient with excessive weight is considered likely, mobilization will not&#xD;
             occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Criteria for exclusion include inability to stand or walk for at least 10 minutes&#xD;
             prior to admission; inability to shift weight in bed or assist with turning, inability&#xD;
             of staff to access bariatric equipment such as an overhead trapeze, chair, or walker.&#xD;
