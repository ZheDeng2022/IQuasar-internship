  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-response study to determine how various measurements of airway inflammation&#xD;
      respond to high and low dose FlutiForm®, and compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of two 4-week treatment periods, each preceded by a 14-21 wash-out period.&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised to receive two of the three study treatments - FlutiForm® pMDI&#xD;
      50/5 µg, FlutiForm® pMDI 250/10 µg, or placebo (dummy inhaler). During the wash-out periods,&#xD;
      subjects will take only salbutamol, if required, as rescue medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will record a daily diary for PEFR, study medication use, rescue medication use,&#xD;
      asthma symptom scores, and sleep disturbance due to asthma. Assessments performed at study&#xD;
      clinic visits include inhaled adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) challenge test, induced sputum&#xD;
      test, exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) test, and spirometry tests. Safety will be assessed by lab&#xD;
      tests, vital signs, ECG and adverse events.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female subjects aged between 18 and 55 years inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Females less than one year post-menopausal must have a negative serum or urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test recorded at the screening visit prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication in each treatment period, be non-lactating, and be willing to use adequate&#xD;
             and highly effective methods of contraception throughout the study. A highly effective&#xD;
             method of birth control is defined as those which result in a low failure rate (i.e.,&#xD;
             less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly such as sterilisation,&#xD;
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some IUDs (Intrauterine Device,&#xD;
             hormonal), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known history of mild to moderate asthma for ≥ 6 months prior to the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has not received systemic (injectable or oral) corticosteroid medication in&#xD;
             the 12 weeks prior to the study screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Demonstrate a FEV1 of ≥ 60% predicted FEV1 (Quanjer et al, 1993) at the screening&#xD;
             visit, following appropriate withholding of asthma medications (no long-acting&#xD;
             β2-agonist or short-acting β2-agonist/anticholinergic use 12 hours and 6 hours prior&#xD;
             to screening, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Demonstrate AMP challenge PC20FEV1 &lt; 60 mg/mL, following appropriate withholding of&#xD;
             asthma medication (no short-acting bronchodilator use 6 hours prior to the AMP&#xD;
             challenge test at Visit 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Non-smoker for at least 12 months prior to study screening. Ex-smokers must have a&#xD;
             smoking history equivalent to less than &quot;10 pack years&quot; (i.e. at least 1 pack of 20&#xD;
             cigarettes per day for 10 years or 10 packs per day for 1 year, etc.).&#xD;

             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would put the subject at risk through study&#xD;
             participation, or which would affect the outcome of the study.&#xD;

             effect on bronchospasm and/or pulmonary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Anti-histamines within 2 weeks prior to the screening visit; non-steroidal&#xD;
