  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2 study is to investigate whether intravenous administration of&#xD;
      REOLYSIN therapeutic reovirus in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin is effective and&#xD;
      safe in the treatment of squamous cell carinoma of the lung.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the most common cancer and cause of cancer-related mortality in the&#xD;
      United States. In 2008, there was an estimated 215,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed and&#xD;
      roughly 162,000 deaths from lung cancer (NCI 2009). The majority (85%) of patients with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of lung cancer will have non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of paclitaxel and carboplatin has become the most commonly prescribed&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of advanced NSCLC in the United States. Laboratory&#xD;
      studies of combinations of REOLYSIN with a variety of chemotherapeutic agents has shown that&#xD;
      the combination of REOLYSIN and paclitaxel was invariably synergistic, even in cells with&#xD;
      drug resistance or limited sensitivity to the reovirus. Moreover, reovirus activity was&#xD;
      dramatically increased in the presence of the taxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 study is designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of REOLYSIN given&#xD;
      intravenously in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin every 3 weeks in patients with&#xD;
      squamous cell carinoma of the lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response is a primary endpoint of this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the treatment combination will be assessed by the evaluation of the type,&#xD;
      frequency and severity of adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory tests,&#xD;
      immunogenicity and physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive chemotherapy combined with REOLYSIN for up to 8 cycles and&#xD;
      may continue indefinitely on REOLYSIN monotherapy under this protocol, provided they have not&#xD;
      experienced either progressive disease or unacceptable drug-related toxicity that does not&#xD;
      respond to either supportive care or dose reduction.&#xD;
