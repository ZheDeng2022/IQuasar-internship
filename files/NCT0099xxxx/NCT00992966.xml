      The VRI device may provide a complementary diagnostic tool for lung examination and aid the&#xD;
      physician in determining whether a chest x-ray should be performed.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single center study to determine the value of VRI images as an&#xD;
      aid in determining whether a chest x ray is necessary to evaluate children presenting with&#xD;
      acute respiratory complaints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be children, selected from the Emergency Department (ED), who were&#xD;
      designated to undergo a PA and Left Lateral CXR because of acute respiratory complaints such&#xD;
      as a new respiratory condition, acute cough, onset of shortness of breath, or fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled and will be&#xD;
      recorded by the VRI device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technician will perform a CXR on the enrolled patients. The CXR and the VRI will be&#xD;
      performed on the same day within 6 hours of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VRI readers, who are blinded to the patient's CXR, history, and physical exam, will evaluate&#xD;
      the VRI recording. The VRI reader will review the VRI images and, using the lexicon of images&#xD;
      supplied by Deep Breeze, determine whether the VRI is normal or abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certified radiologists will review the patient's CXR and will determine whether the CXR is&#xD;
      normal or abnormal based solely on the CXR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRI readers determination of normal or abnormal for each subject will be compared to the&#xD;
      radiologists determination of normal or abnormal CXR for each subject.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Body habitus or skin condition that might prevent the placement of the sound sensors&#xD;
             on the back (e.g. severe scoliosis, kyphosis, chest wall deformation, skin lesion on&#xD;
             the back or compression fracture);&#xD;
