      QTc:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the reports of three deaths attributed to Torsade de Point (TdP) related to treatment&#xD;
      with the long-acting methadone derivative levomethadyl acetate HCl (LAAM), methadone has been&#xD;
      scrutinized for any possible association with TdP. Since then, several studies among&#xD;
      Methadone Maintenance Treatment (MMT) patients and chronic pain patients were done, reporting&#xD;
      diverse results about possible association between methadone dose and QTc prolongation. Most&#xD;
      studies however were cross-sectional and generally found insignificant clinical prolongation&#xD;
      of QTc. A follow up studies are of importance, and although few studies have started&#xD;
      evaluating QTc among MMT patients, none was done among chronic pain patients with no history&#xD;
      of drug usage. One study of 8 chronic pain patients experiencing insufficient pain control or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects during treatment with oral morphine switched to oral methadone&#xD;
      showed insignificant modest increase QTc following 9 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perceived Sleep:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain patients as well as drug addicts are known to suffer from poor sleep. Some&#xD;
      studies found possible relation to methadone dose, however, no causal association was found&#xD;
      and importantly some also found association with duration of opiate usage before starting&#xD;
      methadone when entry to MMT clinic. Thus, patients with no history of opiate addiction are an&#xD;
      important interesting group that may help understand relation between methadone usage and&#xD;
      sleep quality. However, sleep must be evaluate before opiate administration and a follow up&#xD;
      study is needed&#xD;
