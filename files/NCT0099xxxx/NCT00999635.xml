      Importance of the topic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower extremity amputation is a costly complication of diabetes for both the NHS and the&#xD;
      patient. Amputation may be avoided if the preceding foot ulceration can be prevented. One&#xD;
      method of reducing the risk of ulceration in the neuropathic foot is through the provision of&#xD;
      therapeutic insoles. The type of insole prescribed (prefabricated verses custom made) is&#xD;
      currently based on anecdotal evidence. The idea held by many practitioners that the custom&#xD;
      made insole is superior in its effect remains speculation, unsupported by the evidence. In&#xD;
      the absence of economic analysis, the available data suggests that the custom insole is&#xD;
      substantially more expensive to the NHS. This study, to determine which of two types of&#xD;
      insole used in therapeutic shoes reduces peak pressure more in the at-risk diabetic foot, is&#xD;
      therefore a very important topic and will provide both useful evidence for the NHS podiatry&#xD;
      services. It is of course also very important for patients with diabetes as the personal&#xD;
      suffering of those undergoing amputation is immense.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single blind randomised controlled trial comparing custom made with 'off the&#xD;
      shelf' insoles.&#xD;

      Aim The study compared custom-made functional insoles with prefabricated insoles for the&#xD;
      preventative management of neuropathic diabetic feet, assessing effects on peak pressure,&#xD;
      forefoot pressure time integral, total contact area, forefoot rate of loading, duration of&#xD;
      load as a percentage of stance, quality of life, perceived foot health and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Pilot work investigating the physical properties of materials used to fabricate&#xD;
      insoles informed material selection. A single-blind randomised control trial recruited 119&#xD;
      neuropathic participants with diabetes from two Primary Care Trusts and randomly allocated&#xD;
      them to either custom-made functional insoles or prefabricated insoles. Data was collected at&#xD;
      issue and 6-month follow-up, using the F-scan in-shoe pressure measurement system. Patient&#xD;
      perceptions were assessed with the Bristol Foot Score and Audit of Diabetes Dependant Quality&#xD;
      of Life. Further analyses were carried out on two subgroups; 1) insole effect on peak&#xD;
      pressure in 44 participants with pronated feet, over a 6-month follow-up period; 2) insole&#xD;
      durability, investigated in a second subgroup of 60 participants for 12-months. Durability&#xD;
      was evaluated in terms of change in insole thickness and reduction in peak pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To increase the robustness of results, data analysis was calculated using three strategies;&#xD;
      1) pure intention-to-treat analysis, including all 119 participants randomised to an&#xD;
      intervention; 2) intention-to-treat analysis, using all available data; 3) as-treated&#xD;
      analysis, including those participants self-reporting full insole compliance, defined as 60%&#xD;
      or more daytime wear.&#xD;
