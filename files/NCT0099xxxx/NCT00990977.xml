    <textblock>
      The number of Danish women treated for breast cancer rise every year, though survival rates&#xD;
      have improved, women can still expect to experience the diverse late effects reported by this&#xD;
      group of patients. Mindfulness labels the ability to be aware of the present moment - thereby&#xD;
      avoiding speculations about both past and present. Mindfulness based stress-reduction (MBSR)&#xD;
      is an 8-week program, covering 24 contact-hours and 45 minutes daily home practice. The&#xD;
      program aims at developing participants' coping resources and developing participants'&#xD;
      mindful awareness. Thus the program consists of guided meditations, guided body scan(a&#xD;
      specific awareness exercise)and through meditation, yoga and psychoeducation concerning&#xD;
      stress and stress-reactions, while meditation and bodyscan is practiced at home by the use of&#xD;
      specific audio-CDs guiding the patient. The MBSR-program have shoved promising results among&#xD;
      patients with anxiety-disorders, depression and chronic pain. Smaller studies have also found&#xD;
      positive effects of the program among cancer patients. The investigators want to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of the MBSR program on levels of anxiety and depression as well as the possible&#xD;
      influence of mindfulness training on health behaviors and existential concerns. The study are&#xD;
      based on the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  report of anxiety and depression will decrease among cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  better compliance will lead to more decrease in levels of anxiety and depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cases will make lifestyle changes suitable with recommendations for BC patients in&#xD;
           post-treatment phase of the illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decreased level of anxiety and depression will reflect improved spiritual well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improved spiritual wellbeing will lead to decreased report of physical symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants in this randomized controlled trial will fill out questionnaires at&#xD;
      enrollment and as 1, 6 and 12 months follow-up. Based on results from this trial clinicians&#xD;
      and patients will be able to make decisions regarding post-treatment psychosocial&#xD;
      intervention and researchers will have initial evidence of the effect of the intervention and&#xD;
      thus possible indications for research on mindfulness among patients diagnosed with cancer at&#xD;
      other stages or sites.&#xD;

      Original Research Protocol, Copenhagen January 2007 Cancer and Mindfulness: A prospective,&#xD;
      randomized trial of a psychosocial intervention among women operated for breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background From the time of diagnosis cancer patients have a need for psychological support.&#xD;
      Many patients handle the situation by the help of friends and family, while others need&#xD;
      professional support to come to terms with different phases of life as a cancer patient. Only&#xD;
      few randomized trials have been conducted in order to determine what kinds of professional&#xD;
      support patients will benefit from. These studies conclude that the prevalence of anxiety and&#xD;
      depression in reduced. This is of major importance as depending of cancer type, treatment&#xD;
      modality, age and gender, a total of 10-50 % of Danish cancer patients reports such&#xD;
      well-defined psychosocial symptoms following the diagnosis of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness meditation aims to increase the experience of presence and an increased relation&#xD;
      to several emotional and sensory experiences. Instead of being a technique aimed to control&#xD;
      and change unwanted psychological states the method is rather a way to stay present in the&#xD;
      here and now without judging and as such it has been developed into a stress reduction&#xD;
      method: mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR). The method is taught within a group&#xD;
      setting by an instructor guiding the patients during a week long program. The method has been&#xD;
      evaluated within a variety of settings and has been found to effectively reduce symptoms&#xD;
      related to different stress and pain conditions i.e. psoriasis, chronic pain, HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.2 Based on these experiences several programs have been developed and&#xD;
      the program developed by Williams and Kabatt-Zinn has gained status as the most commonly&#xD;
      applied and best validated. Within recent years the program has been included into&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral therapy. But with potential effects not only as reduction of symptoms&#xD;
      but further opens the opportunity for participants to approach spiritual and existential&#xD;
      themes. The potential effect is therefore not limited to simple reduction of symptoms but&#xD;
      includes increased meaningfulness, quality of life and sense of coherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine studies of the effect of MBSR haw been conducted, including 10- 157 adult cancer&#xD;
      patients being taught MBSR in groups of mainly breast cancer patients, but only three of&#xD;
      these trials have been conducted as randomized controlled trials. I these trials patients&#xD;
      have self-referred (selection bias), analysis have not been adjusted for biological status of&#xD;
      the cancer disease (confounding), samples have been small (n=10-157) (type 2 error) and&#xD;
      patients have differed with regard to time since diagnosis (misclassification). Despite these&#xD;
      methodological limitations a tendency of positive effects of MBSR participation on&#xD;
      psychological and physiological outcomes has been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Yet it is still not determined whether MBSR will provide cancer patients benefit improving&#xD;
      their daily life with cancer. Some important aspects have not been addressed in previous&#xD;
      studies: When MBSR is applied as an intervention dose-response relation has only been&#xD;
      observed among patients with a moderate level of symptoms. Thus sensitivity of MBSR in&#xD;
      relation to stages of cancer, levels of pain or negative effects of treatments. We still do&#xD;
      not know whether all cancer patients will profit from this type of intervention. Further the&#xD;
      influence of patient compliance and working alliance is still not explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of cancer accentuates existential dimensions as spirituality and quality of&#xD;
      life. Yet we do not know how MBSR can support patients in dealing with such themes. Be review&#xD;
      of literature regarding patients coping with cancer the patients demand for interventions&#xD;
      supporting their need to deal with existential themes is striking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim We will conduct a randomized controlled trial among women diagnosed with primary breast&#xD;
      cancer in order to evaluate the effect of MBSR on depression, anxiety quality of life, health&#xD;
      behavior and psychological well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We do not know whether all types of cancer patients will benefit from MBSR. Especially&#xD;
           patients compliance must be empirically documented&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer accentuates an array of existential concerns and the effect of MBSR on these&#xD;
           subjective concerns must be examined&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion All patient diagnosed with primary breast cancer in Department of Breast Surgery,&#xD;
      Copenhagen Hospital Herlev, will be invited to participate in the study and in the&#xD;
      randomization allocating patients to either MBSR intervention or treatment as usual control.&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed and in active treatment for major psychiatric disease, patients with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disease and cardiovascular disease hindering MBSR participation, and patients&#xD;
      previously diagnosed with other cancers than non-melanoma skin cancer will be excluded. A&#xD;
      project nurse will contact eligible patients, deliver oral and written information and&#xD;
      collect informed consent. If the patient consents baseline questionnaire will be&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will then take place. The project nurse will up-load patient data on secured&#xD;
      project home-page. Computer generated sequence will automatically assign a unique study&#xD;
      number to each patient indicating which study group she is allocated to. Result of the&#xD;
      randomization will be delivered to the patient by the project nurse and potential&#xD;
      disappointment will be handles at this point, and information regarding optional counseling&#xD;
      provided by the Danish Cancer Society will also be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group MBSR will be delivered in groups of maximum 20 participants. The course&#xD;
      will follow an 8 week schedule with 2-2½ hour sessions each week and instruction to practice&#xD;
      45 minutes daily at home. Upon conclusion of the course each group will participate in a&#xD;
      full-day course (8 hours). The courses will be delivered by a manual (including audio CDs)&#xD;
      developed by Antonia Sumbundu (see attached file). The group must meet in a quiet room large&#xD;
      enough to room 20 persons lying down, as well as mats, carpets and chairs. The courses will&#xD;
      be delivered in locations not affiliated with a hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group The control group will receive treatment as usual and thus follow the standard&#xD;
      control program applied by the surgical department.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire Prior to randomization and as follow-up after 6 and 12 months both study&#xD;
           groups will be mailed questionnaires containing validated psychometric&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital charts Descriptions of breast cancer operation, pathology of tumor as well as&#xD;
           day to day entries will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administrative registries Data regarding comorbidity of all eligible patients will be&#xD;
           collected in National Patient Registry and Central Psychiatric Registry upon&#xD;
           finalization of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative outcomes Data collected by standardized self-report instruments will be&#xD;
           supplemented by qualitative interviews inviting the intervention group participants to&#xD;
           present themselves by giving an account of the treatment and a personal evaluation of&#xD;
           the potential benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative data Data will be stores in a database at the institute. Logistic&#xD;
           regression analysis will be applied to evaluate which background variables effects&#xD;
           participation. Analysis of outcomes will be conducted by applying multiple regressions&#xD;
           at each time point. For simultaneous analysis of all follow-up times a linear mixed&#xD;
           model with random effects of persons will be fitted. Outcomes as relapse and death among&#xD;
           intervention group in comparison to both control group and non-participants will be&#xD;
           analyzed by use of Cox regression model, controlling for the effect of biological and&#xD;
           demographic variables. Analysis will be conducted under supervision of a senior&#xD;
           statistician at the Department of Statistics and Epidemiology at the Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Qualitative data Based on the qualitative interviews a set of data-driven categories&#xD;
           will be developed. These categories will be quantitatively evaluated. The transcript of&#xD;
           the patient's self-presentation (approximately 2 pages) will be analyzed by use of&#xD;
           qualitative methods, allowing for grouping of content categories as expressed by the&#xD;
           patients. Statistical analysis will be applied to evaluate these categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Application of permission to conduct the study will be submitted to the The National&#xD;
      Committee on Health Research Ethics and to the Danish Data Protection Agency. In information&#xD;
      to patients regarding the study it will be stressed that participation is voluntary and that&#xD;
      patients withdraw without any explanation at any time, and that withdrawal will have no&#xD;
      influence on treatments delivered. Both written and oral consent must be given prior to&#xD;
      participation. A short report will be mailed to all participants upon conclusion of the&#xD;
      study. Vital status of participants will be checked in Central Persons Registry prior to any&#xD;
      sending of study questionnaire. Data kept in the study database will be encrypted ensuring&#xD;
      that only authorized scientific staff will be able to identify individuals. The encryption&#xD;
      code will be kept by study manager. Results will be reported as tables and figures hindering&#xD;
      identification of individuals. Also in the reporting of qualitative data will the quoted&#xD;
      participants be kept anonymous.&#xD;
