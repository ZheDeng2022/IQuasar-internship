    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate Mofetil (CellCept) is an FDA approved, well tolerated, oral medication used to&#xD;
      prevent the body's immune system from attacking transplanted organs. It has never been&#xD;
      studied in patients with pancreatic cancer but some preliminary studies have shown that it&#xD;
      may antagonize tumor growth. The goals of this study are to find out how much of this drug&#xD;
      can safely be taken by patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and to assess the variation&#xD;
      of the level of the drug in the blood. Patients will take the drug twice a day at a given&#xD;
      dose and the safety of the drug will be monitored through patient symptoms and blood tests.&#xD;
      The disease burden will be assessed by radiographic studies at the beginning and end of the&#xD;
      study. The patient will take the drug for a total of eight weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mycophenolate Mofetil (CellCept) is a prodrug whose active metabolite, mycophenolic acid&#xD;
      (MPA), acts as an immune suppressant by inhibiting de novo guanosine synthesis. CellCept is&#xD;
      FDA approved to prevent rejection of transplanted organs. It is well tolerated, orally dosed,&#xD;
      and has some known antitumor effects. It has never been studied in pancreatic cancer and the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose is not known. In vitro studies in our lab with human pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      lines found that MPA was a potent inhibitor of pancreatic cancer cell growth and induced&#xD;
      apoptosis. The objectives of this study are to identify the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      CellCept in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer that have failed at least two prior&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens and assess its pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
