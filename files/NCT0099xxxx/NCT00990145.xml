  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase I, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending&#xD;
      multiple dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of orally&#xD;
      administered EDP-322 in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty-two subjects were enrolled into 6 cohorts. Six subjects of each cohort were randomized&#xD;
      to received EDP-322 and 2 subjects of each cohort received placebo. Each cohort received the&#xD;
      study drug once daily (QD) for 7 days under fed conditions. Multiple oral doses of EDP 322&#xD;
      ranging from 200 to 800 mg were safe and generally well tolerated by the healthy male and&#xD;
      female subjects in this study.&#xD;
