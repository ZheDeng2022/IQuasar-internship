    <textblock>
      The hypothesis to be tested in this trial is that the different epidemiologic (including&#xD;
      racial differences) and phenotypic manifestations exhibited by Trichomonas clinical isolates&#xD;
      during infection are correlated with their genotypic strain classification. Two specific aims&#xD;
      are proposed to test that hypothesis. Specific aim 1. Assess the significance of genotypic or&#xD;
      phenotypic differences in the Trichomonas strains among African American women by HIV status.&#xD;
      Specific aim 2. Determine the significance of genotypic or phenotypic differences in the&#xD;
      Trichomonas strains circulating among women from two different racial groups, African&#xD;
      American women and Caucasian women. The overall goals of these specific aims are to identify&#xD;
      racial differences in the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of Trichomonas strains,&#xD;
      and to develop the ability to identify and classify Trichomonas infections in order to&#xD;
      prioritize treatment and epidemiologic follow-up of individuals infected with isolates&#xD;
      associated with adverse clinical outcomes (HIV transmission or acquisition, pregnancy&#xD;
      complications, virulence, or drug resistance).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite serious public health consequences, its widespread prevalence, rising drug resistance&#xD;
      and treatment failures, little has been done to study the role of T. vaginalis genotype in&#xD;
      transmission, virulence, occurrence of mixed infections, and the spread of drug resistance,&#xD;
      primarily due to the lack of suitable assays for rapid strain typing. Previously utilized&#xD;
      genotyping techniques for Trichomonas are inadequate due to problems with speed of analysis,&#xD;
      sensitivity, and reproducibility between different labs. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST)&#xD;
      combines speed, sensitivity, portability, accuracy, and reliability by determining nucleotide&#xD;
      sequence polymorphisms (SNPs) present in small DNA fragments (300-400 nt) that are amplified&#xD;
      by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a number (usually 6-7) of neutrally selected&#xD;
      housekeeping genes. MLST assigns an allele fragment number (AFN) for each unique SNP or&#xD;
      combination of SNPs present in a gene fragment and uses these to identify unique sequence&#xD;
      types (STs) based on the AFN combinations in the collection of all the genes analyzed. MLST&#xD;
      has been used extensively to study epidemiology, population structure, virulence and&#xD;
      evolution in pathogenic bacteria but only for fungi among eukaryotes, due to the difficulty&#xD;
      of interpreting MLST data in diploid organisms. However, T. vaginalis differs from other&#xD;
      eukaryotes, possessing a stable haploid set of six chromosomes, and the investigators have&#xD;
      developed an MLST genotyping system for T. vaginalis clinical isolates. The data (AFNs and&#xD;
      STs) generated for each T. vaginalis strain by the MLST scheme we develop will be deposited&#xD;
      in a freely accessible internet database. This MLST scheme will then be used to examine the&#xD;
      relationships between strain genotypes and the clinical, epidemiologic, and physiologic&#xD;
      manifestations of trichomoniasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trichomoniasis is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical presentation and disease&#xD;
      sequelae. This clinical variability is accompanied by a high degree of genetic diversity in&#xD;
      Trichomonas vaginalis clinical isolates as we originally demonstrated and others have&#xD;
      confirmed. The investigators hypothesize that correlations between genotype and clinical&#xD;
      presentation are true for trichomoniasis and that T. vaginalis isolates differ in their&#xD;
      capacity for clinical disease, severity, drug resistance, and disease sequelae. In support,&#xD;
      several studies (10-40 patients) show a statistically significant correlation between the&#xD;
      genetic relatedness of T. vaginalis isolates, using a random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)&#xD;
      technique, with their clinical presentation. Correlations between disease severity in&#xD;
      trichomoniasis and in vitro phenotypic properties such as cytoadherence, cytotoxicity and&#xD;
      expression of cysteine proteinase 30 kilo-dalton (kDa) protein have also been reported.&#xD;
      Significant differences in cytoadherence to cell monolayers, differential protein expression,&#xD;
      phagocytosis of target cells, ability to exert cytotoxic damage on cultured cells, and&#xD;
      pathogenicity and mortality in mice have been demonstrated in T. vaginalis clinical isolates,&#xD;
      indicating the wide variation in virulence properties present in Trichomonas isolates. The&#xD;
      investigators have also demonstrated up to four-fold differences in secreted cysteine&#xD;
      protease activity between cultured T. vaginalis clinical isolates. The accumulated evidence&#xD;
      strongly supports a correlation between individual T. vaginalis strains and their capacity&#xD;
      for virulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this specific study, at the initial enrollment/diagnosis visit the investigators will&#xD;
      collect T. vaginalis isolates accompanied by a detailed clinical assessment, epidemiological&#xD;
      information, and the results of in vitro testing of drug .resistance. This information will&#xD;
      allow the investigators to determine if particular strains or groups of strains (as&#xD;
      determined by MLST genotyping) are associated with asymptomatic infection, clinical severity,&#xD;
      patient race, treatment failures, drug resistance, mixed infections or sexual history using&#xD;
      univariate and multivariate analysis. This is significant because positive associations of&#xD;
      particular strains or groups of strains with these factors, as the investigators expect to&#xD;
      find, will necessitate changes in the way trichomoniasis is managed and treated with&#xD;
      reference to the strains identified. The investigators will also independently test these&#xD;
      variables for correlations with each other to identify variables or combinations of variables&#xD;
      which may be associated with clinical manifestations of trichomoniasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information the investigators gather will also permit a better understanding of&#xD;
      trichomoniasis in many additional ways. The investigators will culture T. vaginalis at test&#xD;
      of cure (TOC) follow-up visits to genotype and determine their drug resistance in order to&#xD;
      distinguish potential treatment failures or conversion to drug resistance (same genotype as&#xD;
      original visit) from re-infection by another contact (different genotype). This is&#xD;
      particularly significant for HIV+ women as their Trichomonas vaginalis infections are more&#xD;
      difficult to cure and T. vaginalis may persist, undetectable by culture, only to re-emerge up&#xD;
      to six months later. Trichomonas vaginalis is detected at TOC visits at much higher rates (up&#xD;
      to 36 %) in HIV+ women than in HIV- women (8%) with most of these infections ascribed to&#xD;
      treatment failures. Recent reports describe persistent, undetected T. vaginalis infections&#xD;
      cultured 3 and 6 months after an initial negative TOC result in women who report no&#xD;
      intervening sexual contacts. This is significant as a correlation of strain genotype with&#xD;
      persistent infection will identify HIV+ individuals needing multiple TOC visits, use of more&#xD;
      sensitive diagnostic tests, and perhaps longer treatment courses.&#xD;
