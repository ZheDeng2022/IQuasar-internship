  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peri-operative fluid therapy is a controversial area with few randomized trials to guide&#xD;
      practice. Fluid management has a significant influence on outcome following surgery. Yet&#xD;
      practically, fluid prescription practice during this period is sub-optimal, resulting in&#xD;
      avoidable iatrogenic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have assessed the effect of a 'liberal' vs. a 'restrictive' perioperative&#xD;
      fluid regimen on post-operative outcome. However, most of these studies have focused&#xD;
      primarily on intra-operative fluid management, whereas postoperative strategies have been&#xD;
      less well defined, even though the immediate postoperative period is of critical importance&#xD;
      to the patient's recovery. Moreover, whereas intra-operative fluid administration is&#xD;
      monitored by the anesthesiologist, postoperatively it is less supervised and may result in&#xD;
      excess or lack of intravenous (IV) fluids. Therefore, fluid management audit at the&#xD;
      post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) is of paramount importance for patient healthcare. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to follow and report the current practice of fluid administration&#xD;
      in the PACU of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, for an extended period of time as a first&#xD;
      step towards establishing evidence-based guidelines for postoperative fluid management.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative intravenous (IV) fluid management has been a historically controversial issue&#xD;
      in anesthesiology. Accumulating evidence suggest that regulated perioperative fluid&#xD;
      management has beneficial effects on postoperative outcomes. A restricted perioperative IV&#xD;
      fluid regimen aiming at unchanged body weight resulted in reduced complications after&#xD;
      elective colorectal resection (1). In another study, patients receiving a reduced&#xD;
      intraoperative fluid volume demonstrated less postoperative complications, lower morbidity&#xD;
      rates and shorter hospital stay after intraabdominal surgery (2). Conversely, whereas&#xD;
      restricted postoperative IV salt and water intake shortened gastrointestinal (GI) function&#xD;
      and hospitalization after colonic resection in one study (3), it had no effect on the same&#xD;
      outcomes in another randomized clinical trial (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the reported benefits of restrictive fluid therapy, this strategy may be associated&#xD;
      with adverse outcomes. Inadequate fluid administration can lead to a reduced effective&#xD;
      circulating volume resulting in inefficient tissue perfusion (5-7). On the other hand,&#xD;
      overhydration, resulting from perioperative fluid excess, has shown association with&#xD;
      deleterious effects on cardiac and pulmonary function (8-12), and on recovery of GI motility&#xD;
      (2,3,13), tissue oxygenation (14), wound healing and coagulation (15-16). Erroneous fluid&#xD;
      administration is generally associated with increased morbidity and postoperative&#xD;
      complications (17-21). Altogether, these observations call for a standardized and regulated&#xD;
      fluid therapy throughout the perioperative period taking into account patients' premorbid&#xD;
      diseases and type of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have focused primarily on intra-operative fluid management. Postoperative&#xD;
      strategies have been less well defined, even though the immediate postoperative period is of&#xD;
      critical importance to the patient's recovery. Moreover, whereas intra-operative fluid&#xD;
      administration is monitored by the anesthesiologist, postoperatively it is less supervised&#xD;
      and may result in excess or lack of IV fluids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is thus to follow and present the current practice of fluid&#xD;
      administration in the PACU of Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, for an extended period of&#xD;
      time as a first step towards establishing evidence-based guidelines for postoperative fluid&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect data regarding intra- and postoperative fluid administration from the charts&#xD;
      of &gt;18 years old ASA I-III patients undergoing elective general or orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
      Patients with renal/cardiac failure will be analyzed separately, since their pathology&#xD;
      dictates extra caution with fluid therapy. Patients demographics, type of surgery, and the&#xD;
      type and volume of fluids given during the operation and PACU stay, will be documented as&#xD;
      well as the occurrence of morbidity in PACU, without any interventions. Data collection will&#xD;
      be anonymous and will last six months. The setting will be the PACU of the Tal Aviv Sourasky&#xD;
      Medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suggested benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this data report is to provide an overview on the current practice of fluid&#xD;
      management in Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center's PACU. We believe that this is a preliminary&#xD;
      necessary step towards establishing guidelines for postoperative fluid management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the contemporary practice of postoperative fluid management in the PACU of the&#xD;
      Sourasky Medical Center.&#xD;
