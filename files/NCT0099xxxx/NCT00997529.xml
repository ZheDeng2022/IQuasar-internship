  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major focus of recent research has been the development of effective ways of sensitizing&#xD;
      the patient's immune system to recognize the cancer as foreign. Allogeneic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation represents a novel way of potentially achieving this goal. There is recent&#xD;
      evidence that non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides effective&#xD;
      therapy for patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Based on the preliminary reports&#xD;
      from other investigators treating patient with breast and ovarian cancer, the investigators&#xD;
      of this study would propose treating an expanded cohort of patients with any metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal endpoints of the trial will include incidence of durable engraftment, quality&#xD;
      of hematopoietic and immune reconstitution, extent of donor chimerism, incidence and severity&#xD;
      of acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD), and incidence of long-term disease&#xD;
      free survival (DFS). The investigators will evaluate the tumor response of patients with&#xD;
      stable or progressive disease post-transplant to donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI). The&#xD;
      investigators will also study the effects of DLI on T-cell immunity in the recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a pilot study in which patients with metastatic solid tumors will undergo&#xD;
      non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Patients whose&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy has been tapered off, are without GVHD, and have evidence of&#xD;
      residual or progressive disease will undergo DLI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there have been attempts to harness the graft-versus-tumor effect of&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplant to treat patients with metastatic solid tumors. Researchers&#xD;
      at the NIH recently reported on 19 patients with refractory metastatic renal-cell carcinoma&#xD;
      who had suitable donors and received a preparative regimen of cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      fludarabine followed by an infusion of a peripheral-blood stem-cell allograft from an&#xD;
      HLA-identical sibling or a sibling with a mismatch of a single HLA antigen.49 They note that&#xD;
      at the time of the last follow-up, 9 of the 19 patients were alive 287 to 831 days after&#xD;
      transplantation (median follow-up: 402 days). Two had died of transplantation-related causes&#xD;
      and 8 of progressive disease. In 10 patients (53%) metastatic disease regressed: 3 had a&#xD;
      complete response, and 7 had a partial response. The patients who had a complete response&#xD;
      remained in remission 27, 25, and 16 months after transplantation. Regression of metastases&#xD;
      was delayed, occurring a median of 129 days after transplantation, and often followed the&#xD;
      withdrawal of cyclosporine and the establishment of complete donor T-cell chimerism. They&#xD;
      concluded that these results were consistent with a graft-versus-tumor effect and that&#xD;
      non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation can induce sustained regression of&#xD;
      metastatic RCCA in patients who have had no response to conventional immunotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>Conditioning includes cytoxan 60mg/kg/d on Days 6 &amp; 5, total dose 120mg/kg, Fludarabine 25mg/m2/d on days -5 to -1, total dose 125mg/m2. Patients with decreased cardiac or liver function pre-transplant will have their dose of cytoxan reduced by 25% - 45 mg/kg/d for 2 days or total dose of 90mg/kg. Patients will receive G-CSF (5ug/kg) to foster engraftment. PBSC progenitors will be mobilized from donor with G-CSF 5ug/kg 2x daily starting 4 days prior to stem cell collection until a target of 5-10 x106 CD34+ cells/kg is reached. Peripheral blood progenitors will be isolated from leukaphereses obtained on Days 5 &amp; 6 with additional collections dependent on cell yields. Peripheral blood from donors will be given to patients 1 day after cytoreduction &amp; immunosuppression. Immunosuppression will be tapered Day +60 if no signs of GVHD. Patients with residual non-regressing disease or mixed chimerism after day 100, who are off immunosuppression &amp; do not have signs of GVHD, will receive a DLI</description>
