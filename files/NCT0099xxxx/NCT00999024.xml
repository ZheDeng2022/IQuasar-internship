  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adequate oxygenation and retinal perfusion is essential for the function of the inner&#xD;
      retina. There is a wide range of autoregulation mechanisms to ensure a sufficient ocular&#xD;
      blood and oxygen supply during changes in systemic blood pressure or intraocular pressure&#xD;
      (IOP). Nonetheless, various retinopathies such as diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading&#xD;
      cause of blindness in people aged 20-65 in the western world, are highly associated with&#xD;
      hypoxia (Pemp and Schmetterer 2008). Hence, measurements of oxygen levels in retinal vessels&#xD;
      are needed to further our understanding of these ischemic diseases. It is a well known fact&#xD;
      and a commonly employed method to measure oxygen saturation of blood through light&#xD;
      transmission (Kramer 1934). However, this approach is not feasible in the human eye.&#xD;
      Therefore, reflection must be used, meaning the amount of incident light must be estimated&#xD;
      based on the amount of light reflected (for a review see Harris 2003). This is a difficult&#xD;
      task and investigators in this field have encountered several problems, including optical&#xD;
      complexities, nonlinear sensors and eye movement (Beach et al 1999; Delori 1988). Nonetheless&#xD;
      considerable progress has been made over the past decades and the development of an reliable&#xD;
      oximeter reported (Hardarson et al 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study this technique will be applied in healthy subjects as well as in&#xD;
      patients with COPD during room-air conditions. The procedure takes approximately 15 minutes&#xD;
      in each subject and will be performed in only one eye.&#xD;
