      In consideration of the limited supply of donor organs, the careful selection of transplant&#xD;
      candidates is essential to optimize patient outcome after transplantation. Therefore an&#xD;
      extensive evaluation of transplant candidates including among others&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy has been implemented in our centre. The data&#xD;
      regarding the prevalence of upper and lower gastrointestinal (GI) pathology in transplant&#xD;
      candidates are contradictory and are based on only a few retrospective studies, which often&#xD;
      include only a subgroup of transplant candidates. The goal of this project is a prospective&#xD;
      evaluation of the frequency of GI pathologies in transplant candidates with specific focus on&#xD;
      the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Are there GI-pathologies that occur at a higher prevalence in transplant candidates than&#xD;
           described in the general population and is there an increase of GI-pathologies since the&#xD;
           introduction of the urgency-based organ allocation leading to sicker transplant&#xD;
           candidates?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the influence of endoscopic findings on patient management before&#xD;
           transplantation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Which risk factors can be identified that predict the presence of GI-lesions?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is there a subgroup of patients, in which screening colonoscopy before liver&#xD;
           transplantation can not be recommended considering the cost/benefit ratio?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is there a correlation of endoscopic findings with outcome after liver transplantation&#xD;
           or with gastrointestinal complications during or after transplantation (e.g.&#xD;
           gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or gastrointestinal malignancy)?&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The introduction of a MELD (model for end-stage liver disease) based necessity-oriented&#xD;
      allocation system for liver transplantation (OLT) has lead to an increasing number of&#xD;
      patients with advanced liver disease on the waiting list. Hence it is essential to optimize&#xD;
      outcome after transplantation in this high-risk patient collective in order to best utilize&#xD;
      the limited supply of donor organs. To achieve this goal, the careful selection of&#xD;
      appropriate transplantation candidates is based on an extensive evaluation of the patients&#xD;
      including cardiac, pulmonary and renal testing and different imaging methods to exclude&#xD;
      malignancies or an infective focus. As in many other institutions also in the Medical School&#xD;
      Hannover (MHH) esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy are standard procedures&#xD;
      during evaluation for liver transplantation. The rationale to perform these procedures is to&#xD;
      identify patients with medical conditions that might limit their outcome after OLT. Some&#xD;
      endoscopic findings as for example esophageal varices, gastric or duodenal ulcer or colon&#xD;
      adenoma can be treated before transplantation, so that the patient enters the waiting list in&#xD;
      a better medical condition. If gastrointestinal malignancies are detected, the patient will&#xD;
      no longer be considered a candidate for OLT, unless curative treated. The detection of&#xD;
      premalignant changes (high grade adenomas, barrett's esophagus etc.) is of great importance,&#xD;
      since the immunosuppressed liver transplantation recipients are probably at a higher risk to&#xD;
      progress to malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far the data regarding the prevalence of upper and lower gastrointestinal pathologies in&#xD;
      transplantation candidates are contradictory and are based on only a few retrospective&#xD;
      studies. These studies often include only a subgroup of transplantation candidates. Many&#xD;
      centres perform screening colonoscopy during OLT evaluation only in patients greater than age&#xD;
      45 or 50, although until today there is no clear evidence, that younger patients do not have&#xD;
      a benefit from screening colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far it is not known if certain preoperative endoscopic findings correlate with&#xD;
      postoperative gastrointestinal complications. Such a correlation, e.g. between diverticulosis&#xD;
      and postoperative colon perforation or peritonitis due to diverticulitis, could be highly&#xD;
      relevant for patient management before and after OLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent the results of EGD and colonoscopy of all patients evaluated&#xD;
      for OLT at the MHH together with laboratory and clinical data will be entered in a database.&#xD;
      After follow up for at least one year these data will be analyzed. Descriptive statistics as&#xD;
      well as a multivariate analysis will be performed, to find out the frequency of endoscopic&#xD;
      diagnoses in transplantation candidates and to look for correlations between these findings&#xD;
      and patient outcome after OLT.&#xD;
