    <textblock>
      Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) means that the patient is in control of his/her pain&#xD;
      medicine. In this study two (2) different treatment plans of Patient-Controlled Analgesia&#xD;
      will be used to treat people with sickle cell disease who are admitted to the hospital for a&#xD;
      pain crisis. The purpose of this study is to find out if one plan is better than the other in&#xD;
      controlling sickle cell pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are eligible for the study, you will be assigned by chance (like flipping a coin) to&#xD;
      either get a higher continuous amount of the pain medicine with a smaller amount for pain as&#xD;
      you need it, OR to get a smaller continuous amount of pain medicine with a larger amount of&#xD;
      pain medicine as you need it. You or your study doctor can not choose which plan you receive,&#xD;
      and you will not be told which one you have been assigned to. The doctors and nurses taking&#xD;
      care of you will know which plan you are assigned to so they can safely and effectively take&#xD;
      care of your pain. Some members of the study team will not know which plan you are on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will give you morphine sulfate or hydromorphone (dilaudid) for your pain. These medicines&#xD;
      are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and have been used for a long time to&#xD;
      relieve pain. If you have been treated for pain before with hydromorphone (dilaudid) and you&#xD;
      prefer it to morphine, then you may choose to get it during the study. If you have not&#xD;
      received hydromorphone (dilaudid) before or you do not have a preference then you will be&#xD;
      given morphine for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain medicine will be given through the IV in your arm. You will receive morphine or&#xD;
      hydromorphone continuously through the IV and will also be able to use the PCA machine to&#xD;
      give yourself extra pain medicine as you need it for pain. You will need to push a button to&#xD;
      give yourself extra medicine for pain. The amount of pain medicine you get on these plans is&#xD;
      based on how much you weigh.&#xD;

      The following things will be done for the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each day you are in the hospital someone from the study team who does not know your&#xD;
           treatment assignment will come in 3 times during the day to ask you questions about your&#xD;
           pain and how you are feeling. The doctors and nurses taking care of you will also do&#xD;
           this as part of the routine care for your pain crisis. You will have your vital signs&#xD;
           (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature) and oxygen level checked regularly as part of&#xD;
           your routine care. The doctors and nurses may need to give you other medicines or do&#xD;
           procedures that are not part of the study to take care of your pain crisis. They will&#xD;
           talk with you about this. The doctors and nurses taking care of you while you are in the&#xD;
           hospital will take care of you and treat your pain crisis just as they would do if you&#xD;
           were not in this study. Being in this study will not interfere with the usual care and&#xD;
           treatment you would receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each day you are in the hospital a member of the study team will have you answer&#xD;
           questions about your pain, any side effects you are having, and how well you are able to&#xD;
           move around.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. While you are in the hospital, you will wear an Actigraph Micro-Mini-Motion logger, a&#xD;
           wristwatch type device that will keep track of how much you move around and how well you&#xD;
           are sleeping. This will help us determine how well the treatment plan is relieving your&#xD;
           pain level. You will wear the actigraph through Day 5 (Day 3 for children) of your&#xD;
           hospital stay, or until you leave the hospital if you go home sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Each day you are in the hospital you will have blood drawn to check how well your&#xD;
           kidneys and liver are working. These blood tests will be done at the same time as your&#xD;
           regular blood tests whenever possible. We will collect about 2 teaspoons of blood from&#xD;
           you for the study each day you are in the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. We will call you 3 days and 14 days after you leave the hospital. During these phone&#xD;
           calls we will ask you questions about how you are feeling, the medications you are&#xD;
           taking including those for pain, and any problems you have had since your discharge.&#xD;
