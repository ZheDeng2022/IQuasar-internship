      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccines are substances used to try to create resistance or immunity to a disease and to&#xD;
           prevent an infection. Investigators are looking into improved ways to give and test the&#xD;
           results of different kinds of vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in comparing the results of an experimental DNA vaccine for&#xD;
           the prevention of seasonal influenza against a standard FDA-approved vaccine for the&#xD;
           prevention of seasonal influenza. The experimental DNA vaccine is not yet approved by&#xD;
           the FDA for preventing the flu.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test the safety and immune response of an experimental DNA vaccine for seasonal&#xD;
      influenza, compared to the standard vaccine for seasonal influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between ages 45 and 70 who have not yet received the seasonal influenza&#xD;
      vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have six planned clinic visits (Weeks 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, and 27) and two&#xD;
           telephone follow-up contacts (within 2 days after each injection) during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into two groups: one group will receive two standard (TIV)&#xD;
           flu vaccine injections given using a needle and syringe, while the other will receive&#xD;
           the DNA flu vaccine using a needleless injection system followed by the TIV vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vaccine injections for both groups will be given approximately 3 weeks apart,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic staff will observe participants for at least 30 minutes after each vaccination.&#xD;
           One to two days after each injection, participants must telephone the clinic staff, and&#xD;
           for 7 days after the vaccination participants will keep a diary card to report on&#xD;
           possible side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During study visits, blood samples will be collected for research purposes to test for&#xD;
           responses to vaccine.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, open-label study in healthy adults. The study will evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccination regimen against the seasonal&#xD;
      influenza virus with one dose of an investigational plasmid DNA vaccine as a prime followed 3&#xD;
      weeks later by the seasonal influenza trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) boost as compared&#xD;
      to two injections with seasonal TIV. The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for&#xD;
      administration and that the DNA vaccine prime - TIV boost schedule will elicit a greater&#xD;
      frequency and/or magnitude of the antibody response than two injections with the seasonal&#xD;
      TIV. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the prime boost&#xD;
      vaccine regimens. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to evaluation of the major&#xD;
      differences in quantity, quality and durability of humoral and cellular immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VRC-FLUDNA056-00-VP vaccine was developed and manufactured by VRC, NIAID. It is composed&#xD;
      of 3 closed-circular DNA plasmids, each with a CMV/R promoter, that encode for H1, H3, and&#xD;
      influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from the same 2009-2010 influenza vaccine strains.&#xD;
      DNA vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL with each dose administered in a 1 mL volume.&#xD;
      The TIV is the subunit inactivated vaccine for the 2009-2010 season. Each dose is composed of&#xD;
      45 microg hemagglutinin (HA) in 0.5 mL; with the recommended ratio of 15 microg HA of each of&#xD;
      the following 3 strains: A/Brisbane/59/2007-like (H1N1); A/Brisbane/10/2007-like (H3N2); and&#xD;
      B/Brisbane/60/2008-like. All injections will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the&#xD;
      deltoid muscle. The DNA injections will be administered by Biojector[Registered Trademark]&#xD;
      2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System and the TIV by needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 healthy adults, 45-70 years old will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two groups in the study randomized simultaneously at a ratio of 2:1 to the&#xD;
      schedules shown in the schema. All subjects will receive the seasonal influenza TIV vaccine&#xD;
      as the second injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol requires 6 clinic visits (Weeks 0, 1, 3, 4, 6, 27) and 2 telephone follow-up&#xD;
      contacts (within 2 days after each injection) for all groups.&#xD;
