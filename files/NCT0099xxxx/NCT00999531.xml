  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of repeated doses of&#xD;
      GS-9411 in healthy volunteers. GS-9411 is a sodium channel inhibitor, that may restore airway&#xD;
      hydration and mucociliary clearance in the lung.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GS-9411 is being evaluated as a potential therapy to improve airway hydration and mucociliary&#xD;
      clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. This study is evaluating the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of 3 dose levels of GS-9411 as an inhaled product, compared to a matched&#xD;
      placebo, administered twice daily for 14 days.&#xD;
