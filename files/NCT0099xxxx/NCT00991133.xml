    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of Clofarabine, Etoposide, Cyclophosphamide, PEG-asparaginase,&#xD;
      and Vincristine to assess this 5-drug treatment's safety and tolerability in pediatric&#xD;
      patients with first relapse Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a Phase 1, open-label study to assess the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      incorporating clofarabine into an intensive chemotherapy regimen of etoposide,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, PEG-asparaginase, and vincristine. Patients enrolled in this study will&#xD;
      receive a maximum of 2 cycles of the 5-drug regimen, then will be treated according to&#xD;
      investigator discretion. After the study treatment period, all patients will be followed for&#xD;
      a minimum of 4 months beyond the final study visit. This study will include a maximum of 12&#xD;
      evaluable patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be in first relapse with &gt;25% blasts in the bone marrow with a duration of first&#xD;
             remission of ≥6 months and no longer in the intensive phase(s) of initial ALL therapy&#xD;
             (e.g., patients who are in the maintenance or continuation phases of therapy [or&#xD;
             beyond] and who have completed the induction or intensification phases).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received no more than 2 prior induction regimens prior to the date of first&#xD;
             relapse. Patients who are in first relapse but have failed a re-induction attempt&#xD;
             (i.e., 1 cycle of re-induction therapy) are not eligible for inclusion in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be ≥1 and ≤30 years old and have a body weight of &gt;10 kg at study entry. (Note: no&#xD;
