      The purpose of this of this study is to determine if 3804-250A can prevent the common cold&#xD;
      caused by the rhinovirus when applied to the hands. The study will also evaluate whether&#xD;
      3804-250A can prevent rhinovirus infection or common cold illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also evaluate the safety of 3804-250A.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rhinovirus infections are the most frequent cause of up to 80% of cold illness during the&#xD;
      fall rhinovirus season. While viral upper respiratory tract infections are generally mild and&#xD;
      self-limiting, they are associated with an enormous economic burden, both in lost&#xD;
      productivity and in expenditures for treatment. Rhinovirus infection is frequently associated&#xD;
      with medical complications that have substantial morbidity such as acute otitis media and&#xD;
      exacerbation of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Marketed treatment options for common colds consist primarily of symptomatic cold remedies&#xD;
      that have only most effects on specific cold symptoms. 3804-250A is a topical treatment under&#xD;
      investigation for the prevention of rhinovirus-associated colds by interruption of&#xD;
      person-to-person transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized trial conducted during a 9-week period during the fall rhinovirus&#xD;
      epidemic season. Healthy, normal subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AV Lotion or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No Treatment control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the 3804-250A group will use the treatment on a defined schedule. The No&#xD;
      Treatment control group will maintain their regular hand washing routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will record the presence of cold illness symptoms daily. Subjects will return to&#xD;
      the study site weekly during the study for specimen collection for rhinovirus PCR, evaluation&#xD;
      of irritation, review and clarification of study diary entries, for review and assessment of&#xD;
      compliance, collection of adverse events and replenishment of study supplies. In addition,&#xD;
      for the first five weeks of the study, subjects in the AV Lotion group will attend a second&#xD;
      weekly compliance visits in which diaries and test product consumption will be assessed for&#xD;
      compliance and collection of adverse events. Photographs of the hands will be taken for&#xD;
      subjects who are withdrawn for skin irritation. The incidence of cold illness,&#xD;
      rhinovirus-associated cold illness and rhinovirus infection will be compared between the&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
