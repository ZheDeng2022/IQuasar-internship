  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe haemophilia A lack clotting factor FVIII and suffer from spontaneous and&#xD;
      traumatic bleeds. In the absence of treatment, frequent bleeds in joints lead to severe joint&#xD;
      destruction. In 1960s, prophylactic therapy was developed involving the infusion of clotting&#xD;
      factor on a regular schedule in order to keep clotting levels sufficiently high to prevent&#xD;
      spontaneous bleeding episodes. Prophylaxis is started at an early age before the age of 2&#xD;
      years or after the first joint bleed. The Malmö experience indicates that treatment is most&#xD;
      effective when administered in large doses at least 3 times weekly. However, such an&#xD;
      intensive treatment in young boys may be very difficult to carry out for home treatment.&#xD;
      Currently, there is no international recommendation on prophylactic therapy regimens. Because&#xD;
      of the high cost and limited availability of factor concentrates, dosing is an important&#xD;
      issue in prophylaxis therapy. It was recently shown that 24 hours after FVIII concentrate&#xD;
      administration, in patients presenting similar FVIIII levels, thrombin generation capacity&#xD;
      may be significantly different. In addition, independently of the FVIII level, a correlation&#xD;
      was found between severe clinical bleeding phenotype and thrombin generating capacity. The&#xD;
      aim of the present clinical study is to assess the thrombin generation test as the main&#xD;
      surrogate marker to evaluate the coagulating capacity of haemophiliacs on prophylaxis&#xD;
      regimen. Optimizing prophylactic therapy to patient's phenotype with no loss of clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness can significantly improve patients' quality of life, protect haemophilic&#xD;
      children against arthropathy and possibly limit the cost of the prophylaxis therapy.&#xD;
