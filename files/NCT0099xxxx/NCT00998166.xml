  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past, patients with advanced lung cancer who were inoperable underwent chemotherapy&#xD;
      with one or more chemotherapeutic agents. More recently, novel new agents targeting specific&#xD;
      enzymes or pathways responsible for cell division have been developed and clinicians have&#xD;
      begun to utilize various combinations of these drugs with standard chemotherapeutic agents&#xD;
      for the treatment of NSCLC. Some of these approaches have demonstrated a small but&#xD;
      significant increase in survival among patients with advanced disease. Because a recently&#xD;
      completed Phase 3 study of bevacizumab + Taxol/Carboplatin in first line NSCLC therapy&#xD;
      demonstrated a 23% improvement in median survival, it would be appealing to see if a regimen&#xD;
      of bevacizumab/ cisplatin/Alimta would also demonstrate a similar, or perhaps better,&#xD;
      response rate.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with NSCLC present with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      disease for which no curative therapy is available. For these patients, platinum based&#xD;
      doublet combination regimens have become standard of care due to increased survival rates&#xD;
      over platinum therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to try to improve on the overall survival, clinicians have attempted to add a third&#xD;
      cytotoxic agent to their standard regimen(s). Although this approach demonstrated an improved&#xD;
      objective response, no additional benefit was noted in overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent development and approval of new targeted chemotherapies during the past 10 years has&#xD;
      prompted clinical trials to test the efficacy of newly FDA approved agents such as gefitinib,&#xD;
      erlotinib, and bevacizumab in advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although gefitinib and erlotinib have both demonstrated clinical activity in refractory&#xD;
      NSCLC, neither agent improved clinical outcome when added to standard 1st line platinum based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. In contrast, a recently completed randomized Phase 3 trial investigating the&#xD;
      addition of bevacizumab to 1st line paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy reported a 23%&#xD;
      improvement in the median overall survival for the paclitaxel/carboplatin plus bevacizumab&#xD;
      treatment arm (12.5m vs. 10.2m; p=0.007). It is therefore appealing to study a cisplatin&#xD;
      combination with bevacizumab to determine if there is any additive benefit. Pemetrexed is an&#xD;
      ideal agent to use in combination with cisplatin since it is well tolerated and efficacy is&#xD;
      comparable to other cisplatin combinations. Patients will receive a maximum of 6 cycles.&#xD;
      Those who complete 1 cycle will be evaluated for toxicity; more than 1 cycle, response.&#xD;
