      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of a reduced calorie diet intervention in&#xD;
      new kidney transplant recipients on the outcomes weight gain, oxidative stress, and insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;

      Kidney transplantation is the preferred renal replacement therapy for end stage renal disease&#xD;
      (ESRD) because it affords survival and quality of life advantages over maintenance dialysis.1&#xD;
      The number of transplants performed increases each year, with currently over 150,000&#xD;
      individuals living in the United States with a kidney transplant. This is in the setting of&#xD;
      68,000 patients on the wait list with a median wait time of 4 years for an available organ.2&#xD;
      Despite the survival benefit over dialysis, transplanted patients still have a greatly&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the general population, and CVD is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death among recipients with a functioning graft.3 Given the long wait times&#xD;
      for kidneys due to organ shortage, extensive resources used, and support needed for each&#xD;
      transplant procedure, it is imperative that we improve long term patient and graft survival.&#xD;
      Accordingly, modification of CVD risk profile is of paramount importance in kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology of increased risk of CVD in kidney transplant patients is multi-factorial and&#xD;
      includes the high burden of CVD and its risk factors present prior to transplant, as well as&#xD;
      increasing prevalence of these risk factors in the post transplant period due to transplant&#xD;
      associated weight gain, immunosuppression side effects, metabolic consequences of a&#xD;
      functioning kidney, and allograft dysfunction. Efforts to reduce CVD risk factors have yet to&#xD;
      be adequately implemented and rigorously studied in the kidney transplant population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity at the time of transplant is common and associated with several CVD risk factors post&#xD;
      transplant, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome,&#xD;
      and inflammation. Obesity is also associated with potentially poorer graft outcomes,&#xD;
      including death censored graft loss and chronic allograft failure.4 In addition, the majority&#xD;
      of patients gain weight post transplantation, primarily in the form of fat mass. Post&#xD;
      transplant weight gain is also associated with increased prevalence of known CVD risk&#xD;
      factors, CVD death, and graft loss.5 The increased burden of CVD in kidney transplant&#xD;
      patients makes obesity prevention and treatment strategies appealing interventions to improve&#xD;
      long-term outcomes, both in terms of graft and overall survival. In this study we will&#xD;
      measure the effect of a low calorie diet intervention in new kidney transplant recipients on&#xD;
      the outcomes weight gain, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance.&#xD;
