      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevention of colorectal cancer (CRC) is feasible through polypectomy on screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Patient acceptance remains the main limiting factor for execution. Colon capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy (CCE) might be a novel method for large populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for screening means or lower gastrointestinal complaints were included in&#xD;
      this single center pilot study. They underwent preparation and then ingested the capsule&#xD;
      (PillCam Colon). Standard colonoscopy was performed the next morning. Significance was&#xD;
      defined as polyps &gt;5mm in size. Performance of exams was by independent physician with&#xD;
      blinding of results.&#xD;

      Study design This was a prospective, single center pilot analysis under screening conditions.&#xD;
      Patient enrollment was from November 5, 2007, to May 7, 2008. All patients provided written&#xD;
      informed consent. Patients underwent CCE on day 1 and conventional colonoscopy on day 2, the&#xD;
      examinations were done by different physicians. Results were blinded until both examinations&#xD;
      had been completed and until interobserver evaluation was finished. Patient acceptance was&#xD;
      assessed with a questionnaire after completion of both examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the ethics committee. The study was partly funded by the Nycomed&#xD;
      Fund of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland and by Given Imaging Ltd., Yoqneam,&#xD;
      Israel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors designed the study, gathered and analyzed the data; the sponsors had no role in&#xD;
      design or conduct of the study nor did they review or approve the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Men and women above the age of 50 years without symptoms (Indication for screening)&#xD;
      or with lower gastrointestinal signs and symptoms and individuals younger than 50 years,&#xD;
      minimum 18 years, without symptoms but with a positive family history for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) (Indication for screening) were considered for this study. Exclusion criteria were CRC&#xD;
      in the patient's history, cardiac pacemaker, contraindications for sodium phosphate solution&#xD;
      (Colophos®) and risk factors for capsule retention including surgical intestinal anastomosis,&#xD;
      Crohn's disease, diverticulitis and radiologically suspected bowel obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection General characteristic of the patients were assembled, including&#xD;
      demographics, family history and recent surgery, as well as bowel habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis, Aim and End Points Significance was defined as polyps &gt;5mm in size, with the&#xD;
      hypothesis that detection rate on CCE corresponds with colonoscopy. The aim was to evaluate a&#xD;
      novel method (colon capsule endoscopy) for performance as a screening tool compared to&#xD;
      conventional colonoscopy in asymptomatic patients. The proclaimed benefit would be an&#xD;
      increase in acceptance of screening for colorectal cancer and a probable better detection&#xD;
      rate of adenoma resp. carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint was the number of cancerous lesions and polyps detected on CCE compared&#xD;
      to conventional colonoscopy. Secondary endpoints were completeness of the exam completeness,&#xD;
      patient acceptance and adherence to preparation regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colon preparation and Propulsion of the Capsule For colon cleansing we applied our&#xD;
      department's standard preparation procedure for conventional colonoscopy including diet and&#xD;
      Macrogolum (PEG, Cololyt®; Spirig Pharma, Egerkingen, Switzerland) and added an oral motility&#xD;
      agent, Phospho Soda (Colophos®; Spirig Pharma, Egerkingen, Switzerland)-boosters and a rectal&#xD;
      suppository that promotes defecation, Table 1. Patients started with a low residual diet&#xD;
      three days prior to the PillCam® Colon examination. The following day they were required to&#xD;
      adhere to a liquid diet and one day before the examination to a clear liquid diet. The&#xD;
      evening before the examination they ingested 2 litres of Cololyt® between 18:00 and 19:30 and&#xD;
      continued with another 2 litres the next morning between 7:00 and 8:30. At 11:00 they were&#xD;
      given 2 tablets of Domperidon (Motilium®; Janssen-Cilag AG, Baar, Switzerland) 10mg a couple&#xD;
      of minutes prior to the PillCam® Colon capsule. Propulsion from stomach to small bowel was&#xD;
      verified using real time viewing before giving the first Colophos® booster (45 ml). That we&#xD;
      later abandoned (for the remaining 49 patients) due to satisfactory propulsion. If the&#xD;
      capsule had not been excreted by 17:00 (3 hours after the first dose) a second dose of 30 ml&#xD;
      Colophos® was added. If it still had not been excreted by 19:30, a suppository of Bisacodylum&#xD;
      10 mg (Prontolax®; Streuli Pharma, Uznach, Switzerland) was administered. The patient removed&#xD;
      electrodes and recorder-belt at the excretion of the capsule or at 22:00, which ever came&#xD;
      first, and continued clear liquid diet until the conventional colonoscopy was performed the&#xD;
      following day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pillcam Colon Capsule The PillCam® Colon Capsule is 11mm x 31mm in size (Figure 1). It is&#xD;
      equipped with two cameras acquiring pictures from both ends of the capsule at a rate of 4&#xD;
      frames per second (2 pictures per second and camera). Compared to the PillCam® Small Bowel&#xD;
      capsule the optic is optimized and more than double of the area coverage and depth view are&#xD;
      provided. The PillCam® Colon Capsule is automatically activated when it is removed from the&#xD;
      package. It enters sleeping mode in order to save energy after approximately 10 minutes and&#xD;
      starts transmitting again 1 h 45 min later. It has a total operating time of 8 - 10 hours.&#xD;
      During the examination the patient wears a sensor array which is attached to the abdominal&#xD;
      skin and a data recorder for storage of the information generated by the ingested capsule.&#xD;
      After the examination the data are downloaded into the Given Imaging workstation and a video&#xD;
      is generated.&#xD;
