      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Obesity is the result of many factors, including genetics and lifestyle, such as&#xD;
      over-eating high-calorie foods and not being physically active. Obesity affects approximately&#xD;
      one third of adults in the United States. Researchers often study individuals who are already&#xD;
      overweight and obese, but another approach is to examine people who stay thin despite eating&#xD;
      whatever they want and not exercising. Studying these thin individuals will enhance&#xD;
      understanding of why some people become obese and others do not, which may lead to novel&#xD;
      treatments for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the metabolism, body composition, body temperature, physical activity, and blood&#xD;
      chemistries of healthy lean adults before and after adding 1,000 extra Calories per day to&#xD;
      their normal diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults, 30 to 50 years of age, who have never been overweight after adolescence,&#xD;
      who are currently weight-stable, sedentary, and eating without restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The entire study will take about 9 weeks and will include the following outpatient and&#xD;
      inpatient visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Outpatient screening visit and monitoring: Physical examination and blood test at&#xD;
      screening; then, one week of physical activity monitoring (e.g., with a pedometer-like device&#xD;
      called an accelerometer) and completing a food diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Baseline inpatient visit (5 days): Volunteers will eat a normal diet to maintain body&#xD;
      weight. Energy expenditure, body composition, physical fitness, activity level, and eating&#xD;
      behavior will be measured. Urine and blood samples will be taken. Volunteers may go home for&#xD;
      the weekend or stay at the metabolic clinical research unit (MCRU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Inpatient feeding week 1 (5 days): Volunteers will eat a normal diet plus milkshakes&#xD;
      for added calories. All the same measurements during the baseline week visit will be&#xD;
      repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Outpatient feeding weeks 2 3: Volunteers will eat breakfast at the MCRU everyday for&#xD;
      the next 2 weeks and take prepared meals home with them (volunteers may also stay at the MCRU&#xD;
      for the 2 weeks if they prefer). Volunteers will drink a non-radioactive (heavy) water called&#xD;
      doubly labeled water to measure energy expenditure in their normal living environment Daily&#xD;
      urine samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;- Inpatient feeding week 4 (5 days): Volunteers will continue eating a normal diet plus&#xD;
      milkshakes for added calories. This stay and measurement is identical to inpatient feeding&#xD;
      week 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Volunteers will be contacted at 6 and 12 months to assess any changes in body weight, diet,&#xD;
      and physical activity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      While many obesity studies focus on the individuals who are already overweight and obese, a&#xD;
      complementary approach to understand such a common disease is to define the mechanisms which&#xD;
      allow some lean individuals to resist weight gain. The predominant cause of human obesity is&#xD;
      the inheritance of genes favoring fat storage and efficient energy utilization interacting&#xD;
      with an obesogenic environment, characterized by readily available, energy-dense food and&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyle. However, a persistent percentage (about 30%) of the US adult population&#xD;
      remains thin (BMI &lt;23 kg/M(2)). While some of these individuals maintain their weight by&#xD;
      vigilantly controlling their diet, exercising or taking medication(s), others may have the&#xD;
      ability to remain thin despite an excessive energy intake and without volitional exercise. To&#xD;
      identify these individuals and define their phenotypes will provide unique insights into&#xD;
      energy and body weight homeostasis, and may yield novel approaches for treating obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this natural history protocol, we will recruit and characterize a cohort of&#xD;
      constitutionally lean and healthy adult volunteers (age 25-50, BMI 18.5-25 kg/M(2)) who do&#xD;
      not have pathological or exogenous factors that are known to stimulate energy expenditure,&#xD;
      suppress food intake, or decrease absorption. We will recruit volunteers who are&#xD;
      weight-stable, sedentary, and non-restrictive eaters, characterize their free-living dietary&#xD;
      and physical activity energy expenditure using food records and portable accelerometers,&#xD;
      respectively. Using an inpatient controlled setting, we will carefully characterize the&#xD;
      details of their 24-hr energy metabolism, body composition, core and skin temperatures, and&#xD;
      blood chemistries while they are on a one-week metabolic diet adjusted to maintain his/her&#xD;
      body weight (baseline) vs. another week of higher energy intake level (1000 extra kcal per&#xD;
      day above their baseline). Overfeeding will continue for two more weeks in the outpatient&#xD;
      setting with all meals provided by our metabolic kitchen, followed by the fourth week of&#xD;
      overfeeding and repeated measurements back in the inpatient setting. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      spontaneous changes in energy expenditure and/or calorie intake may differ between&#xD;
      individuals, and such difference may explain the ability for some to resist body gain. The&#xD;
      accruals of humans with obesity-resistant phenotypes will significantly enhance our&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanisms of energy homeostasis and identify potential novel regulators&#xD;
      for controlling obesity.&#xD;
