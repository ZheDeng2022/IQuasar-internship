  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of extended-release&#xD;
      oxybutynin chloride for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, also known as hot flashes, in&#xD;
      healthy naturally postmenopausal women. This is a randomized, double-blind, multi-center,&#xD;
      parallel group, placebo-controlled study evaluating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      extended-release oxybutynin chloride on hot flashes in healthy naturally postmenopausal&#xD;
      women. Patients will be randomized to extended-release oxybutynin chloride or placebo in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio. The total duration of the study for each treatment group is approximately 98 days.&#xD;
      Patients will be seen for their Pre-Randomization Visit (Visit 1) fourteen (14) days prior to&#xD;
      randomization and a physical examination, medical history, hot flash history, vital signs and&#xD;
      laboratory tests will be performed. Patients will also have daily diaries dispensed to record&#xD;
      their hot flashes (frequency for each severity). Patients who meet the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      for this study will be randomized at Visit 2. At this visit, patients will have vital signs&#xD;
      taken, adverse events recorded, study medication dispensed, and complete Quality of Life&#xD;
      (QOL) questionnaires. The patient will be instructed to start her study medication beginning&#xD;
      the morning after this visit (defined as Study Day 1). In both treatment groups, patients&#xD;
      will return for follow-up visits between Study Days 8-14 (Visit 3), 22-28 (Visit 4), and&#xD;
      50-56 (Visit 5). The Final Study Visit (Visit 6) will occur between Study Days 78-84.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A total of approximately 140 women will be recruited into the study (70 patients in the&#xD;
      extended-release oxybutynin chloride group and 70 patients in the placebo group). Safety will&#xD;
      be assessed by pre- and post- study physical examinations, laboratory analysis, adverse&#xD;
      events and vital signs. The primary endpoints in this study are the change in daily frequency&#xD;
      of moderate to severe hot flushes from baseline to Week 12 (corresponding to visit 6 that is&#xD;
      scheduled from day 78 to day 84) and the change in severity of moderate to severe hot flushes&#xD;
      from baseline to Week 12. Daily severity score of moderate to severe hot flashes is the sum&#xD;
      of all moderate hot flashes times 2 and all severe hot flashes (including waking episodes)&#xD;
      times 3 divided by the total number of moderate to severe hot flashes on that day. Baseline&#xD;
      severity is the average of all daily severity scores in the 14 days before the first dose of&#xD;
      study medication. Week 12 severity is the average of all daily severity scores in the 7 days&#xD;
      before Visit 6 or the 7 days including and before the last double-blind dose if subject&#xD;
      withdraws before Visit 6. The baseline value for daily frequency is defined as total number&#xD;
      of moderate to severe hot flashes recorded during pre-randomization period divided by the&#xD;
      number of days in the corresponding period for which complete diaries are received. The daily&#xD;
      frequency for Week 12 is defined as the total number of moderate to severe hot flashes&#xD;
      recorded during the last 7 days prior to last dose of study medication divided by the number&#xD;
      of days in that week for which complete diaries are received. The secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      change in daily frequency of moderate to severe hot flashes from baseline to Week 4, change&#xD;
      in severity of moderate to severe hot flashes from baseline to Week 4, change of daily&#xD;
      composite score of moderate to severe hot flashes from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12, change&#xD;
      in daily frequency of any hot flashes from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12, change in severity&#xD;
      of any hot flash from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12, and change in daily composite score of&#xD;
      any hot flashes from baseline to Week 4 and Week 12. Other secondary endpoints include all&#xD;
      scores from the Profile of Mood States, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, Menopause-Specific&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaire, Short Form-36 Health Survey, and Sleep Disruption Scale, as&#xD;
      well as the Patient Global Assessment score. Patients were dispensed a diary at the&#xD;
      Pre-Randomization Visit (Visit 1) and started to record their hot flashes (frequency for each&#xD;
      severity). The term hot flash is descriptive of a sudden onset of reddening of the skin over&#xD;
      the head, neck, and chest, accompanied by a feeling of intense body heat and concluded by&#xD;
      sometimes profuse perspiration. The duration varies from a few seconds to several minutes&#xD;
      and, rarely, for an hour. The severity of a hot flash was defined as:1. Mild: sensation of&#xD;
      heat without sweating; 2. Moderate: sensation of heat with sweating, able to continue&#xD;
      activity; 3. Severe: sensation of heat with sweating, causing cessation of activity. Waking&#xD;
      episodes (i.e., episodes that wake the patient from sleep) associated with hot flashes were&#xD;
      recorded separately and were considered severe. Patients will receive either extended-release&#xD;
      oxybutynin chloride, 15 mg or matching placebo. One tablet will be taken orally every day in&#xD;
      the morning for 12 weeks.&#xD;
