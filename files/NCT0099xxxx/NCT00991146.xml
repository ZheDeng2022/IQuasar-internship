  <brief_title>Efficacy and Safety Study of Canakinumab Administered for 6 Months (24 Weeks) in Japanese Patients With Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes Followed by an Extension Phase</brief_title>
  <official_title>An Open-label, Efficacy and Safety Study of Canakinumab (Anti-interleukin-1Î² Monoclonal Antibody) Administered for 6 Months (24 Weeks) in Japanese Patients With the Following Cryopyrin-associated Periodic Syndromes: Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome, Muckle-Wells Syndrome, or Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease, Followed by an Extension Phase to Provide Canakinumab to Study Patients Until it is Approved and Marketed in Japan</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date there are no approved effective therapies for the treatment of cryopyrin-associated&#xD;
      periodic syndromes (CAPS) including Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS),&#xD;
      Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), or Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) in&#xD;
      Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will assess the efficacy and safety of canakinumab in Japanese patients with&#xD;
      cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). In previous and currently ongoing CAPS&#xD;
      studies (CACZ885A2102, CACZ885D2201, CACZ885D2304, CACZ885D2306), it has been observed that&#xD;
      treatment with canakinumab in patients with CAPS contributed to ensure absence of relapse, to&#xD;
      improve signs and symptoms and to prevent secondary disease complications. However, no&#xD;
      Japanese patients have been included in those studies. This study will allow access for&#xD;
      Japanese patients to a new potentially efficacious treatment for CAPS patients with a&#xD;
      convenient dosing regimen.&#xD;
