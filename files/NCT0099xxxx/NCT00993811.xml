  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the Shang Ring, a novel Chinese device for voluntary&#xD;
      medical male circumcision, in order to improve the provision of male circumcision services&#xD;
      for HIV prevention in Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have confirmed the benefit of voluntary medical male&#xD;
      circumcision (VMMC) in reducing the acquisition of HIV by circumcised men. In Africa, VMMC is&#xD;
      most commonly performed with the methods described in the WHO Manual for Male Circumcision&#xD;
      under Local Anaesthesia (i.e., the forceps-guided, dorsal slit or sleeve method).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modelers have estimated that to scale-up VMMC to prevent large numbers of HIV infections will&#xD;
      require millions of circumcisions over the next 5 to 10 years, with more than 10 million&#xD;
      circumcisions in 2012 based on aggressive scale-up plans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal circumcision is a very common procedure and has been the subject of numerous&#xD;
      clinical trials. With the use of simple devices, neonatal circumcision is rapid and safe. In&#xD;
      contrast, current adult surgical techniques are done freehand. Adolescent or adult male&#xD;
      medical circumcision has been a rarely performed procedure in most developed countries.&#xD;
      Circumcision has suffered from little or no research that could make possible either (a)&#xD;
      comparison or simplification of surgical techniques or (b) development of devices to&#xD;
      facilitate the procedure. Current techniques are time consuming and require long training&#xD;
      periods to produce skilled personnel. Each procedure typically takes 20 to 40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A search for more efficient adult circumcision techniques has been undertaken by consultants&#xD;
      for the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. Preliminary&#xD;
      discussions that helped to produce this proposal suggest that the Shang Ring is one of the&#xD;
      most promising existing devices that could greatly simplify adult circumcision. More&#xD;
      efficient and simpler techniques could potentially:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduce the operating time and the cost of supplies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the safety of the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Permit more rapid training of non-physician health care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accelerate the process of scaling up this proven HIV prevention strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shang Ring is a relatively new device, manufactured by SNNDA, a small company based in&#xD;
      Wuhu, China owned by Mr. Shang Jianzhong Shang. It has been approved for marketing in China&#xD;
      since 2005, with sales of about 40,000 devices in the past couple of years. The Shang Ring&#xD;
      and was awarded the CE Mark by for the European Union in October, 2008. The Shang Ring has&#xD;
      the potential to dramatically reduce the time needed for the surgical procedure, from the&#xD;
      current 20 to 430 minutes, to an average of about 5 3 to 10 minutes per procedure. This&#xD;
      efficiency would greatly increase the productivity of large scale VMMC efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Shang Ring has several unique advantages compared to other devices that are currently in&#xD;
      use, including its suitability for use in adults, small size, simple design, and ease of&#xD;
      application. It is a clamp- type device, so there is no need for cautery for hemostasis,, or&#xD;
      for suturing for hemostasis, or wound closure. The manufacturer has agreed to negotiate a low&#xD;
      public sector price so that it would be affordable for circumcision programs in Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project goal, objectives and critical milestones: We propose to conduct a multicenter RCT&#xD;
      comparing the Shang Ring to standard surgical techniques, with a sample size of 500 men in&#xD;
      the Shang Ring group and 500 men in the standard surgery group. We will conduct cost studies&#xD;
      to compare time and resources needed for both techniques. We will also assist SNNDA in&#xD;
      preparing and submitting dossiers to regulatory authorities in both the United States and at&#xD;
      least three African countries, and will assist as needed in SNNDA's application to the U.S.&#xD;
      FDA for 510(k) clearance. Circumcision devices are considered class II devices by the U.S.&#xD;
      FDA. We will request that the FDA grant marketing clearance for the Shang Ring through a&#xD;
      510(k) process, similar to other recent circumcision device approvals. We propose to conduct&#xD;
      these activities over a 30-month period. If successful, they could lead to wide use of the&#xD;
      Shang Ring and dramatic efficiencies in scaling up VMMC programs.&#xD;
