      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common chronic disease in children, occurring in&#xD;
           approximately 1 of every 400 to 600 children. Children with T1D are unable to produce&#xD;
           insulin, a hormone that allows the body to use glucose from food. Children with T1D&#xD;
           manage their diabetes by taking insulin, monitoring their blood glucose levels, and&#xD;
           watching their diet, including carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Carbohydrates come from many different kinds of food, and recent research has shown that&#xD;
           different foods have a different effect on the level of glucose in the blood. In&#xD;
           general, whole, unprocessed foods (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes) have&#xD;
           a lower glycemic index (GI), which means that they cause smaller, more sustained blood&#xD;
           sugar levels. Additionally, these foods are rich in nutrients. Nutrient-poor&#xD;
           carbohydrates come from foods made with refined grains and sugars, such as breads,&#xD;
           crackers, and breakfast cereals; they general cause a more rapid increases in blood&#xD;
           sugar (i.e., a high GI). Lower GI diets may help people with T1D manage their blood&#xD;
           glucose levels more easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the utility of a whole foods, low GI diet in the management of T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the utility of a behavioral intervention to promote healthful family&#xD;
           dietary behaviors, including eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes,&#xD;
           and fewer refined carbohydrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how the dietary intervention affects quality of life, satisfaction with the&#xD;
           diet, and risk for problem eating behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Children 8 to 16 years of age who have been diagnosed with T1D for more than 12 months, and&#xD;
      who use insulin injections to maintain normal blood glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Families will be divided into two groups: an intervention group that will participate in&#xD;
           intensive dietary intervention and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and a control&#xD;
           group that will not have the dietary intervention but will have CGM and scheduled&#xD;
           contacts with study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention group families will have 11 family-based and 2 group-based sessions&#xD;
           consisting of behavioral techniques and educational content about eating nutrient-dense,&#xD;
           low GI foods. CGM results will give families feedback about how their diet affects blood&#xD;
           glucose levels. At least one parent and the child with T1D will participate in the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention topics will consist of goal setting, behavior self-monitoring, educational&#xD;
           information, and problem solving, among others. Parents and children will record the&#xD;
           foods they eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group families will participate in 11 family-based sessions consisting of CGM&#xD;
           feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessments will be conducted at 6, 12, and 18 months, and medical record information,&#xD;
           including blood and urine testing, will be obtained at each routine clinic visit.&#xD;

      This protocol describes a randomized controlled trial to promote consumption of carbohydrates&#xD;
      from nutrient-dense whole foods among children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes and to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of such dietary changes in improving glycemic control and other&#xD;
      diabetes-related health outcomes.&#xD;
