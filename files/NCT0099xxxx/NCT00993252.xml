      Each year, Canadian emergency department physicians treat 600,000 patients with head injury.&#xD;
      Many of these are adults with &quot;minor head injury&quot;, i.e. loss of consciousness or amnesia and&#xD;
      a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15. Only 6.2% of these &quot;minor&quot; patients have some&#xD;
      acute injury on computed tomography (CT scan) and only 0.5% have an epidural hematoma&#xD;
      requiring surgery. Among Canadian teaching hospital emergency departments, we have shown a&#xD;
      fourfold variation in use of CT and that a small but important number of intracranial&#xD;
      hematomas are missed at the first visit.&#xD;

      Background: Each year, Canadian emergency department physicians treat 600,000 patients with&#xD;
      head injury. Many of these are adults with &quot;minor head injury&quot;, i.e. loss of consciousness or&#xD;
      amnesia and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13-15. Only 6.2% of these &quot;minor&quot; patients&#xD;
      have some acute injury on computed tomography (CT scan) and only 0.5% have an epidural&#xD;
      hematoma requiring surgery. Among Canadian teaching hospital emergency departments, we have&#xD;
      shown a fourfold variation in use of CT and that a small but important number of intracranial&#xD;
      hematomas are missed at the first visit. This renewal application builds on previous MRC/CIHR&#xD;
      Health Services Research Committee funded grants to determine feasibility (phase 0, MRC&#xD;
      GR-13304D, 1995-96), develop a clinical decision rule for CT in minor head injury (phase I,&#xD;
      MRC MT-13700, 1996-99, N=3,121), and prospectively validate this Canadian CT Head Rule (phase&#xD;
      II, CIHR #42521, 2000-03, N=2,707), all part of the U of Ottawa Group Grant in Decision&#xD;
      Support Techniques (CIHR 2000-143). The Canadian CT Head Rule is comprised of simple clinical&#xD;
      variables and allows physicians to be much more accurate in their diagnosis of brain injury&#xD;
      and will standardize the use of CT without jeopardizing patient care (The Lancet 2001). In&#xD;
      the recently completed prospective validation (phase II), we confirmed the accuracy and&#xD;
      reliability of the rule in 2,707 additional patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The goal of phase III is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of an active&#xD;
      strategy to implement the Canadian CT Head Rule into physician practice. Specific objectives&#xD;
      are to: 1) Determine clinical impact by comparing the intervention and control sites for: a)&#xD;
      CT Head ordering rates, b) Missed neurological intervention cases, c) Missed brain injuries,&#xD;
      d) Number of deaths, d) Length of stay in ED, and e) Patient satisfaction; 2) Determine&#xD;
      sustainability of the impact; 3) Evaluate performance of the Canadian CT Head Rule, with&#xD;
      regards to: a) Accuracy, b) Physician accuracy in interpretation, and c) Physician comfort&#xD;
      and compliance with use; 4) Conduct an economic evaluation to determine the potential for&#xD;
      cost savings with widespread implementation; 5) Conduct an exploratory psychological process&#xD;
      evaluation to examine whether physicians' intentions and behaviours can be predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We propose a matched-pair cluster design study which compares outcomes during 3&#xD;
      consecutive 12-month 'before', 'after', and 'decay' periods at 6 pairs of 'intervention' and&#xD;
      'control' sites. These 12 hospital ED sites will be stratified as 'teaching' or 'community'&#xD;
      hospitals, matched according to baseline CT head ordering rates, and then allocated within&#xD;
      each pair to either intervention or control groups. During the 'after' period at the&#xD;
      intervention sites, simple and inexpensive strategies will be employed to actively implement&#xD;
      the Canadian CT Head Rule: a) physician group discussion and consensus, b) educational&#xD;
      initiatives (lecture, posters, pocket cards), and c) a process-of-care modification with a&#xD;
      mandatory reminder of the Rule at the point of requisition for radiography. These outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed: 1) Measures of clinical impact will compare the changes from 'before' to&#xD;
      'after' between the intervention and control sites: a) CT Head ordering proportions (the&#xD;
      primary analysis); b) Number of missed brain injuries; c) Number of serious adverse outcomes;&#xD;
      d) Length of stay in ED; e) Patient satisfaction. 2) Performance of the Canadian CT Head&#xD;
      Rule: a) Accuracy of the rule; b) Physician accuracy of interpretation; c) Physician comfort&#xD;
      and compliance. 3) Economic evaluation measures: a) CT head rate after discharge; b) Length&#xD;
      of stay in ED and hospital; c) Hospital admission; d) Neurological intervention; e) Number of&#xD;
      transfers. 4) Psychological Process Evaluation: Mail surveys of physicians before and after&#xD;
      the intervention. During the 12-month 'decay' period, implementation strategies will&#xD;
      continue, allowing us to evaluate the sustainability of the effect. We estimate a sample size&#xD;
      of 2,400 patients in each period in order to have adequate power to evaluate the main&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance: This implementation study (phase III) is an essential step in the process of&#xD;
      developing a new clinical decision rule / guideline for health care practitioners. Phase I&#xD;
      successfully derived the Canadian CT Head Rule and phase II confirmed the accuracy and safety&#xD;
      of the rule and, hence, the potential for physicians to improve care. What remains unknown is&#xD;
      the actual change in clinical behaviour that can be effected by implementation of the&#xD;
      Canadian CT Head Rule and whether implementation can be achieved with simple and inexpensive&#xD;
      measures. We believe that the Canadian CT Head Rule has the potential to significantly limit&#xD;
      health care costs and improve the efficiency of patient flow in busy Canadian EDs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consecutive adult patients presenting to one of the study hospital EDs after sustaining&#xD;
        acute minor head injury will be enrolled into the study. Eligibility as an 'acute minor&#xD;
        head injury' case will be determined by the patient having all of the following&#xD;
        characteristics upon arrival in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Blunt trauma to the head resulting in witnessed loss of consciousness, definite&#xD;
             amnesia, or witnessed disorientation, no matter how brief; this may be determined from&#xD;
             the patient or from the report of a witness (the patient will be asked specific&#xD;
             questions: 'do you remember the accident?', 'how did you get to the hospital?', 'have&#xD;
             you talked to me before?').&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Initial ED GCS score of 13 or greater as ascertained by the attending physician (e.g.&#xD;
             opens eyes spontaneously, obeys commands, but speech may include only comprehensible&#xD;
             but inappropriate words).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Injury within the past 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. less than 16 years,&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. 'minimal' head injury i.e. no loss of consciousness, amnesia, or disorientation,&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. no clear history of trauma as the primary event (for example primary seizure or&#xD;
             syncope),&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. GCS score of less than 13,&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. head injury occurred more than 24 hours previously,&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. obvious penetrating skull injury or depressed fracture,&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. acute focal neurological deficit (motor or cranial nerve) that cannot be ascribed to&#xD;
             an extracerebral cause, for example, traumatic mydriasis or peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. have suffered a seizure prior to assessment in the ED,&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. a bleeding disorder or current use of oral anticoagulants,125 or&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. returned for reassessment of the same head injury&#xD;
