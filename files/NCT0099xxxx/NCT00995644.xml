      Smoking cessation can be enhanced either by increasing the success of quit attempts or by&#xD;
      increasing in the number of quit attempts. The investigators are interested in what causes a&#xD;
      smoker to make a quit attempt. The investigators will test whether certain events (e.g., a&#xD;
      request from a child to quit smoking or exposure to a smoking-related health message)&#xD;
      increase the probability of a quit attempt in the near future. The investigators are will&#xD;
      test whether planning behaviors (e.g. seeking information about treatment) and setting a quit&#xD;
      date are common and increase the probability of a quit attempt. Finally, the investigators&#xD;
      want to see if spontaneous, unplanned quit attempts are common and are more or less&#xD;
      successful than delayed, planned quit attempts. In a pilot study, the investigators will&#xD;
      develop measures of the most common events and planning activities. In the main study, the&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 200 adult daily smokers who are interested in quitting in the next&#xD;
      3 months. They will call a phone daily and use the phone's keypad to enter data plus they&#xD;
      will complete mailed or internet questionnaires weekly for 3 months. The results of this&#xD;
      study will a) help us understand what prompts smoking cessation attempts, b) help develop&#xD;
      media messages and individual interventions to motivate smokers to make a quit attempt, and&#xD;
      c) help determine whether spontaneous, impulsive quit attempts or delayed, planned quit&#xD;
      attempts should be encouraged.&#xD;

      METHODS Pilot Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of our foci was on whether certain external events (prompts or cues) increase the&#xD;
      probability of a quit attempt. We could not locate validated measures of possible external&#xD;
      cues or planning activities for a quit attempt; thus, in Pilot Study 1, we recruited 28&#xD;
      daily, adult smokers of who had stopped smoking for at least 24 hours in the past month&#xD;
      (including Hispanics, African-Americans, smokers whose income was below 1.5x poverty level,&#xD;
      who were under age 24, and both men and women) to respond to a semi-structured telephone&#xD;
      interview to identify possible causes of and preparations for their recent quit attempt. We&#xD;
      used these responses to produce a list of 13 possible prompting events and two possible&#xD;
      planning activities. In Pilot Study 2, we tested the ease of use of our IVR system and the&#xD;
      clarity of our prompts. We will recruited smokers in the protocol described below including&#xD;
      some who had a high school education or less and some who were 60 years or older. The only&#xD;
      differences between this pilot study and the main study were that: a) IVR response options&#xD;
      included a &quot;don't know/unclear&quot; option, and b) we will conduct a qualitative interview two&#xD;
      weeks into the pilot 2 study to determine problems with IVR usage and understanding of the&#xD;
      cue items. The pilot studies and the main study were approved by the University of Vermont&#xD;
      Committees on the Use of Human Subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Main Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a prospective cohort study of 200 adult daily smokers who were interested in&#xD;
      quitting smoking in the next two months. Participants will call an interactive voice response&#xD;
      (IVR) system daily for 3 months to report daily smoking, prompts to quit, planning events,&#xD;
      and intentions to quit. In addition, they will complete more lengthy monthly questionnaires&#xD;
      via mail or internet and, if they attempted to quit, a post-quit qualitative interview. We&#xD;
      provided no intervention. The main aim was to determine which, if any, external cues to stop&#xD;
      smoking or preparations for quitting prospectively increased the probability of a quit&#xD;
      attempt. A secondary aim is to compare the predictive power of certain cessation-related&#xD;
      internal cognitive variables versus external cues on quit attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via newspaper and radio advertisements and via internet ads&#xD;
      that will have messages such as &quot;Daily cigarette smokers who plan to quit wanted for&#xD;
      University of Vermont research study. Reimbursement for completing phone questions and mailed&#xD;
      surveys. No need to leave home. This study does not offer treatment.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      We chose a sample size of 200 because we believed about 50% of our sample would attempt to&#xD;
      quit during the study period. This would provide 100 quit attempts which should be sufficient&#xD;
      for prediction analyses. Plus a sample size of 200 produces a 95% confidence interval (CI) of&#xD;
      no wider than + 7% with dichotomous outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Participants will be given the option of completing baseline and monthly&#xD;
      questionnaires either via return of mailed questionnaires or via a password-protected&#xD;
      internet site. The baseline questionnaire will collect demographic and smoking information&#xD;
      including past quit attempts, plans for quitting, and the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine&#xD;
      Dependence. It will ask the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), to indicate psychiatric problems&#xD;
      and asked questions on recent alcohol and marijuana use and abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete the IVR questions nightly for 3 months. The IVR is a system in&#xD;
      which participants call a number which directs them to enter data using the phone keypad. IVR&#xD;
      has many of the assets of computer-assisted telephone interviewing; e.g., automatic skips,&#xD;
      branching options, prohibition of illogical responses and outliers, standardized questioning,&#xD;
      and direct data entry. IVR's major assets are the increased confidentiality, the ability to&#xD;
      prompt participants to call, and the ability of participants to determine when to call. Drug&#xD;
      use outcomes are more validly reported in IVR studies compared to in-person phone interviews,&#xD;
      computer assessments, written questionnaires or in-person interviews. After brief training in&#xD;
      the use of the IVR, participants will be instructed to call the IVR within 2 hours of their&#xD;
      usual bedtime. If no call iss received during that window, the IVR telephoned the participant&#xD;
      reminding them to call. The IVR questions include an assessment of current smoking status and&#xD;
      whether the smoker plans to smoke tomorrow. If the participant reports smoking or being&#xD;
      abstinent for only 1 day, the IVR asks whether each of 13 possible quit attempt cues and two&#xD;
      planning activities (see Table 1) occurred on that day. If the participant reports abstinence&#xD;
      for 2 or more days, the IVR will ask 12 questions about withdrawal symptoms and relapse cues,&#xD;
      and whether abstinence was due to an attempt to stop smoking. If it was a quit attempt, a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview will be scheduled to gain further details about the quit attempt&#xD;
      and it's precipitants. To detect quit attempts that may not have lasted a full day, once each&#xD;
      week the IVR will ask whether participants made a quit attempt that lasted less than a day in&#xD;
      the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and monthly, participants will complete questionnaires that ask about several&#xD;
      cognitive variables related to stopping smoking; i.e., self-efficacy, perceived risks and&#xD;
      benefits of smoking and abstinence and smoking expectancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our major dependent variables are the events and cognitions and our major independent&#xD;
      variable was the incidence of a quit attempt, defined as 24 hrs of abstinence due to an&#xD;
      attempt to stop smoking.&#xD;
