      Five percent of children in the UK are prescribed steroid inhalers to control asthma symptoms&#xD;
      but there is no test to determine whether the dose of steroids is correct. Too much steroid&#xD;
      treatment has potential side effects and too little may lead to asthma attacks. Exhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide (ENO) is a gas present in everyone's breath and may be a useful &quot;meter&quot; for&#xD;
      asthma control. In children, ENO can be measured easily and quickly, the results are&#xD;
      available immediately to the doctor or nurse and for these reasons ENO is an attractive&#xD;
      clinical test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pioneering studies have used ENO to help clinicians treat asthmatic adults and children and&#xD;
      the results are promising. Breathing tests improved among those where asthma treatment was&#xD;
      guided by ENO and asthma symptoms were slightly less frequent. These studies all used a&#xD;
      single ENO value to increase or reduce treatment and study authors have suggested there&#xD;
      should be a range of ENO values where treatment is neither increased nor reduced; what is not&#xD;
      known is what these ENO values may be. Elevated NO is associated with a number of factors&#xD;
      other than asthma, including allergy and pollen exposure. What is not known is how factors&#xD;
      other than asthma affect ENO measurements over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will answer two important questions: What values of ENO indicate that&#xD;
      steroid treatment should be increased or reduced? And how much does ENO rise and fall&#xD;
      normally? The investigators will recruit 200 asthmatic and non-asthmatic children. The&#xD;
      investigators will measure ENO on six occasions over a 12-month period. The investigators&#xD;
      will measure factors that may affect ENO other than asthma. For the asthmatic children, the&#xD;
      investigators will also assess asthma control. The investigators' methodology is based on&#xD;
      several years experience with ENO. The investigators' results will allow ENO to be used to&#xD;
      monitor asthma.&#xD;

      Our hypotheses are that there will be different ENO values that correlate with loss of/gain&#xD;
      in asthma control and that ENO variability is related to environmental exposures including&#xD;
      tobacco smoke and pollen. Our research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do determine what values or % change in ENO correlates with gain and loss of asthma&#xD;
           control&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine by how ENO measurements vary within an individual over a 12-month period&#xD;
           among children aged 6-16&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine whether ENO measurements vary by the same degree for stable asthmatic,&#xD;
           non-asthmatic atopic and non-asthmatic non-atopic children&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine whether variability in ENO correlates with environmental exposures&#xD;
           including tobacco smoke, pollen, domestic animals, mould and ambient NO2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Asthma is a common chronic condition that affects approximately one million&#xD;
      children in the UK and 5% of all children in the UK are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids&#xD;
      (ICS) to palliate asthma symptoms. The 2008 British Thoracic Society/Scottish Intercollegiate&#xD;
      Guidelines Network guidelines for the management of asthma recommends a step-wise approach to&#xD;
      treatment, i.e. treatment is stepped up and down as symptoms relapse and remit. There is no&#xD;
      definition of which severity or duration of symptoms should prompt a step-up in treatment.&#xD;
      The guideline suggests a &quot;trial and error&quot; approach to stepping down treatment in&#xD;
      symptom-free individuals. In the 21st century, the management of asthma remains based on&#xD;
      highly subjective clinical decisions and there is a pressing need for a biomarker to guide&#xD;
      asthma treatment. &quot;Priorities for respiratory research in the UK&quot; recommends that &quot;Rigorous&#xD;
      evaluation is needed of the use of new technologies for diagnostic and monitoring purposes&#xD;
      [in asthma], for example exhaled nitric oxide&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small number of pioneering studies have sought to use ENO to guide asthma treatment, and&#xD;
      these have been reviewed recently by the lead applicant. These studies all find ENO-guided&#xD;
      treatment is associated with improvements in bronchial hyperresponsiveness, spirometry or&#xD;
      ENO. Although all studies found ENO-guided management was associated with improved symptom&#xD;
      control, this only achieved significance in one of the four populations studied. The dose of&#xD;
      ICS was often considerably higher in individuals where treatment was guided by ENO. One&#xD;
      possible reason for the lack of improved symptom control despite increased ICS dose is that&#xD;
      all studies used a single cut-off value for ENO to step up or step down ICS treatment; in&#xD;
      this situation treatment may be stepped up in an individual with minimal/no symptoms but with&#xD;
      a relatively small increase in ENO. Use of separate ENO values for stepping up and stepping&#xD;
      down treatment may be more effective, and a recent study has found that changes in paired ENO&#xD;
      measurements between -40% and +30% from baseline did not indicate gain or loss of asthma&#xD;
      control. Additionally, approximately 10% of individuals with high ENO do not have airway&#xD;
      eosinophilia and in this subgroup, who have minor asthma symptoms, ENO does not reduce with&#xD;
      ICS treatment. Whilst the present literature suggests that ENO is a promising biomarker for&#xD;
      asthma, the findings to date are conflicting and questions remain. In particular, what is&#xD;
      still not understood is (i) what values of ENO (or change in ENO) correspond with loss or&#xD;
      gain in asthma control? (ii) the variability of ENO over time independent of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will include rigorous clinical evaluation of participants and will have good&#xD;
      statistical power (a weakness of some previous studies). In the proposed study we will take&#xD;
      ENO measurements on six occasions over a 12-month period in well-phenotyped asthmatic,&#xD;
      non-asthmatic atopic and non-atopic non-asthmatic children. We will describe changes in ENO&#xD;
      in the context of asthma control. We will use the results to produce a series of cut-offs for&#xD;
      change in ENO measurements in children; analogous to traffic lights there will be a green&#xD;
      range (little or no change), amber range (slight increase in ENO), red range (significant&#xD;
      increased in ENO). This &quot;traffic light&quot; approach to asthma management is analogous to current&#xD;
      asthma management plans where symptoms and peak flows measurements are used. We will also&#xD;
      report on changes in ENO in the context of atopy and also environmental exposures including&#xD;
      tobacco smoke, pollen, domestic animals, mould and ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels. In&#xD;
      future, and in collaboration with colleagues in primary care, we will use these ranges to&#xD;
      design clinical trials where ENO is used to safely monitor asthma. Our data will also be made&#xD;
      public and could be used by colleagues to design studies where ENO is used to step-up and&#xD;
      step-down corticosteroid treatment in asthmatic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c) Experimental design and methods Study design Protocol. Two hundred children aged between 6&#xD;
      and 10 years at enrolment will be recruited from local schools. The initial assessment will&#xD;
      take place at hospital and the remaining five will take place at school. The following will&#xD;
      be included in the initial phenotyping assessment: height and weight, a standard respiratory&#xD;
      questionnaire (ISAAC), Child Asthma Control Test (CACT) for asthmatics, ENO, spirometry, in&#xD;
      bronchodilator response and skin prick reactivity. Longitudinal measurements of ENO will&#xD;
      thereafter be taken at two monthly intervals. Asthmatic children will complete a CACT at each&#xD;
      assessment where changes in asthma medication will also be recorded. The defined primary end&#xD;
      point is change in ENO between assessments where asthma control changes. The defined&#xD;
      secondary end point will be variability in ENO over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility. Children attending schools in Aberdeen city will be eligible. There is a long&#xD;
      tradition of Aberdonian schools and school children participating with asthma studies and we&#xD;
      are fortunate to have had the support of Aberdeen City Council, headteachers, class teachers,&#xD;
      parents and children over the last 40 years. Our experience is that blanket distribution of&#xD;
      letters to parents via class teachers results in relatively poor enrolment rates. We will&#xD;
      therefore meet with headteachers and representative of the parent-teachers associations to&#xD;
      explain the purpose of the study, gain their approval and include articles in school parent&#xD;
      bulletins before approaching the parents and children. Children aged under 6 years will not&#xD;
      be included since we have shown that ENO measurements cannot be obtained in the majority of&#xD;
      this young age-group. Children who are unable to provide an ENO measurement on the initial&#xD;
      assessment will not be included for future assessments. In the event that few children with&#xD;
      severe asthma (defined as BTS/SIGN treatment step 3 and 4) are recruited from schools in the&#xD;
      first year of the study, we will enrich the cohort with severe asthmatics enrolled from&#xD;
      hospital clinics. At the start of the study, written consent will be obtained from parents&#xD;
      and verbal assent will be obtained for each assessment from the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorisation of participants. Children with asthma will be defined as those with&#xD;
      affirmative responses to both questions &quot;have you/your child ever had asthma?&quot; and &quot;have&#xD;
      you/your child had wheezing or whistling in the chest during the last 12 months?&quot; The number&#xD;
      of non-atopic asthmatic children (ie asthma and negative skin prick reactivity) is&#xD;
      anticipated to be small; in the final analysis, and only if the number of non-atopic&#xD;
      asthmatics is sufficient, we will determine whether the variability for this group differs&#xD;
      for the atopic asthmatics. A stable asthmatic will be defined as an asthmatic child where&#xD;
      CACT remains ≥19 and treatment does not change over one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires. At enrolment a validated questionnaire used for the International Study of&#xD;
      Allergy and Asthma in Children will be completed. Parents of primary school children (aged≤11&#xD;
      years) will complete the wheezing, rhinitis and eczema modules in the core questionnaire for&#xD;
      6-7 year olds. Children attending secondary schools (aged &gt;12 years) will themselves complete&#xD;
      the wheezing, rhinitis and eczema modules in the core questionnaire for 13-14 year olds.&#xD;
      Asthmatic children will also complete the CACT. A CACT score of ≥19 will be defined as loss&#xD;
      of asthma control. A CACT score of &lt;16 will be used to define good asthma control and has a&#xD;
      79% negative predictive value for physician-defined uncontrolled asthma. Indoor NO2 exposure&#xD;
      will be ascertained using questions relating to open gas fires and hobs in the home. Current&#xD;
      cat and dog exposure will be defined as an affirmative response to the questions &quot;Do you&#xD;
      currently have a cat at home?&quot; and &quot;Do you currently have a dog at home?&quot; Mould exposure will&#xD;
      be determined from the response to the &quot;Is there visible damp within the home?&quot; if so which&#xD;
      room?&quot; Home will be defined as the residence where the child spends most of the week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENO measurements. A portable NO analyser (MINO®, Aerocrine, Sweden) will be used to measure&#xD;
      ENO in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. The same MINO® will be used for each&#xD;
      school to eliminate the risk of potential variability for measurements between analysers. Our&#xD;
      group has already validated the use of the MINO® for use in children. The child will be asked&#xD;
      to inhale through the analyser and the exhale slowly, using the visual and auditory&#xD;
      incentives, at 50ml/s for six seconds. In keeping with international guidelines11, we will&#xD;
      report the mean ENO from three measurements within 10% or two measurements within 5% of each&#xD;
      other; this approach minimises any inherent variability in ENO measurements due to the&#xD;
      analyser itself. Measurements will be taken at the same time of day for each child, if&#xD;
      possible, and this will eliminate any possible diurnal variability in ENO measurements.&#xD;
      Exhaled measurements will not be taken in children who have a concurrent cold since this may&#xD;
      affect the ENO result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry. Spirometry will be used to phenotype the study participants. A standard portable&#xD;
      pneumotachograph (ML3500, MicroLab) will be calibrated and used in accordance with the&#xD;
      manufacturer's recommendations, international recommendations will be followed. Each child&#xD;
      will complete three forced expiratory manoeuvres, the highest FEV1 and FVC values will be&#xD;
      identified, FEV1 and FEV1/FVC ratio will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchodilator response. We will measure FEV1 before and 15 minutes after 200 micorg&#xD;
      salbutaom (mid/spacer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Skin Prick Reactivity. The skin prick test will be used to determine reactivity to cat&#xD;
      dander, house dust mite, hen's egg, tree pollen, timothy grass, dog dander, cat dander,&#xD;
      Aspergillus and Alterneria (allergens provided by ALK, Northampton). Positive (histamine&#xD;
      10mg/ml) and negative controls (0.9% saline) will be used. Atopy will be defined as at least&#xD;
      one wheal that measures more than 2mm in longest diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambient NO2 concentration. Using the Aberdeen NO2 diffusion tube network we will assess the&#xD;
      likely average weekly NO2 exposure for each child in the week in which their measurements&#xD;
      were made. This will be supplemented by an assessment of indoor NO2 exposure from&#xD;
      questionnaire data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pollen exposure. This will be done by looking at the predictable seasonality of pollen&#xD;
      production, ie. Tree pollen March/April Grass pollen June/July. Pollen concentrations are not&#xD;
      measured in Aberdeen and concentrations in Dundee will be used as a frame of reference and&#xD;
      provided at cost (£500) by the National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit. The pollen&#xD;
      season difference between Aberdeen and Dundee is likely to be very small and insufficient to&#xD;
      affect the timing of pollen exposures.&#xD;
