    <textblock>
      This study examines methods to better predict improvement of a hidden disability of&#xD;
      functional vision, spatial neglect, following stroke. Spatial neglect is a tendency to make&#xD;
      visual judgment and movement errors mislocating the body and objects in space. The&#xD;
      investigators are using specialized statistical methods to compute the proportion of&#xD;
      improvement accounted for by personal characteristics of each stroke survivor, the proportion&#xD;
      of improvement accounted for by the unique visual-spatial errors made by each subject, and&#xD;
      the proportion of improvement accounted for by each treatment administered. The investigators&#xD;
      will also examine whether brain imaging predicts how rapidly improvement occurs. Lastly, the&#xD;
      study tests whether improvements that are meaningful to the survivor can be measured in a way&#xD;
      that still allows detection of small and scientifically eloquent performance changes.&#xD;

      DESCRIPTION: Spatial neglect, pathologically asymmetric spatial behavior resulting from a&#xD;
      brain injury (Heilman, 1979) and causing functional disability (Barrett and Burkholder, 2006)&#xD;
      may occur in 20-50% of strokes, up to 350,000 Americans annually (Ringman et al., 2004;&#xD;
      American Stroke Assoc., 2007). Difficulty eating, dressing, and navigating in complex&#xD;
      environments occurs acutely in this disorder, but even if symptoms improve in chronic&#xD;
      recovery, people with spatial neglect are more likely to lose functional independence (Katz&#xD;
      et al., 1999). Current standard clinical approaches are not theory driven, and&#xD;
      widely-employed therapies may be only marginally effective. In this proposal, we suggest two&#xD;
      means by which scientific acute spatial neglect treatment can be implemented. In available&#xD;
      studies, subject heterogeneity may have obscured treatment effects. Across methods, studies&#xD;
      used single subject, case series, and group analytic designs, but did not attempt to&#xD;
      reconcile the distinct advantages offered by individual versus group analytic approaches.&#xD;
      Different treatments might affect different spatial cognitive recovery functions, but simple,&#xD;
      global outcome measures may not reflect these changes. Modeling both subject-specific and&#xD;
      group effects is also an extremely useful method of examining targeted treatment effects. We&#xD;
      will collect spatial neglect treatment response data over four years, for two promising and&#xD;
      feasible spatial neglect treatments: prism adaptation training and dopaminergic medication.&#xD;
      With mechanism-specific outcome assessment and hierarchical linear modeling, we will examine&#xD;
      whether treatments result in predictable response. We will also examine whether controlling&#xD;
      for subject-specific predictors models group recovery trajectory. Lastly, we will examine&#xD;
      current standard global outcome measures instruments which have not been fully&#xD;
      psychometrically developed, and attempt to predict subject- and group-specific recovery&#xD;
      profiles for these variables. We hope this research will improve our ability to design&#xD;
      cognitive rehabilitation treatment studies. It may also, however, improve our ability to&#xD;
      translate cognitive neuroscience models of action, spatial knowledge, and attention, to&#xD;
      treatments to optimize adaptive movement in complex environments. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:&#xD;
      This study investigates novel methods of outcome analysis for comparing two treatments for&#xD;
      hidden disabilities in functional vision after stroke. We hope this research will improve our&#xD;
      ability to design cognitive rehabilitation treatment studies. It may also, however, improve&#xD;
      our ability to bring basic brain science to the bedside, to optimize stroke survivors'&#xD;
      adaptive movement and balanced visual-spatial function in complex environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although subjects are assigned to treatments in this study, we classified the study as&#xD;
      observational because there are no quasi-experimental options fitting its hierarchical design&#xD;
      under the interventional study description. At no point do we examine the independent effect&#xD;
      of treatments; rather, we assign subjects to treatments in order to learn if treatment exerts&#xD;
      an additional effect IN COMBINATION WITH 1) individual differences and 2) performance&#xD;
      characterization of spatial bias type immediately after stroke. We are lastly making separate&#xD;
      examination of the predictive effect of brain lesion location in combination with variables&#xD;
      1) and 2). NO traditional efficacy comparisons between the two treatments to which subjects&#xD;
      are assigned, are made. Neither treatment is considered &quot;control&quot; or &quot;placebo,&quot; and there is&#xD;
      no attempt to match severity or other relevant variables between the two treatment&#xD;
      assignments.&#xD;
