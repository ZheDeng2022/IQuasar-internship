  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Extension Phase of the COMPASS-HF study is to continue to observe the&#xD;
      safety of the Chronicle® Implantable Hemodynamic Monitor (IHM) system and Chronicle ICD&#xD;
      system and provide study doctors continued access to the heart pressure information recorded&#xD;
      by the Chronicle devices which may be used to help manage heart failure. The Extension Phase&#xD;
      of the COMPASS-HF study is limited to people who have already received the investigational&#xD;
      system and are currently enrolled in a Chronicle IHM or ICD study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For the purpose of the Extension Phase, the Chronicle IHM and ICD systems are for continued&#xD;
      use in patients with moderate to severe heart failure and are intended to monitor hemodynamic&#xD;
      information, including right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures, heart rate and&#xD;
      activity. The COMPASS-HF Extension Phase includes the following Chronicle IHM studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Chronicle IHM Phase I/II study, which was a 148 patient technology assessment study&#xD;
           that began enrolling patients in 1998 and completed the endpoint driven follow up period&#xD;
           of 3 months for safety and 12 months for efficacy in 2002&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Chronicle Offers Management to Patients with Advanced Signs &amp; Symptoms of Heart&#xD;
           Failure (COMPASS-HF) study, which was a 274 patient randomized study that began&#xD;
           enrolling patients in 2003 and completed the endpoint driven follow up period of 6&#xD;
           months in 2005&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Pilot (PAH Pilot) study, which was a 24 patient&#xD;
           pilot study that began enrolling patients in 2003 and completed the endpoint driven&#xD;
           follow up period of 12 weeks in 2006&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Reducing Decompensation Events Utilizing intraCardiac Pressures in Patients with&#xD;
           Chronic HF (REDUCEhf) study, which was a 400 patient randomized study that began&#xD;
           enrolling patients in 2006 and completed endpoint driven follow up period of 12 months&#xD;
           in 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all four studies, patients were implanted with a Chronicle IHM or ICD system and upon&#xD;
      completion of the endpoint driven follow up period, entered long term follow up and have&#xD;
      continued to be seen every six months for study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the Chronicle IHM or ICD system has not received U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      approval, the COMPASS-HF Extension Phase is being initiated as a means to allow continued&#xD;
      access of Chronicle IHM data to study investigators in one concurrently enrolled study and&#xD;
      follow up schedule. No additional study objectives or new enrollments will be captured in the&#xD;
      COMPASS-HF Extension Phase.&#xD;
