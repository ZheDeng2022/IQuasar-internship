  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of two types of spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      programming types, in comparison to each other as well as patient baseline data.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients have been implanted with an Abbott spinal cord stimulator capable of&#xD;
      delivering both tonic (continuous) stimulation as well as Burst (intermittent) stimulation.&#xD;
      Patients are programmed to be in both stimulation modes for a study period of 4 weeks, after&#xD;
      which their pain symptoms are evaluated on a variety of surveys: McGill Pain Questionnaire&#xD;
      (MPQ), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Pain Catastrophizing&#xD;
      Scale (PCS), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Numerical Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS) and Global Improvement. They also undergo Quantitative Sensory Testing (QST),&#xD;
      where thermal, mechanical, vibration and pressure stimuli are applied to the patient and&#xD;
      detection limits are documented.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Stimulus Testing (QST)-Thermal</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Thermal stimulus testing - thermal stimulation system is used to record hot and cold sensation and pain thresholds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measurement tool contains 15 descriptive words (11 sensory and 4 affective) used by subjects to describe their pain. Total number of words chosen is documented</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement tool assesses functional outcome for 10 conditions in subjects with chronic pain. Patients select a statement for each condition that most closely resembles their own situation. Each statement has a score of 0-5, depending on the severity of the particular disability. Raw scores are calculated into a disability percentage.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 21 section multiple-choice self-report survey. Patients select a statement in each section that most closely resembles their own situation. Each statement has a score of 0-3, depending on the severity of the depressive content. Raw scores are tallied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 13 question survey. It is used to assess the degree to which patients ruminate on, magnify, and/or amplify their pain symptoms. Patients rate on a scale of 0-4 (never - all the time) how often they have each of the thoughts listed. Raw scores are tallied</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients rate, on a scale of 0-10, their pain at it's least, most, and average over the past week. They also rate their pain &quot;right now&quot; as well as their perception of Global Improvement.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey is used to assess the 'daytime sleepiness' of patients. Patients rate the likelihood of falling asleep during several daytime scenarios, on a scale of 0-3 (never - very likely). Raw scores are tallied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This survey is designed to assess the nature, severity, and impact of insomnia in adults. Patients are asked to rate on a scale of 0-4 (no problem - very much a problem) how much of a problem they have with several sleep conditions. Raw scores are tallied.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Stimulus Testing (QST)-Sensitivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Von Frey fibers are used to determine tactile sensitivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Stimulus Testing (QST)-Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An algometer is used to measure pain related to pressure.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Stimulus Testing (QST)-Vibration</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A tuning fork is used to measure sensitivity to vibration.</description>
