  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among college students and suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      suicide-related behaviors are a frequent presenting problem at college counseling centers&#xD;
      (CCCs), which are overburdened. Studies show that some students respond rapidly to treatment,&#xD;
      whereas others require considerably more resources. Evidence-based adaptive treatment&#xD;
      strategies (ATSs) are needed to address this heterogeneity in responsivity and complexity.&#xD;
      ATSs individualize treatment via decision rules specifying how the type and intensity of an&#xD;
      intervention can be sequenced based on risk factors, response, or compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this multisite study is to investigate the effectiveness of four adaptive&#xD;
      treatment strategies (ATSs) to treat college students who report suicidal ideation when first&#xD;
      seeking services at their college counseling center&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multisite study will enroll moderately to severely suicidal college students in the&#xD;
      &quot;emerging adulthood&quot; phase (ages 18-25) seeking services at CCCs. This Sequential&#xD;
      Multi-Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) will have two stages of intervention. In Stage 1,&#xD;
      700 participants from four CCCs will be randomized to 4-8 weeks of: 1) a suicide-focused&#xD;
      treatment - Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS) or 2) Treatment as&#xD;
      Usual (TAU). Sufficient responders to either intervention will discontinue services/be&#xD;
      stepped down. Non-responders will be re-randomized to one of two Stage 2 higher&#xD;
      intensity/dosage intervention options for an additional 4-16 weeks: 1) CAMS (either continued&#xD;
      or administered for the first time) or 2) Comprehensive Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT),&#xD;
      which includes individual therapy, skills group, and phone/text coaching for the clients and&#xD;
      peer consultation for the counselors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize a Sequential Multi-Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) design.&#xD;
      College students seeking counseling services through the College Counseling Centers (CCCs)&#xD;
      will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1, student participants will be initially randomized into either treatment as usual&#xD;
      (TAU) or Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality (CAMS). Student participants&#xD;
      receiving TAU will receive the customary treatment they would receive at the CCC at a&#xD;
      frequency typical to the site (e.g., once a week). Student participants receiving the CAMS&#xD;
      intervention will receive CAMS through weekly sessions with a counselor that will last for&#xD;
      50-60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Responders to either CAMS or TAU may stop intervention after three consecutive weeks of&#xD;
      non-engagement in suicidal acts combined with the ability to cope with suicidal ideation, if&#xD;
      present, based on counselor's clinical global impression ratings of improvement and severity.&#xD;
      Stage 1 has an intended duration of between 4 and 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-responders to Stage 1 treatments, will be re-randomized to one of two Stage 2 treatments:&#xD;
      CAMS or Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Student participants receiving DBT will engage in&#xD;
      individual therapy and a skills training group. Stage 2 has an intended treatment duration&#xD;
      between 4 and 16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All treatment in Stage 1 and Stage 2 (TAU, CAMS, and DBT) will usually be administered in&#xD;
      person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counselors will provide TAU, CAMS, and DBT to study participants. They will also participate&#xD;
      in CAMS and DBT trainings and ongoing consultation teams for each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project estimates 36 months (3 years) total duration from beginning of recruitment until&#xD;
      final data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of treatment will vary from 4 to 24 weeks and is based on response. Total&#xD;
      participant duration in study, due to the assessments, is approximately 48 weeks (which&#xD;
      includes the 24-week follow-up assessment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counselor participants will participate for 1-3 years.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We will participant de-identified data (linked only by GUID) with the National Institute of Mental Health Data Archive (NDA). The NDA is an informatics system and research data repository developed by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to share research data. The NDA provides the infrastructure to store, search across, and analyze various types of data. In addition, The NDA provides longitudinal storage of a research participant's information generated by one or more research studies. In other words, the NDA is able to associate a single research participant's genomic, imaging, clinical assessment and other information even if the data were collected at different locations or through different studies. By doing so, the NDA gives researchers access to more data than they can collect on their own, making it easier and faster for researchers to gather, evaluate, and share research information from a variety of sources.</ipd_description>
