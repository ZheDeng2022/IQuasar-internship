      This study is a observational, prospective, case-control, monocentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the polysomnographic characteristics of sleep in glaucomatous&#xD;
      and non-glaucomatous subjects, using data collected in the MARS database of CHU&#xD;
      Grenoble-Alpes, to compare the total sleep time of glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous&#xD;
      subjects, measured during the polysomnographic examination collected in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are the exhaustive characterization of the sleep architecture in&#xD;
      glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous subjects, from data collected in the MARS database of the&#xD;
      CHU Grenoble-Alpes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of sleep period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time spent in phase 1, 2, 3 and 4&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Micro-alarm clocks index&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time with arterial oxygen saturation less than 90%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Apnea-hypopnea index&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is an eye and neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive destruction of&#xD;
      optic nerve cells (retinal ganglion cells), affecting vision but also the retino-hypothalamic&#xD;
      pathway leading to the suprachiasmatic nuclei and helping to synchronize nycthemeral rhythms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can therefore be suggested that glaucoma may affect the structure and quality of sleep.&#xD;
      Few studies on the subjects of sleep quality and architecture have been performed to date,&#xD;
      and all are either small series of cases without a comparator group, or studies based on&#xD;
      questionnaires but without polysomnographic examination. The results of studies carried out&#xD;
      to date are conflicting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject is important because glaucoma is a frequent disease (1 to 1.2 million subjects in&#xD;
      France and 75 to 90 million in the world), and could potentially be a frequent cause of&#xD;
      disturbance of the quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHU Grenoble-Alpes has a large database (MARS Cohort) including polysomnographic&#xD;
      examinations of glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous subjects. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      characterize the sleep parameters (sleep time, sleep period, sleep stages, sleep efficiency,&#xD;
      cycles per night, micro-arousal index, etc.) in glaucomatous and non-glaucomatous subjects,&#xD;
      by controlling any possible confounding factors that can affect the quality of sleep (age,&#xD;
      biometric data, associated pathologies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will require confirming the diagnosis of glaucoma in subjects declared as such,&#xD;
      and specifying the stage of glaucomatous involvement. A current ophthalmologic examination of&#xD;
      glaucoma assessment will therefore be offered to this group of subjects (including&#xD;
      examination of the visual field and tomography of the optic nerve). This study will also&#xD;
      require verifying with certainty the absence of glaucoma in subjects in the control group. To&#xD;
      this end, a telephone questionnaire will be administered to the subjects of this group.&#xD;

        Our population is taken from the MARS database. The MARS database (Multimorbidity Apnea&#xD;
        Respiratory failure Sleep database) is a database designed by the EFCR CHU Grenoble Alpes&#xD;
        laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It consists of patients with respiratory pathology associated or not with other pathologies&#xD;
        and patients with respiratory pathology associated with several co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It is a database that has so far received all the legal authorizations required for its use&#xD;
        and scientific exploitation (CCTIRS: Request for advice N ° 15.925bis, favorable opinion&#xD;
        obtained on 03/23/2016; CNIL: Declaration of conformity to the reference methodology MR003&#xD;
        N ° 1996650v0 on 05/10/2016). This database is also managed in compliance with GDPR rules.&#xD;
