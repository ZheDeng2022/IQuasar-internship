    <measure>Change in corneal endothelial cell count</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -15 (±2) (eligibility visit), and 29 (±2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>By means of specular microscopy, endothelial cell count will take place. Density expressed in cells/mm2 will be recorded. Normal density varies according to age, but an average of 1500 - 3500 cells/mm2 (age 40 to 90) has been described.</description>

    <description>During evaluation with a slit lamp, setting the beam of light to 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm dimensions, it will be obliquely aimed to the anterior chamber. The standardized scale for anterior chamber cellularity (uveitis) will be used, according to number of observed cells: 0 (none), ½+ (1-5), 1+ (6-15), 2+ (16-25), 3+ (26-60), 4+ (&gt;60).</description>

    <description>During evaluation with a slit lamp, setting the beam of light to 0.2 mm x 0.2 mm dimensions, it will be obliquely aimed to the anterior chamber. The standardized scale for anterior chamber cellularity (uveitis) will be used: 0 (No flare), 1+ (Mild), 2+ (Moderate; iris and lens clearly visible), 3+ (Marked; slightly blurry iris and lens), 4+ (&gt;60 cells; fibrin)</description>

    <time_frame>Days: -15 (±2) (eligibility visit), 1 (first safety evaluation visit), 8 (±2) (second safety evaluation visit), and 29 (±2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>With the patient's best possible refractive correction, visual acuity will be evaluated through the Snellen chart. Its notation (fraction or decimal) is described as the distance from the chart at which the test is performed, divided by the distance at which a letter equals vertically 5 minutes of arc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Trans-surgical evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (surgery)</time_frame>
    <description>During the phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, the surgeon will evaluate the performance of the viscoelastic substance used during the procedure trough a questionnaire that will inquire on the following: Capability to maintain a formed anterior chamber during continuous circular capsulorhexis and intraocular lens implantation, retention during phacoemulsification, user-friendliness, ergonomics, ease of use during capsulorhexis, transparency during surgery and ease of use during extraction. Scale: 0 (very bad), 1 (bad), 2 (acceptable), 3 (good), 4 (very good).</description>
