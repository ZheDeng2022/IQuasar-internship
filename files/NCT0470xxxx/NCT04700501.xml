    <textblock>
      Enjoy Your Bump is an implementation study relating to antenatal maternal mental health in&#xD;
      women who have mild to moderate feelings of depression and anxiety. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      address the following research question: Is a pregnancy-specific online CBT based life skills&#xD;
      course (EYB) delivered antenatally clinically effective in improving maternal anxiety symptom&#xD;
      scores immediately post-intervention and at 12 weeks postpartum?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that a pregnancy specific on-line CBT intervention delivered&#xD;
      antenatally will improve PNMH during pregnancy and that this will be sustained at 3 months&#xD;
      post-partum with beneficial effects for mother and child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pregnancy specific online CBT tool Enjoy Your Bump (EYB) course teaches CBT-based life&#xD;
      skills to expecting mothers in a fun and low-jargon way. Participants are asked to complete 5&#xD;
      'core' modules and encouraged to take their time to learn, reflect and practice these new&#xD;
      life skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate recruiting approximately 100 women to participate in this&#xD;
      implementation study. Mental health assessments will be conducted before starting the CBT&#xD;
      programme, on completion of the programme and again at 6-12 weeks postnatal. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate an improvement in maternal mental health assessment scores in women&#xD;
      who have completed the course and the investigators hope to observe a longer term effect in&#xD;
      scores at 6-12 weeks postnatal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One in four women have mental health problems, such as feeling anxious or depressed, during&#xD;
      pregnancy and following childbirth. This not only impacts on the woman's own wellbeing but&#xD;
      can also adversely affect the physical development and mental wellbeing of her child. The&#xD;
      National Health Service (NHS) Long Term Plan aims to be able to provide better access to&#xD;
      quality psychological interventions for women with mental health problems in pregnancy. Since&#xD;
      the start of the Covid-19 outbreak in March 2020, pregnant women have been placed in a&#xD;
      vulnerable group. There have been dramatic changes to maternity services in the community and&#xD;
      hospital settings with remote midwife visits and changes to antenatal services. The normal&#xD;
      support from friends and family has been reduced due to the current social distancing&#xD;
      guidelines. This has all led to an increase in levels of stress and anxiety in the antenatal&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a unique pregnancy-specific on-line educational CBT based&#xD;
      life skills course called Enjoy Your Bump (EYB). Unlike other CBT tools currently in use,&#xD;
      this tool is specifically designed for use by pregnant women with chronic PNMH problems like&#xD;
      elevated anxiety, mild depressive symptoms or high levels of self-reported stress. It also&#xD;
      addresses specific concerns that women have during pregnancy, is the only pregnancy specific&#xD;
      on-line CBT tool available and teaches CBT-based life skills in a fun and low-jargon way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This implementation study will be open to any pregnant women in NHS Lothian who are&#xD;
      experiencing mild or moderate symptoms of anxiety or depression. All pregnant women have&#xD;
      access to an antenatal booking appointment with the community midwife following a positive&#xD;
      pregnancy test. Women receive routine antenatal appointments during other stages of pregnancy&#xD;
      and can participate in the study at any time point up to 32 weeks of pregnancy. During the&#xD;
      booking appointment women are routinely asked two mental health questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the past month has the participant often been bothered by feeling down, depressed&#xD;
           or hopeless?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the past month has the participant often been bothered by having little interest&#xD;
           or pleasure in doing things?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants answer yes to either of these questions, the midwife can direct them to the&#xD;
      online Enjoy Your Bump study website to gain further information about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about this study will also be displayed in maternity waiting rooms in hospitals&#xD;
      and on-line websites and women can self refer to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of three baseline questionnaires, the participants will be provided with&#xD;
      a link to the Enjoy Your Bump website. It can be completed using a tablet, smart phone,&#xD;
      computer or kindle and is delivered as a modular intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are asked to complete 5 'core' modules. There are additional optional modules and&#xD;
      support materials the women can access to support their journey through the programme. The&#xD;
      modules are supported by completion of 'worksheets' which can be accessed electronically. EYB&#xD;
      is unique, as it is tailored to include specific issues relevant to pregnancy. At&#xD;
      approximately 36 weeks gestation (after completion of the modules) the participants will be&#xD;
      asked to complete 3 short questionnaires either by phone or by an email link to the study&#xD;
      website. As part of routine practice all women receive a 6-12 week community follow up&#xD;
      appointment by a health care professional. During this appointment the EPDS questionnaire is&#xD;
      collected to assess postnatal mental Health.&#xD;

    <description>To determine if a pregnancy-specific online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based life skills course delivered antenatally is effective in improving short term maternal mental health scores following the CBT intervention. The GAD-7 score is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of 'not at all', 'several days', 'more than half the days', and 'nearly every day', respectively, and adding together the scores for the seven questions. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively. When used as a screening tool, further evaluation is recommended when the score is 10 or greater.</description>

    <description>To determine if a pregnancy-specific online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based life skills course delivered antenatally is effective in improving short term maternal mental health scores following the CBT intervention. Eight patient questions, each of which is scored 0 to 3, providing a 0 to 24 severity score. This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3, to the response categories of - not at all, several days, more than half the days, and nearly every day, respectively. PHQ-8 total score for the eight items ranges from 0 to 24. Scores of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent cut off points for mild, moderate, moderately severe and severe depression, respectively.</description>

    <description>To determine if a pregnancy-specific online Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) based life skills course delivered antenatally is effective in improving short term maternal mental health scores following the CBT intervention. The scale consists of 10 short statements. A mother checks off one of four possible answers that is closest to how she has felt during the past week. Responses are scored 0, 1, 2 and 3 based on the seriousness of the symptom. The total score is found by adding together the scores for each of the 10 items. None or minimal depression (0-6), Mild depression (7-13), Moderate depression (14-19), Severe depression (19-30).</description>
