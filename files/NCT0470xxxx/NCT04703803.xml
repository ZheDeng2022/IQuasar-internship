  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Palliative Care is active holistic care offered to people who are in intense suffering&#xD;
      related to their health, resulting from a serious life-threatening illness, with a focus on&#xD;
      improving the quality of life. Among the symptoms that cause suffering, physical pain has a&#xD;
      prominent role in terms of prevalence and impact on well-being, especially in the subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with terminal cancer. Myofascial Pain Syndrome may be one of the components of pain&#xD;
      in cancer patients in palliative care. However, the literature is scarce in defining the&#xD;
      prevalence of this condition in this population, and there is no evidence of the benefit of&#xD;
      needling treatment with 1% lidocaine in these patients until now. The objectives of this&#xD;
      study are to determinate the prevalence of myofascial pain syndrome and to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of myofascial pain treatment with 1% lidocaine injection in reducing pain in&#xD;
      palliative cancer patients, comparing it with a control group in usual care.&#xD;

      This is a clinical trial designed as a comparative, randomized, single-blinded intervention&#xD;
      study. Patients will be recruited from wards and radiotherapy sector of the Ribeirão Preto&#xD;
      Clinical Hospital - Ribeirão Preto Medical School, University of São Paulo (FMRP-USP).&#xD;
      Initially, patients aged 50 years or older with cancer in palliative care will be evaluated&#xD;
      to assess the prevalence of myofascial pain syndrome using Travel and Simons' diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria and for the following variables: demographic characteristics, functional status&#xD;
      (Palliative Performance Scale), pain intensity (visual analog scale and pain threshold&#xD;
      measurement with a pressure gauge), prognostic score (Palliative Prognosis Score), depression&#xD;
      and anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), quality of life (European Organization&#xD;
      for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 15 PAL) and analgesic&#xD;
      drugs in use. The participants that (1) accomplish the Travel and Simons' diagnostic criteria&#xD;
      for myofascial pain syndrome, (2) have performance status on the Karnofsky scale of 30 or&#xD;
      more, and (3) have pain intensity on visual analog scale of 5 or more will be randomized for&#xD;
      the clinical trial. The sample size calculation resulted in 15 participants for each group,&#xD;
      totaling a sample composed of 30 patients. The intervention group will be submitted to the&#xD;
      trigger point injection procedure with 1% lidocaine, and the control group will receive usual&#xD;
      care, defined as the treatment for pain prescribed by their assistant doctors. Both groups&#xD;
      will be reevaluated after 72 hours and 1 week after the procedure. In the analysis&#xD;
      statistics, chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) will be used to evaluate categorical&#xD;
      variables. For the comparison between the groups at each moment (before and after&#xD;
      intervention) will be used the linear mixed effects model. The significance level established&#xD;
      was &lt;0.05. SAS Statistical Software (version 9.3; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary , NC) will be used&#xD;
      for the analysis.&#xD;
