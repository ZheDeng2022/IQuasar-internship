    <textblock>
      Epiphora is a condition due to obstruction of lacrimal passages either proximal or distal.&#xD;
      Canalicular obstruction is a condition in which the lacrimal canaliculi are narrowed or&#xD;
      occluded. Canalicular obstructions can be anatomically classified as proximal type in which&#xD;
      the obstruction found at the initial 2-3 mm from the punctal opening while in mid canalicular&#xD;
      type obstruction at 3-8 mm from the punctum and the distal type in which a membrane of the&#xD;
      common canaliculs to the lacrimal sac. Canalicular obstruction can be acquired or congenital.&#xD;
      Acquired canalicular obstruction may result from infectious and inflammatory eyelid&#xD;
      disorders, ocular surface disease, systemic or topical medications, irradation, iatrogenic,&#xD;
      intrinsic cannalicular tumors and trauma. The correct chioce of the techinque for given&#xD;
      canalicular obstruction and therefore the long-term success depends on the site and degree of&#xD;
      the obstruction, incomplete obstruction or stenosis can be treated with canalicular stenting.&#xD;
      Proximal and mid canalicular obstructions need reconstruction by excising the focal&#xD;
      canaliculus obstruction near the punctum and the cut ends of the canaliculus can be&#xD;
      anastomosed over a stent. Dacryocystorhinostomy with retrograde intubation of the lacrimal&#xD;
      system has shown some success may avoid the need for a Jones tube. Patients with symptomatic&#xD;
      distal canalicular obstruction should undergo timely insertion of a bicanalicular silicon&#xD;
      stent to prevent permanent and complete closure of the canaliculi. There are several&#xD;
      modalities of canalicular intubation for the patients with distal canalicular obstruction. In&#xD;
      patients with nasolacrimal duct and canalicular obstruction ,preferred procedures include&#xD;
      dacryocystorhinstomy with bicanalicular or monocanalicular intubation .However,in patients&#xD;
      with canalicular obstruction without nasolacrimal duct obstruction use bicanalicuar silicone&#xD;
      intubation. In 2014 P.Bige' designed self-retaining bicanaliculs intubation setII(SRSII)&#xD;
      which is the latest innovation in the field as these silicone stent segments traverse both&#xD;
      canaliculi till the lacrimal sac. In which each end of this semicircular device has 2 stout&#xD;
      angulated wings/flanges which pose no resistance while proceeding forward into the&#xD;
      canaliculus, but once they get into open cavity (lacrimal sac), the flanges open up and give&#xD;
      resistance to their removal against the common canalicular opening.&#xD;
