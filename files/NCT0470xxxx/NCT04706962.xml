      Open label first-in-human study of TH1902 in solid cancer, with 2 sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (dose escalation): patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors (all comers) that&#xD;
      have relapsed or are refractory to standard chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and for&#xD;
      which no known effective therapies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (expansion): selected patient populations with recurrent advanced TNBC, gynecological&#xD;
      cancer (epithelial ovarian or endometrial cancer), colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      that have relapsed or are refractory to standard chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy,&#xD;
      and for which no known effective therapies exist.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This first-in-human study is designed as a multi-center, open-label, with 2 sequential parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (dose escalation): will comprise patients with recurrent advanced solid tumors (all&#xD;
      comers) that have relapsed or are refractory to standard chemotherapy, surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy, and for which no known effective therapies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (expansion): will comprise selected patient populations with recurrent advanced TNBC,&#xD;
      gynecological cancer (epithelial ovarian or endometrial cancer), colorectal cancer and&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer that have relapsed or are refractory to standard chemotherapy, surgery,&#xD;
      radiation therapy, and for which no known effective therapies exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK profiles of TH1902 and free docetaxel will be evaluated for all patients in Parts 1&#xD;
      and 2. Once the MTD has been reached in Part 1, patients with TNBC, gynecological cancer&#xD;
      (epithelial ovarian or endometrial cancer), colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer (10&#xD;
      patients per cancer type) will be enrolled in Part 2 and treated at the MTD or RP2D to&#xD;
      further assess the safety and tolerability of TH1902. The preliminary anti-tumor activity of&#xD;
      TH1902 will be evaluated for all patients as per the response evaluation criteria in solid&#xD;
      tumors (RECIST 1.1; Eisenhauer, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a modified rapid dose-escalation design as described by Simon et al.&#xD;
      (1997). A starting dose of 30 mg/m2 is proposed based on the available data for TH1902 and&#xD;
      the known safety profile of docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation by dose-doubling will be done for the first 2 dose levels, followed by a&#xD;
      modified Fibonacci dose escalation scheme (i.e. dose increases of 67%, 50%, 40% and 33%)&#xD;
      thereafter for each dose level. Patients in Part 1 will be observed for 21 days post Cycle 1&#xD;
      Day 1 drug administration for dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation to the next dose&#xD;
      level will proceed following satisfactory review of safety data until the MTD is reached. The&#xD;
      MTD is defined as that dose-level at which ≤1 of 6 patients in a cohort develop an emergent&#xD;
      DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been defined, patients with TNBC, gynecological cancer (epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      or endometrial cancer) colorectal cancer and pancreatic cancer may be treated at the MTD or&#xD;
      Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D), to further assess the safety and tolerability of TH1902, and&#xD;
      the preliminary anti-tumor activity of TH1902.&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Patients with HIV/HBV/HBC will not be excluded from entry into the study provided the&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Patients with HIV infection must have CD4+ T-cell (CD4+) counts ≥ 350 cells/µL.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The following eligibility criteria are for patients with evidence of chronic HBV&#xD;
                  infection or patients with history of chronic HCV or who are virologically&#xD;
                  suppressed on HCV treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Liver-related laboratory eligibility criteria should be the same as that for&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Exceptions: AST/ALT and bilirubin criteria may be less stringent in patients&#xD;
                       with cancers such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma in whom&#xD;
                       hepatic function based on Child-Pugh score should be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with chronic HBV infection with active disease who meet the&#xD;
                       criteria for anti HBV therapy should be on a suppressive antiviral therapy&#xD;
                       prior to initiation of cancer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients on concurrent HCV treatments must have HCV below the limit of&#xD;
                       quantification.&#xD;

                       patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation, and the investigational&#xD;
                       cancer treatment is not expected to exacerbate the HCV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients with chronic HBV infection with active disease who meet the criteria for&#xD;
                  anti HBV therapy should be on a suppressive antiviral therapy prior to initiation&#xD;
                  of cancer therapy.&#xD;

               -  Patients with a history of HCV infection should have completed curative antiviral&#xD;
                  treatment and HCV viral load must be below the limit of quantification. For&#xD;
                  incurable cancers, patients with untreated HCV may be enrolled if the HCV is&#xD;
                  stable, the patient is not at risk for hepatic decompensation, and the&#xD;
                  investigational cancer treatment is not expected to exacerbate the HCV infection.&#xD;
