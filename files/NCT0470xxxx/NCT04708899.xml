      Rehabilitation of dyslexic children with (cental) auditory processing disorder.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Central Auditory Processing Disorder(C)APD is defined as difficulty for children with normal&#xD;
      hearing to listen selectively in the presence of noise, to combine information from two ears&#xD;
      properly, to process speech when it is slightly degraded, and to integrate auditory&#xD;
      information when it is delivered faster than the individual with (C)APD can process.( The&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of (C)APD in the school-aged population is approximately 2 to 5 %, and&#xD;
      the estimated prevalence of (C)APD in the older adult population is 76 %. These percentages&#xD;
      are higher than those affected by hearing loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyslexia and (C)APD are common comorbidities and since there is limited research on (C)APD&#xD;
      within each related academic discipline. Furthermore the language, audiologiological , and&#xD;
      cognitive nature of the disorder confirmed that a multi-disciplinary effort is needed in&#xD;
      order to provide clinical decision and effective intervention for the (C)APD population.&#xD;
      Hence Development of additional intervention tools for use in clinics, schools and home&#xD;
      settings is warranted .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to develop a novel Arabic (C)APD remediation program ,to study the&#xD;
      outcome of the program and to validate it's effectiveness by comparing it to the Arabic&#xD;
      computer based auditory training(CBAT) program.&#xD;
