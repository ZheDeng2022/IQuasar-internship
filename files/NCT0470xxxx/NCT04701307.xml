  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of niraparib and dostarlimab in treating small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer and other high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas. Niraparib is an inhibitor of&#xD;
      PARP, an enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged.&#xD;
      Blocking PARP may help keep cancer cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to&#xD;
      die. PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as dostarlimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving niraparib and&#xD;
      dostarlimab may help to control the diseases.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine objective response rate (ORR) and 6-month progression free survival (PFS) in&#xD;
      response to combined niraparib plus dostarlimab in patients with recurrent small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (SCLC) and high-grade neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate toxicity of combined niraparib plus dostarlimab (PARP inhibition plus&#xD;
      anti-PD-1) in patients with recurrent SCLC and other high-grade NECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine overall survival (OS), PFS, disease control rate (response plus stable&#xD;
      disease &gt; 12 weeks) to combined niraparib plus dostarlimab in patients with recurrent SCLC&#xD;
      and other high-grade NECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine treatment-related changes in immune profiles or other biomarker in response&#xD;
      to combined niraparib plus dostarlimab in patients with recurrent SCLC and other high-grade&#xD;
      NECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive niraparib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of cycles 1-4, and on&#xD;
      days 1-42 of subsequent cycles. Patients also receive dostarlimab intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for cycles 1-4 and every 42 days for subsequent&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 90 days, every 6 months&#xD;
      for 2 years, then annually for 3 years.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Time from the start of study treatment to the earlier date of assessment of progression or death by any cause in the absence of progression, assessed at 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the number (or fraction) of patients who are alive without evidence of progression at 6 months from initiation of therapy. Progression will be assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version (v.)1.1 criteria using investigator's review.

Quartiles (i.e. 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile) and associated two-sided 95% confidence intervals will be provided. Estimates of PFS at 6-months will be estimated from Kaplan-Meier survival curve.</description>
