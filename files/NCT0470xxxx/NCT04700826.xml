    <textblock>
      The DaRe2 approach (healthcare Data for pragmatic clinical Research in the NHS - primary 2&#xD;
      secondary) is designed to operationalise efficient, nationwide, primary care approaches for&#xD;
      randomised trials embedded within the UK National Health Service (NHS), providing automated&#xD;
      screening, targeted patient enrolment and 'no-visit' follow-up through innovations in big&#xD;
      data and technology solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DaRe2THINK will be the first exemplar of this system, and is appropriately focused on the&#xD;
      intersection of key national priorities for healthcare; atrial fibrillation (a heart rhythm&#xD;
      condition that will double in prevalence in the next few decades) and the impact this&#xD;
      condition has on stroke, thromboembolic events, cognitive impairment and vascular dementia.&#xD;
      The trial will test the hypothesis that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), now commonly used&#xD;
      in older patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), are effective and cost-effective at reducing&#xD;
      major adverse clinical events in younger patients at low or intermediate risk of stroke, and&#xD;
      can reduce the high rate of cognitive decline. The health technology innovations noted above&#xD;
      will allow the investigators to answer this important clinical question, as well as&#xD;
      demonstrate the capacity and potential of this system for future, large-scale&#xD;
      healthcare-embedded clinical trials for patient benefit.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Designed with a Patient and Public Involvement Team, DaRe2THINK is an individual-patient,&#xD;
      open-label, event-driven randomised trial with 1:1 allocation to DOAC or no additional&#xD;
      therapy (usual care). Automated screening will occur of over 12 million patients in England,&#xD;
      with targeted recruitment to practices with eligible patients, regular updates to General&#xD;
      Practitioners, simple processes for centre inclusion and patient randomisation, remote&#xD;
      e-consent and no additional visits for any patient. The primary outcome is a comprehensive&#xD;
      composite of any thromboembolic event, ascertained entirely using electronic healthcare&#xD;
      records within both primary and secondary NHS care across the nation. All endpoint data will&#xD;
      follow a pre-published coding manual for extracted electronic healthcare data. The key&#xD;
      secondary outcome is the change in patient-reported cognitive function, using remote&#xD;
      technology solutions to save time for clinical staff and patients. DaRe2THINK will carefully&#xD;
      assess and validate safety outcomes relating to major and minor bleeding. A systematic health&#xD;
      economic analysis will determine NHS and societal cost-effectiveness of DOAC therapy in this&#xD;
      younger population of patients with AF. DaRe2THINK will initially run over a 5-year period&#xD;
      (outcomes as listed below), with longer-term outcomes (in particular cardiovascular death,&#xD;
      cognitive function and vascular dementia) reassessed at 10 years.&#xD;
