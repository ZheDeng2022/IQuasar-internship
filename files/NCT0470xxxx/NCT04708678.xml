  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A classic distinction is made between internal and external hemorrhoidal pathology. External&#xD;
      hemorrhoids can present with thrombosis, which causes painful swelling; internal hemorrhoids&#xD;
      by rectal bleeding, prolapse, and more rarely thrombosis. Hemorrhoidal pathology is one of&#xD;
      the most frequent reasons for consultation in proctology. Its prevalence is probably&#xD;
      underestimated due to taboos and the frequent self-medication of patients, but it is&#xD;
      considered high in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic management of internal or external hemorrhoidal pathology is primarily based&#xD;
      on hygiene and dietetic measures and regularization of transit. In the case of external&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal pathology, treatment may also include Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs&#xD;
      (NSAIDs) and topical treatment (anesthetic or topical corticosteroid). For internal&#xD;
      hemorrhoidal pathology, when these measures are insufficient or when prolapse is present from&#xD;
      the outset, instrumental treatment can be offered, allowing the bleeding and / or prolapse to&#xD;
      be treated up to grade 3 maximum. This treatment includes sclerosis (less and less&#xD;
      practiced), infrared photocoagulation and rubber band ligation. In 10 to 20% of cases, when&#xD;
      the prolapse is irreducible, there is anemia of hemorrhoidal origin or the symptoms persist&#xD;
      despite well-conducted treatment, surgical treatment may be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reference surgical technique in France and in Europe is tripedicular hemorrhoidectomy&#xD;
      according to the Milligan and Morgan technique, developed at Saint Marks Hospital in London,&#xD;
      first published in 1937. It has the advantage of to be the most effective technique, with a&#xD;
      low rate of postoperative recurrence and treats both internal and external hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      pathology. However, the postoperative period is painful, requires local care and requires&#xD;
      cessation of activity for several weeks. On the other hand, there is a risk of potentially&#xD;
      serious complications and permanent sequelae: acute retention of urine (2.1-15%), hemorrhage&#xD;
      (0.6-5.4%), anal stenosis (6%) , infection (0.5-5%) and anal incontinence (0-6%). Patient&#xD;
      selection is essential and contraindicates hemorrhoidectomy in cases of anal incontinence,&#xD;
      active suppuration, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, anal intercourse or a history of&#xD;
      pelvic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to hemorrhoidectomy, and its painful and restrictive consequences, new&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgical techniques that have proven their effectiveness in the treatment&#xD;
      of internal hemorrhoidal pathology have emerged over the past twenty years. The two main ones&#xD;
      are Longo circular stapling hemorrhoidopexy and Doppler-controlled arterial ligations with&#xD;
      mucopexy. Several studies have shown that Longo's hemorrhoidopexy causes less postoperative&#xD;
      pain and allows a faster return to activity than after a tripedicular hemorrhoidectomy. On&#xD;
      the other hand, the rate of recurrence of hemorrhoidal pathology was higher. This rate was&#xD;
      41% at 12 years and 47.5% at 15 years. In addition, specific and severe complications have&#xD;
      been described as rectal perforations, rectovaginal fistulas, perirectal hematomas, pelvic&#xD;
      cellulitis, peritonitis and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several comparative studies have shown that arterial ligation under Doppler control with&#xD;
      mucopexy was less painful postoperatively than hemorrhoidopexy by circular stapling and that&#xD;
      the short- and medium-term efficacy was generally similar. In addition, the postoperative&#xD;
      consequences of arterial ligatures under Doppler control with mucopexy seem harmless, with&#xD;
      none of the major complications described after stapled hemorrhoidopexy. For these reasons,&#xD;
      arterial ligation is now tending to replace hemorrhoidopexy with circular stapling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to assess the rate of recurrence of long-term hemorrhoidal&#xD;
      pathology in patients who have had arterial ligatures under Doppler control with mucopexy at&#xD;
      our center. The results will help guide the practitioner and the patient in the choice of&#xD;
      surgical treatment.&#xD;
