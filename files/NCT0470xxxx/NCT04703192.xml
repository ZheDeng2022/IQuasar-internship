      This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of valemetostat tosylate&#xD;
      monotherapy. The primary objective will evaluate objective response rate of valemetostat&#xD;
      tosylate monotherapy as measured by blinded independent central review (BICR) in&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma, including relapsed/refractory adult T-cell&#xD;
      leukemia/lymphoma participants.&#xD;

    <description>For the relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) cohort, objective response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of participants with a best overall response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR), among participants with centrally confirmed PTCL eligible histology.
