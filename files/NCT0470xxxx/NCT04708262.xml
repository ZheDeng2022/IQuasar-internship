  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), the term used for when somebody purposefully hurts&#xD;
      themselves without intending to end their life. Often, it suggests that there are other&#xD;
      difficulties going on in someone's life. Talking therapies can be offered to help however&#xD;
      currently there is little evidence to show which therapies help most. CATCH-Y (Cognitive&#xD;
      Analytic Therapy for Containing Self-Harm in Young People) is a brief talking therapy which&#xD;
      has been created to support young people who self-injure. It aims to help young people and&#xD;
      those around them build to a shared understanding of their difficulties. Previously a group&#xD;
      of adults, who have a history of self-harm, have engaged in a trial version of CATCH-Y for&#xD;
      adults, in which it was found to be positive, safe and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to recruit nine young people who have self-injured in the past.&#xD;
      Participants must be aged between 13 - 17 years old and have self-injured within the last six&#xD;
      months. They will be recruited from local Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS)&#xD;
      and associated 3rd sector organisations. The therapy is five sessions long, with two&#xD;
      assessment sessions before the therapy begins and one assessment session post-therapy. Online&#xD;
      assessments will be completed throughout. CATCH-Y involves working with the therapist to&#xD;
      understand a young person's past and current experiences, linked to their self-injurious&#xD;
      behaviours. This individualised approach could benefit these young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a novel treatment, and in accordance with the medical research council (MRC) framework,&#xD;
      the feasibility and acceptability of CATCH-Y should be considered before progressing to a&#xD;
      larger trial. This trial will examine the feasibility and acceptability of the CATCH-Y&#xD;
      intervention through attendance and retention rates, data completion and intervention&#xD;
      acceptability. As a secondary measure, the trial will investigate whether CATCH-Y shows&#xD;
      preliminary evidence for positive change.&#xD;

    <measure>Repertory Grid</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Repertory grids: The repertory grid will be used to explore changes in participants' perceptions of the self, others and their experiences of NSSI. Participants will be asked to complete them prior to, and following, completion of CATCH-Y. This assessment will be completed as a structured interview, with one of the researchers talking through and explaining each step. The repertory grids will be developed following established techniques (Jankowicz, 2003). Previously repertory grids have been used with adolescents (Sewell, 2020). These measures will be used pre and post intervention.</description>

    <measure>Motivation for Youth Treatment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Motivation for Youth Treatment Scale. This evaluates motivation to change and desire to find solutions to difficulties in youths and their caregivers. A psychometric evaluation of this scale conducted with young people aged 11-18 found it to be a reliable tool for assessing important dimensions of intrinsic treatment motivation (Breda &amp; Riemer, 2012). This measure will be assessed online using select survey, pre and post intervention. The minimum score is 1, the maximum score is 40. Higher scores mean a better outcome (improved motivation).</description>

    <measure>Recovery Questionnaire</measure>

    <description>Recovery Questionnaire. Examines recovery of functionality and outlook post-treatment. An evaluation of the psychometric properties of the Recovery Questionnaire with 65 young people showed good internal consistency and test-retest reliability (Bentley, Bucci &amp; Hartley, 2019). This measure will be assessed online using select survey, pre and post intervention. The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 93. Higher scores mean a better outcome (improved recovery).</description>

    <time_frame>up to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Alexian Brothers Urges to Self-injure scale (ABUSI): A measure to assess the frequency, intensity and duration of the urge to self-injure. The ABUSI has shown good internal consistency and reliability (Chavez-Flores et al., 2019). In addition, a recent study found that the ABUSI provided valid information in a population of students who self-injured (Dimitrova, Radkova, Stoyanov &amp; Petrov, 2020). This measure will be assessed online using select survey, pre, post and weekly during the intervention. It will also be assessed for four weeks post-intervention. Summed scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater urges (poorer outcome).</description>

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire for Adolescents (PHQ-9A): Low mood clinical evaluation. An examination of the PHQ-9A completed by 442 young people, showed positive validity of the measure (Richardson et al., 2010). This measure will be assessed online using select survey, pre, post and weekly during the intervention. It will also be assessed for four weeks post-intervention. Summed scores range from 0 to 27 with higher scores indicating lower mood (poorer outcome).</description>
