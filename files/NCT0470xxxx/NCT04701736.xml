    <textblock>
      Determine if an oncology pictorial medication calendar will improve patient adherence to&#xD;
      oncology supportive care medication regimens for adult patients receiving adjuvant or&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy treatment for cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Objective: In order to evaluate the impact of such an approach on adherence, a&#xD;
      prospective, open-label, randomized controlled pilot trial (RCT) was carried out to determine&#xD;
      if a picture-based medication calendar would improve patient adherence to antiemetic&#xD;
      medication regimens for adult patients receiving chemotherapy treatment for solid organ tumor&#xD;
      origins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives were: 1) to assess medication use and self-efficacy parameters, 2)&#xD;
      to determine patient comfort with antiemetic regimen prescribed along with chemotherapy and&#xD;
      3) to determine patient satisfaction with the calendar study tool.&#xD;

    <measure>Medication Adherence to Prescribed Antiemetics</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Adherence is quantified as the number of doses taken of a prescribed agent divided by the number of doses prescribed, expressed as a percentage. Pill counts were utilized to calculate the number of missed doses or pills taken as a percentage of the total number prescribed and dispensed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Understanding and Satisfaction Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The participant survey conducted at end of study was investigator-created and asked questions regarding demographics and medication taking behaviors. Questions specifically related to the calendar for those in the intervention arm were also asked. Questions regarding satisfaction with the calendar as well as complexity of medication regimen for oncologic treatment were assessed using a 5-point Likert scale.</description>

    <measure>Medication Use and Self-Efficacy (MUSE) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
