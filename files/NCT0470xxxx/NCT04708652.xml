  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results will provide insightful information to understand the process of neural&#xD;
      development and the predictive value of early cerebral blood flow measures on longitudinal&#xD;
      neurodevelopment and handedness outcomes in preterm and term adolescents. The findings also&#xD;
      contribute to the understanding of effectiveness of early intervention on long-term&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm children at adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study has three hypotheses as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The preterm intervention group have higher neuromotor scores, lower behavioral problem&#xD;
           scores and higher incidence of right-handedness than the preterm control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The preterm intervention group have comparable neuromotor scores, behavioral problem&#xD;
           scores and incidence of right-handedness than the term adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The neonatal cerebral blood flow velocity asymmetry measures are significantly&#xD;
           associated with the infant, preschool, school and adolescent neurodevelopment and&#xD;
           handedness outcomes in preterm children with very low birth weight and term children.&#xD;

      The term and preterm children have previously been administered Cranial Doppler Ultrasound&#xD;
      and neurobehavioral assessment at term age, and neurodevelopmental assessment in the neonatal&#xD;
      period, infancy, preschool and school age (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler&#xD;
      Development-3rd edition, Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd Edition, Child Behavior&#xD;
      Check List/4-18, Wechsler Pre-School and Primary Scales of Intelligence-Revised, and&#xD;
      Developmental Test of Visual-Motor Integration - 6th Edition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All families will be contacted via phone call and mail to participate in this study. Children&#xD;
      and their parents will be examined for child neuromotor development, handedness and behavior&#xD;
      when the children reach 12-14 years of age. All measures will be conducted at the Infant&#xD;
      Motor Development Laboratory, School of Physical Therapy, National Taiwan University. The&#xD;
      outcome measures in this study will consist of the growth (weight and height), neuromotor&#xD;
      function (Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2nd Edition), handedness (Edinburgh&#xD;
      Handedness Inventory) and behavior (child report and parent report of Child Behavior Check&#xD;
      List for Ages 4-18 Years).&#xD;

        This study extends our previous intervention research. The current study will recruit them&#xD;
        for a follow up of their neuromotor development, handedness and behavior outcome after&#xD;
        entering junior high school at 12-14 years of age. Our previous intervention study enrolled&#xD;
        178 VLBW preterm children and 62 term children who were born or admitted at the National&#xD;
        Taiwan University Hospital, the Mackay Memorial Hospital and Taipei City Hospital, Branch&#xD;
        for Women and Children in Taipei, Taiwan, during the time period of 2006 to 2008.&#xD;
