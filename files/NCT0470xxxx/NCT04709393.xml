  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fragility fractures are a major threat to functional independence in older adults locally&#xD;
      and globally. In Hong Kong, the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia in people aged &gt;50&#xD;
      years were reported to be as high as 37% and 52%, respectively. The major challenge in&#xD;
      fragility fracture prevention is that fragility fracture is caused by the combination of&#xD;
      osteoporosis and propensity to fall, and both of these conditions are multifactorial. Ample&#xD;
      evidence shows that fall risks can be reduced by well-designed exercises, and osteoporosis&#xD;
      can be effectively diagnosed by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry imaging (DXA) and treated&#xD;
      with anti-osteoporosis medication. Lifestyle modifications e.g. diet, optimal physical&#xD;
      activity, environmental safety can also help to prevent falls or improve bone health. The&#xD;
      brief Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) and SARC-F provide a low cost of prescreening for&#xD;
      fracture risk and sarcopenia, respectively. Using SARC-F in conjunction with FRAX has&#xD;
      increased sensitivity for hip fracture risk prediction. FRAX+SARC-F may help increase the&#xD;
      public awareness of osteoporosis and get the at-risk group to receive diagnostic tests and be&#xD;
      treated. This model should fit in well with the coming District Health Centres across Hong&#xD;
      Kong.&#xD;

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either the pre-screening or control group in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Independent personnel not involved in data collection or intervention will perform and&#xD;
      conceal the randomization using an online data server. Research assistants who are blinded to&#xD;
      the group allocation will conduct all the baseline assessments and subsequent event&#xD;
      surveillance. All data will also be entered and checked by the blinded research assistants.&#xD;
      All procedures concur with the Declaration of Helsinki (2013).&#xD;
