  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies worldwide and is&#xD;
      commonly treated with transarterial locoregional therapies (transarterial chemoembolization&#xD;
      (TACE) or transarterial radioembolization (TARE)). Early assessment of the effectiveness of&#xD;
      transarterial locoregional therapies is critical for treatment planning and early&#xD;
      identification of non-responders to allow a timely repeat treatment or conversion to a&#xD;
      second-line local-regional or systemic treatment. Response of HCC to transarterial&#xD;
      locoregional therapies is usually assessed by changes in tumor contrast material enhancement&#xD;
      thought to reflect tumor viability. However, contrast material enhancement may not always&#xD;
      accurately indicate tumor response as it may also reflect reactive changes rather than&#xD;
      residual tumor tissue. A potential alternative for evaluation of the residual tumor is&#xD;
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which can differentiate between tumor tissue with high&#xD;
      cellularity and tumor necrosis. DWI has been shown useful in therapy response assessment of&#xD;
      liver tumors. A further development of DWI is intravoxel incoherent motion imaging (IVIM), an&#xD;
      MRI technique which also takes tumor perfusion and thus tumor viability into account. This&#xD;
      makes IVIM a promising tool for early therapy response assessment in HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to proof that DWI and especially IVIM with its inherent perfusion&#xD;
      information related to tumor neovascularization allows for reliable and quantitative&#xD;
      monitoring of tumor response and separating responders from non-responders to either of the&#xD;
      two locoregional treatments (TACE or TARE) The secondary objective is to identify whether&#xD;
      DWI/IVIM acquired during early follow-up (1 month after treatment) leads to better response&#xD;
      assessment than DWI/IVIM acquired during later follow-up (3 months after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the DWI/IVIM values in patients responding to transarterial&#xD;
      locoregional therapies of HCC compared to patients not responding to therapy according to&#xD;
      mRECIST at 6 months The secondary outcome will be the number of patients correctly identified&#xD;
      as responders at early follow-up (after 1 month) with DWI/IVIM compared to the number of&#xD;
      patients correctly identified as resopnders at later follow-up (after 3 months).&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    Treatment practice unexpectedly changed during the course of the study. Majority of follow-up&#xD;
    MRI performed in external institutions. Consequently, the planned number of participants could&#xD;
