  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will undergo surgical excision of OSSN at baseline and will be followed at 1&#xD;
      week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for post-surgical follow up. This study is being&#xD;
      conduced to assess the feasibility of conducting multi-center prospective studies on surgical&#xD;
      excision of suspected OSSN lesions in SSA in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).&#xD;
      Participants include those with HIV infection and with suspected non-invasive OSSN lesions&#xD;
      that the AMC-certified ophthalmologist determines can be resected with 3 mm clinical margins,&#xD;
      sparing involvement of the superior and inferior fornices and 6 clock hours of the corneal&#xD;
      scleral limbus.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AMC-certified ophthalmologist will obtain a thorough eye history and conduct a slit-lamp&#xD;
      examination of both eyes. The AMC-certified ophthalmologist will draw the size and shape of&#xD;
      the suspected lesion on a well-accepted template designed for documentation of ocular surface&#xD;
      malignancies. Using this template, the AMC-certified ophthalmologist will document the number&#xD;
      of clock hours of corneal-scleral limbus involved (6 clock hours maximum) as well as the&#xD;
      maximum vertical and horizontal dimensions of the lesion in mm as determined through the use&#xD;
      of the adjustable slit beam, whose length can be adjusted and determined using the slit&#xD;
      length display window, a standard feature of slit lamp biomicroscopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty-four participants undergoing surgical excision of tumors suspicious for OSSN will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. Participants who do not complete the study follow-up visits will not&#xD;
      be replaced. The lesions will be swabbed prior to surgical excision and the swabs will be&#xD;
      placed in PrimeStore MTM solution, for HPV DNA testing. The suspected OSSN lesion will be&#xD;
      excised with 3 mm margins as determined by clinical exam. The PrimeStore MTM solution will be&#xD;
      sent to Stellenbosch University in Cape Town, South Africa for HPV testing. The surgically&#xD;
      excised lesions will be fixed, aligned, embedded in paraffin, sectioned and evaluated by&#xD;
      pathologists at each of the 4 study sites. Tissue will then be sent to Stellenbosch&#xD;
      University in Cape Town, South Africa for confirmatory histopathologic analysis and HPV&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure reliable follow-up, we will collect detailed contact and alternate contact&#xD;
      information from study participants. Participants will be asked to return for follow-up one&#xD;
      week after surgery, 6 weeks after surgery, 6 months after surgery, and 12 months after&#xD;
      surgery. At each of these follow-up visits, the AMC-certified ophthalmologist will obtain a&#xD;
      thorough medical history and perform a slit-lamp examination of the eyes. At week 2, sites&#xD;
      will contact participants via phone to review AEs. Participants will undergo a structured&#xD;
      review of post-surgical signs and symptoms at each follow-up visit. Participants presenting&#xD;
      with a suspected recurrent OSSN lesion at follow-up will undergo re-excision per routine&#xD;
      clinical care, including any follow-up per the local standard of care. After local diagnostic&#xD;
      review, excised specimens will be sent for central histopathology evaluation and confirmation&#xD;
      of recurrent OSSN or not recurrent OSSN. All other ocular lesions and conditions will be&#xD;
      referred for routine medical care, outside of the study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Using an exact binomial one-sample test for proportions, 90% power and one-sided 0.0167 significance level (0.05/3 = 0.0167), the number of study participants required to test the hypotheses shown above, respectively, are 28, 28 and 68. Thus, this study will require 68 evaluable participants using a one-sample test of proportions. We define evaluable as participants with suspected OSSN lesions who are shown to have OSSN on biopsy. We estimate that 20% of participants will be found to have lesions that are histopathologically not OSSN and will therefore, not be evaluable. As a result, we are recruiting 84 individuals (21 per clinical site) to get 68 evaluable participants.</intervention_model_description>

As part of the study patients will be asked to return for follow-up evaluation 1 week, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. At each of these follow-up visits, the AMC-certified ophthalmologist will obtain a thorough ocular history as well as a history of AIDS-defining illnesses and perform a slit-lamp examination of both eyes, complete with templated drawings of the conjunctiva, and careful examination of the cornea for limbal stem cell deficiency.</description>

             AMC-certified ophthalmologist determines can be resected with 3 mm clinical margins,&#xD;
             sparing involvement of the superior and inferior fornices as well as 6 clock hours of&#xD;
             the corneal scleral limbus. This assessment must be carried out within 4 weeks before&#xD;
             surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  3.2.2 HIV positive. Documentation of HIV-1 infection by means of any one of the&#xD;
                  following:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Documentation of receipt of ART by a licensed health care provider&#xD;
                       (Documentation may be a record of an ART prescription in the participant's&#xD;
                       medical record, a written prescription in the name of the participant for&#xD;
                       ART, or pill bottles for ART with a label showing the participant's name.&#xD;
                       Antiretroviral drug regimens used for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may&#xD;
                       not satisfy this requirement.;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  HIV-1 RNA detection by a licensed HIV-1 RNA assay demonstrating &gt;1000 RNA&#xD;
                       copies/mL confirmed by a licensed screening antibody and/or HIV&#xD;
                       antibody/antigen combination assay;&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Any licensed HIV screening antibody and/or HIV antibody/antigen combination&#xD;
                       assay confirmed by a second licensed HIV assay such as a HIV-1 Western blot&#xD;
