  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with monoclonal gammopathies either benign or malignant may develop inflammatory&#xD;
      symptoms such as Schnitzler syndrome. We proposed to name those cases as monoclonal&#xD;
      gammopathy of inflammatory significance, or MGIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to search for inflammatory pathway that may be activated in case MGIS&#xD;
      and to search if the genetic of tumoral cell could explain those activations.&#xD;

      Auto-inflammatory Diseases (AIDs) are defined by disorders of the innate immunity. They&#xD;
      manifest themselves as episodes of inflammation associated with general signs and organ&#xD;
      damage, mainly to the cutaneous, musculoskeletal and digestive systems. The majority of&#xD;
      monogenic AIDs described to date begin in childhood. Aside from impaired quality of life, and&#xD;
      disease-related organ damage (e.g. deafness in periodic cryopyrin-associated syndromes), the&#xD;
      most severe complication of AIDs is inflammatory amyloidosis (AA), which can lead to kidney&#xD;
      failure and dialysis. More recently, late-onset AIDs have been described, secondary to&#xD;
      somatic mutations in auto-inflammatory genes, mainly NLRP3 (1). This discovery comes in a&#xD;
      more general context of highlighting new forms of late-onset genetic diseases linked to&#xD;
      somatic mutations. These discoveries have been made possible by the revolution in sequencing&#xD;
      techniques and in particular by the new generation sequencing which allows a more in-depth&#xD;
      analysis compared to Sanger's technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood neoplasms, known as clonal hemopathies, whether myeloid (such as myelodysplastic&#xD;
      syndrome) or lymphoid (such as multiple myeloma), are constantly increasing in the general&#xD;
      population. They are associated with an accumulation of somatic gene mutations that confer&#xD;
      survival and proliferation properties to tumor cells (2). A number of manifestations of these&#xD;
      clonal hemopathies are related to the activation of inflammatory pathways and in particular&#xD;
      the activation of an inflammasome. For example, it has been shown that pyroptosis via&#xD;
      activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome could be one of the pathophysiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes (3). In addition, inflammatory cytokines such as IL1 and IL6 have&#xD;
      been shown to play a role as growth factors in these hemopathies (4). However, the mechanisms&#xD;
      behind the activation of the inflammasome and the production of those cytokines are currently&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of patients with clonal hemopathies develop symptoms and complications similar to&#xD;
      those encountered during AIDs. In particular, within the reference center for&#xD;
      autoinflammatory diseases and amyloidosis in adults, we have identified patients with&#xD;
      myelodysplastic syndromes or clonal gammopathies complicated by autoinflammatory symptoms or&#xD;
      AA amyloidosis. These manifestations in the context of clonal hemopathies could be called&#xD;
      &quot;hyperinflammatory hemopathies &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the inflammatory manifestations occurring in these patients are&#xD;
      secondary to the occurrence of somatic mutations in genes known to be involved in innate&#xD;
      immunity and AIDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main objective is to perform in patients with hyperinflammatory hemopathy a functional&#xD;
      study in search of the activation of inflammatory pathways; then a parallel genomic and&#xD;
      transcriptomic study using an innovative methodology (5), in order to investigate whether&#xD;
      there are somatic mutations of innate immunity genes in a clonal subpopulation and their&#xD;
      impact on gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step will be to identify the inflammatory signature of mononuclear blood cells from&#xD;
      patients. To do this, we will recover the cells from blood and bone marrow. Real-time&#xD;
      quantitative ELISA (Enzyme Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) and PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction)&#xD;
      experiments will quantify the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. In addition, flow&#xD;
      cytometry experiments with membrane and intracellular co-labelling will be performed. These&#xD;
      experiments, performed routinely in the laboratory, will make it possible to identify the&#xD;
      cell type responsible for the overproduction of cytokines that may explain the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step, truly innovative and involving state-of-the-art techniques, will consist in&#xD;
      carrying out genomic and transcriptomic analysis of tumor cells. For this we will use methods&#xD;
      known as &quot;single cell analysis&quot; with parallel sequencing of the genome and transcriptome. The&#xD;
      aim of genomic analysis is to search for somatic mutations present in tumor cells, and to&#xD;
      compare them with those known to be associated with AIDs (comparison with the European&#xD;
      Infevers database in particular. The genomic results will also be compared with international&#xD;
      cancer cell databases to look for mutations in tumor cells that could explain this clinical&#xD;
      presentation. These Big Data studies are necessary in view of the high number of mutations&#xD;
      expected in tumor cells. The association with the parallel transcriptomic study will allow an&#xD;
      unsupervised clustering analysis to study the effect of somatic mutations on gene expression.&#xD;
      Indeed, it is currently recognized that the consequences of a genetic mutation must be&#xD;
      analyzed both by its effect on the protein structure, but also by its effect on epigenetics.&#xD;
      Today, this type of analysis is possible using the artificial intelligence analysis method.&#xD;
