  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WE-TRUST study is a multi-center randomized clinical trial to assess the impact of a&#xD;
      Direct to Angio Suite (DTAS) workflow on stroke patient outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes for stroke patients are closely tied to how fast they receive treatment. Currently,&#xD;
      when a possible stroke patient arrives at the emergency department, typically first a CT or&#xD;
      MRI exam is acquired for stroke triage. In case of an ischemic stroke the patient is then&#xD;
      treated in an interventional suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the DTAS workflow stroke patients are diagnosed and treated in the interventional suite&#xD;
      without interruption. The Cone-Beam CT (CBCT) capabilities of the interventional X-ray system&#xD;
      are utilized to perform triage, directly followed by stroke treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the WE-TRUST study is to demonstrate that the DTAS triage workflow&#xD;
      involving CBCT results in superior patient outcome in ischemic stroke patients with confirmed&#xD;
      Large Vessel Occlusion as compared to the conventional CT/MR triage workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WE-TRUST study will be running in 16 sites to enroll 500+ patients globally.&#xD;

    <measure>Distribution of ordinal modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 ± 14 days follow-up</measure>
    <time_frame>90 ± 14 days follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in the distribution of ordinal modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 ± 14 days follow-up in the ITT population to determine the performance of the DTAS triage imaging workflow involving Stroke CBCT reconstructions by the investigational device in comparison to the conventional CT/MR triage imaging workflow. The 90 day mRS score will be evaluated by a blinded assessor of a pool of blinded assessors (i.e., a specialist with mRS certification) at the local hospital by performing a structured interview of the patient in person using the Rankin Focused Assessment (RFA) structured mRS questionnaire. If subject is unable to return to the clinic for the day 90 ± 14 visit, a (video) call in which the mRS score is assessed by a blinded assessor is preferable to no assessment.</description>
