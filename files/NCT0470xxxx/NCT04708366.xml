  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An adequate level of bowel preparation before colonoscopy has an extremely relevant impact on&#xD;
      lesion detection and procedure success. The inpatient status represents a well-known&#xD;
      independent predictor for inadequate colon cleansing. A recent prospective, multicentre,&#xD;
      Italian study among inpatients showed that an adequate colon cleansing was achieved in 60-70%&#xD;
      of patients, far below the ideal threshold of 90%. Interestingly, a higher rate of adequate&#xD;
      colon cleansing was reported for a very low-volume (1L) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based&#xD;
      preparation when compared to 4L and 2L PEG-based solutions. However, this finding has to be&#xD;
      confirmed as the study was not controlled and the PEG-1L group was much smaller than the&#xD;
      other two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the present multicenter randomized controlled study will be to assess and compare the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of a novel very-low volume (1L) PEG-based preparation vs.&#xD;
      standard-of-care low-volume (2L) and high-volume (4L) PEG-based purge, among inpatients who&#xD;
      undergo colonoscopy.&#xD;

      An adequate level of bowel preparation before colonoscopy has an extremely relevant impact on&#xD;
      lesion detection and procedure success. The inpatient status represents a well-known&#xD;
      independent predictor for inadequate colon cleansing. A recent prospective, multicentre,&#xD;
      Italian study among inpatients showed that an adequate colon cleansing was achieved in 60-70%&#xD;
      of patients, far below the ideal threshold of 90%. Such a low efficacy has several negative&#xD;
      consequences: first, it leads to repetition of colonoscopy, therefore prolonging patients'&#xD;
      in-hospital stay and increasing the risk of adverse events and costs; second, it augments the&#xD;
      risk of missing colorectal lesions, negatively affecting patients' management and increasing&#xD;
      costs due to the need for adjunctive diagnostic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current recommendations on bowel preparation among difficult-to-prepare patients are mostly&#xD;
      based on expert opinions, the high-volume 4L polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based prep being&#xD;
      considered as the gold standard, possibly with further additional solution. On the other&#xD;
      hand, compliance to the bowel preparation has been related to an adequate colon cleansing,&#xD;
      and it may be argued that inpatients might find it difficult to take high-volume purge. A&#xD;
      recent Italian prospective multicentre study among inpatients showed similar rates of&#xD;
      adequate bowel preparation between patients who underwent bowel preparation with and without&#xD;
      additional solution. Interestingly, a higher rate of adequate colon cleansing was reported&#xD;
      for a very low-volume (1L) polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based preparation when compared to 4L&#xD;
      and 2L PEG-based solutions. However, this finding has to be confirmed as the study was not&#xD;
      controlled and the PEG-1L group was much smaller than the other two.&#xD;

    <description>Efficacy will be assessed as the percentage of patients with adequate bowel cleansing, as rated according to the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS). This scale gives 0-3 points to each of the three colonic segments (i.e. right colon, transverse colon, and left colon); 0 points are assigned for the worst segment cleansing, whereas at least 2 points stand for adequate segment cleansing. Adequate colon cleansing is defined when at least 2 points are reached in each colonic segment.</description>
