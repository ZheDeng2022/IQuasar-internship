    <textblock>
      The Investigators hypothesize that the recalcitrant nature of ocular GVHD may be related to&#xD;
      corneal nerve damage and corneal hypoesthesia. The investigators aim to study the prevalence&#xD;
      of corneal hypoesthesia in GVHD patients and its correlation with ocular surface changes.&#xD;

      Rationale: Graft-versus-host disease(GVHD) is a common complication of allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It affects multiple systems, including&#xD;
      skin, gastrointestinal system, liver, lung, and oral cavity, as well as eyes, which&#xD;
      contributes to decreased quality of life and increased mortality. About 10% of patients with&#xD;
      acute GVHD and 60-90% of those with chronic GVHD develop ocular complications. Dry eye is the&#xD;
      most common manifestation of ocular GVHD. The pathogenesis remains unclear. The conjunctival&#xD;
      tissue and cornea are the main immunological targets in GVHD. Patients often have punctate&#xD;
      hypothesize that the recalcitrant nature of ocular GVHD may be related to corneal nerve&#xD;
      damage and sensation changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a few confocal microscopy studies on corneal nerve changes in GVHD, including&#xD;
      increased tortuosity and reduced reflectivity of sub-basal nerves. However, there were very&#xD;
      few studies on clinical correlations of those microscopic changes with corneal sensation and&#xD;
      ocular surface health. In addition, confocal microscopes are not widely available in clinical&#xD;
      practice. It also requires the special expertise of technicians and physicians to obtain and&#xD;
      explain the images. It is therefore not feasible to routinely perform confocal microscopy for&#xD;
      corneal innervation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to study the corneal sensation changes and their correlation with&#xD;
      ocular surface staining, tear film breakdown and meibomian gland dysfunction in GVHD&#xD;
      patients. The study will shed light on an important aspect of corneal innervation damage in&#xD;
      GVHD and may lead to new treatment modalities for those patients, noting that topical&#xD;
      recombinant human nerve growth factor cenegermin was recently FDA approved for neurotrophic&#xD;
      keratopathy. The investigators intend to identify the ocular characteristics of GVHD patients&#xD;
      that may potentially benefit from cenegermin treatment.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic GVHD is diagnosed based on the history of allogeneic HSCT (Hematopoietic stem&#xD;
             cell transplant) and the presence of systemic GVHD in organs other than the eye. In&#xD;
             the ocular GVHD group, dry eye symptoms start after the development of systemic GVHD.&#xD;
             If post-HSCT dry eye precedes GVHD clinical signs in other organs, the investigators&#xD;
             will use the 2013 diagnostic criteria by International chronic ocular GVHD consensus&#xD;
             group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The investigators will recruit patients for the study. The investigators plan to&#xD;
             include ocular GVHD patients that are of age 18 years or older who have typical&#xD;
             symptoms of dry eye with an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) score greater than 13&#xD;
             and corneal fluorescein staining (CFS) score of 3 or more (National Eye Institute&#xD;
             [NEI] grading scale, 0-15). Normal age-matched volunteer group will include people&#xD;
             whose OSDI less or equal to 13 and CFS score less than 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The patients will continue their current systemic and ocular medications, which may include&#xD;
        one or combination of preservative free artificial tears, restasis or xiidra, serum tears,&#xD;
        ointment, or scleral contact lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with a history of herpetic simplex or zoster keratitis, ocular or neurologic&#xD;
             surgery (including laser or refractive surgical procedure) within 3 months before&#xD;
             enrollment, trauma, diabetes with signs of peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with active corneal thinning or infection.&#xD;
