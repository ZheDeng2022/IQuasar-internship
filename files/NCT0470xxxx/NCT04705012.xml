    <textblock>
      This pilot study is an interventional clinical study on the supportive peri-implant treatment&#xD;
      (SPiT) necessary to maintain/ improve the clinical conditions surrounding a dental implant&#xD;
      following surgical treatment of peri-implantitis. The focus of this pilot, double arm,&#xD;
      split-mouth, single centre, controlled, randomised clinical study is to examine the effect of&#xD;
      short-term increased frequency of a SPiT-protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients with surgically treated peri-implantitis enrolled in a maintenance program at the&#xD;
      Specialist clinic, Institute for Clinical Dentistry, Dental Faculty, University of Oslo, will&#xD;
      receive SPiT by the use of an oscillating chitosan brush (LBC, BioClean, Labrida AS, Oslo,&#xD;
      Norway). Subjects with at least two not-adjacent implants of similar brand and defect&#xD;
      configuration registered with suppuration or Bleeding index score 3-2 (Roos-Jansaker et al.,&#xD;
      2007) on at least 1 of 6 surfaces (mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual,&#xD;
      distolingual) will be invited to participate in the current pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline examinations and treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs of the implants showing clear projections of the implant threads at the mesial&#xD;
      and distal surfaces will be taken using standard Eggens holders&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following clinical registrations will be performed at six sites (mesiobuccal, buccal,&#xD;
      distobuccal, mesiolingual, lingual, distolingual) of the included implants by the blinded&#xD;
      examiner:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suppuration: the presence or absence after light pressure against gingiva/mucosa or following&#xD;
      gentle probing of the peri-implant pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plaque: the presence or absence recognized by running a probe across the marginal surface of&#xD;
      the implant (Mombelli, van Oosten, Jr, &amp; Lang, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival bleeding: registered according to the Modified Sulcus Bleeding Index (mBI) (Mombelli&#xD;
      et al., 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PPD: recorded with a pressure- sensitive probe (20 g) (University of North Carolina probe,&#xD;
      Aesculap, Braun, Tuttlingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bleeding index score: measured at the implants after probing at six sites, and graded (0-3):&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 = no bleeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. = spot bleeding,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. = line bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. = profound bleeding within 30 seconds after measurement of PPD. Presence of keratinized&#xD;
           mucosa: registered at the mid buccal site as &quot;adequate&quot; ≥2 mm, &quot;inadequate&quot; &lt;2 mm&#xD;
           (Moraschini, Luz, Velloso, &amp; Barboza, 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included implants receive the following treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated oral hygiene instruction if needed Submucosal debridement with a chitosan brush&#xD;
      (LBC, BioClean®, LABRIDA AS, Oslo, Norway) seated in an oscillating dental drill piece&#xD;
      (ER10M, TEQ-Y, NSK Inc., Kanuma Tochigi, Japan) for 3 min followed by copious irrigation with&#xD;
      sterile saline Supramucosal polishing using polishing paste and rubber cup Following&#xD;
      treatment, if local anesthesia was not applied, the subjects will be asked to grade the level&#xD;
      of pain experienced on a 10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-, 6- and 9 weeks following baseline At the 3-week follow up, an equal number of included&#xD;
      implants are determined &quot;test-&quot; and &quot;control-&quot; by flipping of a coin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At these time points, all implants are clinically examined by a blinded examiner and receive&#xD;
      supramucosal polishing, but only test-implants receive submucosal debridement as described&#xD;
      above (see figure 1) VAS scales are registered&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 weeks (3 month) following baseline At these time point, all implants are clinically&#xD;
      examined by a blinded examiner and receive supramucosal polishing as well as submucosal&#xD;
      debridement as described above (see figure 1) VAS scales are registered&#xD;
&#xD;
      16 weeks (4 month) following baseline All implants are clinically examined by a blinded&#xD;
      examiner and receive supramucosal polishing, but only test-implants receive submucosal&#xD;
      debridement as described above (see figure 1) VAS scales are registered&#xD;
&#xD;
      24 weeks (6 month) following baseline At these time point, all implants are clinically&#xD;
      examined by a blinded examiner and receive supramucosal polishing as well as submucosal&#xD;
      debridement as described above (see figure 1) VAS scales are registered&#xD;
&#xD;
      36 weeks (9 month) following baseline At these time point, all implants are clinically&#xD;
      examined by a blinded examiner and receive supramucosal polishing as well as submucosal&#xD;
      debridement as described above (see figure 1) VAS scales are registered Radiographs are taken&#xD;
      according to the baseline examination&#xD;
