  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      evaluation of occlusal force distribution was carried out with the aid of T-Scan device&#xD;
      (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA) for mandibular complete dentures before and after&#xD;
      relining with long term soft liner for controlled type 2 diabetic patients.&#xD;

      A crossover clinical study was carried out with previously constructed and used conventional&#xD;
      complete dentures before relining with soft denture liners and then with the same dentures&#xD;
      after relining with soft denture liners. The study sample included 50 males completely&#xD;
      edentulous contributors, All patients were controlled type 2 diabetes during the study&#xD;
      period. All selected patients had previously constructed and used conventional heat cured&#xD;
      acrylic resin complete dentures for not less than two years with history of retention and&#xD;
      stability problems of mandibular dentures. Mandibular complete dentures had received the&#xD;
      essential prosthetic adjustments aiming to achieve optimal retention, maximum stability and&#xD;
      the necessary occlusal contacts. The first occlusal parameters were recorded before denture&#xD;
      relining. Relining of mandibular dentures was performed and Patients were comfortably using&#xD;
      their relined mandibular complete dentures for at least three months and the retention and&#xD;
      stability of the conventional dentures were assessed before second recording of occlusal&#xD;
      parameter. The evaluation of occlusal force distribution was carried out with the aid of&#xD;
      T-Scan device (Tekscan Inc., South Boston, MA, USA). The first record was recorded before&#xD;
      denture relining and the second record was three months after denture relining&#xD;

    <description>Fifty completey edentulous patients having previously constructed and utilized conventional complete dentures were selected for this study. Relining of mandibular complete dentures with soft denture liner was carried out.

    <description>Relining of mandibular dentures was performed by reducing one mm of the denture fitting surfaces and borders to make a right-angled border. apply two separate layers of Mucopren adhesive upon the vestibular surface of the mandibular denture and allow each layer to dry for about 40 seconds. then, the lower denture was inserted and molded in patient mouths; while biting in centric occlusion with the opposing maxillary complete dentures.</description>
