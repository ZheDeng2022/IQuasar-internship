  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to determine the effect of&#xD;
      Call for Life TB (CFLU-TB) on Tuberculosis (TB) treatment success in patients with non-drug&#xD;
      resistant Tuberculosis receiving care at three public health facilities, Kisenyi Health&#xD;
      Centre IV, Kasangati Health Centre IV and Kiryandongo government Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Call for Life TB will employ a mobile health Health technology called CONNECT FOR LIFE™ to&#xD;
      provide SMS or Interactive Voice Response patient support. This support will be in the form&#xD;
      of clinic appointment, daily pill reminders, reminders, health tips and an opportunity to&#xD;
      report symptoms which are responded to by a call from study doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, 274 patients will be randomized (1:1ratio) to Intervention Arm (daily adherence&#xD;
      calls, a pre-appointment reminder call, health tips and 24hr symptom reporting) or Standard&#xD;
      of care (standard practice according to the national guidelines for TB treatment). Call for&#xD;
      Life TB will also provide for Treatment supporters of patients on the Intervention Arm to be&#xD;
      co-registered onto the system so as to enhance Directly Observed Treatment (DOTS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed up for 6 months and observational data collected at several&#xD;
      points. Data on sociodemographics, treatment response/outcome determined at 2 and at the end&#xD;
      of treatment. Investigators shall conduct Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) and In- Depth&#xD;
      Interviews (IDIs) with patients and clinic staff respectively, on ease of use, acceptability&#xD;
      and satisfaction with the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will use system data to assess uptake and adherence to the tool. Investigators&#xD;
      shall determine differences in the proportions of patients with treatment success in the two&#xD;
      arms. Additionally, investigators shall assess adherence to medication, TB cure rates and&#xD;
      treatment completion. Investigators shall qualitatively determine, perception, acceptability,&#xD;
      and satisfaction with CFLU-TB. As a measure of cost-effectiveness, investigators shall&#xD;
      determine marginal cost effectiveness CFLU-TB with regard to treatment success. The proposed&#xD;
      study endpoint is 6-months retention in care, treatment and appointment adherence.&#xD;

      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effect of CFLU-TB on TB treatment success (treatment completion and cure&#xD;
      rates) in patients with TB receiving care at three public health facilities in Uganda.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare TB cure rates (six months) in patients with microbiologically diagnosed TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of enhanced TB treatment support with CFLU-TB on 2- and 6-month&#xD;
           retention in patients receiving TB treatment at Kisenyi Health Center IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess views of care-providers towards the CFLU-TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the CFLU-TB intervention in TB care&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To determine and compare adherence rates between patients in the intervention arm and&#xD;
           control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To compare treatment completion (six months) in patients clinically diagnosed with TB in&#xD;
           the intervention and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare knowledge about TB/HIV in patients enrolled in the intervention and control&#xD;
           arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To determine the effect of CFLU-TB on adherence to clinic appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. To determine the level of usage of the CFLU-TB tool in patients and their care providers&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To determine rifampicin-resistance rates in the intervention and control arms.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Call for Life Uganda</intervention_name>
    <description>Call for Life™ Uganda (C4LU) is a web-based mHealth tool that provides treatment support to patients in the form of daily or weekly pill adherence reminders, health messages, clinic appointment reminders and a remote symptom reporting service. The tool interacts with patients by text message (SMS) or using voice and tone input via keypad (Interactive Voice Response - IVR) on both analogue and smart phones.&#xD;
The tool uses CONNECT FOR LIFE technology, which is on an open source platform developed by Grameen Foundation and the University of Southern Maine with financial support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It was supported by Janssen, the Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson and Johnson and was released under the terms of the MOTECH open source license agreement.</description>
