  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study quantifies residual limb volume fluctuations affecting transfemoral amputees due&#xD;
      to the prosthesis doffing, physical activity, and testing time.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first test session aims at measuring residual limb volume at 7 time-points, with 10&#xD;
      minute intervals, after prosthesis doffing. This allows for evaluating the time required for&#xD;
      volume stabilization after prosthesis removal, for each amputee. In subsequent sessions, 16&#xD;
      residual limb scans in a day for each amputee are captured to evaluate volume changes due to&#xD;
      prosthesis removal and physical activity, in two times per day (one in the morning, one in&#xD;
      the afternoon). These measurements are repeated in three different days, a week apart from&#xD;
      each other, for a total of 48 scans for each amputee.&#xD;

    <description>The clinical protocol consisted of four test sessions in four different days for an overall duration of 3 weeks. During the 1st session, amputees' residual limb volume was measured 7 times at intervals of 10 minutes after the prosthesis removal. During the subsequent sessions, the residual limb volume was measured immediately after the prosthesis doffing and after the amputee's stabilization time, before and after 15-min of walking on a treadmill, both in the morning and in the afternoon.</description>
