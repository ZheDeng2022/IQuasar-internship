  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persistent-post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) is a condition that effects on average one in&#xD;
      seven persons following a concussion. Anxiety and depression symptoms are experienced by over&#xD;
      one-third of those with PPCS. These symptoms can delay recovery from a concussion. Two&#xD;
      techniques used to treat anxiety and depression symptoms are breath control and mindfulness&#xD;
      exercises. This 8-week feasibility study will evaluate the implementation and compliance of a&#xD;
      remote delivered breathing and mindfulness treatment program for individuals experiencing&#xD;
      PPCS anxiety or depression symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the feasibility of a randomized control study designed to remotely&#xD;
      deliver a breath control and guided mindfulness exercise to individuals experiencing&#xD;
      post-concussion symptoms of anxiety or depression. Participants will be randomized into one&#xD;
      of the study arms after they have met eligibility criteria and have given informed consent.&#xD;
      Study arm interventions include a 20-minute paced breathing (breath control) exercise, a&#xD;
      20-minute guided mindfulness exercise, and a sham control arm that incorporates a minimal&#xD;
      instruction 20-minute quiet sitting meditation exercise. The participant is asked to complete&#xD;
      their assigned intervention daily for a period of eight weeks and to complete weekly and&#xD;
      biweekly follow-up questionnaires. The questionnaires will include the Rivermead&#xD;
      Post-Concussion Syndrome Questionnaire (RPQ) and the Positive Affect Negative Affect Survey&#xD;
      Short Form (PANAS) completed weekly, the General Anxiety and Depression questionnaire (GAD-7)&#xD;
      and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) completed biweekly. These questionnaires will be&#xD;
      completed prior to a participant commencing the study (pre-test measure), at weekly intervals&#xD;
      throughout the study (at end of week), and at the conclusion of the 8-week study (post-test&#xD;
      measure). At the conclusion of the study participants will be asked to complete the Treatment&#xD;
      Acceptability / Adherence Scale (TAAS), a measure used to assess the acceptability of the&#xD;
      intervention from the point of view of the participant. All participant outcome measures, and&#xD;
      intervention tracking questionnaires will be administered through a secure internet&#xD;
      user-input interface.&#xD;
