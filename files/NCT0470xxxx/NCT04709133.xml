    <textblock>
      Multi-ligament knee injuries (MLKI) are devastating injuries. They are defined as injuries to&#xD;
      at least two of the four major ligaments in the knee: anterior cruciate ligament, posterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament (and posterolateral corner) and medial&#xD;
      collateral ligament (and posteromedial corner). These injuries are commonly classified using&#xD;
      the Schenck classification system. The incidence of these injuries has been reported to be&#xD;
      around 0.02-0.20% of all orthopaedic injuries. However, this is likely to be an&#xD;
      underestimation due to spontaneous knee reduction and missed injuries. The immediate&#xD;
      management of these injuries is crucial in identifying and treating any vascular and nerve&#xD;
      injury. The literature has shown poor outcome and residual instability in those who were&#xD;
      treated non-operatively. However, the optimal surgical treatment for these injuries is not&#xD;
      known, with differences in opinion amongst treating clinicians. There are controversies in&#xD;
      the timing of surgery (early versus delayed), single-staged or two-staged procedures and&#xD;
      whether the damaged ligaments should be repaired or reconstructed&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 50% of all knee dislocations reduce spontaneously before the physician's&#xD;
      arrival. Thus, high suspicion must be held, and literally every MLKI must be treated&#xD;
      immediately as a true knee dislocation until proven otherwise. Failing to recognize the whole&#xD;
      injury pattern around the knee can lead to disastrous consequences. Thus, an initial&#xD;
      interdisciplinary systematic approach obtains top priority. Even though diagnostic image&#xD;
      instruments become more and more reliable, physical examination still remains a fundamental&#xD;
      element in any accurate assessment of knee dislocation. Several authors describe their own&#xD;
      experiences and related treatment strategies of knee dislocation. But although a large number&#xD;
      of studies about knee dislocation and MLKI do exist in medical databases, the complexity of&#xD;
      this injury, the inhomogeneity of literature, and the persevering controversies in their&#xD;
      treatment still make it difficult to draw reliable general conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although important advances have been made in knee arthroscopy, ligament reconstruction and&#xD;
      patient management, recommendations are not always applicable in settings with limited&#xD;
      resources available. Challenges encountered in these situations include long delays to&#xD;
      presentation, as well as the lack of sufficient access to operating room time, arthroscopic&#xD;
      equipment, newer fixation devices, and allografts. Patients are often uninsured; work&#xD;
      informally as manual laborers and their access to physiotherapy is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to analyse our institution's experience with multi-ligament knee&#xD;
      injuries via the following items prevalence, detailed initial management at emergency&#xD;
      department, types of these injuries, rationale of definitive treatment, rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocol, postoperative complications and functional outcomes.&#xD;
