  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Birth defects are relatively common, occurring in 1 in 40 live born babies. They can be&#xD;
      single, or multiple. They may occur as part of multiple malformation syndromes, often in&#xD;
      association with growth disturbance or intellectual disability. Over 7000 rare syndromes have&#xD;
      been identified. Thus, though they are rare they are collectively important. Understanding&#xD;
      how a multiple malformation syndrome came about, defining what investigations and health&#xD;
      surveillance is needed for affected children and identifying whether there is a treatment is&#xD;
      very important for parents and professionals caring for affected children and also for&#xD;
      genetic counselling of their extended families, since the majority will have a genetic basis.&#xD;
      Diagnosis of these rare disorders is therefore important,but as many syndromes are rare this&#xD;
      can be extremely difficult and requires specialist knowledge, many investigations and many&#xD;
      hospital appointments. This study aims to determine whether using face-recognition software&#xD;
      can improve diagnosis of rare syndromes when used in addition to current routine practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinicians see over 2000 patients per year who have rare syndromes in Manchester NHS clinics.&#xD;
      In the majority of these individuals the cause is unknown. Many will have a genetic cause,&#xD;
      but knowing which genes to test and being able to access these tests is difficult. When a&#xD;
      patient comes to the clinic, details of their medical and developmental history are collected&#xD;
      , and they are examined in detail to look at their investigation results. New tests may also&#xD;
      be ordered for patients. In many cases, subtle differences in physical features, especially&#xD;
      facial features may provide an important clue to the underlying diagnosis. However, because&#xD;
      many of the conditions seen are so rare and doctors may not have seen that particular&#xD;
      condition before, the diagnosis may not be made immediately at the appointment. In those&#xD;
      cases, permission will be sought to take photographs so that further opinions can be sought&#xD;
      within the department or by sharing with national and sometimes international colleagues.&#xD;
      This is routine practice. Where consent has been obtained for photos, these are then first&#xD;
      reviewed in a departmental case-review meeting. They may then also be presented at regional,&#xD;
      national or even international meetings aimed at syndrome diagnosis with patient consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit patients who are attending clinics for syndrome diagnosis, and who&#xD;
      have differences in their facial features. Such patients will undergo a full routine&#xD;
      diagnostic work-up as outlined above. Following that, if patients have consented to having&#xD;
      photographs taken as part of standard care, they will be asked if they would consent to&#xD;
      upload of the facial photographs to a digital face recognition system, along with upload of a&#xD;
      list of key clinical features, to see which diagnoses are suggested by this software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of Inherited Metabolic Disease patients with known diagnoses will be included under&#xD;
      the Faces sub-study to establish whether the technology may help to define their phenotype.&#xD;
      This group of patients would be asked to send photos to the research team either by email via&#xD;
      a secure email address or by post. The study would request one facial photo of each of the&#xD;
      biological parents (where applicable and available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will first of all be routine discussion of patients and photographs in a case review&#xD;
      meeting as per standard practice. Differential diagnoses will be formulated and recorded&#xD;
      based on this. Following this, the facial photo will be uploaded to a face recognition system&#xD;
      and suggested diagnoses from this recorded. Any diagnostic suggestions considered worthy of&#xD;
      investigation will be followed up in line with standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will then determine whether this was made a) in the standard way b) only&#xD;
      suggested by the face recognition software or c) utilising the two methods together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up to see if a final diagnosis is confirmed. The patient/parents&#xD;
      will also be sent a questionnaire by email or post 6 months after recruitment. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will ask if they had any concerns about using FDNA, if they found it helpful&#xD;
      and if so in what way. Another questionnaire to professionals will collect information on how&#xD;
      easy they found it to use, how helpful they found it ranging 1-5, did it alter patient&#xD;
      management, if so how, and other comments&#xD;
&#xD;
      . The investigators will document whether utilising the software helped to arrive at an&#xD;
      earlier diagnosis, whether it impeded the diagnosis by providing misleading or incorrect&#xD;
      guidance, whether parents and professionals found its use acceptable and whether it impacted&#xD;
      on the patient's management.&#xD;
