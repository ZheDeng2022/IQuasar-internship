      In this single-centre, cross-sectional case series, the investigators aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidence of facial nerve injury in patients undergoing superficial parotidectomy in the&#xD;
      absence of nerve conductor. Data to be collected retrospectively from a prospectively&#xD;
      maintained database of consecutive patients, at the Department of Surgery, Liaquat University&#xD;
      of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro, Pakistan. The sample size was calculated as 101.&#xD;

      In this single-centre, cross-sectional case series, the investigators aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      incidence of facial nerve injury in partcipants undergoing superficial parotidectomy in the&#xD;
      absence of nerve conductor. The institutional Research Ethics Committee has approved the&#xD;
      study. Data to be collected retrospectively from a prospectively maintained database, at the&#xD;
      Department of Surgery, Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences Jamshoro, Pakistan.&#xD;
      The data period to be over a period of nine years that is from 1st January 2012 till August&#xD;
      2020. The sample size was calculated using the WHO sample size calculator and taking disease&#xD;
      prevalence as 7.1 with CI 95%, which turned out to be 101. All the patients with pleomorphic&#xD;
      adenoma irrespective of age and gender were included. To control any chance of bias, one of&#xD;
      the members of researchers as part of the team who operated upon these patients. The primary&#xD;
      outcome was the incidence of temporary or permanent facial nerve injury, while secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were wound infection, seroma, hematoma, Frey's syndrome, salivary fistula and&#xD;
      disfigured scar. Temporary facial nerve injury was defined as a feature of facial nerve palsy&#xD;
      with full recovery to regular activity within six months. Permanent facial nerve injury was&#xD;
      defined as any facial nerve dysfunction lasting beyond six months of operation. The data was&#xD;
      recorded on a predesigned Performa, and patients' confidentiality was maintained assigning&#xD;
      codes to each case known only to researchers. The data was calculated using SPSS version 23.&#xD;
      Values of mean and standard deviation were calculated for continuous variables, whereas&#xD;
      frequencies were calculated for categorical data.&#xD;
