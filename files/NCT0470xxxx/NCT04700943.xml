  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Awake thoracic surgery is a feasible and safe alternative to general anesthesia for pulmonary&#xD;
      biopsy in interstitial lung disease patients, but there is still no evidence as to its&#xD;
      superiority in terms of outcome. However, there is extensive literature about the effect of&#xD;
      anesthetic drugs and surgery on diaphragmatic function. Furthermore, in thoracic surgery,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction was associated with a higher occurrence of postoperative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of general anesthesia on diaphragmatic function, the investigators&#xD;
      conducted an observational prospective trial. The investigators measured both diaphragmatic&#xD;
      excursion and Thickening Fraction at baseline and 12 hours after surgery together with&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests and gas exchange data.&#xD;

      excursion and Thickening Fraction at baseline and 12 hours after surgery together with&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests and gas exchange data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators divided our population into two groups: one group of patients undergoing&#xD;
      awake thoracic surgery with epidural anesthesia, and the other group undergoing general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-one patients were recruited and the Thickening Fraction percentage, calculated as (End&#xD;
      Inspiratory thickness-End Expiratory thickness)/End Expiratory thickness, was evaluated by&#xD;
      means of an ultrasound-assisted method, using a high frequency (10 MHz) linear probe.&#xD;

    <description>In non-intubated patients, an epidural catheter was placed at T5-T6. An anesthetic load of 0,5 mg/kg of ropivacaine was administered to reach anesthesia of the thoracic wall. Adjunctive local anesthetic infiltration of the incision site was performed by the surgeon with 2% lidocaine and 7,5% Ropivacaine. The cumulative dose of anesthetics drugs was computed as not to exceed the recommended dosage.&#xD;
To improve patient comfort through the procedure, sedation with Target Controlled Infusion of propofol (using Schnider algorithm) and low dose remifentanil (0,05 mcg/kg/min) was also administered.</description>

    <description>Either epidural block or an interfascial plane block of the thoracic wall, such as serratus anterior plane block or erector spinae plane block, were performed.&#xD;
Patients were then anesthetized with Propofol plus opiates (usually remifentanil) and muscle paralysis was achieved with Rocuronium.</description>
