      This study will evaluate the adaptations in skeletal muscle that occur in response to 10&#xD;
      weeks of weight training with or without peanut protein supplementation in untrained men and&#xD;
      women ages 18-30&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-phase study using both novel and conventional methods to assess how PP&#xD;
      supplementation affects muscle tissue in young adults who engage in resistance training.&#xD;
      These two phases will be conducted as part of a 10-week randomized controlled trial in which&#xD;
      men and women aged 18-30 years (n=40), will be stratified by gender and randomized to a&#xD;
      resistance training intervention (whole body, two days per week) with PP powder (72g daily;&#xD;
      n=10 males, n=10 females) provided during the intervention (immediate group, IG) or after the&#xD;
      intervention (wait-list control, WLC, n=10 males, n=10 females). The aims of this study are&#xD;
      to determine the acute (deuterium oxide tracer) and chronic (peripheral quantitative computed&#xD;
      tomography) effects of PP during resistance training on skeletal muscle myofibrillar protein&#xD;
      synthesis rates, changes in skeletal muscle size and quality, changes in whole and&#xD;
      appendicular body composition (dual energy x-ray absorptiometry), changes in inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and the fecal microbiome.&#xD;
