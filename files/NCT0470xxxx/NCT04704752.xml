  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) can affect patients all age group and clinical symptoms of the&#xD;
      disease varies depending on the patient's ages. Infants and toddlers with EoE generally have&#xD;
      food refusal, vomiting and poor weight gain. Older school-aged children and adolescents may&#xD;
      have abdominal and chest pain, difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia) especially in solid&#xD;
      foods. In the meantime, many children especially infants and toddlers, are not perceptive of&#xD;
      their dysphagia, because they have the ability to compensate. Such as, avoiding certain&#xD;
      textures or increases liquid intake in the meal.To date, to our knowledge, there is no study&#xD;
      in the literature has investigated complex swallowing behaviour (including all phases),&#xD;
      oral-motor evaluation and/or swallowing safety. Thus, the present study purposed to&#xD;
      investigate (a) descriptive and clinical swallowing characteristics of children with EoE (b)&#xD;
      the relation between disease characteristic and swallowing function.&#xD;
