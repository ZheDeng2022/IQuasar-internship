  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The meta-analysis &quot;sleep apnea syndrome and arterial stiffness&quot; includes data from 893&#xD;
      patients initially included in 9 studies conducted by the EFCR Department of the CHUGA&#xD;
      between 2006 and 2015, presenting a sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) with exploration of their&#xD;
      arterial stiffness via the measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, we do not have long-term follow-up data for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the &quot;PWV Follow-up&quot; project is to collect cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      these patients through telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire to determine the&#xD;
      prevalence of these events. The prevalence of metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths&#xD;
      will be also determined as secondary objectives through the same questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Others secondary objectives are to evaluate the impact of continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in the literature.&#xD;

      The meta-analysis &quot;sleep apnea syndrome and arterial stiffness&quot; includes data from 893&#xD;
      patients initially included in 9 studies conducted by the EFCR Department of the CHUGA&#xD;
      between 2006 and 2015, presenting a sleep apnea syndrome (SAS) with exploration of their&#xD;
      arterial stiffness via the measurement of pulse wave velocity (PWV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 9 studies were referred as : ADISAS (NCT011968), AGIRSASADOM (NCT010902), BPCO&#xD;
      (NCT004044), BPCO-SAS (NCT01195064), DIAMETASAS, Aortic Dissection (NCT01068691), INFRASAS&#xD;
      (NCT010892), VALSAS (NCT004094), NIV-OHS (NCT006030).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this meta-analysis on individual data was to understand the relationship&#xD;
      between the severity of the sleep apnea syndrome (measured by the apnea + hypopnea index) and&#xD;
      arterial rigidity at the time of diagnosis of SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, we do not have long-term follow-up data for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the &quot;PWV Follow-up&quot; project is to collect cardiovascular events in&#xD;
      these patients through telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire to determine the&#xD;
