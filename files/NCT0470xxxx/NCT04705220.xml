  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The EPICURO study aims to demonstrate the beneficial effects of a 6-month dietary&#xD;
      supplementation with an improved bioavailable turmeric (MERIVA®) on inflammatory, oxidative&#xD;
      and metabolic parameters together with cognitive performance, potentially resulting in the&#xD;
      reduction of the risk of cognitive decline in subjects, male and female, with Metabolic&#xD;
      Syndrome. The results obtained will provide novel insights on MERIVA® for improving the&#xD;
      prevention of age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-center trial will be a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, 2 parallel&#xD;
      groups study. The subjects will be randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups (MERIVA®&#xD;
      or placebo). The duration of the supplementation is 6 months. The total sample size at&#xD;
      baseline is 100 subjects aged 60+ years with Metabolic Syndrome, and therefore at risk of&#xD;
      cognitive decline but without definite cognitive pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effect of nutritional&#xD;
      supplementation with MERIVA® on the cognitive performance of subjects with Metabolic&#xD;
      Syndrome, and therefore at risk of cognitive decline, with a view to maintaining the&#xD;
      homeostatic balance of the function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the effect of nutritional supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) on&#xD;
           memory, executive and attention functions, language, neuropsychiatric profile and daily&#xD;
           living ability of Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the effect of nutritional supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) on the&#xD;
           body composition of Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the effect of nutritional supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) on the&#xD;
           arterial properties of Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the effect of nutritional supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) on&#xD;
           glucose metabolism and on the lipid and immune structure of Subjects with Metabolic&#xD;
           Syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the influence of gender / gender on the response to nutritional&#xD;
           supplementation with turmeric (MERIVA®) in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of the safety profile of nutritional supplementation with turmeric&#xD;
           (MERIVA®) in Subjects with Metabolic Syndrome.&#xD;
