  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether a culturally-tailored nutrition and exercise intervention&#xD;
      designed for African-American women will lead to sustained improvements in exercise and&#xD;
      healthy eating through improvements in self-management mediators: mindfulness, stress&#xD;
      management, positive reappraisal, self-regulation, and self-efficacy.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among all groups of women in the US, African American women (AAW) have the highest rates of&#xD;
      death and disability from chronic cardiometabolic (CM) illnesses. Furthermore, AAW have&#xD;
      inadequate engagement in exercise and are least successful at achieving and sustaining CM&#xD;
      risk-reduction goals compared to all men and women of other racial/ethnic groups, despite&#xD;
      participating in comprehensive lifestyle interventions. These alarming disparities are due in&#xD;
      part to disproportionately high rates of psychological stress. A shortcoming of interventions&#xD;
      with AAW is an inadequate focus on stress exposure, including gender and racialized stress,&#xD;
      stress physiology, and stress-related barriers to healthy eating and exercise to reduce CM&#xD;
      risk. In response, the HARMONY study is a randomized controlled trial to test a&#xD;
      culturally-tailored nutrition and exercise intervention to manage stress, designed to help&#xD;
      AAW build on their strengths to promote self-management and to reduce stress-related CM risk.&#xD;
      Certain information about the interventions is not disclosed to protect the scientific&#xD;
      integrity of the trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Amount of Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's moderate to vigorous physical activity will be measured by triaxial accelerometry. Results will be reported in minutes, with higher numbers indicating a higher amount of moderate to vigorous physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Dietary Risk Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's dietary intake will be assessed using the dietary risk assessment, which includes 54 items. The dietary risk assessment measures the healthiness of a participant's eating habits. Score ranges from 0 to 108, with higher scores associated with less healthy dietary intake.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Veggie Meter Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's nutrition will be assessed using the veggie meter, which uses light reflectance spectroscopy to provide an estimated skin carotenoid composite score. Score ranges from 0 to 800, with higher scores associated with greater fruit and vegetable intake.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's BMI is calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (cm).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participants weight will be measured using a digital scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Waist-to-Hip Ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's waist to hip ratio is calculated by using the mean of two waist circumference measurements divided by mean of two hip circumference measurements. Waist circumference will be measured at the midpoint between the upper iliac crest and lower costal margin in the midaxillary line. Hip circumference will be measured at the maximum width of the buttocks or gluteo-femoral fold.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Percent Body Fat</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's percent body fat is measured using lange skinfold calipers. The final measurement will be the mean of three measurements on the right side of the body.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Blood Pressure (Systolic Blood Pressure/Diastolic Blood Pressure)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's blood pressure is measured using an electronic sphygmomanometer. The final measurement will be the mean of three measurements.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Amount</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels will be obtained via phlebotomy. C-Reactive Protein is an inflammatory biomarker, and indicative of cardiovascular risk.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in IL-6</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 48 weeks after first group session</time_frame>
    <description>The participant's IL-6 levels will be obtained via phlebotomy. IL-6 is an inflammatory biomarker, and indicative of cardiovascular risk.</description>
