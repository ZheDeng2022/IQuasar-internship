    <textblock>
      Patients were randomized into two groups: Group Gabapentine ( G group) received 600 mg of&#xD;
      Gabapentin (two tablets) two hours prior to surgery and saline solution before induction of&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia and group Ketamine ( K group) received two placebo tablets and an injection&#xD;
      of ketamine at a dosage of 0.15 mg/Kg before induction of spinal anesthesia.. During the&#xD;
      surgery, blood pressure and heart rate were monitored. Postoperative analgesia was provided&#xD;
      by a PCA morphine. Acute postoperative pain was assessed by a visual analog scale. The&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative neuropathic pain was detected by the DN4 questionnaire after one&#xD;
      and three months of surgery.&#xD;

      the investigators includes patients aged at least 18 classified as ASA I and II. Patients&#xD;
      with significant cardiovascular or central nervous system disease, as well as those with&#xD;
      renal or liver failure and those who could not operate the PCA device were not eligible for&#xD;
      our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were patients that had incidents during the surgery such as: an allergic&#xD;
      reaction, local anesthetic systemic toxicity or a surgical incident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomized into two groups: Group Gabapentine ( G group) received 600 mg of&#xD;
      Gabapentin (two tablets) two hours prior to surgery and saline solution before induction of&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia and group Ketamine ( K group) received two placebo tablets and an injection&#xD;
      of ketamine at a dosage of 0.15 mg/Kg before induction of spinal anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival in the operating room, patients were monitored using mean blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate and peripheral oxygen saturation monitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery was performed under spinal anesthesia. Each patient received 10 mg of hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine mixed with 5 µ of sufentanil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the intervention, the patients were transferred to the post anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit (PACU) where analgesia was arranged through morphine titration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the motor block is lifted, patients were transferred to surgery department where they&#xD;
      were connected to a PCA device that provided 1 mg IV bolus injection of morphine at a lockout&#xD;
      interval of 7 minutes and with a maximum four-hour limit of 0.5 mg/Kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the hospital stay, acute post-operative pain assessed through the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS) at rest and at motion, every 15 minutes in the PACU and then at H2, H6, H12 and H24&#xD;
      postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morphine consumption was noted as well as its first demand. Sedation was assessed using&#xD;
      the Ramsay score. The occurrence of adverse effects such as nausea and vomiting, dizziness,&#xD;
      diarrhea, hallucination and pruritus was also noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first night sleep quality was evaluated through the Spiegel score. After hospital&#xD;
      discharge, patients were contacted at one month and three months. The incidence of&#xD;
      post-operative neuropathic pain was detected by the DN4 questionnaire. The effect the pain&#xD;
      had on their daily activities was also judged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to available data (30% occurrence of post-operative chronic pain after inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair (2)), to decrease by 25% this number with a power of 80%, 28 patients were&#xD;
      needed in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS in its 20 version. Results were expressed as&#xD;
      mean, standard variation or median. χ2 test, fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney test were&#xD;
      performed. A P value of &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.&#xD;
