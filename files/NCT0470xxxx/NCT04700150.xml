  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that tai chi sessions would increase physical activity of patients with&#xD;
      Spondyloarthitis. The main objective is to study the effect of tai chi sessions (16 vs.0) on&#xD;
      global physical activity of Spondyloarthitis patients, compared to a control group without&#xD;
      tai chi.&#xD;

      Selection and inclusion of patients will be done by principal investigator of Rheumatology&#xD;
      Department. After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria by principal&#xD;
      investigator and signature of consent, patients will be randomized by 1: 1 randomization&#xD;
      (centralized randomization by statistician into 2 groups at M0). They will participate in&#xD;
      sessions in a deferred manner due to two per week for each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interventional &quot;A&quot; group: 32 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from M0 to M4 in 15&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control &quot;B&quot; group: 16 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from M2 to M4 in 15&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of &quot;B&quot; group will be not performing sessions with &quot;A&quot; group patients. Sessions&#xD;
      lasting about 45 minutes will be proposed from Monday to Friday in a room planned from this&#xD;
      activity within the CHU. Exercises will be adapted and personalized according to each one.&#xD;
      Evaluations will be carried out at M0, M2 and at the end of the protocol at M4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of pain and stress will be done before and after each session. Final assessment&#xD;
      will be done at 4 months after randomization. Fitness assessment and tai chi sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted by APA student.&#xD;
