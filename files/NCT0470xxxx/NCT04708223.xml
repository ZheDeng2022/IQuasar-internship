      The objective of this 2-year split mouth comparative study, a randomized controlled study, is&#xD;
      to determine whether the simplified placement procedure of the ultra-rapid polymerizing&#xD;
      Tetric PowerFlow/ Tetric PowerFill with a reduced light polymerization time (3 s), yields the&#xD;
      same clin-ical results as widely used commercially available dental composites (Tetric&#xD;
      EvoCeram Bulk Fill, Tetric EvoFlow Bulk Fill) requiring up to 40 seconds of light&#xD;
      polymerization time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients, requiring posterior tooth restorations Class I and II or requesting amalgam&#xD;
      restoration replacement, were treated in the clinical investigation. Each patient received&#xD;
      two composite restorations in the posterior region.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each subject must need at least 2 restorations in a vital posterior tooth (in&#xD;
             different quadrants)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restorations may be indicated for caries removal and restoration, replacement of&#xD;
             defec-tive restorations (i.e. fractured, stained, unaesthetic), or requested&#xD;
             replacement of un-aesthetic restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have given written consent to participate in the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be available for the required follow-up visits over 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restored teeth must have occlusal contact with opposing teeth or restored teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Restoration width should be equal to or greater than 1/3 the distance from buccal to&#xD;
             lin-gual cusp tips&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  75% of the restorations Class II (minimum) and 25% Class I&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One, two or three surfaces per restoration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Each Class II will have at least one proximal contact&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  75% in molars (minimum) and 25% in premolars&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All restored teeth must have at least one occlusal contact in habitual closure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have 20 or more teeth with evidence of bilateral posterior tooth contacts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Teeth that require one or no cuspal build-ups&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  Allergies to ingredients of the materials under investigation (monomers)&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment, cancer or are immunocompromised) or disabilities rendering them unable to&#xD;
             tolerate the time required to complete the restorations or to provide adequate oral&#xD;
             hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffer from xerostomia either by taking medications known to produce xerostomia or&#xD;
             those with radiation induced xerostomia or Sjogren's syndrome subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have teeth with advanced or severe periodontitis, rampant caries or poor oral hygiene&#xD;
             which may require extraction of the teeth to be restored&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Present with any systemic or local disorders that contraindicate the dental procedures&#xD;
             included in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients reporting having severe grinding/bruxing or clenching or in need of&#xD;
             TMJ-related therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have tooth with exposed pulp during preparation or caries removal or require indirect&#xD;
             pulp capping&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of teeth that are non-vital or that exhibit signs of pulpal pathology&#xD;
             (pulpitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the working field cannot be maintained in a dry state for treatment&#xD;
