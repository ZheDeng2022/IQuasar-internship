    <textblock>
      We propose a placebo controlled randomized study on the use of mannitol as an agent to&#xD;
      protect against delayed graft function, during the surgical procedure of kidney&#xD;
      transplantation from a cadaver. Patients undergoing kidney transplantation for the treatment&#xD;
      of end stage kidney disease will be randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either&#xD;
      intravenous mannitol or saline during their procedure, administered prior to renal artery&#xD;
      clamp release and reperfusion of the kidney. Changes in renal function following surgery and&#xD;
      the incidence and duration of delayed graft function (DGF) will be monitored using calculated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the need for dialysis performed post-operatively, as&#xD;
      part of routine standard of care. Additionally biological samples will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed for use of a non invasive biomarker for delayed graft function.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial comparing renal&#xD;
      function outcomes in patients undergoing cadaver donor renal transplant for end stage kidney&#xD;
      failure. Patients will be randomized to receive 0.5 g / kg body weight, of mannitol or saline&#xD;
      0.9% as an intravenous infusion to be initiated and be completely infused within 15-30&#xD;
      minutes prior to vascular clamp removal of the transplanted renal artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to surgery, all study participants will receive standard departmental treatment as all&#xD;
      other patients undergoing a kidney transplantation from a cadaver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the operating room patients will be placed supine on the operating room&#xD;
      table, and will be connected to an anesthesia monitor which will include monitoring the HR,&#xD;
      blood pressure, saturation, temperature and ECG as standard departmental procedure. After&#xD;
      connecting the participant to the anesthesia monitor an IV line will be inserted, as is&#xD;
      standard clinical practice. In addition, venous central line catheter for central venous&#xD;
      pressure monitoring and specific inotropic drugs infusion, as well as arterial line catheter&#xD;
      for blood pressure monitoring, will be initialized upon anesthesiologist team decision The&#xD;
      technique of kidney transplantation is well-standardized . None of the techniques utilized in&#xD;
      the study are considered experimental and all are considered standard therapeutic options for&#xD;
      a patient undergoing cadaveric donor kidney transplantation. The procedures are performed&#xD;
      under general anesthesia with non-invasive intraoperative vital sign monitoring, as is&#xD;
      standard departmental practice. Study participation will not affect anesthesia method or&#xD;
      protocol treatment in anyway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon study enrollment patients will be randomized in 1:1 ratio for study arm&#xD;
      treatment/control. The perioperative team, investigator and patient will be blinded to the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm: Patients randomized to receive the treatment arm will receive 0.5 g / kg body&#xD;
      weight of mannitol. The mannitol solution used in the hospital contain 18% mannitol in 500ml&#xD;
      solution. An equivocal volume of 2.8 cc / kg body weight, which will be given intravenously&#xD;
      with the use of an Ivac pump, infused for a duration of 15 minutes through an existing&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous access catheter within 15-30 minutes prior to renal artery&#xD;
      reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo arm (Control arm) Study participants randomized to this arm will receive a 0.9%&#xD;
      saline solution at a dose of 2.8 cc / kg, infused within 15-30 minutes prior to renal artery&#xD;
      reperfusion through an existing intravenous access catheter (either through an central or&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following receiving the study drug, either mannitol or saline, patients will receive 80 mg&#xD;
      furosemide, which will be given intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluid management throughout the kidney transplant surgery for all study participants will&#xD;
      consist as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon arrival to the operating room, immediately following IV insertion, all patients&#xD;
           will receive an IV infusion of Plasma-Lyte as it is a standard protocol at our institute&#xD;
           for kidney transplant surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After induction of anesthesia, the patient will receive Plasma-Lyte solution at a rate&#xD;
           of 8 cc / kg body weight per hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At this stage of the procedure, before reperfusion of the transplanted kidney, the&#xD;
           purpose of this fluid management is intended to maintain a minimum systolic blood&#xD;
           pressure of 90-100mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At 30 to 15 minutes before reperfusion, in purpose to let the transplanted kidney get&#xD;
           better opening conditions, the target blood pressure is elevated to an mean arterial&#xD;
           pressure (MAP) of not less than 100 mmHg. In order to achieve that, additional 1000 cc&#xD;
           of Plasma-Lyte will be given to the patient 30 to 15 minutes before re-perfusion. In&#xD;
           addition, small boluses (each 0.1 mg) of Phenylephrine will be given as needed to&#xD;
           maintain that MAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thereafter, and until the end of the operation, the fluid management will be titrated&#xD;
           according to the patient's blood pressure, ensuring that systolic blood pressure does&#xD;
           not fall below 120 mmHG, as the common departmental protocol in such surgeries. In&#xD;
           occasions of hypotension, a bolus of 250 cc Plasma-Lyte will be given to increase the&#xD;
           blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If there is insufficient response to repeat boluses, vasopressors (phenylephrine,&#xD;
           ephedrine or noradrenaline) will be given at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Episodes of hypotension not responsive to intravenous fluids will be treated with&#xD;
           intravenous vasopressors (phenylephrine, ephedrine or noradrenaline as needed) at the&#xD;
           discretion of the anesthesiologist. The provision of these drugs will be documented&#xD;
           individually in the study report for each patient, as is common clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After surgery, in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), the patient will receive 80 cc /&#xD;
           hour of Plasma-Lyte or 120% of urine output if urine output exceeds 80 cc. Patients are&#xD;
           regularly supervised in PACU for 2-4 hours after the end of the operation and then&#xD;
           transferred to the department of organ transplantation. In cases of need for dialysis or&#xD;
           prolonged ventilation, they stay at PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The fluid management for the postoperative days are as standard regimen in our center&#xD;
           which consists of giving the patient full fluid replacement at POD1 - including urine&#xD;
           output and drains output. On the next post-operative days, we replace 80% of urine&#xD;
           output in IV fluids and oral intake together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally blood and urine samples maybe collected from some of the patients (In the event&#xD;
      that it is possible) at the following different timelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before administering mannitol Immediately after administering mannitol 24 hours&#xD;
      after transplant 7 days after transplant, These biological samples will be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed to asses the presence of proteins, exosomes , cytokines that can be used as a non&#xD;
      invasive biomarker for delayed graft function.&#xD;
