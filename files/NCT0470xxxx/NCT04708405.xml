  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Numerous epidemiological studies have investigated the association between Helicobacter&#xD;
      pylori (H. pylori) infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with various conflicting&#xD;
      results. The main objective of this study is to further explore the possible association&#xD;
      between H. pylori infection and IBD and its impact on disease course. The investigators&#xD;
      sought to conduct a prospective observational study and enroll a total of 182 IBD patients&#xD;
      who were screened for H. pylori infection. All the participants will be clinically evaluated&#xD;
      at the initial visit and bimonthly for 3 months. Several factors will be explored such are&#xD;
      diet, physical activity, life style and considering specific environmental exposures that&#xD;
      impact the development of disease or its relapse.&#xD;
