  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial investigates the safety and the preliminary clinical benefit of the&#xD;
      hemiverse shoulder prosthesis. Implantation of this newly developed hemi-prosthesis is&#xD;
      intended for patients who do not qualify for a regular reverse or hemi-prosthesis due to&#xD;
      severe medical conditions, poor bone stock or critical status of the rotator cuff. The&#xD;
      expected benefit is, that patients will have a minimally invasive surgical procedure, only&#xD;
      addressing the humeral shaft, however with the biomechanical advantage of a total reverse&#xD;
      shoulder prosthesis, meaning, that with a minimally invasive surgery a comparable result as&#xD;
      with a regular total shoulder prosthesis is accomplished. Patients will be closely monitored&#xD;
      within the study protocol for 24 months and thereafter in regular interval as with a normal&#xD;
      prosthetic follow-up.&#xD;

      This clinical trial investigates the safety and the preliminary clinical benefit of the&#xD;
      hemiverse shoulder prosthesis. Implantation of this newly developed hemi-prosthesis is&#xD;
      intended for patients who do not qualify for a regular reverse or hemi-prosthesis due to&#xD;
      severe medical conditions, poor bone stock or critical status of the rotator cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical condition of the patient a clinical examination including evaluation&#xD;
      of the&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constant-Murley score,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject shoulder value and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visual analogue scale are performed before inclusion and during the regular follow-ups.&#xD;
           To evaluate the bone stock and the musculature a conventional radiological status and a&#xD;
           computed tomography of the shoulder will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A delto-pectoral approach is preferred. The incision starts immediately lateral to the&#xD;
      coracoid tip and extends to the insertion of the deltoid on the Humerus. The subscapularis&#xD;
      tendon is exposed and detached from the humerus. The humeral head is exposed and dislocated&#xD;
      from the joint using an oscillating saw the humeral head is resected. The shaft is prepared&#xD;
      to receive a regular humeral stem which is definitely implanted with 0° retroversion. A trial&#xD;
      implant is inserted and reduced into the joint. Free mobility of the joint is tested and the&#xD;
      stability of the implant documented. According to the trial implants the definite implant is&#xD;
      assembled and implanted. After reduction of the implant the subscapularis tendon is&#xD;
      reattached to the humerus using transosseous sutures. Regular closure of the incision is&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After-care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately post operatively a anteroposterior radiograph is performed. For the first two&#xD;
      post-operative weeks the arm is immobilised in a sling and external rotation is allowed until&#xD;
      0° and flexion until 90° in internal rotation. Thereafter gradual increase of active mobility&#xD;
      is allowed until the weeks post operatively, when full load bearing of the arm is allowed.&#xD;
      Regular follow-up visits include evaluation of the Constant-Murley score, Subject shoulder&#xD;
      value and visual analogue scale. Additionally conventional radiographic status&#xD;
      (anteroposterior lateral and axillary view) are performed post-operatively on day 1 or 2,&#xD;
      week 6, 4.5 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Shoulder destruction for which reverse total shoulder replacement would be a high risk&#xD;
             for medical reasons (longer operation, more blood loss) or for advanced glenoid bone&#xD;
             destruction&#xD;

             standards (e.g. Renal disease, Cardiopulmonary Disease, Heart Disease, Medication&#xD;
             including Anticoagulation, Poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, Immunosuppressive&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Destruction of more than superior one third of the humeral shaft&#xD;
