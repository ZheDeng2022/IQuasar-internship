  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the structural documentation and analysis of the data of demographics,&#xD;
      neuroimaging, IONM and clinical outcomes can help to further standardize the use of such&#xD;
      equipment for detecting the integrity of the corticospinal tracts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to confirm that the retrospectively data analysis of neuroimaging, IONM and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes does help to understand these methods better in the surgical management of brainstem&#xD;
      lesions, and therefore, improve the safety of brainstem surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This will be a prospective data collection and retrospective data analysis study to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of pre- and post-neuroimaging, intraoperative monitoring, and clinical&#xD;
      outcome during the surgical management of brainstem lesions in our neurosurgical center. The&#xD;
      data of demographics, neuroimaging, IONM and patients' outcomes will be acquired based on the&#xD;
      medical records and follow-up visits. All data is stored in the personal file of the clinical&#xD;
      information system for each patient. The expected duration of each subject's participation is&#xD;
      confined to the surgery itself and the routine visits during the follow-up. The overall study&#xD;
      duration is expected to collect all the brainstem surgery in next five years.&#xD;

        The study population is patients with lesions in or near brainstem who accept surgical&#xD;
        resection as the optimal treatment. Estimation of 50 participants in the intra-axial&#xD;
        brainstem surgical group, and 150 in the extra-axial brainstem surgical group. There is no&#xD;
        other patient collective that could be used as substitute for the study population.&#xD;
