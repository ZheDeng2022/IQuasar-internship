  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Boswellia sacra Flueck. oleoresin extract (frankincense) was traditionally used in the&#xD;
      treatment of different diseases as respiratory, rheumatoid arthritis, and bacterial&#xD;
      infections. Therefore, the antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of frankincense extract&#xD;
      against Porphyromonas gingivalis periodontal pathogen clinical isolates were studied&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was carried out on 30 systemically healthy patients of both sexes their ages ranged&#xD;
      from 25 to 50 years old, diagnosed with moderate to severe chronic periodontitis (grade III&#xD;
      stage b periodontitis), and selected from the clinic of Periodontology, Faculty of Dentistry,&#xD;
      Tanta University&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingival crevicular fluid samples (GCF) were collected from pockets having ≥ 5 mm depth and&#xD;
      positive bleeding on probing (active disease) with a paper point. Samples were obtained from&#xD;
      the periodontal pockets after removing the supragingival plaque from the teeth to be sampled.&#xD;
      The subgingival plaque samples were then inoculated into 2 ml brain heart infusion (BHI)&#xD;
      broth supplemented with 5 μg/mL hemin and 1 μg/mL menadione (vitamin K1). They were then&#xD;
      diluted and cultured onto blood agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood, hemin (5 μg/mL) and&#xD;
      vitamin K1 (0.5 μg/mL). These plates were incubated in duplicate for 7-10 days at 37 °C in an&#xD;
      anaerobic atmosphere. The bacteria grown were finally selected based on their color, size,&#xD;
      and shape. The black-pigmented colonies and Gram-negative rods (when examined&#xD;
      microscopically) were examined by a fluorescence test using longwave UV light. The absence of&#xD;
      fluorescence distinguishes between P. gingivalis and other anaerobic, black-pigmented,&#xD;
      Gram-negative rods. The identification of P. gingivalis isolates was then confirmed using API&#xD;
      20A (BioMérieux, France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.8. Antibacterial screening It was performed using the agar diffusion method [40]. In brief,&#xD;
      bacterial suspension was distributed onto blood agar plate surfaces supplemented with 5%&#xD;
      sheep blood, 1% (v/v) hemin, and 1% (v/v) vitamin K1, then sterilized 6 mm blank filter paper&#xD;
      discs were impregnated with 25 µl of frankincense oleoresin extract with different&#xD;
      concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1000 µg/ml. Discs loaded with 10% DMSO was used as&#xD;
      negative controls and tetracycline disc (30 µg) was used as a positive control. All Petri&#xD;
      dishes were anaerobically incubated at 37°C for 48 hrs. Inhibition zone diameters were&#xD;
      measured and the concentrations of frankincense extract which showed clear zones (inhibition&#xD;
      zone) around the discs were regarded to have an inhibitory effect on the tested bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.9. Determination of MIC values The MIC values of frankincense extract against P. gingivalis&#xD;
      isolates were estimated using the broth microdilution method. Briefly, cultures of P.&#xD;
      gingivalis were grown overnight in BHI broth containing hemin (5 µg/mL) and vitamin K1 (1&#xD;
      µg/mL). Then, 100 µL of bacteria plus 100 µL of serial dilutions (two-fold) of the&#xD;
      frankincense extract (starting from 2000 µg/mL) in BHI were mixed in the wells of the&#xD;
      microtitration plate. Each microtitration plate had a negative control well-containing BHI&#xD;
      without bacteria and a positive control well containing only bacteria without the extract.&#xD;
      After anaerobic incubation at 37°C for 24 hrs., bacterial growth was inspected visually. The&#xD;
      MIC values were recorded as the lowest concentrations that caused an inhibition of the&#xD;
      bacterial growth. All the following experiments were performed before and after treatment of&#xD;
      P. gingivalis isolates with sub-inhibitory concentrations (0.5 MIC) of the frankincense&#xD;
      extract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.10. Bacterial growth curve P. gingivalis isolates were cultured in blood agar plates,&#xD;
      supplemented with 5% sheep blood, hemin (5 μg/mL), and vitamin K1 (0.5 μg/mL), for 5-7 days&#xD;
      under anaerobic conditions at 37°C [43]. Then, a single colony of each isolate was inoculated&#xD;
      into BHI broth, containing hemin (5 µg/mL) and vitamin K1 (1 µg/mL), and grown anaerobically&#xD;
      for 24 hrs. The optical density (OD) values at 600 nm were detected every 2 hrs. using UV-VIS&#xD;
      spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan), and the growth curves were constructed via plotting the&#xD;
      log OD against the sampling time (hrs.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.11. Measurement of nucleic acid leakage The release of nucleic acids from the bacterial&#xD;
      cells was measured as described previously. P. gingivalis isolates, at log phase, were&#xD;
      centrifuged and the pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and&#xD;
      incubated under anaerobic conditions. The release of cellular nucleic acids was measured at&#xD;
      different times of 0, 1, 2, and 4 hrs. through measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using an&#xD;
      1800 UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.12. Antibiofilm activity of frankincense extract&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was performed as previously described . Briefly, 100 µL of P. gingivalis suspensions were&#xD;
      inoculated and cultured into a 96 well microtitration plate at anaerobic conditions at 37 °C.&#xD;
      After incubation for 72 hrs., the non-adherent cells were removed via washing with PBS, and&#xD;
      they were left to dry for 1 hr. The biofilms were stained using a solution of 0.1% crystal&#xD;
      violet and the samples were washed with distilled water. For quantitative analysis of biofilm&#xD;
      production, 125 µL of 30% acetic acid was added and the OD at 492 nm was measured using ELISA&#xD;
      Auto Reader (Sunrise Tecan, Austria). The percentage of biofilm reduction was calculated&#xD;
      using the formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      % reduction of biofilm formation=(OD untreated-OD treated)/(OD untreated) x 100 Measurement&#xD;
      of the extracellular polysaccharides The polysaccharides found in the extracellular polymeric&#xD;
      substance (EPS) of the formed biofilm were estimated using the phenol-sulfuric acid method&#xD;
      [43]. In brief, microtitration plates, after 3 days of biofilm formation by P. gingivalis&#xD;
      isolates, were washed with PBS to remove the free-floating bacteria and air-dried. Then, 40&#xD;
      µL sterile water plus 40 µL 6% phenol solution, followed by 200 µL 97% sulfuric acid was&#xD;
      added to each well. The plates were then left at room temperature for 30 min and the number&#xD;
      of polysaccharides in the formed biofilm were determined by measuring the absorbance at an OD&#xD;
      of 490 nm using ELISA Auto Reader (Sunrise Tecan, Austria). We used different glucose&#xD;
      concentrations (0, 5, 10, 20, and 100 mg/L) as a standard to convert the OD values to&#xD;
      polysaccharide concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.14. Bacterial cell surface hydrophobicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bacterial hydrophobicity was assessed using the hydrocarbon-xylene test. Briefly, P.&#xD;
      gingivalis isolates were cultured anaerobically and the pellets collected after&#xD;
      centrifugation were resuspended in phosphate urea magnesium sulfate buffer (PUM buffer, pH&#xD;
      6.9). Then, volumes of 0.3, 0.9, 1.2, and 1.8 ml of n-hexane were added to 4.8 ml of the&#xD;
      bacterial suspension. The mixtures were left for 2 hrs and the aqueous phase was cautiously&#xD;
      separated. The absorbance of the tested isolates that remained in the aqueous phase was&#xD;
      measured at 540 nm. HI was identified by the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HI=(A540 control-A540 test)/(A540 control) 4.15. Examination of biofilm morphology by light&#xD;
      microscope and SEM It was carried out according to Qi et al. Briefly, two groups of glass&#xD;
      cover slides were flooded with P. gingivalis isolates (with and without frankincense extract)&#xD;
      and they were left for three days under anaerobic conditions to allow the isolates to form&#xD;
      biofilms. The first group of the formed biofilms by P. gingivalis isolates was visualized by&#xD;
      a bright-field microscope (Labomed, America) using 100× magnification after staining with&#xD;
      crystal violet. The second group of the formed biofilms was rinsed using PBS and submerged in&#xD;
      2.5% glutaraldehyde solution for 24 hrs at 4°C. Then, they were sequentially dehydrated using&#xD;
      a series of ethanol; concentrations ranging from 30% to 100%, let to dry, and sputter-coated&#xD;
      with gold for examination with SEM (Hitachi, Japan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.16. qRT-PCR Relative gene expression of fimA, hagA, hagB, rgpA and kgp genes was examined&#xD;
      using qRT-PCR. The used primers are listed in Table S1 and the 16S rRNA gene was the&#xD;
      housekeeping gene or endogenous control. All the experiments were performed three times and&#xD;
      the results values were expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The amplification was&#xD;
      carried out by Power SYBR® Green master mix (Thermo SCIENTIFIC, USA) using Rotor-Gene Q5 plex&#xD;
      instrument (Qiagen, Germany). The relative gene expression was determined using the method of&#xD;
      2-ΔΔCt using the untreated isolates as control samples (its expression was set to 1). Changes&#xD;
      in the gene expression with ≥ 2-fold (increased or decreased) were considered to be&#xD;
      statistically significant&#xD;
