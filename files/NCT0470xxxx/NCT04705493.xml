  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) has been used as a reference technique for CO&#xD;
      measurement and its accuracy has been adequate for many clinical uses. TTE is painless, safe&#xD;
      and non-invasive. Some drawbacks of TTE are being expensive, bulky and needs advanced&#xD;
      training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, due to increased interest in minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring, multiple&#xD;
      new methods have become commercially available to assess CO: the arterial pulse aortic flow,&#xD;
      bioreactance, and bioimpedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of these new devices is LiDCOrapid (LiDCO Ltd, Cambridge, UK). It is a new, minimally&#xD;
      invasive monitor which estimates beat-by-beat CO and fluid responsiveness from the arterial&#xD;
      waveform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been validated after vascular, urological and thoracic surgery and shows good&#xD;
      agreement with the PA catheter in swine, in patients with normal left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      function and in patients with vasodilatation. However, LiDCO has not yet been validated in&#xD;
      patients with septic shock. Therefore, the aim of this study is to validate LiDCOrapid&#xD;
      parameters in septic shock patients using TTE derived parameters as the non-invasive&#xD;
      reference.&#xD;

      Obtaining a patient's cardiac output (CO) could contribute to optimized, safe hemodynamic&#xD;
      control. Accurate CO measurements can serve as a guide for resuscitation therapy,&#xD;
      catecholamine use, differential diagnosis, and intervention during a circulatory failure.&#xD;
      Although the thermodilution technique via a pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) has an invasive&#xD;
      and intermittent, it remains the gold standard for CO measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously monitoring of CO required invasive and costly devices limiting their use to&#xD;
      intensive care setting. More recently ultrasound is increasingly being used and offers a&#xD;
      range of non-invasive tools to estimate CO.&#xD;
