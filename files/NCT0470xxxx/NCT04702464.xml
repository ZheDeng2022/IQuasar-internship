  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test the effect of fluconazole (a dual CYP2C19 and CYP3A4&#xD;
      inhibitor) on the Pharmacokinetics (PK) of fedratinib. Knowledge of these effects can be used&#xD;
      to determine if dose adjustments should be considered when fedratinib is coadministered with&#xD;
      drugs that are dual CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none&#xD;
      of the exclusion criteria will return to the clinical site on Day -1 for protocol-specified&#xD;
      assessments, and will be domiciled at the clinical site from Day -1 to Day 27.&#xD;

             documentation required) at least 6 months before Screening, or postmenopausal (defined&#xD;
             as 24 consecutive months without menses before Screening, with a follicle-stimulating&#xD;
             hormone [FSH] level in the post-menopausal range according to the laboratory used at&#xD;
             Screening).&#xD;

          5. Females of childbearing potential (FCBP1) must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Have a negative pregnancy test as verified by the investigator at Screening and&#xD;
                  Baseline (prior to starting study treatment). She must agree to ongoing pregnancy&#xD;
                  testing during the course of the study and after end of study treatment. This&#xD;
                  applies even if the subject practices true abstinence2 from heterosexual contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Either commit to true abstinence from heterosexual contact (which must be&#xD;
                  reviewed on a monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to&#xD;
                  use, and be able to comply with, any one of the following highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception methods without interruption, beginning at least 14 days prior to&#xD;
                  starting investigational product (IP), during the study treatment, and for at&#xD;

             monthly basis, as applicable, and source documented) or agree to use a barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control (condoms not made from natural [animal] membrane [latex condoms are&#xD;
             recommended]) during sexual contact with a pregnant female or FCBP while receiving&#xD;
             study treatment, and for at least 30 days after the last dose of IP, even if he has&#xD;
             undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must have a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 33 kg/m2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Must be healthy, as determined by the Investigator on the basis of medical history,&#xD;
             physical examination (PE), clinical laboratory test results, vital signs, and 12-lead&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening and check-in (Day -1), as applicable:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), ALT, and total bilirubin must be at or below the&#xD;
             upper limit of the reference range on or before check-in (Day -1). Other clinical&#xD;
             laboratory results must be either within normal range or deemed not clinically&#xD;
             significant by the Investigator. Any out of range lab tests may be repeated up to 1&#xD;
             time during Screening and up to 1 time at check-in per Investigator discretion to&#xD;
             confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Must be afebrile (febrile is defined as ≥ 38°C or 100.3°F).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Supine systolic blood pressure (BP) must be in the range of 90 to 150 mmHg&#xD;
             (inclusive), supine diastolic BP must be in the range of 50 to 90 mmHg (inclusive),&#xD;
             and pulse rate must be in the range of 45 to 90 bpm (inclusive) at Screening. Any out&#xD;
             of range vital sign measurements may be repeated up to 1 time during Screening and up&#xD;
             to 1 time at check-in per Investigator discretion to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has a normal or clinically acceptable 12-lead ECG at screening; male subjects&#xD;
             must have a corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) value ≤ 430 msec&#xD;
             and females must have a QTcF value ≤ 450 msec. An ECG may be repeated up to 2 times,&#xD;
             and the average of the QTcF values will be used to determine subject eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from enrollment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. History (within 3 years prior to Screening) of any clinically significant&#xD;
             neurological, GI, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine,&#xD;
             hematological, dermatological, psychological, or other major disorders as determined&#xD;
             by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any condition, including the presence of laboratory abnormalities, that places the&#xD;
             subject at unacceptable risk if he or she were to participate in the study or&#xD;
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study (congenital nonhemolytic&#xD;
             hyperbilirubinemia [eg, Gilbert's syndrome] is not acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has prior history of Wernicke's Encephalopathy (WE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has signs or symptoms of WE (eg, ataxia, ocular paralysis, or cerebellar&#xD;
             signs) without documented exclusion of WE by thiamine level and brain magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has thiamine deficiency, defined as thiamine levels in whole blood below&#xD;
             normal range according to institutional standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Use of any prescribed systemic or topical medication, including vaccines, within 30&#xD;
             days of the first dose administration (with the exception of ondansetron administered&#xD;
             for purposes of this study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Use of any nonprescribed systemic or topical medication (including vitamin/mineral&#xD;
             supplements and herbal medicines) within 14 days of the first dose administration&#xD;
             (with the exception of acetaminophen up to 2 grams/day for no more than 3 consecutive&#xD;
             days to treat minor illness or headache [per Investigator judgment]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use of any metabolic enzyme or relevant transporter inhibitors or inducers that would&#xD;
             affect the relevant drugs within 30 days of the first dose administration unless&#xD;
             determined by the Investigator that there will be no impact on the study integrity or&#xD;
             subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The Indiana University &quot;P450 Drug Interaction Table&quot; should be used to determine&#xD;
             inhibitors and/or inducers of metabolic enzymes&#xD;
             (http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table/aspx). The Sponsor should be contacted&#xD;
             for questions about potential drug-drug interactions and exclusions/prohibitions when&#xD;
             necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Exposure to an investigational drug (new chemical entity) within 30 days preceding the&#xD;
             first dose administration or 5 half-lives of that investigational drug, if known&#xD;
             (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Presence of any surgical or medical conditions possibly affecting drug absorption,&#xD;
             distribution, metabolism, and excretion (eg, bariatric procedure, cholecystectomy).&#xD;
             Appendectomy is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Donated blood or plasma within 8 weeks before the first dose administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of drug abuse (as defined by the current version of the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual [DSM]) within 2 years before dosing or positive drug screening test&#xD;
             reflecting consumption of illicit drugs.&#xD;
