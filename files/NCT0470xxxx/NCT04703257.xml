  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate if the combination of metamizole and paracetamol is superior&#xD;
      in reducing post-operative pain on day 1 after ambulatory shoulder surgery where the use of&#xD;
      NSAIDs is prohibited compared to paracetamol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a monocenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled superiority trial&#xD;
      will be designed to investigate the superiority of the combination of metamizole and&#xD;
      paracetamol compared to paracetamol treatment in patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder&#xD;
      surgery with tendon repair.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an ambulatory setting, good post-operative analgesia is challenging because patients have&#xD;
      to control pain at home by themselves, in the absence of hospital staff. Moreover, there is a&#xD;
      limit in the type of analgesia that is available (i.e. no strong opioids) as well as in the&#xD;
      route of administration (i.e. no epidural, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular route)&#xD;
      at home. Nowadays a multimodal approach based on a combination of paracetamol, non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and, if necessary, weak opioids to control pain has been&#xD;
      advocated in the ambulatory setting. Local and regional anesthesia also has been advocated in&#xD;
      the ambulatory setting to relieve pain for 8 to 24 hours after surgery. Despite this&#xD;
      multimodal pain therapy, the prevalence of outpatients suffering from moderate to severe&#xD;
      acute postoperative pain at home remains high and varies from 9 to 40%. More specifically,&#xD;
      some patients seem to be at high risk to develop moderate to severe pain on the fourth&#xD;
      postoperative day, among which patients undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides this high prevalence, recent findings suggest that the use of NSAIDs is detrimental&#xD;
      to tendon healing, especially in early stages. This negative impact is due to its effect on&#xD;
      both proliferation and migration of tendon cells, as well as the inflammation reaction&#xD;
      involved in the healing process and the bone growth necessary for tendon-to-bone healing.&#xD;
      Healing of injured tendon proceeds through three phases: inflammation, regeneration, and&#xD;
      remodeling/maturation. The initial phase involves an inflammatory response, in which the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)/prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) pathway is of major&#xD;
      importance. In the regenerative phase of a tendon injury, tendon cells migrate towards a&#xD;
      repair site, proliferate and deposit extracellular matrix (ECM) in the tissue. The expression&#xD;
      of paxillin, a positive regulator of cell mobility, is downregulated by ibuprofen, resulting&#xD;
      in inhibited tendon cell migration. Moreover, treatment decreases DNA synthesis and gene&#xD;
      expression in tendon cells, harming proliferation, and interfering with normal processes of&#xD;
      ECM remodeling. Furthermore, the resulting p21CYP1 expression and decreased Rb protein&#xD;
      phosphorylation are associated with inhibited proliferation. Additionally, the inhibition of&#xD;
      COX-enzymes associated with PGE-2 inhibition may lead to impaired osteoblast differentiation,&#xD;
      essential for tendon-to-bone healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On top of that, NSAIDs are not always sufficiently effective, can have numerous&#xD;
      contraindications, and are therefore not suitable in up to 25% of all patients. These&#xD;
      controversies implicate the need for alternative pain therapy. Metamizole (dipyrone) is a&#xD;
      non-opioid compound with strong analgesic, antipyretic, and spasmolytic effects. The&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of intravenous or intramuscular metamizole for pain relief after inpatient&#xD;
      surgery is well described. Recently, we showed in a prospective, double-blind, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that the combination of paracetamol and metamizole is equally effective in&#xD;
      the treatment of acute postoperative pain at home after ambulatory surgery compared to&#xD;
      paracetamol and ibuprofen. Moreover, patient satisfaction was equal in both groups, as well&#xD;
      as the reported side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple mechanisms are involved in the antinociceptive effects of metamizole. More&#xD;
      particularly, the inhibition of COX-1 and -2 enzymes and the activation of the&#xD;
      endocannabinoid and opioidergic system. This seems partly similar to the working mechanism of&#xD;
      NSAIDs, suggesting a theoretical presumption that metamizole also harms tendon repair.&#xD;
      However, metamizole is not classified as an NSAID and no detrimental effect of metamizole on&#xD;
      tendon healing and no link between metamizole and the previously described mechanism has been&#xD;
      reported in the literature. The most important advantage of metamizole compared with NSAIDs&#xD;
      is its favorable gastro-intestinal and cardiovascular side effect profile. Therefore,&#xD;
      replacing NSAIDs with metamizole in the standard approach in surgeries where NSAIDs are&#xD;
      contraindicated such as shoulder arthroscopies with tendon repair may increase the overall&#xD;
      suitability of postoperative pain therapy.&#xD;
