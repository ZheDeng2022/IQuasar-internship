  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: The purpose was to investigate whether modifiable risk factors for type 2 diabetes can&#xD;
      be reduced by an intensive healthy lifestyle intervention designed for Arab Muslim women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Women were assigned randomly to either an Exercise and Nutrition Group (ENG) or a&#xD;
      Control Group (CG). The ENG attended a women-only supervised exercise program that presented&#xD;
      Arabic music and traditional Lebanese Dabka steps three times/week in the Mosque Gym for 12&#xD;
      weeks. A nutritionist was available one hour/week for nutrition education. The CG followed&#xD;
      their typical day.&#xD;

      Women were assigned randomly using a computer-generated random numbers table to either an&#xD;
      Exercise and Nutrition Group (ENG) or a Control Group (CG). The women received step-by-step&#xD;
      instructions on how to complete a consecutive 3-day food record (including two week-days and&#xD;
      one weekend day) and an exercise log for 7 days using a pedometer (YAMAX SW-200 Digi-Walker)&#xD;
      to determine steps/day. The information and instruction were delivered to the women in&#xD;
      English or Arabic. Body weight and height were measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and 0.1 cm,&#xD;
      respectively. Women came to the lab after a 12 hour fast and a blood sample was drawn. Waist&#xD;
      and hip measurements were taken along with resting blood pressure. Estimated fitness levels&#xD;
      was measured by a trained kinesiologist using a Step Test (Siconolfi et al. 1985). All&#xD;
      baseline measurements, including the 3-day food intake record and the 7-day pedometer step&#xD;
      count log were repeated at the end of the 12-week intervention in both groups. The ENG group&#xD;
      attended a supervised women-only exercise program that presented Arabic music and traditional&#xD;
      dance steps (the Lebanese Dabka) three times a week in the London Muslim Mosque Gym and&#xD;
      received nutrition education over the 12 weeks, one session per week.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group attended a supervised exercise program for women only that presented Arabic music and traditional dance steps (the Lebanese Dabka) three times a week in the London Muslim Mosque Gym. The intervention lasted 12 weeks. There was also a nutrition education component that occurred once per week for the duration of the intervention. The lifestyle intervention group was instructed to walk 10,000 steps per day for the 12 weeks of the program. They were given instructions to take a 30-min walk on days when no formal exercise sessions were offered.</description>
