  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test tools that will be part of a platform for training and&#xD;
      supervision of mental health and psychosocial support helpers, including providers without&#xD;
      specialized training in mental health. This platform, entitled Ensuring Quality in&#xD;
      Psychological Support, is an online resource being developed to include: materials for&#xD;
      evaluating core and specific competencies, training on core competencies, implementation&#xD;
      guidance to conduct competency-based training. The Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support&#xD;
      platform is designed to aid trainers and supervisors working with providers being trained to&#xD;
      deliver World Health Organization and non-World Health Organization low-intensity&#xD;
      psychological interventions. The research will address two study objectives: Objective 1.&#xD;
      Determine feasibility, acceptability, and perceived utility of the Ensuring Quality in&#xD;
      Psychological Support platform; Objective 2. Evaluate the reliability, validity, and&#xD;
      sensitivity to change of Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support competency assessment&#xD;
      tools. To maximize generalizability of findings, Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support&#xD;
      will be evaluated in seven countries: Ethiopia, Kenya, Lebanon, Peru, Uganda, Zambia and&#xD;
      Jordan. The sites are varied by types of psychological intervention, beneficiaries,&#xD;
      experience of trainers, and background of trainees. In each site, trainers will train&#xD;
      non-specialist providers on a low-intensity psychological intervention.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is increasing evidence that non-specialist or minimally trained mental health providers&#xD;
      can effectively provide support and deliver psychosocial support and low-intensity&#xD;
      psychological interventions for common mental disorders and substance use disorders in low&#xD;
      resource settings. Psychological treatments delivered by non-specialists in low-resource&#xD;
      settings have effectiveness comparable to high-income country studies of specialist&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low intensity interventions refer to interventions that do not rely on specialists and are&#xD;
      modified, brief evidence-based therapies including guide self-help and e-mental health. The&#xD;
      World Health Organization identifies such interventions as being: brief, basic,&#xD;
      non-specialist-delivered versions of existing evidence-based psychological treatments (e.g.,&#xD;
      basic versions of cognitive-behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy); and may include&#xD;
      self-help materials (e.g., self-help books, audiovisual materials, and online or app-based&#xD;
      self-help interventions); individual or group programs, and designed to be age-appropriate&#xD;
      (i.e., delivered differently for children and adults). Moreover, low intensity interventions&#xD;
      are particularly well suited to communities affected by adversity, as they use fewer&#xD;
      resources which make them more scalable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychosocial refers to interventions that are designed to address the psychological effects&#xD;
      of conflict [or adversity], including the effects on behavior, emotion, thoughts, memory and&#xD;
      functioning, and social effects, including changes in relationships, social support and&#xD;
      economic status. The term psychosocial emphasizes, the close connection between psychological&#xD;
      aspects of experience and wider social aspects of experience, inclusive of human capacity,&#xD;
      social ecology, and culture and values. For the purpose of this study, low intensity&#xD;
      psychological and psychosocial interventions were selected using the criteria above, and&#xD;
      ensuring the interventions are freely accessible to the public.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assure success of such interventions outside the context of resource-intensive research&#xD;
      trials, it is crucial to develop training and supervision programs that produce competent&#xD;
      providers of psychological and psychosocial support interventions. A necessary element to&#xD;
      achieve this goal is development of standardized tools and procedures to assess the&#xD;
      competency of those trained to deliver them; while ensuring competency assessment results are&#xD;
      easily understandable to trainers and supervisors so that they can remediate areas of low&#xD;
      competency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of psychological and psychosocial interventions, competency refers the extent&#xD;
      to which a therapist [including non-specialists] has the knowledge and skill required to&#xD;
      deliver a treatment to the standard needed for it to achieve its expected effects. Competency&#xD;
      is typically assessed through structured role-plays in which trained standardized [mock]&#xD;
      clients elicit trainee's ability to perform the key skills of an intervention. Role-plays&#xD;
      such as this are commonly used in health professional training and evaluation in the form of&#xD;
      observed structured clinical evaluations with simulated patients. The Ensuring Quality in&#xD;
      Psychological Support initiative was developed out of need to have easily implementable&#xD;
      competency evaluation tools and remediation training materials that can be used with&#xD;
      specialists and non-specialists in diverse global settings. To supplement the platform,&#xD;
      Ensuring Quality in Psychological Support will also include various implementation, trainer&#xD;
      and training resources and guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for these competency assessment tools and training materials was identified in May&#xD;
      2018, during a Theory of Change Workshop conducted by the World Health Organization Ensuring&#xD;
      Quality in Psychological Support team with frontline psychological service practitioners,&#xD;
      clinicians, non-governmental organization training and supervision staff, and researchers.&#xD;
      The four key elements of the platform will be (a) competency tools for evaluation of&#xD;
      non-specific (core competencies or common factors) and specific practice elements (or&#xD;
      treatment specific factors); (b) role-play vignettes for conducting competency evaluations;&#xD;
      (c) instructional materials on how to conduct competency evaluations (training standardized&#xD;
      clients, establishing inter-rater reliability when conducting competency evaluations, using&#xD;
      rating tools, interpreting results); and (d) instructional materials on how to integrate&#xD;
      competency evaluations into trainings and supervision (giving feedback to participants,&#xD;
      modifying training programs, feedback to trainers and supervisors) including core competency&#xD;
      training and remediation materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goals and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to inform development of the Ensuring Quality in Psychological&#xD;
      Support platform and its tools, ensuring feasibility, acceptability, utility, reliability,&#xD;
      and validity to support the provision of quality psychological support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the feasibility, acceptability, and perceived utility, of the Ensuring Quality&#xD;
           in Psychological Support platform to facilitate assessment of competency and employ&#xD;
           competency assessment results and remediation training materials to support training and&#xD;
           supervision of non-specialists on low-intensity psychological interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the reliability, validity, and sensitivity to change of Ensuring Quality in&#xD;
           Psychological Support competency assessment tools based on inter-rater reliability of&#xD;
           the tools within and between sites, ability to detect changes in competency over the&#xD;
           course of training and supervision, and association with trainer ratings, as well as&#xD;
           service delivery metrics and client outcomes across different psychological&#xD;
           interventions and implementation sites.&#xD;
