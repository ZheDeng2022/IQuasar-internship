      Use of tranexamic acid (TXA) for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) after&#xD;
      cesarean section in high-risk patients ( a randomized control trial ).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be divided into two groups: a study group &amp; a control group. In addition to&#xD;
      the standard management, the study group will be given TXA 1 gm (100 mg/ml) slowly&#xD;
      intravenous infusion during delivery after clamping of the cord (administered over 10 minutes&#xD;
      at 1 ml/minute).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second dose of TXA 1 g Intravenous can be given if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding continues after 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding restarts within 24 hours of completing the first dose While the control group&#xD;
           will not be given TXA and we will compare the results in both groups (amount of blood&#xD;
           loss during operation to assess efficacy of TXA in prevention of PPH and reduction of&#xD;
           intra and postoperative blood loss and to assess its safety and benefit in the reduction&#xD;
           of incidence of hysterectomy or blood transfusion requirements).&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Scheduled or unscheduled cesarean delivery. Singleton or twin gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women at high risk for PPH after cesarean section:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Placenta previa, accreta, increta or percreta. haematocrit (HCT) &lt; 30%. Bleeding at&#xD;
        admission. History of Postpartum haemorrhage. Abnormal vital signs (hypotension or&#xD;
        tachycardia). Previous Cesarean or uterine surgery. More than four previous deliveries.&#xD;
        Multiple Gestation. Large Uterine fibroids. Chorioamnionitis. Magnesium sulphate use.&#xD;
        Prolonged use of oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age less than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who are not at high risk for PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women attending for normal vaginal delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pre-existing maternal hemorrhagic conditions such as Factor 8 deficiency - haemophilia&#xD;
             A carrier, Factor 9 deficiency - haemophilia B carrier or Von Willebrand's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Recent diagnosis or history of venous thromboembolism or arterial thrombosis because&#xD;
             TXA is a risk factor for thromboembolism, and its use is contraindicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known congenital or acquired thrombophilias, including antiphospholipid antibody&#xD;
             syndrome, because of the increased risk of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Autoimmune diseases such as lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's disease, and&#xD;
             inflammatory bowel disease because of hypercoagulability and the increased risk of&#xD;
             thrombosis or thromboembolism&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Need for a therapeutic dose of anticoagulation before delivery, because the risk of&#xD;
             thrombosis may be increased with TXA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Hypersensitivity to TXA or any of its ingredients.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Transfusion or planned transfusion of any blood products during the current admission&#xD;
             because the primary outcome is already pre-determined and the need for transfusion&#xD;
             will be unrelated to perioperative haemorrhage&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Seizure disorder (including eclampsia), and its use has been associated with&#xD;
             postoperative seizures..&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Active cancer, because of the risk of thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Congestive heart failure requiring treatment, because of the risk of thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. If there is no haemoglobin and hematocrit result available from the last 4 weeks since&#xD;
             it is necessary to measure the postoperative change in haemoglobin and hematocrit.&#xD;
