  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a chronic disease associated with multiple acute decompensations, which&#xD;
      are the main cause of hospital admission above 65 years and two thirds of the high costs&#xD;
      associated with the disease. Furthermore, in the patient they reflect a phase of clinical&#xD;
      instability, with a higher risk of early readmission (20-30% at 30 days) and higher mortality&#xD;
      (10-15% at 30 days and 30-40% at 1year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the investigators do not have treatments specifically aimed at this unstable phase,&#xD;
      known as acute or decompensated (HF). It is known that, in this acute and unstable state,&#xD;
      there is an increase in inflammatory parameters. Indeed, our group has recently demonstrated&#xD;
      the relevance of the interleukin-1 axis, in particular IL-1beta and sST2 concentrations&#xD;
      identified a worse prognosis regardless of HF phenotype. Colchicine, a widely available drug,&#xD;
      has proven to be a powerful cardiovascular anti-inflammatory, acting on inflammasome and&#xD;
      therefore inhibiting the production of IL1-beta.The study hypothesis is that colchicine&#xD;
      administered early during the acute phase can promote stability in terms of biomarkers of&#xD;
      cardiac function and new decompensations. For this it is designed a randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical study with two arms (colchicine 0.5 mg vs. placebo) initiated within the first 24&#xD;
      hours of hospitalisation and administered for 60 days, in patients with acute decompensated&#xD;
      HF with either reduced or preserved LV ejection fraction.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is the reduction of NT-proBNP at two months of treatment.&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to attain a greater clinical stability, in terms of reduction of new&#xD;
      HF decompensations and need for diuretics, and symptoms improvement. The calculated&#xD;
      population size is 278 patients. Follow-up visits will be carried out at discharge, 7 days, 4&#xD;
      weeks and 8 weeks after the hospital discharge. The potential of the study is very high given&#xD;
      the high prevalence and clinical impact of HF hospitalizations, together with the absence of&#xD;
      specific treatment for this phase of the disease. Therefore, in case of a positive result,&#xD;
      this would mean a huge clinical, social and health benefits, as well as being an important&#xD;
      therapeutic progress.&#xD;
