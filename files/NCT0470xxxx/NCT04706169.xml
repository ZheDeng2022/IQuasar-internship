  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional descriptive study, in which the surface electromyographic activity of five&#xD;
      shoulder muscles was compared in two populations: older adults and adults. The evaluation of&#xD;
      the electromyographic data offers a suitable foundation to understand aging process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This supports that surface electromyography provide information about the aged shoulder&#xD;
      muscles. Loss of functionality is suffered by a high percentage of older adults, which&#xD;
      greatly limits their physical activity. In this sense, this paper presents findings that&#xD;
      might be related with possible therapeutic approaches in subsequent studies.&#xD;

      Aging processes in the musculoskeletal system lead to functional impairments that restrict&#xD;
      participation. Purpose: To assess differences in force and motor recruitment patterns of&#xD;
      shoulder muscles between age groups to understand functional disorders. A cross-sectional&#xD;
      study comparing thirty adults (20-64) and 30 older adults (&gt;65). Surface-electromyography&#xD;
      (sEMG) of the middle deltoid, upper and lower trapezius, infraspinatus and serratus anterior&#xD;
      muscles was recorded. Maximum isometric voluntary contraction (MIVC) was determined at 45°&#xD;
      glenohumeral abduction. For the sEMG signal registration, concentric and excentric&#xD;
      contraction with and without 1 kg and isometric contraction were requested. Participants&#xD;
      abducted the arm from 0° up to an abduction angle of 135° for concentric and excentric&#xD;
      contraction; and from 0º to 45º and remained there at 80% of the MIVC level while&#xD;
      isometrically pushing against a handheld dynamometer. Differences in sEMG amplitudes (root&#xD;
      mean square, RMS) of all contractions, but also onset latencies during concentric contraction&#xD;
      of each muscle between age groups were analyzed. Statistical differences in strength&#xD;
      (Adults&gt;Older adults;0.05) existed between groups. No significant differences in RMS values&#xD;
      of dynamic contractions were detected, except for serratus anterior, but there were for&#xD;
      isometric contraction of all muscles analyzed (Adults&gt;Older adults;0.05). The recruitment&#xD;
      order varied between age groups, showing a general tendency towards delayed onset times in&#xD;
      Older Adults, except for the upper trapezius muscle. Age differences in muscle recruitment&#xD;
      patterns were found, which underscores the importance of developing musculoskeletal data to&#xD;
      prevent and guide geriatric shoulder pathologies.&#xD;

    <description>The electromyographic data were captured simultaneously on a computer by using the LabChart® software. Within the time interval from 2 to 4 seconds after contraction initiation a power spectrum analysis was performed together with the determination of RMS values. The mean RMS values were automatically obtained from the software.</description>

    <description>SEMG was used to measure the amplitude and onset of five shoulder muscle electrical signal, performing glenohumeral abduction. In this movement, the middle deltoid muscle was selected because it is a main motor. The infraspinatus muscle represented the rotator cuff muscle group. The middle deltoid muscle was selected as the representative of shoulder abduction because it is a main motor in this movement. The trapezius muscle and the serratus anterior muscle were chosen as representative established of the ascending scapular rotator muscles.</description>
