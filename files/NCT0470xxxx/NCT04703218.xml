      Study context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature identifies more and more research revealing olfactory disorders, with a high&#xD;
      frequency after an acquired brain injury. So far, studies have mainly focused on&#xD;
      post-traumatic and post-infectious olfactory disorders of the upper airways. There is scarcer&#xD;
      data available on the olfactory disorders occurring after stroke. A recent study found 43.6%&#xD;
      of patients with a loss of olfactory function after a stroke (2). This type of disorder can&#xD;
      have repercussions in everyday life and endanger people, not being able to smell a burning&#xD;
      odor or gas fumes. In addition, patients frequently describe loss of pleasure associated with&#xD;
      these olfactory disorders (3). Tests allowing the evaluation of these difficulties exist but&#xD;
      remain little used in clinical routine (4). These psychophysical tests allow a quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of the olfactory capacities of subjects through various measures such as the&#xD;
      detection threshold (T SST sub-score), discrimination (D SST sub-score) or the identification&#xD;
      of an odor. (SST sub-score I). Some studies have shown a reduction in olfactory disturbances&#xD;
      following specific training. Thus, Hummel et al. proposed a self-stimulation protocol to&#xD;
      patients whose olfactory dysfunction was due to various aetiologies (post-infectious,&#xD;
      post-traumatic or idiopathic) (5). People were to smell 4 scents twice a day for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      The results show an improvement in the olfaction of the patients, while no change was noted&#xD;
      in the subjects who did not perform the training. Lehrer et al. obtained similar results in&#xD;
      patients with head trauma (CT) after 3 months of training (6). However, no study has looked&#xD;
      at the effect of specific olfaction training in post-stroke patients. The few data available&#xD;
      in the literature suggest that these disorders are common after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose an open, randomized controlled study, comparing the SST score between the group of&#xD;
      patients who received olfactory training and the group who received standard rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the treatment of post-stroke olfactory disorders, we will suggest to patients hospitalized&#xD;
      in SSR or followed in consultation to participate in a controlled, randomized open study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be assessed using the SST and the modified ASOF quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire (7). After randomization, patients in the treatment group will benefit from a&#xD;
      presentation of specific olfaction training. This training consists of smelling 4 scents&#xD;
      twice a day using scent sticks, for 12 weeks. At the end of these 12 weeks, a post-protocol&#xD;
      evaluation including the SST, the modified ASOF quality of life questionnaire and a&#xD;
      measurement of any side effects related to training will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of a specific olfaction training&#xD;
      protocol in patients with olfaction disorders following stroke.&#xD;
