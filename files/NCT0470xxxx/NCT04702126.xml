  <brief_summary>

      Besides normal aging, genetic and environmental factors are important potential determinants&#xD;
      of lumbar disc degeneration. Smoking causes serious health problems, particularly lung and&#xD;
      other cancers, heart disease and respiratory diseases, and is among the most common causes of&#xD;
      death worldwide. Besides these commonly known diseases related to smoking numerous studies&#xD;
      have shown that smoking has detrimental effects on the musculoskeletal system and worsens the&#xD;
      prognosis and treatment of leukomotor diseases. In the literature there are studies examining&#xD;
      the effect of smoking status on disc degeneration. The aim of the study was to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of current, former and passive smoking status on degeneration of lumbar&#xD;
      intervertebral discs.&#xD;

      This retrospective study was performed by obtaining medical records of patients who underwent&#xD;
      lumbar spinal MRI between September 2019 and February 2020. After the application of&#xD;
      exclusion criteria 955 patients determined between the specified dates. These patients were&#xD;
      called by phone to be questioned about their smoking status and whether they were working in&#xD;
      heavy work and whether they were athletes. Heavy workers and athletes were also excluded from&#xD;
      the study and a total of 360 patients whose smoking status information could be obtained were&#xD;
      included in the study.The patients were grouped according to their smoking status as &quot;current&#xD;
      smoker&quot;, &quot;former smoker&quot;, &quot;non-smoker&quot; and &quot;passive smoker&quot;. The cumulative smoking dose for&#xD;
      current and former smokers was calculated in terms of pack-years and categorized further into&#xD;
      two subgroups: smoked ≤9 pack-years or &gt;9 pack-years. The number of pack-years was calculated&#xD;
      by dividing the number of cigarettes consumed per day by 20 and multiplying by the years that&#xD;
      the patient had smoked. Age, gender, weight, and height were recorded, and body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) was calculated as weight/(height)2. Lumbar spinal MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla&#xD;
      imaging system (General Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), using the following settings:&#xD;
      amplitude: 44 mT/m; slew rate gradient configuration: 200 T/m/s. MRI images were evaluated&#xD;
      using a GE Advantage Workstation (GE Healthcare, Buc, France) and Volume Share software&#xD;
      v.7.0. The lumbar lordosis angle was measured and the lumbar intervertebral discs were&#xD;
      evaluated by Pfirrmann disc degeneration grading system using sagittal T2-weighted MR images&#xD;
      (TR/TE: 2500/85 ms, matrix: 320x224, slice thickness: 4 mm, FOV: 32) (23). The degree of&#xD;
      degeneration was classified into five grades with Grades IV and V considered as &quot;severe disc&#xD;
      degeneration&quot;. Radiologist reviewing the MRI studies was blinded to the smoking status of the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

    <description>The lumbar intervertebral discs of patients were evaluated by Pfirrmann disc degeneration grading system using sagittal T2-weighted MR images. The degree of degeneration was classified into five grades with Grades IV and V considered as &quot;severe disc degeneration&quot;. Severe disc degeneration was identified between the current, former, passive and non-smoker groups. The relationship between smoking status groups and severe disc degeneration was examined.</description>
