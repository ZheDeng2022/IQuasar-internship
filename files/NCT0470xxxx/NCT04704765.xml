      The research purpose is to investigate the effectiveness of abdominal breathing training on&#xD;
      reducing anxiety. This study is an experimental research design. Using a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial approach. The patients receiving the intervention of abdominal breathing&#xD;
      training were in the experimental group, while those who did not receive it were in the&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of the abdominal breathing training&#xD;
      on reducing anxiety. Using an experimental randomized controlled trial approach. The&#xD;
      experimental group receiving abdominal breathing training, and control group without&#xD;
      training. The effectiveness assessment used the Beck anxiety inventory, required to be&#xD;
      completed by both the experimental group and control group. This study performed the&#xD;
      pre-and-post assessments. This study performed the pre-test before the implementation of&#xD;
      abdominal breathing training, and performed the post-test at Week 4 and Week 8 the end of&#xD;
      abdominal breathing training. During this period, they received the abdominal breathing&#xD;
      training at the outpatient clinic (every day 30 minutes, can include every time during the&#xD;
      day). When the subjects were at home, they received self-training using the abdominal&#xD;
      breathing training video (once every day and 30 minutes every time).&#xD;
