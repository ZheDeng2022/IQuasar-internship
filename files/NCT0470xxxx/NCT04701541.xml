    <textblock>
      In this study the Authors assume that peri-operative changes in DIA are predictive of&#xD;
      postoperative atelectasis, thus providing a clinically useful tool to stratify the need for&#xD;
      high-intensity monitoring, including admission to intensive care. Aim of this prospective&#xD;
      observational study, in obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy, is to evaluate the&#xD;
      relationship between pre to postoperative changes in US-DIA and PaO2/FiO2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, are at high risk for postoperative respiratory&#xD;
      complications but predictive variables, risk factors and criteria for postoperative ICU&#xD;
      admission are debated. In these patients, postoperative respiratory complications are related&#xD;
      to various pathophysiological mechanisms that include: decreased lung volumes, respiratory&#xD;
      muscle dysfunction and atelectasis. Very recently it has also been demonstrated a possible&#xD;
      role of molecules that would mediate the fibro-adipogenic remodeling of the diaphragm in the&#xD;
      obese, thus increasing the respiratory disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary atelectasis appears within minutes after anesthesia induction, complicate 85-90% of&#xD;
      the cases -involving up to 15% of the lungs and inducing a 5 to 10% of cardiac output intra&#xD;
      pulmonary shunting- and determine an increased incidence of postoperative morbidity (with&#xD;
      higher incidence of pneumonia). Furthermore, in the perioperative period, obese patients are&#xD;
      more likely to develop atelectasis that resolves more slowly than in non-obese patients.&#xD;
      Surgical handling of sub diaphragmatic region, as during sleeve gastrectomy, can impair&#xD;
      diaphragmatic excursions thus contributing to postoperative pulmonary dysfunction. The same&#xD;
      upper abdominal surgery represents a risk factor for the development of pulmonary&#xD;
      complications in the perioperative period and alteration of the respiratory function indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasounds (US) imaging is a real-time, bedside, non-invasive technique that allows the&#xD;
      quantitative evaluation of amplitude, force and velocity of diaphragmatic movement,&#xD;
      including: diaphragmatic inspiratory amplitude (DIA) and diaphragmatic thickening. The US-DIA&#xD;
      is a qualified quantitative approach to assess diaphragmatic function and has been reported&#xD;
      to linearly correlate with vital capacity. Recent studies have also correlated diaphragmatic&#xD;
      dysfunction, which reduces the ability to generate total current volume, with the onset of&#xD;
      atelectasis, but in a very specialized and dedicated area such as thoracic surgery. The&#xD;
      originality of the study lies in the fact that the investigators have translated this method&#xD;
      of evaluation of diaphragmatic function, as a predictive index of pulmonary complications in&#xD;
      postoperative surgery, into a highly selected and clinically demanding type of patient, such&#xD;
      as the patient suffering from pathological obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several guidelines have been created at European level for the perioperative management of&#xD;
      the obese patient. One of the most recent is the one created by the Italian Society of&#xD;
      Anaesthesia Analgesia Rianimazione e Terapia Intensiva (SIAARTI), which commissioned an&#xD;
      &quot;Obesity Task Force&quot; of the Airway Management Study Group to coordinate a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      multi-professional consensus project to identify bundles of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs),&#xD;
      useful to define the risks in adult obese patients in hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In obese patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy there are no conclusive criteria for&#xD;
      discharge and indications to postoperative ICU admission, as recently defined for patients&#xD;
      with OSAS, the investigators hypothesize that perioperative change in US-DIA predicts&#xD;
      postoperative atelectasis, thus providing a clinically useful tool to stratify the need for&#xD;
      higher intensity monitoring including ICU admission.&#xD;

    <description>Obesity is a progressively growing morbid condition in the world, and given the direct relationship between body mass index (BMI) and costs, this has a major impact on economic and health policy. Obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery are at high risk for postoperative respiratory complications. In these patients, postoperative respiratory complications are related to various pathophysiological mechanisms that include: decreased lung volumes, respiratory muscle dysfunction and atelectasis. Demographic (age, gender, BMI) and clinical features of the population included: ASA, comorbidity and pre and postoperative respiratory function [PaO2/FiO2, haemogasanalysis (EGA)]. Ultrasound evaluation of DIA was performed.&#xD;
T0: preoperative within 24h before surgery: DIA, haemogasanalysis; T1: Post operation: 60 min after extubation: Aldrete Score, DIA, EGA; T2: Post operation: 240 min after extubation: Aldrete, EGA.</description>

    <description>Diaphragmatic ultrasound is non-invasive, portable, quick to perform, with a linear relationship between diaphragmatic movement and inspired volume. In eligible patients, a preoperative baseline ultrasound evaluation of the diaphragm and lungs is accomplished. Evaluation will be performed by a single operator, blinded to the arterial blood gas analysis values. In a semi recumbent position, patients will be asked to rest and breath quietly. An anterior approach will be carried out applying freehand transducer on abdomen at the right midclavicular line immediately below the costal margin with firm pressure, steering in cranial direction. A B-mode transverse scanning will be performed looking across the liver with gallbladder in the middle. Measurements will be recorded by the M-mode frozen images. The M-mode modality will be used to study DIA. The best sinusoidal curve will be considered for measurements.</description>
