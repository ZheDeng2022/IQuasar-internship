      The aim of the study is to investigate the efficacy of the thoracic combined spinal epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia in breast surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies of the regional anesthetic techniques such as erector spinae plane block and&#xD;
      pectoralis nerve blocks (PECs blocks) additional to general anesthesia have described their&#xD;
      use for postoperative analgesia in breast surgery. It has been also reported that these&#xD;
      blocks can be used to provide surgical anesthesia in breast surgery . Segmental thoracic&#xD;
      epidural anesthesia can be used as an alternative anesthetic technique in patients with&#xD;
      severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma undergoing breast surgery. It has&#xD;
      been also reported that thoracic spinal anesthesia was effective and successful in patients&#xD;
      undergoing laparoscopic surgery. In this study, efficacy of high thoracic spinal epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia in patients undergoing breast surgery will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>A combined spinal-epidural anesthesia set will be used for the block. Using the loss of resistance to saline technique, an 18 G Tuohy needle will be advanced to the T2-3 vertebral interspace with the mid-line approach. After confirming the epidural space, a 26 G pencil point spinal needle will be inserted slowly through the Tuohy needle to puncture the dura. After free flow of cerebrospinal fluid will be observed, local anesthetic wil be injected into the subarachnoid space over 15 secs. Then, an epidural catheter will be inserted into the epidural space.</description>
