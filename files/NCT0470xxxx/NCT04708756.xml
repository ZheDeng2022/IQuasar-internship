  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a clinical study to improve medication adherence among patients with hypertension in&#xD;
      Switzerland. Adult men and women who suffer from high blood pressure and have been prescribed&#xD;
      a therapy consisting of at least 4 tablets per day can participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to examine whether Collabree, a mobile phone application, is&#xD;
      effective in supporting patients with hypertension to more successfully following their&#xD;
      therapy plan. The study will also investigate if the use of Collabree can help lower blood&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 4 visits that take place during a 90-day adherence promotion program&#xD;
      plus a 90-day follow-up period. There is also a screening visit before the study to determine&#xD;
      whether the participants qualify for the study. The visits are carried out at the University&#xD;
      Hospital Basel. Each visit lasts about 1-2 hours. During the visits, blood pressure is&#xD;
      measured in the clinic and also through 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM).&#xD;
      Participants will also fill out questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of 3 groups in a ratio of 1: 1: 1. Two of these&#xD;
      groups will receive the Collabree mobile phone application. All participants will receive a&#xD;
      box for storing their antihypertensive medication. This box serves as a system for measuring&#xD;
      medication intake as it records the time the box is opened and closed. Standard care will&#xD;
      given to all participants.&#xD;
