  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the primary therapeutic procedure&#xD;
      for many bilio-pancreatic diseases, and requires the first crucial step of the successful&#xD;
      deep cannulation of the common bile duct through the Vater's papilla. Difficult biliary&#xD;
      cannulation (DBC) is a well-recognized risk factor for adverse events (AE) and cannulation&#xD;
      failure, which has been reported in about 11% of ERCP regardless of their indication and a&#xD;
      relevant heterogeneity in definition of DBC is present in the available studies. More&#xD;
      recently, DBC during ERCP has been precisely defined by the European Society of&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) as follows: more than 5 contacts with the papilla whilst&#xD;
      attempting to cannulate; more than 5 minutes spent attempting to cannulate after&#xD;
      visualization of the papilla; more than one unintended pancreatic duct cannulation or&#xD;
      opacification (4). To date, the rate of DBC has not been calculated for specific sub-groups&#xD;
      of ERCP indications. In particular, the rate of DBC in the setting of distal malignant&#xD;
      biliary obstruction (DMBO), a frequent indication for ERCP, has not yet been described. DMBO&#xD;
      is generally secondary to pancreatic adenocarcinoma, distal cholangiocarcinoma, ampullary&#xD;
      carcinomas or adenopathy/metastasis from other cancers, and could potentially increase the&#xD;
      complexity of the procedure as the tumor compression or infiltration alter the normal&#xD;
      duodenal/papillary anatomy or determine duodenal rigidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to investigate the rate of DBC and the outcome of patients undergoing&#xD;
      ERCP for DMBO.&#xD;
