  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter phase II trial including 2 cohorts of patients in&#xD;
      Refractory/Relapse disease at least 1 month after CAR T-cells therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cohort 1: DLBCL patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cohort 2: PMBL, mantle cell lymphoma, transformed indolent NHL (t-iNHL) or iNHL CAR&#xD;
           T-cells Refractory/Relapse status will be determined by PET-CT central review allowing&#xD;
           inclusion in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled will then receive a pre-phase of obinutuzumab followed by experimental&#xD;
      treatment:11 cycle of glofitamab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the anti-lymphoma activity of glofitamab, a&#xD;
      bispecific CD3xCD20 monoclonal antibody in patients with relapse/refractory DLBCL (cohort 1)&#xD;
      disease after anti-CD19 CAR T-cells therapy&#xD;
