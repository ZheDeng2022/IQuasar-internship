  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachytherapy treatment in gynecological cancers is an essential component to delivering&#xD;
      adequate doses of radiation to a tumour while sparing normal tissue. Interstitial or&#xD;
      intra-cavitary brachytherapy are often needed in advanced or recurrent disease, in cases&#xD;
      where intrauterine brachytherapy may not deliver the optimal outcome. Interstitial or&#xD;
      intra-cavitary brachytherapy are based on a defined template-and-needle system, and the&#xD;
      procedure relies on clinical examination and pre-treatment imaging to guide needle insertion.&#xD;
      There is currently no standard image-guided process to help direct needles in the pelvis. We&#xD;
      propose using 3D ultrasound to provide real-time imaging for the brachytherapy procedure,&#xD;
      which will aid in avoiding needle insertion into pelvic organs and result in optimal dose&#xD;
      coverage to the tumour.&#xD;

    <description>Device: Gynecological brachytherapy requiring an Interstitial or ring and tandem insert involves insertion of the needle and applicators with no standard real-time image guidance. Occasionally 2-dimensional ultrasound is used, but it greatly limited by its flat nature, preventing a volumetric view of the needle pathways. Interstitial brachytherapy is done under general anesthesia. The trans-abdominal and trans-rectal standard 2D ultrasound that are used in some cases, will be expanded to 3D dimensional imaging through the use of an investigational device. Pre-procedure imaging in the form of MRI is used to help guide needles insertion as well as the clinical exam. Post-procedure CT is done for radiation planning.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Females of age eighteen (18) or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with locally advanced or recurrent gynecological malignancies who are offered&#xD;
             interstitial or ring and tandem brachytherapy treatment. These typically would include&#xD;
             patients with primary or recurrent vaginal cancers, endometrial cancers or cervical&#xD;
             cancers. Histologies of these cancers are typically adenocarcinomas or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinomas&#xD;
