  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is designed to test the hypothesis that in human obesity, the balance of&#xD;
      pro- and anti-inflammatory T cells in fat tissue is in fact related to macrophage phenotype&#xD;
      and insulin resistance, and how it is related.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is needed to confirm whether conclusions based on studies of visceral adipose&#xD;
      tissue in mice are indeed applicable to humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to determine the relationship between insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia and&#xD;
      ability to lose weight in obese individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have found convincing evidence of the relationship between insulin&#xD;
      resistance, T cell profiles, macrophage profiles and inflammation of the fat cells. This&#xD;
      study will add human subjects to that body of evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that the balance of anti- inflammatory vs proinflammatory&#xD;
      T cells is protective for systemic insulin resistance. T cell profiles in subcutaneous and&#xD;
      visceral tissue and blood will be compared in IR vs IS obese humans at baseline and&#xD;
      potentially after 12 months following weight loss. Tcell profile will be evaluated for&#xD;
      relationships with IR and inflammation, with adjustment for total body fat. Secondarily, they&#xD;
      will be evaluated for relationship to adipose cell size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that macrophage phenotype in adipose tissue is associated&#xD;
      with T cell profile and IR. Frequency of macrophage phenotypes (M1 vs M2) will be analyzed in&#xD;
      IR vs IS obese humans at baseline and potentially after 12 months following weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Aim 3: Testing the hypothesis insulin resistance is associated with T cell receptor&#xD;
      phenotypes in subcutaneous and visceral tissue. IR and IS subjects will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline by sequencing of expressed TCRs in paired SAT, VAT, and blood. We will determine&#xD;
      whether TCR phenotypes are shared between different IR individuals.&#xD;
