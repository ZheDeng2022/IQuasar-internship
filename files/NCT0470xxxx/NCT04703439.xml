      Investigators evaluated the efficacy of a pilot-tested mHealth intervention to improving&#xD;
      medication adherence and health outcomes among patients with coronary heart disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a two-arm parallel randomized controlled trial, in which 116 and 114 participants&#xD;
      were assigned to the experimental and control groups, respectively. The mHealth intervention&#xD;
      in this study had been pilot tested and tailored. Specifically, the experimental group&#xD;
      received a medication-taking reminder every morning via WeChat app and educational materials&#xD;
      of coronary heart disease and medication adherence every five days via Message Express app.&#xD;
      The control group received only general educational materials, which were irrelevant to&#xD;
      coronary heart disease or medication adherence, every 5 days via Message Express app. All&#xD;
      participants were diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The specific recruitment criteria of&#xD;
      participants had been published in peer-reviewed journal.&#xD;
