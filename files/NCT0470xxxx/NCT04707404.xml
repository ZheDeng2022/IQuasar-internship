      Decompressive craniectomy is suggested as an effective surgical intervention for patients&#xD;
      with high intracranial pressure. Recently, various customized artificial materials are&#xD;
      increasingly employed, e.g., titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK). The application of&#xD;
      PEEK in cranioplasty is increasing, while its comprehensive evaluation in clinical practice&#xD;
      is still insufficient, especially when comparing with the effects of titanium implant. We&#xD;
      thus designed the study to evaluate the comprehensive effects of the cranioplasty with PEEK&#xD;
      vs titanium.&#xD;

      Decompressive craniectomy (DC) is suggested as an effective surgical intervention for&#xD;
      patients with high intracranial pressure. For the skull defect after DC, cranioplasty could&#xD;
      pro-vide protection, aesthetic and even functional improvements. The autologous bone flap&#xD;
      (ABF) was once thought to be an optimal autograft for repairing [8]. While accumulated&#xD;
      studies reported ABF related disadvantages. Recently, various customized artificial materials&#xD;
      are increasingly employed, e.g., titanium and polyetheretherketone (PEEK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Titanium is a widely applied metal material for cranioplasty, attribute to its high strength,&#xD;
      bio-compatibility and comparatively low material cost. Currently, pre-operative three&#xD;
      dimensional (3D) reconstruction of titanium brings a customized implant for optimal shaping&#xD;
      effect. However, titanium implant is still confronted with complications of infection,&#xD;
      implant exposure, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PEEK is a novel polymer used to rebuild the personalized construction. Through the precise&#xD;
      computational reconstruction of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scanning, the&#xD;
      customized PEEK could more accurately rebuild the complex cranial and maxillofacial&#xD;
      structure. The application of this material in cranioplasty is increasing, while its&#xD;
      comprehensive evaluation in clinical practice is still insufficient, especially when&#xD;
      comparing with the effects of titanium implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We thus designed the study to evaluate the comprehensive effects of the cranioplasty with&#xD;
      PEEK vs titanium. The data of the patients implanted PEEK or titanium in four years in our&#xD;
      institute were retrospectively collected and evaluated, in respects of the general&#xD;
      information of patients, postoperative complications, shaping effects, and psychosocial&#xD;
      improvements, to display a comprehensive evaluation for these two implants.&#xD;
