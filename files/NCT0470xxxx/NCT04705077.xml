      This study is a phase 1, open-label study to assess the single dose pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      suspension and capsule formulations of SR419 and repeat dose pharmacokinetics of capsule&#xD;
      formulation of SR419, and to assess the effect of a high-fat meal on the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      SR419 in healthy subjects.The trial will consist of 3 cohorts. Cohort 1 and 2 will follow a&#xD;
      single sequence, 3-period, 2-formulation, dosing in fasted or fed state design. Cohort 3 will&#xD;
      be a repeated dose study of SR419 capsule in healthy subjects.&#xD;
