  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced angle closure glaucoma (AACG) can result in severe visual function defect or even&#xD;
      blindness with or without acute attacks. Different from open angle glaucoma (OAG), the main&#xD;
      principle of treatment for AACG is not only to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) but also to&#xD;
      protect the anterior chamber angle from closing. Previously, the most common and classical&#xD;
      treatment for AACG was trabeculectomy. However, both doctors and patients are not satisfied&#xD;
      with this surgery because of its limited success rate due to fibrosis of the filtration&#xD;
      pathway. Besides, trabeculectomy has various complications, such as shallow anterior chamber,&#xD;
      choroidal effusion, suprachoroidal hemorrhage, malignant glaucoma, and bleb leakage&#xD;
      associated endophthalmitis. In addition, patients who underwent trabeculectomy will have&#xD;
      decreased visual acuity in a couple of years due to accelerated development of cataract.&#xD;
      Since a thickened and anterior-positioned lens could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of AACG, cataract surgery has also been used. Accumulative evidence shows lens extraction&#xD;
      alone is an efficient way in treating the early stage of ACG but has limited success rate in&#xD;
      AACG. Lens extraction combined with goniosynechialysis (LEG) has been proved to be better&#xD;
      than lens extraction alone in re-opening the anterior chamber angle for ACG patients with&#xD;
      extensive peripheral anterior synechia and possibly have better effect than trabeculectomy as&#xD;
      well from our preliminary data, which has not been proved yet. Thus, this investigation is&#xD;
      designed to compare the effect of LEG and trabeculectomy in AACG patients prospectively in 3&#xD;
      years of follow-up. The investigators hypothesize that LEG could have better IOP control and&#xD;
      better visual function than trabeculectomy in long term for AACG patients.&#xD;
