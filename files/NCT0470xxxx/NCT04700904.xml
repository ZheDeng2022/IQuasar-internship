      The objective is to test the accuracy and user satisfaction of the PortionSize™ app and the&#xD;
      MyFitnessPal© app during laboratory controlled test meals.&#xD;

      Accurately quantifying food intake is vital to promoting health and reducing chronic disease&#xD;
      risk. Food intake encompasses energy intake, nutrient intake (macronutrients, micronutrients,&#xD;
      vitamins, minerals), and intake of various food groups (e.g., fruits, vegetables), and thus&#xD;
      reflects the nutritional status of individuals. Nutrition affects disease risk, including&#xD;
      risk of developing obesity, diabetes, and cancer, all of which negatively affect the United&#xD;
      States (U.S). Nonetheless, accurate assessment of food and nutrient intake has remained&#xD;
      challenging, despite an improvement in methods. Self report methods, namely food records, are&#xD;
      a mainstay of nutritional epidemiology research, with food recall being another popular&#xD;
      method. These methods rely on the participant to accurately estimate portion size and, for&#xD;
      food recall, remember what was consumed. The accuracy of these methods have been questioned&#xD;
      and the problems with human recall have been comprehensively outlined. As a result, there&#xD;
      remains a significant need for methods that are sufficiently accurate to provide researchers&#xD;
      with good outcome data and to guide health promotion efforts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PortionSize™ app was designed by our laboratory to overcome the limitations outlined&#xD;
      above, and to guide users to follow specific diets. PortionSize relies on users capturing&#xD;
      images of their food selection and waste. Food intake data are immediately provided since the&#xD;
      user relies on built in tools, including templates, to estimate portion size. However,&#xD;
      despite promising early indications, the PortionSize app's validity has yet to be extensively&#xD;
      tested. Determining the accuracy of PortionSize is vital before users can utilize the app to&#xD;
      obtain immediate feedback about their food intake. We accordingly aim to test the validity of&#xD;
      PortionSize in a controlled laboratory setting. We will also test the validity of the&#xD;
      MyFitnessPal© app, which is similar to an electronic food record.&#xD;

    <description>The primary analyses assessing equivalence between PortionSize and the criterion measures (and MyFitnessPal and the criterion measures), will rely on equivalence testing using the Two One-side T-test (TOST) method. The criterion measure is directly weighed foods from simulated lunch meals. Differences in the observed error from PortionSize and MyFitnessPal will be compared with dependent t-tests, with error calculated as the difference between each experimental method and the criterion variable (e.g., energy intake values from PortionSize minus energy intake values from weighed foods). These procedures will also produce results indicating if the error from each method differs from zero.</description>
