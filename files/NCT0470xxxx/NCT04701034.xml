  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects around 5 % of women in reproductive age. The&#xD;
      underlying cause of RPL is most often unknown, probably multifactorial, and no treatment with&#xD;
      documented effect on chance of live birth exists. In unexplained cases of RPL, primarily the&#xD;
      immune system is hypothesized to play a pivotal, causative role, since autoantibodies and&#xD;
      specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as well as unbalanced distribution of&#xD;
      leucocyte subsets, especially natural killer (NK) cells and T-helper (Th) cells, occurs more&#xD;
      frequently in patients with unexplained RPL. For that reason, many treatment regimens used in&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases have been tested on RPL patients, as for example prednisolone and&#xD;
      intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVIg (Privigen) consist of a broad spectrum of structurally and functionally intact IgG&#xD;
      antibodies. The mechanism of action is not fully elucidated, but certainly IVIg do help&#xD;
      opsonise and neutralize foreign cells and pathogens. Prednisolone support this&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory action by suppressing migration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and&#xD;
      reducing volume of the immune system, capillary permeability, and immune cell activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective, observational pilot study suggested that a combination of prednisone and&#xD;
      IVIg in first trimester improves the chance of a live birth in women with RPL after assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technologies (ART) (Nyborg et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled study is necessary for determining if this immunomodulatory treatment&#xD;
      is definitely effective in patients with unexplained RPL after ART (defined as IVF or ICSI&#xD;
      treatment). Potentially, this study will be able to establish a new treatment to women with&#xD;
      unexplained RPL after ART, who otherwise have a poor prognosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, this study aims to investigate&#xD;
      whether treatment with prednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) before and in early&#xD;
      pregnancy improves the chance of a live birth in women undergoing treatment with artificial&#xD;
      reproductive technologies (ART) (defined as IVF or ICSI or FER treatment) after previous&#xD;
      recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) after ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an improved live birth rate can be confirmed, the treatment will be the first documented&#xD;
      treatment supplement for women undergoing ART treatment. A treatment with such effect is&#xD;
      highly desirable, and in addition to increased birth rate, it will potentially improve&#xD;
      quality of life and reduce detrimental anxiety and stress symptoms associated with RPL and&#xD;
      ART treatment, since the number of treatments and the number of losses will be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential study participants will be identified among patients who are referred to The Center&#xD;
      for Recurrent Pregnancy Loss of Western Denmark (in the following called The RPL Center),&#xD;
      located at Aalborg University Hospital (AaUH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first appointment at The RPL Center, a list of standard health information important&#xD;
      for the RPL examination will be collected together with the RPL Center's standard blood&#xD;
      sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: The participants will be randomly allocated 1:1 to active immunomodulatory&#xD;
      treatment versus placebo treatment (see Arms and Interventions). Study treatment starts on&#xD;
      the patient's first day of her menstrual cycle in which her fertility clinic plan to transfer&#xD;
      an embryo/blastocyst(s) and continue until a negative pregnancy test, the time of biochemical&#xD;
      pregnancy loss/miscarriage or pregnancy week 8+0, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 14 days after ET, the patient will have a pregnancy test. If positive, the&#xD;
      patient will have plasma-hCG measured twice with 1-2 days interval at her local hospital.&#xD;
      With adequate increment of plasma-hCG, the patient will be booked for her last 3 infusions in&#xD;
      gestational week 5, 6, and 7, and continue tablet intake. If she is not pregnant, study&#xD;
      medication will not continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the first infusion treatment and again approximately four weeks later (the day&#xD;
      of her third infusion treatment during pregnancy), a study specific blood sample will be&#xD;
      taken for our research biobank. In participants who do not achieve pregnancy or have a&#xD;
      miscarriage before gestational week 6 (and therefore do not come for the third infusion), we&#xD;
      will ask these participants to come for the second blood sample too. The blood samples will&#xD;
      be analysed by the Department of Clinical Immunology at AaUH. In addition, a group of 37&#xD;
      healthy female blood donors in reproductive age with no prior known pregnancy losses will&#xD;
      have one blood sample collected in their luteal phase and analyzed according to the same&#xD;
      protocol and will serve as a reference group to the two study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An immediate analysis of the blood sample will quantify NK-cells, B-cells, and T-cell subsets&#xD;
      by flow cytometry. Also, a TruCulture analysis for activity of leucocyte subsets will be&#xD;
      carried out in 25 patients. The research/future biobank will store frozen serum and plasma&#xD;
      for analysis of immune markers including smaller extracellular vesicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participant is still pregnant after her last infusion of study medicine before week&#xD;
      8+0, she will be offered routine monitoring at The RPL Center at AaUH, at her local fertility&#xD;
      clinic, and her local hospital. She will receive a questionnaire 2 weeks after her nuchal&#xD;
      scan and 2 weeks after her due date for collection of data regarding her pregnancy, delivery,&#xD;
      and perinatal outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-relevant data will be collected from medical records, birth records, questionnaires,&#xD;
      and the research biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be recorded on all participants from the day of admission and until 6&#xD;
      months after last infusion treatment or until birth of her child if she becomes pregnant.&#xD;
      Both adverse events in the participant and her child will be recorded. To support compliance&#xD;
      and meticulous reporting of side effects, all participants receive a folder with a list of&#xD;
      all known side effects to prednisolone, IVIg and albumin, a diary with boxes to tick of every&#xD;
      day the tablet(s) is taken, and a table in which side effects can continuously be noted.&#xD;
      According to the child, negative perinatal outcomes (low birth weight, preterm birth,&#xD;
      stillbirth) and malformations will be recorded after birth.&#xD;
