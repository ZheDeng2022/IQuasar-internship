  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many adults with spinal cord injury (SCI) suffer from long-term debilitating neuropathic&#xD;
      pain. Available treatments, including opioids, are ineffective at eliminating this pain.&#xD;
      Based on preliminary data from Dr Morse and from Dr Van de Winckel, we have demonstrated that&#xD;
      brain areas that are important for body awareness and pain perception (parietal operculum,&#xD;
      insula) have weaker brain connectivity in adults with spinal cord injury than in able-bodied&#xD;
      healthy adults and that Cognitive Multisensory Rehabilitation (CMR) can restore these&#xD;
      networks. This study uses a cross-over study for adults with SCI and a comparison of baseline&#xD;
      outcomes in adults with SCI vs able-bodied healthy adults to address two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Determine baseline differences in resting-state and task-based fMRI activation and&#xD;
      connectivity in adults with SCI compared to able-bodied healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Identify changes in brain activation and connectivity, as well as behavioral outcomes&#xD;
      in pain and body awareness in adults with SCI after CMR versus standard of care.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the reasons for the current lack of effective therapies is that underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of neuropathic pain after SCI are not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, as suggested by&#xD;
      numerous studies, because of the spinal injury, the inflow of sensory information is&#xD;
      dramatically altered. Therefore, the brain is missing sensory information or receiving&#xD;
      incorrect sensory information, which may alter the brain circuitry related to pain sensation,&#xD;
      which in turn may drive the perception of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive multisensory rehabilitation (CMR), developed for motor recovery after stroke, has&#xD;
      shown to be effective for treating adults with chronic pain, i.e., after shoulder impingement&#xD;
      when compared to traditional physical therapy; or in a case study of severe phantom limb pain&#xD;
      after below the knee amputation, resulting in such substantial pain reduction that the&#xD;
      patient could finally be fitted with a prosthesis and walk. CMR is thought to be effective&#xD;
      because it restores mental body representations by recalibrating sensations in combination&#xD;
      with a focus on body awareness. Body awareness is often impaired in people with chronic pain&#xD;
      and with dysfunctions in the sensory and motor networks, such as after SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses a cross-over study for adults with SCI and a comparison of baseline outcomes&#xD;
      in adults with SCI vs able-bodied healthy adults to address two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1: Determine baseline differences in resting-state and task-based fMRI activation and&#xD;
      connectivity in adults with SCI compared to able-bodied healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: Identify changes in brain activation and connectivity, as well as behavioral outcomes&#xD;
      in pain and body awareness in adults with SCI after CMR versus standard of care.&#xD;

    <measure>WHOQOL-BREF</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline - mid evaluation (after 12 weeks) - final evaluation (after second period of 12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The WHOQOL- BREF assesses quality of life within the context of an individual's culture, value systems, personal goals, standards and concerns in the last two weeks. This is a self-report questionnaire 26 items assessing 4 quality domains of quality of life (QOL): physical health (7 items), psychological health (6 items), social relationships (3 items) and environmental (8 items). In addition, two other items measure overall QOL and general health.&#xD;
Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale (low score of 1 to high score of 5) to determine a raw item score. The mean score of items within each domain is used to calculate the domain score. After computed the scores, they transformed linearly to a 0-100-scale. Score of each domain is reported. A higher score indicating a higher quality of life.</description>

    <description>Cognitive multisensory rehabilitation (CMR) is a type of physical therapy that incorporates conscious perception of body positions and movements during (multi)sensory discrimination exercises. The treating therapists will give 40 minutes of discrimination exercises embedded in functional movements followed by 5 minutes of applying the learned strategies during activities of daily living. CMR uses several types of discrimination exercises: Participants discriminated shapes, length, weight, distance, resistance, textures or compare kinesthetic information with visual information for integration of multisensory information. Solving the discrimination task is combined with reflection and a learning process, prompted by the therapist on how the limb (was) moved or was positioned.</description>
