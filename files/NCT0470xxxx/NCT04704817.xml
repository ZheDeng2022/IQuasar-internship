    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men, after prostate and lung cancer. It&#xD;
      represents 11.2% of all new cases of male cancer. In women, this cancer is the second most&#xD;
      common after breast cancer (11.3% of all new cases of female cancer).&#xD;

      Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in France. It accounts for&#xD;
      nearly 12% of all cancer deaths, especially among those 65 and over. However, mortality has&#xD;
      declined steadily since 1980.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access to screening for colorectal cancer and resection of precancerous lesions partly&#xD;
      explains this decline. All sexes combined, it is estimated that about one in five colorectal&#xD;
      cancer is diagnosed at a limited local stage. The treatment is then less heavy and gives&#xD;
      better results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the development of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols and their extension&#xD;
      to rectal excision, it becomes imperative to be able to collect operative data from these&#xD;
      patients on a perennial basis for the purpose of evaluating our results. Finally, the&#xD;
      evaluations resulting from this database could have prognostic value and ultimately allow us&#xD;
      to adapt the surgical management of the patient according to the results.&#xD;
