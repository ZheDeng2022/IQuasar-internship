  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In radiotherapy, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used as a complement to the CT scanner&#xD;
      because it provides better tissue contrast and therefore more precise delineations without&#xD;
      the need for additional irradiation. However, MRI does not allow the definition of the&#xD;
      electronic densities of the tissues necessary for dose calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this work, we sought to measure the feasibility of a method for generating CT-synthetic&#xD;
      images from MRI in terms of dosimetric and geometrical precision for the purpose of MRI&#xD;
      workflow alone (see diagram). The cerebral sphere and the prostate are the two tumor&#xD;
      locations considered. All patients will have a planning CT (reference) and an MRI in the&#xD;
      treatment position. The contours of the structures will be contoured by a radiotherapist on&#xD;
      both the MRI and the reference CT. Synthetic CTs will be generated from the MRI with the&#xD;
      method of automatic assignment of densities in five classes. The volumes bypassed and the&#xD;
      dosimetries performed will be compared. A study of the quality of the images generated from&#xD;
      MRI for dose calculation and images for the verification of per-treatment positioning will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

      This is a prospective single-center dosimetry study that exhaustively included brain tumor&#xD;
      and prostate cancer patients treated at the ICO Site d'Angers by external radiotherapy and&#xD;
      prior to which they were given an MRI and a simulation CT in treatment position over a&#xD;
      12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients who agree to participate in the study, CT-synthetic images will be generated&#xD;
      from the MRI images by automatic assignment of densities (5 classes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference CT images from CT and synthetic CT images from MRI will be available for comparison&#xD;
      for all eligible patients.&#xD;
