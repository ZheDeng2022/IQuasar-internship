  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research project EAPER-P is to evaluate PCC person-centred care (PCC) in the&#xD;
      form of a combined eHealth and telephone support for patents with chronic pain. A developed&#xD;
      PCC eHealth platform, together with person-centred telephone conversations, will be used as a&#xD;
      tool to identify patients´ resources to enhance coping and living with their illness by means&#xD;
      of a dialog and partnership with staff and relatives. PCC in the form of a combined eHealth&#xD;
      and telephone support will not replace, but instead be used as add on treatment to usual care&#xD;
      (guideline directed care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a process evaluation of the intervention will be performed in order to evaluate&#xD;
      the mechanisms behind the intervention and evaluate which parts of the interventions the&#xD;
      participants find useful.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous research and collaboration between patients, relatives and professionals in the&#xD;
      research program has clarified the need to develop a PCC accessible at home. Previous&#xD;
      research has shown that eHealth support, where the users are not involved in the process, has&#xD;
      a low impact and has highlighted several limitations with respect to patients' participation&#xD;
      in the design process; its anchorage in the home and local environment and opportunities for&#xD;
      communication rather than information. Therefore, this project has a participatory design&#xD;
      that assumes that all users (patients, relatives and health care professionals) are involved&#xD;
      in the study design, which facilitates implementation. An end-user perspective as a starting&#xD;
      point increases the chances that users adapt a positive attitude towards the new system. PCC&#xD;
      along the chain of health care showed a 4-fold chance of improved self-efficacy in&#xD;
      combination with return to work or prior activity level after an event of acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to evaluate if PCC in the form of a combined eHealth and&#xD;
      structured telephone support combined with an eHealth support available at home will improve&#xD;
      return to work rates, reduced relapse, reduce costs and improved self-efficacy for patients&#xD;
      with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, open, parallel group intervention study where patients on sick&#xD;
      leave for chronic pain are eligible. Patients will be randomized into either the control or&#xD;
      the intervention arm 1:1. The control group will receive usual care. The intervention group&#xD;
      will receive usual care plus PCC in the form of a combined eHealth and structured telephone&#xD;
      support combined with an eHealth support. Randomization will be done through&#xD;
      computer-generated lists and stored in sealed envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients listed in primary care with a confirmed diagnosis of chronic pain will be screened&#xD;
      and sent an informing letter about the study from the chief at each center. Specially trained&#xD;
      registered nurses (RNs) will then screen patients against study inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and by phone contact eligible patients and inform the patient about the aims of the&#xD;
      study and ask if they are interested to participate. If the patient wants to participate, a&#xD;
      consent form is sent to the patient and then returned to the RN. Written informed consent&#xD;
      will then be obtained. Then the randomization procedure is performed which is stratified for&#xD;
      age. The patient will be informed about the outcome by phone. Patients randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention group will need a computer, smart phone or iPad with internet access to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Patients randomized to usual care will be managed by regular&#xD;
      evidence-based treatment and care as outlined in treatment guidelines and followed as usual&#xD;
      at their local primary care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PCC, the goals, capabilities and needs of each patient, will be the starting point.&#xD;
      Self-care strategies will be reinforced and empowered. Patients in the intervention group&#xD;
      will be contacted by a RN who has received special training in PCC communication for an&#xD;
      initial person-centered dialogue by phone. The RN presents the eHealth platform and the RN&#xD;
      invites the patient and activates their account where he/she can login via an individual user&#xD;
      name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this phone conversation, the participants will also be invited to tell their story.&#xD;
      Based on the patient narrative the patient´s goals, resources and needs are identified. The&#xD;
      patient (sometimes maybe together with relatives) and the RN formulate a person-centered&#xD;
      health plan. This plan is part of and will be up-loaded to the eHealth platform, which also&#xD;
      contains individual notes and information about stress, depression and anxiety. The plan will&#xD;
      be the point of departure for the forthcoming dialogue at distance via the eHealth platform&#xD;
      that the patient and the RN will have during the study period (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eHealth support contains headings that may inspire the patient to make notes on &quot;a good&#xD;
      day&quot; respectively &quot;a bad day&quot; and register daily health related status. The health plan&#xD;
      contain three parts; 1. &quot;My goal is to feel or be able to do&quot;. 2. &quot;To be able to reach my&#xD;
      goal I will.&quot; 3.&quot;Support I need to reach my goal&quot;. In the communication during the study&#xD;
      period between the RN and patient, the personal health plan is discussed and any needs of&#xD;
      reformulating the goals may be discussed. The overall goal is to help the patient to identify&#xD;
      their own capabilities/resources such as a strong will, social relations etc. and formulate&#xD;
      goals that help them increase their self-efficacy and to cope with their condition in daily&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of each phone conversation, the participant and RN will agree on when and how they&#xD;
      will be in contact next. I addition to these pre-agreed on phone conversations, the&#xD;
      participants are free to contact the RNs via the eHealth platform or direct phone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the eHealth platform, the participants can and formulate, comment, evaluate and develop&#xD;
      the health plan, rate and follow their symptoms and keep a diary. Access to the eHealth&#xD;
      platform will be password protected. The RN can see the patient´s account and make comments.&#xD;
      The participants can invite other health care professionals, family and friend that they want&#xD;
      to give access to the eHealth platform. The participants can add or delete these invitees&#xD;
      when they want and they can limit the access for each invitee. The RNs follow the procedures&#xD;
      closely. A monitor controls the protocol adherence. All case record forms, questionnaires and&#xD;
      referrals will be constructed (for intervention and usual care groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires on for example general self-efficacy, quality of life, anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      symptom burden and daily functional level will be sent to all patients in both groups at&#xD;
      inclusion and 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 5 years after randomization. In&#xD;
      addition, data from registries, the platform and medical records will be collected.&#xD;
