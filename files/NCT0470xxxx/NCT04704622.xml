  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and Objectives: Surgery and hospitalization present a very stressful period for&#xD;
      children and their parents. The induction of anesthesia and cannula insertion may be the only&#xD;
      bad experience a child can remember during his procedure. Pediatric intravenous cannulation&#xD;
      is technically difficult and moreover may cause psychological problems. Sedative&#xD;
      Premedication has a great role in pediatric anesthesia to overcome fear and anxiety and to&#xD;
      facilitate easy separation from their parents. Intranasal approach is safe and painless and&#xD;
      well tolerated by children in addition to a comparable onset of action with the intravenous&#xD;
      approach. Midazolam, dexmedetomidine and ketamine have proved their effectiveness as a&#xD;
      sedative premedication. The objective of the current study was to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of administration of intranasal midazolam, dexmedetomidine and ketamine as sedatives to&#xD;
      facilitate and decrease the discomfort of intravenous cannulation before surgery in children&#xD;
      undergoing various surgical procedures. Methods: the patients agreed to participate in the&#xD;
      research were classified into 3 groups. Dexmedetomidine, Midazolam and Ketamine group; each&#xD;
      group received the intranasal drug 30 min before the procedure. Pulse, MAP, oxygen saturation&#xD;
      and sedation score (MOAA/S) baseline and every 10 min. Easiness of venipuncture, parental&#xD;
      separation and any complication encountered were recorded.&#xD;

      approach. Midazolam, dexmedetomidine and ketamine have proved their effectiveness as a&#xD;
      sedative premedication. We assumed that intranasal midazolam, dexmedetomidine and ketamine&#xD;
      would help anesthetics to carry out venous cannulation easily; in addition to their sedative&#xD;
      premedication effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the current study was to compare the effectiveness of administration of&#xD;
      intranasal midazolam, dexmedetomidine and ketamine as sedatives to facilitate and decrease&#xD;
      the discomfort of intravenous cannulation before surgery in children undergoing various&#xD;
      surgical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: 150 patients agreed to participate in the research after written informed&#xD;
      consent. patients were classified into 3 groups. Dexmedetomidine, Midazolam and Ketamine&#xD;
      group; each group received the intranasal drug 30 min before the procedure. Pulse, MAP,&#xD;
      oxygen saturation and sedation score (MOAA/S) baseline and every 10 min. Easiness of&#xD;
      venipuncture, parental separation and any complication encountered were recorded. Group&#xD;
      assignment, preparation and administration of drugs will be performed by a junior anesthetist&#xD;
      who is neither involved nor interested by any means in the study.&#xD;
