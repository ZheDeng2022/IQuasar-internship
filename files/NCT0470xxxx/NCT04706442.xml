  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Supportive Parenting App is a theory-based perinatal educational intervention for couples&#xD;
      administered through a mobile application. The intervention comprise of knowledge-based&#xD;
      content, informational videos and audio, discussion forum, peer volunteer chat group, and a&#xD;
      FAQ expert advice section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. develop theory-based supportive parenting App (SPA) intervention for both first-time and&#xD;
           experienced parents across perinatal period&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. examine its effectiveness on parental outcomes: including maternal depression at 12&#xD;
           months postpartum (primary outcome), paternal depression, parental anxiety, parenting&#xD;
           self-efficacy, help - seeking behavior (social support), parental bonding and parenting&#xD;
           satisfaction (secondary outcomes); and new-born outcomes: physical, social and emotional&#xD;
           developments (secondary outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. evaluate SPA's cost-effectiveness as compared to standard perinatal care across major&#xD;
           restructured hospitals, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. examine the perceptions of parents in receiving this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When compared with those in the control group receiving standard care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. parents receiving SPA intervention will have better- emotional well-being (reduced&#xD;
           depression and anxiety);parenting self-efficacy; social support; bonding and&#xD;
           satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. new-borns of parents receiving SPA will have better physical, social and emotional&#xD;
           development&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. It will be more cost-effective to provide SPA than the standard care&#xD;
