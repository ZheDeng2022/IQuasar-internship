  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess speech therapy's effectiveness in understanding other people's&#xD;
      thoughts (implied) using written stories. The main objective is to examine whether the&#xD;
      therapy improves understanding of the stories worked on in the sessions. We also explore&#xD;
      whether the observed progress is maintained one month after the end of treatment and whether&#xD;
      it is generalized to neuropsychological tests, video material, and the participants' daily&#xD;
      lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This therapy will be administered to four individuals with brain lesions, for six weeks, at&#xD;
      the rate of two weekly sessions of one hour.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from the score on the written task of comprehension of non-literal language 48 hours after the end of the therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>Baselines, 24-48 hours after the last session of the therapy</time_frame>
    <description>The non-literal language comprehension task includes written stories ending with a character's utterance that can be interpreted literally (e.g., &quot;I'm mad at you&quot; to signify her nervousness); ironically (e.g. &quot;it was a fantastic play&quot; to mean the play was bad); as an indirect request (e.g., &quot;Caramels look good&quot; to ask for a caramel); like a lie (e.g. &quot;it was very nice&quot;); like a faux-pas (e.g., criticizing a person without knowing that he or she hears everything).&#xD;
Following these stories, the participant must answer the question: &quot;What does the character mean? &quot;. Each story is scored 0-1-2 depending on the accuracy of the answer. The total score is thus obtained by adding the points received for each of the questions in the task's stories.&#xD;
The stories will be administered twice before the therapy (baselines) and directly (24-48 hours) after the last session of the therapy to analyze the change of performance.</description>

    <description>The intervention focuses on understanding the thoughts of the characters. Twenty written stories will be used, which end with statements that can be interpreted literally, ironically, as a lie, a request or a faux-pas (maladroitness). At the end of each story, the participant should explain what the characters want to mean by their statement.&#xD;
To help the participant in his understanding of the character's intention, he will be asked:&#xD;
1) To mention as many intentions as possible that can be associated with the target statement presented out of context (eg: &quot;it's hot here&quot; that can be interpreted literally, ironically, as a lie or a request) and to imagine contexts in connection with interpretation; 2. Analyze the relevant elements of the context (environment, the relationship between the characters, knowledge of the characters); 3. To judge the probability of the possible interpretations (pt 1) by justifying using the elements of the context analyzed previously (pt 2).</description>
