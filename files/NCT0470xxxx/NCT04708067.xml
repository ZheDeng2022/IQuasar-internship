  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is to find out the best dose, possible benefits, and/or side effects of&#xD;
      hypofractionated radiation therapy and bintrafusp alfa in treating patients with bile duct&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma). Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher doses of radiation&#xD;
      therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and have fewer side&#xD;
      effects. Immunotherapy with bintrafusp alfa, a bifunctional fusion protein composed of the&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody avelumab and TGF-beta, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. The combination&#xD;
      of hypofractionated radiation therapy and bintrafusp alfa may help to control intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine the safety of bintrafusp alfa in combination with hypofractionated radiation&#xD;
      therapy for patients with advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and recommend a phase II&#xD;
      radiation dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate objective response rate, local progression free survival, progression free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival with the study regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate expression of TGF-beta related pathways with clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To examine intratumoral pharmacodynamic changes in the immune microenvironment using&#xD;
      paired biopsies before and after therapy with the study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To correlate immune biomarkers from pre- and post-treatment tissue, blood, and stool with&#xD;
      clinical study endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study of radiation therapy followed by a dose-expansion&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy once daily (QD) on weekdays&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday) for 15 fractions in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Beginning 1 week after completion of radiation therapy, patients receive bintrafusp&#xD;
      alfa intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Cycles repeat every 14 days for up to 2 years&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
