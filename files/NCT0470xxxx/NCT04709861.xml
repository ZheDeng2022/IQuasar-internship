    <textblock>
      The Investigators hypothesize that an early 2 week post-operative protocol will have no&#xD;
      difference in the successful osseointegration and stability of the total ankle replacement as&#xD;
      compared to a delayed 6 week post-operative protocol. The importance of the research is to&#xD;
      allow patients who receive a total ankle replacement to bear weight 4 weeks earlier than the&#xD;
      current protocol with no negative effect on the osseointegration and stability of the ankle&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted using two groups. The first group will be a retrospective review&#xD;
      of charts of 35 patients who received a total ankle replacement porous prosthesis by an&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeon at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. This group was&#xD;
      received a delayed 6 week post-operative weight-bearing protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will be prospective and include patients who will receive the same total&#xD;
      ankle replacement porous prosthesis but will be assigned to early 2 weeks post-operative&#xD;
      weight-bearing protocol.The retrospective and prospective groups will be age and gender&#xD;
      matched. A Wright Medical Infinity Total Ankle Replacement System will be used for both&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will be assessed at 1 year and 2 years post-operative. This assessment will take&#xD;
      place during the post-operative care period and will be conducted as part of their&#xD;
      post-operative care by the operating physician.&#xD;
