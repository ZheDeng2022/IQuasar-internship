    <textblock>
      The study will examine the efficacy of an internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT)&#xD;
      for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) intervention to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression&#xD;
      in individuals with IBD and comorbid clinically elevated t anxiety and/or depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. The investigators will conduct a two-arm RCT comparing participants receiving the&#xD;
      iCBT intervention (intervention group) and those receiving Treatment As Usual (TAU).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects over a quarter of a million Canadians and this rate&#xD;
      is expected to increase to 403,000 by year 2030 (Kaplan, Bernstein, Coward, Bitton, Murthy,&#xD;
      Nguyen, Lee, Cooke-Lauder, Benchimol, 2019). The disease has a high burden for patients, with&#xD;
      unpredictable, painful symptoms often requiring costly medications and surgery to facilitate&#xD;
      disease remission. It is well established that individuals with IBD have significantly higher&#xD;
      rates of anxiety and depression compared to the general population. (Bernstein, 2017; Graff,&#xD;
      Walker, &amp; Bernstein, 2009; Mikocka-Walus, Knowles, Keefer, Graff, 2016; Walker, Ediger,&#xD;
      Graff, Greenfeld, Clara, Lix, Rawsthorne, Miller, Rogala, McPhail, &amp; Bernstein, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing research on psychological treatment for individuals with IBD, providing some&#xD;
      evidence that Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) reduces psychological distress in this&#xD;
      population (Knowles, Monshat, &amp; Castle, 2013). Traditional CBT delivery methods involve&#xD;
      in-person treatment, with multiple sessions over time, either one-on-one or in small groups.&#xD;
      Development of alternate modes of effective treatment delivery is vital to enhance access and&#xD;
      facilitate availability, particularly given limited mental health service availability.&#xD;
      Internet-Based Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (iCBT) may be an effective alternative treatment&#xD;
      for persons with IBD and related stress, anxiety and/or depression (McCombie, 2016) as it may&#xD;
      mitigate the aforementioned challenges. Potential benefits of iCBT include enhanced cost&#xD;
      effectiveness, little to no wait time to begin treatment, and increased accessibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group developed and pilot-tested an internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy&#xD;
      (iCBT) intervention targeting stress, anxiety and/or depression in adults with IBD. The&#xD;
      intervention is housed on the Minddistrict online platform, the same platform used in our&#xD;
      pilot study (HREB Ethics HS22087 (H2018:333) (Minddistrict, 2018, June, 1).The program was&#xD;
      designed to be completed over 12 weeks. The study coordinator will be tracking participants'&#xD;
      progress through the intervention by reviewing completion of questionnaires and modules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention includes 9 core modules and 3 optional modules. CORE Modules: 1. About the&#xD;
      program, 2. IBD and Stress, 3. Relaxation Strategies, 4, Commitment to Living Life Fully, 5.&#xD;
      The Brain-Gut Connection, 6. Understanding Anxiety, 7. Overcoming Avoidance, 8. Depression,&#xD;
      9. Behavioural Activation Optional Modules: 11. IBD and the Workplace, 12. Coping with Pain&#xD;
      through Mindfulness, 13. Fatigue and Sleep&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next stage in extending this research is to conduct a randomized control trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of this internet-based intervention, utilizing a control condition and&#xD;
      ensuring adequate sample size powered to detect differences between the intervention group&#xD;
      and Treatment as Usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be adults with confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, recruited from local&#xD;
      enrollees of the IMAGINE study described earlier (IMAGINE, 2020, July, 2). They will be&#xD;
      contacted by email to invite for participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized using a computer-generated randomization schedule which&#xD;
      allows for allocation concealment with a ratio of 1.2 (iCBT) : 1.0 (TAU).&#xD;
