  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality. Several&#xD;
      PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its overall effective population is only 20%,&#xD;
      and even in studies of enriched populations (such as PD-L1 ≥ 50%), its single-drug effective&#xD;
      rate is only about 40%. Therefore, this study aims to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in combination with&#xD;
      bronchoscopy-assisted lnterventional therapy in the first-line treatment of advanced central&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized controlled, prospective clinical trial&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy, safety, and mechanism of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted interventional therapy vs&#xD;
      anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in combination with chemotherapy as the first-line&#xD;
      treatment of patients with advanced central NSCLC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is one of the malignant tumors with high morbidity and mortality. Most patients&#xD;
      with lung cancers are already in advanced stages when diagnosed, and the 5-year survival rate&#xD;
      of advanced lung cancer is less than 5%. Therefore, exploring effective treatments is of&#xD;
      great significance for improving the survival and quality of life of patients with lung&#xD;
      cancer. Immunotherapy represented by immune checkpoint inhibitors has received widespread&#xD;
      attention in the field of lung cancer, and several PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      have been approved for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).However,&#xD;
      its overall effective population is only 20%, even in studies of enriched populations (such&#xD;
      as PD-L1 ≥ 50%), its single-drug effective rate is only about 40%. Therefore, this study aims&#xD;
      to explore the efficacy and safety of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy&#xD;
      in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted interventional therapy in the first-line treatment&#xD;
      of advanced central non-small cell lung cancer. We conducted a randomized controlled,&#xD;
      prospective clinical trial to examine the efficacy, safety and mechanism of anti-PD-1/PD-L1&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies and chemotherapy in combination with bronchoscopy-assisted&#xD;
      interventional therapy versus anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy as the first-line treatment of patients with advanced central NSCLC.&#xD;
