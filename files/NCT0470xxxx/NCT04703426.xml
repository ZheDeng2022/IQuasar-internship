  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is testing the combination of two drugs, sargramostim and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      The study is designed to see if the combination of these study drugs would improve the&#xD;
      control of unresectable or metastatic melanoma cancer when compared to use of these drugs&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sargramostim (GM-CSF)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study looking at safety and efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (PD-1 inhibition and sargramostim (GMCSF) in people with unresectable stage III&#xD;
      or IV melanoma who have not received prior immunotherapy in the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sargramostim as a treatment&#xD;
      option for people with stage III or IV melanoma who have not received prior immunotherapy in&#xD;
      the metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved pembrolizumab as a treatment option&#xD;
      for people with stage III or IV melanoma who have not received prior immunotherapy in the&#xD;
      metastatic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive the study drug(s) for as long as they do not have serious side&#xD;
      effects and their disease does not get worse and will be followed for safety 30 days after&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug(s). Participants may also be followed for long term follow-up&#xD;
      every 12 weeks from the last dose of study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive 12 weeks of sargramostim (GM-CSF) and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1). Participants may be pre-medicated with drugs to reduce the chance of having a sensitivity reaction to the study treatment of pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) and sargramostim (GM-CSF).&#xD;
Study cycles are 21 days in length:&#xD;
Pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) will be given by intravenous infusion once on day 1 of every 21 day cycle&#xD;
Sargramostim (GM-CSF) will be self-administered by participants via a subcutaneous (below the skin) injection daily for days 1 - 14 of each 21- day cycle.&#xD;
Participants will be assessed at 12 weeks for disease response/progression and further study treatment.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease (by CT, PET/CT or MRI)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of GMCSF and PD-1 inhibition on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        For this reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
        contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study&#xD;
        entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
        suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should&#xD;
        inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must&#xD;
        also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
        participation, and 7 months after completion of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior immunotherapies in the metastatic setting. Prior targeted therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;

        therapy for ≥ 6 months at the time of progression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;

             entering the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases must have documented stability over a four&#xD;
             week interval and not be requiring active treatment for these. Prior radiation,&#xD;
             surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery are allowed but must be completed four weeks&#xD;
             prior to initiating therapy.&#xD;

             nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with Pembrolizumab, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with Pembrolizumab. These potential&#xD;
             risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known active HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C patients. HIV-positive participants on&#xD;
             combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of the potential for an&#xD;
             immunologic effect with the therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autoimmune disease that requires treatment at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
