  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, randomized, double blind, single ascending dose (SAD) and&#xD;
      multiple ascending dose (MAD) study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of ANA001 in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects. In the single ascending dose portion of the study, subjects in 3&#xD;
      cohorts of 10 subjects each will be randomized to receive a single daily oral dose of ANA001&#xD;
      or matching placebo. In the multiple ascending dose portion of the study, subjects in 3&#xD;
      cohorts of 12 subjects each will be randomized to receive twice or thrice daily oral dose of&#xD;
      ANA001 or matching placebo.&#xD;
