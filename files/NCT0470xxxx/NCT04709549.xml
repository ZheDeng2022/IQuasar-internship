  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional research study about clinical, psychosocial, and behavioral factors&#xD;
      that impact weight loss, weight maintenance, and cardiovascular disease in socially&#xD;
      disadvantaged persons.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand whether the incorporation of social determinants&#xD;
      of health into a weight loss/maintenance study, along with a known behavioral intervention&#xD;
      will result in improved efficacy than the behavioral intervention by itself. This study will&#xD;
      examine the role of psychosocial, clinical, and behavioral factors in the context of the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire duration of the study will be 18 months. Study activities will occur virtually or&#xD;
      at YMCA locations in the city of San Francisco or at other community centers.&#xD;

    <allocation>Randomized</allocation>
    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>The parallel, interventional SCULPT-Job Study model randomizes persons to either the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) only OR the DPP plus job readiness/legal services.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Prevention</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Double (Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Due to the nature of lifestyle behavioral intervention, the study design prevents participants and study staff blinding to allocation. However, to minimize bias, outcomes will be assessed by independent study staff blinded to allocation status.</masking_description>
  </study_design_info>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BMI Change</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>Weight will be measured using a calibrated digital scale to the nearest 0.1 kg. Height will be measured using a stadiometer. Waist and hip measurements will be performed using vinyl retractable tape to the nearest 0.1 cm at the smallest horizontal portion of the waist (highest horizontal point of the iliac crest with minimal respiration) and largest area of the hip.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BMI Maintenance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The primary analysis of the maintenance phase will include 18-month outcomes, allowing 0-to-12 and 12-to-18 month linear changes by study arm. This model will estimate and compare mean (95% CI) 0-to-18 month changes by study arm: under the hypothesis that differential changes through month 12 will be maintained over the following 6 months, 12- and 18-month differences (95% CI) between arms will be similar (i.e., same sample size calculation). For descriptive purposes, we will compare the later slopes to quantify differential recidivism; within-arm 95% CIs that exclude positive values will demonstrate maintenance of intervention-period weight loss</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Ideal Cardiovascular Health</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month and 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>AHA 2020 ideal cardiovascular health score will be used as an index about cardiovascular health consisting of health behaviors and factors. Ideal cardiovascular health is defined as: BMI &lt; 25 kg/m2, &gt; 150 min/week of moderate physical activity, a healthy diet pattern including sufficient amounts of fruits and vegetables, optimal blood pressure (&lt; 120/&lt;80 mmHg), fasting glucose (&lt; 100 mg/dL), total cholesterol &lt; 200, and never smoking or quit smoking for more than 12 months&#xD;
For analysis, the investigators will score each item-level category as (0,0.5,1), respectively. This step expands the granularity of ICH Scores from 8 to 15 values, allowing finer measure of longitudinal change during the intervention and maintenance periods. For descriptive purposes,the investigators will compare the later slopes to quantify differential recidivism; within-arm 95% CIs that exclude positive values will demonstrate maintenance of intervention-period weight loss.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cumulative Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The construct &quot;cumulative psychological stress&quot;(CPS), will be used to capture eight types of stress that commonly affect individuals over a life-course. The stressors include negative and traumatic life events, work-family stress, work, financial stress, intimate partner stress, neighborhood stress, and everyday discrimination. The questionnaire was constructed using a battery of scales approach that utilizes scales that have good psychometric properties that were assembled for the Chicago Community Health Aging (CCAHS), American Changing Lives, and Alameda County and Detroit Area Studies. Weights were assigned to each of the 8 domains comprising the cumulative stress score based on the reciprocal of the standard deviation of the scores for questions in each domain. The 8 domain-specific weighted scores were then added to create the cumulative stress score (CPS; range 16-385), with higher values representing higher stress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impulsivity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>The following indicators will be obtained: Self-reported indicators of trait impulsivity via the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cellular Aging Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the change in telomeres, telomere length processing will be performed using finger-stick blood samples collected from participants at baseline and 12 months. Approximately 30 microliters of blood will be collected.&#xD;
Relative mean telomere length will be measured from DNA by a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay as (T)/(S) ratio. The inter-assay coefficient of variability for telomere length measurement is 3.7%. The intra-assay coefficient of variability is 2.5% (equivalent to 0.13 kilobases/baseline mean)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Binge Eating</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 12 month</time_frame>
    <description>BIS captures impulsive decision making, lack of planning, and impaired attention. We will assess binge eating by evaluating binge eating frequency using the methods from the Framingham Heart Study and severity from a 16 item binge eating scale, BES.</description>
