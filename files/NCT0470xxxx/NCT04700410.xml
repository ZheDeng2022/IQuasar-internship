  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnostic accuracy and safety of colonoscopy highly depends on the quality of the&#xD;
      pre-procedural bowel preparation. A past history of poor bowel preparation is the most&#xD;
      important risk factor of inadequate bowel cleansing at the next colonoscopy. This study aims&#xD;
      to evaluate if an adequate level of bowel cleansing can be achieved with the Pure-Vu System&#xD;
      in patients with previous poor bowel preparation, in a single arm international multicenter&#xD;
      feasibility study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: It is widely acknowledged that the efficacy and safety of colonoscopy depends on&#xD;
      the quality of the pre-procedural bowel preparation. Despite its importance, the proportion&#xD;
      of colonoscopies with inadequate bowel preparation still ranges from 6.8-33% across studies.&#xD;
      A past history of poor bowel preparation is the most important risk factor of inadequate&#xD;
      bowel cleansing at the next colonoscopy. (1, 2) Evidence to recommend a specific bowel&#xD;
      cleansing regimen in these patients is currently lacking. (3) Mostly, patients with previous&#xD;
      bowel preparation are advised to drink more oral purgatives, which is very difficult and&#xD;
      unpleasant for patients and therefore often fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate if an intra-procedural bowel cleaning device, the&#xD;
      Pure-VuTM System (Tirat Carmel, Israel) can be used to achieve an adequate level of bowel&#xD;
      cleansing in patients with previous poor bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate if an adequate level of bowel cleansing can&#xD;
      be achieved with the Pure-Vu System in patients with previous poor bowel preparation (Boston&#xD;
      Bowel Preparation Scale [BBPS]&lt;6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: We will perform a single arm international multicenter colonoscopy trial. Adult&#xD;
      patients with previous poor bowel preparation (BBPS&lt;6) will be invited to participate in our&#xD;
      study (n= 44). All patients willing to participate will receive a limited bowel preparation&#xD;
      (2-days of dietary restrictions + 2x 150ml picoprep) followed by intra-procedural bowel&#xD;
      cleansing with the Pure-Vu System. The BBPS will be assessed before and after segmental&#xD;
      washing by the endoscopist who performs the procedure and later by an independent endoscopist&#xD;
      (photos).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Adult patients with poor bowel preparation within the last 2 years.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria; previous colon resection, previous colorectal cancer, colitis, lower&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding with hemodynamic instability, ASA&gt;3, insufficiently corrected&#xD;
      anticoagulation disorders, inability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: The primary endpoint of the study will be the BBPS-score before and after&#xD;
      intra-procedural bowel cleaning with the Pure-Vu System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total number of colon lesions specified by histology&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adenoma detection rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cecal intubation rates&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure times (total procedure time, cecal intubation time, withdrawal time, time for&#xD;
           all other interventions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total amount of water used for washing and total amount of fluids+residual stool&#xD;
           removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient reported outcomes (level of discomfort during bowel preparation and during&#xD;
           colonoscopy on a visual analog scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  System usability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopists' learning curve&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risk associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Colonoscopy is a commonly performed procedure and the overall serious adverse&#xD;
      event (SAE) rate is low, around 2.8 per 1000 colonoscopies. The risk of adverse events (AE)&#xD;
      with the Pure-Vu are believed to be equivalent to conventional colonoscopy, including&#xD;
      bleeding and perforation risks (13). Participation in this study could potentially benefit&#xD;
      colonoscopy patients because the Pure-Vu is expected to improve the quality of colonoscopy.&#xD;
      Inadequate bowel cleansing may be prevented by the Pure-Vu System. Inadequate bowel cleansing&#xD;
      is associated with lower adenoma detection rates (ADR), lower completion rates, longer&#xD;
      procedure times, more complications and a higher need for repeat procedures.(4, 5) In&#xD;
      addition, Pure-Vu reduces the reliance on patients pre-procedural bowel preparation which is&#xD;
      often considered the most deterrent part of colonoscopy by patients.&#xD;

    <description>Boston Bowel Preparation scale (BBPS): The adequacy of bowel preparation should be assessed after all appropriate efforts to clear residual debris is completed. All three bowel regions of the colon will be scored (i.e., the right colon, transverse colon, and left colon) from 0-3 points by the endoscopist. The segment scores are summed for a total BBPS ranging from 0 to 9. The points will be assigned as follows:&#xD;
0) Unprepared colon segment with mucosa not seen because of solid stool that could not be cleared.&#xD;
Portion of mucosa of the colon segment seen, but other areas of the colon segment are not well seen because of staining, residual stool, and/or opaque liquid.&#xD;
Minor amount of residual staining, small fragments of stool, and/or opaque liquid but mucosa of colon segment seen well.&#xD;
Entire mucosa of colon segment seen well, with no residual staining, small fragments of stool, or opaque liquid. Each segment of the colon received a segmental score from 0- 3.</description>
