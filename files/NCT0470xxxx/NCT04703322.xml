    <textblock>
      This phase 2, multicenter, two-part, open-label, single-arm study will be conducted in Japan&#xD;
      and will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy of&#xD;
      pexidartinib in adult participants with symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT)&#xD;
      associated with severe morbidity or functional limitation and not amenable to improvement&#xD;
      with surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 2 parts. In Part 1, pexidartinib 800 mg/day (400 mg twice a day&#xD;
      [BID]) will be administered on an empty stomach and tolerability and PK of pexidartinib will&#xD;
      be evaluated to determine the initiation of Part 2. In Part 2, pexidartinib 800 mg/day (400&#xD;
      mg BID) will be administered on an empty stomach and efficacy, safety, and PK of pexidartinib&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

             improvement with surgery determined consensually by qualified personnel (eg, 2&#xD;
             surgeons or a multi-disciplinary tumor board).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease as defined by RECIST version 1.1 (except that a minimal size of 2&#xD;
             cm is required), assessed from MRI scan by a central radiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known metastatic TGCT.&#xD;

          -  Pre-existing increased serum transaminases; total bilirubin or direct bilirubin&#xD;
             (&gt;upper limit of normal); or active liver or biliary tract disease, including&#xD;
             increased alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant concomitant arthropathy in the affected joint, serious illness,&#xD;
             uncontrolled infection, or a medical or psychiatric history that, in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, would likely interfere with a participant's study&#xD;
             participation or the interpretation of his or her results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of strong cytochrome P450 3A inducers, including St John's wort, proton pump&#xD;
             inhibitors and potassium-competitive acid blockers, or other products known to cause&#xD;
             hepatotoxicity.&#xD;
