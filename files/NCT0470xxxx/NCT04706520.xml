      To assess, relative to a placebo, the effects of consuming 400 mL/day or 200 mL/day of a&#xD;
      vinegar beverage providing either 1,500 mg/day of acetic acid (in two 200 mL doses daily) or&#xD;
      750 mg/day of acetic acid (in one 200 mL dose daily), respectively, for 12 weeks on VAT&#xD;
      (MRI). Thus the 2 active comparator arms 400 mL and 200 mL of vinegar will be independently&#xD;
      tested compared to placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that increased visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with a range&#xD;
      of metabolic abnormalities, including decreased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, as&#xD;
      well as adverse lipid profiles, all of which are risk factors for type 2 diabetes and CVD&#xD;
      (WHO, 2008). In the European Union, a sustained reduction in abdominal fat, and in particular&#xD;
      visceral fat, is considered a beneficial physiological effect for adults with adverse health&#xD;
      effects associated with excess abdominal fat, including impaired glucose tolerance,&#xD;
      dyslipidemia, and hypertension (EFSA, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel,&#xD;
      single-center study involving a total of 60 male and female adults (aged 18 to 60 years,&#xD;
      inclusive) who are overweight (BMI between 25.0 to Ë‚30.0 kg/m2) and have abdominal obesity&#xD;
      (waist circumference &gt;102 cm for males, &gt;88 cm for females) (ATP III, 2001). Each subject's&#xD;
      duration of participation will be a total of ~14 weeks, including a ~2-week screening visit&#xD;
      and a ~12-week randomized placebo-controlled double-blinded supplementation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the first day of the ~2-week screening period (~Day -14), subjects will be screened&#xD;
      according to the study inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects meeting all of the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to return to the clinic&#xD;
      for a second screening visit (~Day -7). During this second screening visit, subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed on how to use the Fitbit (accelerometer) and on how to properly complete the food&#xD;
      intake diary. Subjects will be instructed not to alter their dietary intakes or their&#xD;
      physical activity levels during the subsequent week, and to record the information as&#xD;
      accurately as possible. Participants will be asked to record at least 3 days of physical&#xD;
      activity and dietary measurements that includes at least 1 weekend day. Subjects will then be&#xD;
      instructed to return to the clinic ~1 week later for the collection of baseline measures (Day&#xD;
      0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the collection of baseline measures on Day 0, subjects will be randomized to the&#xD;
      placebo or one of the vinegar groups. Each group will consist of 20 subjects. Randomization&#xD;
      will be adaptive according to sex and age; subjects will be asked to return to the clinic&#xD;
      twice, once ~11 weeks after the baseline visit to obtain food intake diary, accelerometer,&#xD;
      and stool collection materials, and again, ~12 weeks after the baseline visit (i.e., 12 weeks&#xD;
      after the baseline visit). Each subject will be required to make a total of 4 visits to the&#xD;
      clinical research site (i.e., Days -14, -7, 0, and 84). The entire duration of the clinical&#xD;
      study is expected to be approximately 52 weeks from subject enrollment to study closeout.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>VAnish is a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel study model with 3 groups consisting of 20 participants who will all consume 2 bottles of study product per day. Group 1 will receive 400mL/day of vinegar; Group 2 will receive 200mL/day of vinegar and 200mL/day of the placebo drink; Group 3 will receive 400mL/day of the placebo drink.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will be blinded as to which group they are randomized since both the vinegar and placebo beverages are the same in appearance and taste. The Investigators, clinic staff, and intervention staff are also all blinded. The only unblinded group is the Metabolic Kitchen who facilitates randomization and distribution of study product.</masking_description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females between 18 and 60 years of age (inclusive) of any ethnicity, free of&#xD;
             medications except for oral contraceptives (see inclusion criterion 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects are overweight at screening (Visit 1, Day -14), as defined by a BMI of&#xD;
             between 25.0 to Ë‚30.0 kg/m2, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects have abdominal obesity at screening (Visit 1, Day -14), as defined by a waist&#xD;
             circumference of &gt;102 cm for males or &gt;88 cm for females (ATP III, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Physical examination and vital signs are normal, or deemed abnormal but clinically&#xD;
             insignificant by the Principle and/or Medical Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinical laboratory evaluations (including but not limited to clinical chemistry&#xD;
             [fasted at least 8 hours], including creatine phosphokinase (CPK)], amylase, lipid&#xD;
             profile, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (T4), cortisol) complete&#xD;
             blood count (CBC), are within the reference ranges for the central laboratory, unless&#xD;
             deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Males who are sterile or agree to use an approved method of contraception, with an&#xD;
             approved method of contraception considered a barrier method (diaphragm, cervical cap,&#xD;
             or condom) plus a contraceptive jelly (spermicidal foam, gel, film, cream, or&#xD;
             suppository). If the female sexual partner of the male is using an approved form of&#xD;
             contraception (see inclusion criterion 8), the male is not required to be sterile or,&#xD;
             if not sterile, to use an approved form of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Female subjects who are postmenopausal (absence of menses for 1 year or more), women&#xD;
             who are surgically sterilized, or women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) who are&#xD;
             nonlactating and have been using an effective form of birth control for a minimum of 6&#xD;
             months prior to screening and agree to continue using the effective form of birth&#xD;
             control during the study and for 30 days after the treatment period [effective forms&#xD;
             of birth control include oral pills with a concentration of at least 50 Î¼g of the&#xD;
             estrogenic component of a biphasic or triphasic pill; transdermal, injectable, or&#xD;
             implantable contraceptive; intrauterine device; or double-barrier method (e.g.,&#xD;
             diaphragm and condom). Abstinence is not considered an acceptable form of birth&#xD;
             control.] WOCBP who are using low dose oral birth control must also use a barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception for the duration of the study.&#xD;
