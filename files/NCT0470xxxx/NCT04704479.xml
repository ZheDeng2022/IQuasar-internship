  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory muscles are essential to alveolar ventilation. In COPD, these muscles work&#xD;
      against increased mechanical loads due to airflow limitation and geometrical changes of the&#xD;
      thorax derived from pulmonary hyperinflation. Respiratory muscle fibers show several degrees&#xD;
      of impairment in cellular and subcellular structures which translates, from the functional&#xD;
      point of view, to a loss of strength (capacity to generate tension) and an increased&#xD;
      susceptibility to failure in the face of a particular load. Expiratory Muscle Training was&#xD;
      recommended to strengthen expiratory muscles and minimize exacerbations in addition to&#xD;
      delaying deterioration with better functional capacity. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES) is emerging as a new rehabilitation modality for muscle strengthening that does not&#xD;
      evoke dyspnea to obtain a benefit in patients who are unable to participate in a traditional&#xD;
      rehabilitation program&#xD;

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) remains the fourth leading cause of chronic&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality at the global level, and it represents a major problem for public&#xD;
      health. It is known that expiratory muscles are usually activated at the end of expiration in&#xD;
      COPD patients during rest, or weight-bearing breathing to compensate weakness of inspiratory&#xD;
      muscle and lung hyperinflation by time, expiratory muscle fatigue and weakness take place and&#xD;
      more lung deterioration affecting COPD patient functional capacity occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of pulmonary rehabilitation on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)&#xD;
      patients has been demonstrated in many studies. Although pulmonary rehabilitation is a&#xD;
      multi-dimensional therapy, respiratory muscle training and strengthening appears to be its&#xD;
      most effective component, expiratory muscle training improves functional exercise capacity as&#xD;
      assessed by timed walking distance, and decreases dyspnea during daily living activities,&#xD;
      resulting in a better health-related quality of life in patients with COPD. Russian current&#xD;
      is a medium frequency current, which was developed for improving muscle strength. There is&#xD;
      limited literature on the effect of Russian current in improving strength of respiratory&#xD;
      muscles. Thus, a need arises which addresses this perspective for new management strategies&#xD;

    <description>It is used to measure MEP with a pressure manometer. Measurements are usually made with patients in a sitting position and with a nose clip, Patients perform a maximal expiratory effort and sustain it for 1 to 2 seconds. The maneuver should be repeated 3 to 8 times, and the highest value recorded is used for analysis. The value obtained from the best of at least three efforts, measured at 2-min intervals, was used. Measurements will be obtained from TLC which yield higher values than those obtained of measurements from FRC</description>

    <description>Maximal Voluntary Ventilation (MVV) is a spirometry test that measures the largest volume that can be moved into and out of the lungs during a 10-15 second interval with voluntary effort. it reflect respiratory muscle endurance. In the normal subject MVV is about 15 to 20 times the resting minute volume.</description>

    <description>Modified Borg scale to determine degree of dyspnea and level of improvement in COPD patients. it is a 0 to 10 rated numerical score used to measure dyspnea as reported by the patient during during six-minute walk testing (6MWT), 0 referred to no breathing difficulties while 10 referred to maximal difficulty of breathing</description>

    <description>6 min. walking test.The 6MWT is a practical simple test that requires a 100-ft hallway but no exercise equipment or advanced training for technicians. This test measures the distance that a patient can quickly walk on a flat, hard surface in a period of 6 minutes (the 6MWD). It evaluates the global and integrated responses of all the systems involved during exercise, including the pulmonary and cardiovascular systems, systemic circulation, peripheral circulation, blood, neuromuscular units, and muscle metabolism.</description>

Patient-completed questionnaire assessing globally the impact of COPD (cough, sputum, dyspnea, chest tightness) on health status. Range of CAT scores from 0-40. Higher scores denote a more severe impact of COPD on a patient's life. The self-administered questionnaire consists of eight items assessing various manifestations of COPD aiming to provide a simple quantified measure of HRQoL</description>

    <description>patients in both groups trained 3 times a week, each session consisting of 1/2 h by the end of sessions. Initially, repeated cycles of 3 min of work followed by 2 min of rest were conducted (total work- time 18 min). The length of work intervals was increased on a weekly basis while rest periods were shortened to obtain a total work time of 30 min in the last week of the program. The valve opening pressure was continuously monitored at the mouthpiece to ensure the achievement of the target pressure. Patients will receive EMT with a threshold expiratory muscle trainer (Threshold; HealthScan), started breathing through the expiratory port of the threshold muscle trainer at a resistance equal to 15% of their Pemax for 1 week. The resistance will then increase incrementally, 5 to 10% each session, to reach 60% of their baseline Pemax at the end of the first month then continued at 60% of the Pemax, will be adjusted weekly to the new Pemax achieved</description>
