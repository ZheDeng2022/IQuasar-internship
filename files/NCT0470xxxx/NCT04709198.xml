  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of muscle wasting is high in the intensive care unit patients during the treatment&#xD;
      process and this condition is associated with adverse clinical outcomes. The etiology of&#xD;
      muscle wasting is multifactorial and medical nutrition therapy plays a key role in muscle&#xD;
      wasting treatment and prevention. The aim of this study is assesing the malnutrition and&#xD;
      fraility, anthropometric measurements, and muscle mass by ultrasound at the first admission&#xD;
      to the intensive care unit and to determine the nutritional factors affecting clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. In addition, it is planned to determine the risk factors affecting the change of&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements and muscle wasting in the first week during the intensive care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A nutrition-focused physical examination is an integral component in the assessment of&#xD;
      critically ill patients. Malnutrition, muscle wasting, and frailty are multidimensional&#xD;
      clinical conditions in critically ill patients and are associated with adverse outcomes.&#xD;
      Although malnutrition, muscle wasting and frailty are linked, the exact relation between them&#xD;
      is unsure. As a result of evaluating these conditions together, it is planned to develop new&#xD;
      treatment strategies and to improve the clinical results of patients by determining the&#xD;
      relationship between medical nutrition therapy.&#xD;
