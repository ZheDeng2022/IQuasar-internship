    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, ambispective observational study that will collect data focusing&#xD;
      on patients with lung cancers in Canada. The study will begin with ALK, EGFR, ROS1, ERBB2&#xD;
      (HER2), exon 20 EGFR mutation, MET and BRAF patients, with the goal of expanding into other&#xD;
      rare molecular alterations within year 2&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is no longer considered a single entity. In the new world of lung cancer, it&#xD;
      consists of many subgroups that are defined in different ways by different clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers. In broad categories, these include sociodemographic, molecular, treatment, or&#xD;
      biomarker-driven subgroups, to name a few. As a result, the single-center study of lung&#xD;
      cancer is not viable, as no single center has adequate numbers of each subgroup to study by&#xD;
      themselves. PALEOS is designed to use the power of a multi-institutional study to evaluate&#xD;
      these important questions of natural history, treatment patterns, outcomes as they relate to&#xD;
      new diagnostic, new biomarkers, and new treatments. Real-world data will be generated by&#xD;
      PALEOS. Thus, there will be a broader understanding of how treatments and outcomes that were&#xD;
      originally studied in the clinical trial setting would now be translated into the real-world&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To report on the natural history of multiple subgroups of lung cancer patients&#xD;
           (regardless of stage) in Canada, from 2006 onwards, using a combination of retrospective&#xD;
           and prospective methods that includes diagnostic, molecular alterations, treatment, and&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To report the real-world treatment patterns of all and specific subgroups of lung cancer&#xD;
           patients in Canada, across time (from 2006 onwards), geography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To recruit from centers that are representative of Canadian patients seen in both&#xD;
           academic and community cancer settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate patient-reported outcomes of different subgroups of lung cancer, through all&#xD;
           phases of the disease, from diagnosis through to end-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To understand the incidence, prevalence, and outcomes (efficacy and toxicity), and&#xD;
           patterns of locoregional and metastatic spread of different subgroups of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand the evolution of clinical implementation of new diagnostic tests, new&#xD;
           biomarker tests, new treatments (whether it be surgical, medical, radiation, or other),&#xD;
           including access by healthcare teams and patients, their rates of adoption into clinical&#xD;
           practice, and retention of overtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To develop economic models for various subgroups of lung cancer patients based on the&#xD;
           accumulated data within the PALEOS study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To compare the natural history, stage distribution, treatment outcomes such as treatment&#xD;
           effectiveness (composite of disease progression or death), and treatment toxicities&#xD;
           (where available) across sub-group of patients with tumors that have been molecularly&#xD;
           subtyped and identified to have rare molecular alterations.&#xD;
