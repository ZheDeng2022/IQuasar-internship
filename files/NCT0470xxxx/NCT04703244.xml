  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer patients who undergo neoadjuvant systemic therapy and have residual breast&#xD;
      cancer identified at the time of surgery exhibit a high (&gt;50%) risk of future&#xD;
      life-threatening recurrences and death.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to collect blood and leftover surgical tissue from patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer remaining after chemotherapy or endocrine therapy is completed. We will use the&#xD;
      blood and tissue for future studies. These studies will try to find ways to treat future&#xD;
      breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because there is cancer left in your body after breast cancer treatment is finished, we think&#xD;
      the cancer may be different than other cancers. Tissue from surgery will be used to try to&#xD;
      grow that kind of cancer in the lab so we can find out more about it and how to treat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be used to look at measurements of biomarkers to see how this cancer is&#xD;
      different and seek new ways to identify and treat it.&#xD;
