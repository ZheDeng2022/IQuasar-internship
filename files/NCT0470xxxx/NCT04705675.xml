      The study was designed to be parallel group, randomized controlled study (1:1). The study&#xD;
      universe consisted of all of the mothers presenting at the family health centers (FHC's) of a&#xD;
      province in Turkey over the period February 1, 2018-October 31, 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study samples were included 152 study and 152 control group which individuals selected by&#xD;
      simple random sampling.In the power analysis performed at a confidence interval of 95% and a&#xD;
      margin of error of plus/minus 5%, sample size was calculated as a total of 304 mothers with&#xD;
      152 in the study group and 152 in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers collected the data for the study. They administered the pretest and filled&#xD;
      out the personal information form prior to the planned individual education. The mothers were&#xD;
      asked to remember the pseudonyms they used on the pretest and to use the same pseudonym on&#xD;
      the posttest. Following the pretest, the mothers in the study group were taken into a&#xD;
      separate room at the FHC and asked to breastfeed their infants. The mothers' breastfeeding&#xD;
      behaviors were observed. After the breastfeeding, each mother was provided an average&#xD;
      30-minute session of individual education. All of the mothers in the study group received the&#xD;
      education from the same researcher. Both audio and visual materials were used in the mothers'&#xD;
      training. The researchers educated the mothers on breastfeeding techniques in an effort to&#xD;
      encourage them to develop the skill of correctly using the positions taught and then the&#xD;
      mothers were asked to practice what they had learned. The researcher took care to be positive&#xD;
      and support whenever the mother attempted the right move in breastfeeding while also&#xD;
      providing encouraging feedback when something went wrong. Included in the content of the&#xD;
      education were the topics of the formation of breast milk and its benefits, the duration of&#xD;
      breastfeeding, the sufficiency of breast milk, factors that reduced and increased it, things&#xD;
      to look out for before breastfeeding, taking the right position for breastfeeding and&#xD;
      positioning the baby on the breast, the steps in breastfeeding, burping the baby afterwards,&#xD;
      milking and storing the mother's milk, and other issues that could pose problems during&#xD;
      breastfeeding (Turkish Ministry of Health Basic Health Services General Directorate 2008). To&#xD;
      test the retention of what was learned in the training, a posttest was administered to the&#xD;
      groups one month following the education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Personal Information Form and the Breastfeeding Behaviors and Traditional Practices&#xD;
      Assessment Form were used as data collection tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences)&#xD;
      Statistics 22 software. Descriptive statistics (means, standard deviation, frequencies and&#xD;
      percentages) were used in the analysis of the findings. Normality tests (Kolmogorov-Smirnov&#xD;
      Test) were performed on all continuous variables.&#xD;
