  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer(EC) is the 4th most common cancer in women globally. Clinicians struggle&#xD;
      to determine 'the best' treatment for endometrial cancers as they are very hard to tell apart&#xD;
      under the microscope. Our BC team developed and validated a low-cost practical tool that can&#xD;
      reliably distinguish ECs by molecular features. Molecular classification can inform women&#xD;
      about the likelihood of their disease coming back as well as which treatments might work best&#xD;
      for them or are not needed. Investigators are studying how this classifier can identify women&#xD;
      at very low risk of disease recurrence in order to spare them toxic therapies.&#xD;

      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal will for the first time test the clinical utility of ProMisE in a pan-Canadian&#xD;
      setting. Through molecular classification, Investigators are closer to providing consistent&#xD;
      treatment to women with EC reducing disparities in care as might be observed according to&#xD;
      geography/access to care, and/or racial differences. As the primary focus for this trial&#xD;
      investigators will focus on identifying women investigators believe may be overtreated,&#xD;
      working to avoid giving toxic therapies with consequential side effects of treatment as many&#xD;
      women with EC may be cured by surgery alone. However, by performing molecular classification&#xD;
      for all new ECs enrolled investigators will also be able to identify women who are at&#xD;
      increased risk of recurrence or death from their disease based on molecular features and&#xD;
      direct them to molecular-subtype-specific clinical trials. This will, investigators believe,&#xD;
      reduce undertreatment (not identifying and treating women at high risk for recurrence) and&#xD;
      will help select the best treatment according to an individuals tumor biology. In summary,&#xD;
      the research proposed will assess the feasibility and impact of ProMisE-directed care within&#xD;
      a rigorous clinical setting - fulfilling the last step in bringing molecular&#xD;
      classification-driven care to women across the country with EC and ultimately improving&#xD;
      outcomes for women with this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a subgroup of early stage endometrial carcinomas that are at very low risk of pelvic&#xD;
      recurrence and can be identified through molecular classification providing an opportunity to&#xD;
      withhold or deescalate adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if women with POLE-mutated or p53 wild type/NSMP early stage endometrial cancer who&#xD;
      undergo surgery (hysterectomy, BSO, +/-LND)have a low risk (&lt;5%) risk of pelvic (including&#xD;
      vaginal) recurrence at 3 years with no or de-escalated adjuvant treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine recurrence-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine sites of recurrence (vaginal, pelvic, distant).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine health economic impact of molecular classification-tailored adjuvant therapy&#xD;
           on the cost of treating endometrial cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Determine the impact of molecular classification on patient Decisional Conflict Scale&#xD;
           (DCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Determine if variability in adjuvant treatment given to women with endometrial cancer is&#xD;
           decreased by molecular classification-tailored adjuvant therapy as compared to&#xD;
           current/historic standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Are there additional molecular parameters that further stratify risk of recurrence within&#xD;
      POLE or p53wt ECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other mutations are also on the Contextual Genomics FindIt™ panel and will be recorded for&#xD;
      testing of prognostic or predictive value but will not be used to stratify care nor direct&#xD;
      therapy in real time. Similarly L1CAM IHC on whole sections of representative tumor will be&#xD;
      performed and tested for associations with outcomes. Additional analysis might include&#xD;
      further IHC, proteomic, epigenetic assessment, and immune markers.Investigators will have the&#xD;
      opportunity to weigh multiple molecular and clinicopathological parameters captured in data&#xD;
      collection post hoc to see if any of these improve prognostic ability when applied with&#xD;
      ProMisE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is A single arm prospective cohort study is the most efficient trial design to address&#xD;
      the primary hypothesis. Study investigators have experience with similar successful trials in&#xD;
      other disease sites (breast-DUCHESS, LUMINA). Some components of this molecular based tool&#xD;
      are now widely reported on standard of care pathology reports (MMRd, p53) making the&#xD;
      possibility of creating a cohort blinded to these molecular results and thus randomization of&#xD;
      this cohort impractical. With implications of these molecular features impacting HCP&#xD;
      referrals, pathology categorization, and treatment opportunities (e.g., immune blockade) it&#xD;
      is not appropriate to withhold these molecular results from patients. Randomization and&#xD;
      creation of true blinded cohorts are therefore no longer feasible. Despite increasing&#xD;
      availability of some of these molecular features in most cancer centers, POLE mutation&#xD;
      testing has not routinely been available, and as yet there are no algorithms to direct&#xD;
      management based upon molecular status thus practice variability is large. A prospective&#xD;
      trial will get all components of the molecular classifier into the hands of clinicians and&#xD;
      patients. Investigators have evidence-based publications supporting treatment recommendations&#xD;
      herein, although taken from retrospective series or preclinical work. Investigators have a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial in molecular classification-driven care (PORTEC4a) that although&#xD;
      not mature enough to be published has revealed no concerns for higher rates of adverse events&#xD;
      in the observation-only arms that would threaten continuation. As clinicians are already&#xD;
      beginning to factor molecular features into their management recommendations it is imperative&#xD;
      that investigators measure the impact of implementation of molecular based triage in a&#xD;
      controlled setting. This will enable us to have preassigned 'stop' mechanisms in place if&#xD;
      higher than anticipated recurrence rates are note and has the potential to change future&#xD;
      algorithms for care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB: This trial will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, GCP and all applicable&#xD;
      regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to provide reliable estimates of the 3-year cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of pelvic recurrence, and to confirm that this probability is sufficiently low e.g.&#xD;
      de-escalation or no adjuvant therapy is safe in molecular classification selected early stage&#xD;
      ECs.&#xD;
