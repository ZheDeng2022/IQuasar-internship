      The objectives of the GECCOS project are to identify genetic variants associated with&#xD;
      complications of childhood cancer using genotype-phenotype association studies. Germline&#xD;
      genetic samples and data of the &quot;Germline DNA Biobank for Childhood Cancer and Blood&#xD;
      Disorders Switzerland&quot; (BISKIDS) which is included in the Geneva Biobank for Hematology and&#xD;
      Oncology in Pediatrics (BaHOP) will be used with clinical data of Swiss childhood cancer&#xD;
      patients collected at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine in Bern.&#xD;

      Background and rationale :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 300 children and adolescents are diagnosed with cancer each year in Switzerland. A&#xD;
      wide range of acute and chronic complications have been linked to cancer and its treatments.&#xD;
      Cancer treatments, though highly curative, have a high incidence of adverse events, not only&#xD;
      acutely but also chronically. Depending on the type and dose of treatments, the complications&#xD;
      vary. There are important inter-individual differences in the type and severity of&#xD;
      complications associated with similar cancer treatments. Genetic variation was identified to&#xD;
      affect some complications and is suspected to play an important role in many of these&#xD;
      differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GECCOS project on analysis of genetic risks for complications associated with childhood&#xD;
      cancers fills the gap to analyze germline genetic data with clinical information on short-&#xD;
      and long-term complications. This has not been done on a nationwide scale in Switzerland yet.&#xD;
      The GECCOS project will improve knowledge on germline genetic risks for complications and&#xD;
      further personalize care during acute treatment and follow-up of childhood cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify genetic variants associated with complications after childhood cancer leading&#xD;
           to specific organ dysfunctions and second primary neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the functional importance of genetic variants for complications after childhood&#xD;
           cancer through in silico and in vitro studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess genetic variants and their impact on multiple outcomes as a result of specific&#xD;
      treatment exposures.&#xD;

        Brief description of the anticipated study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Swiss childhood cancer patients and survivors are being invited to participate in the BaHOP&#xD;
        biobank hosting the Germline DNA Biobank for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders&#xD;
        Switzerland (BISKIDS). Recruitment for BISKIDS is done by the collaborators at the&#xD;
        Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine (ISPM), University of Bern. As of December&#xD;
        2019, 9,306 persons were alive and eligible to participate in this project. Participants&#xD;
        are invited in batches depending on inclusion criteria of specific sub-projects. Clinical&#xD;
        data is collected at the ISPM for childhood cancer patients and survivors since 1976 which&#xD;
        will be available for the GECCOS project for genotype-phenotype analysis.&#xD;
