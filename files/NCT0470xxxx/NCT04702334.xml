      Objective: To evaluate the adjunctive effect of hyaluronic acid (HA) gel in the treatment of&#xD;
      residual periodontal pockets over a 12-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: Periodontal patients enrolled in maintenance and presenting at least&#xD;
      one periodontal pocket 5-9 mm of depth in the anterior area were recruited from six&#xD;
      university-based centers. Each patient was randomly assigned to control treatment with&#xD;
      professional mechanical plaque removal (PMPR) and local placebo application or test treatment&#xD;
      with the adjunctive use of HA to PMPR. Clinical parameters [i.e. probing depth (PD), bleeding&#xD;
      on probing (BoP), plaque score, recession (REC), and clinical attachment loss (CAL)] and&#xD;
      microbiological samples for the investigation of the total bacterial count (TBC) and presence&#xD;
      of specific bacterial strains (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denticola, Tannerella&#xD;
      forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum) were taken at baseline and every 3 months, until study&#xD;
      termination. PD was determined as the primary outcome variable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Population A total of 144 patients were enrolled from 6 university clinical centers (Sapienza&#xD;
      University of Rome, Department of Periodontology, Rome, Italy ; University of Rijeka, School&#xD;
      of Dental Medicine, Rijeka, Croatia; University of Zagreb, Department of Periodontology,&#xD;
      Zagreb, Croatia; Jagiellonian University, Dental Institute, Krakow, Poland; Medical&#xD;
      University of Sofia, Faculty of Dentistry, Sofia, Bulgaria; Medical University of Plovdiv,&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry, Plovdiv, Bulgaria). The extension in time from patient recruitment to&#xD;
      end of the protocol was January 2016 to November 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was determined considering the patient level as statistical unit and probing&#xD;
      depth (PD) as the primary outcome measure. In order to detect a mean difference of 1 mm of PD&#xD;
      between groups with a standard deviation of 1 mm, maintaining a power of 85%, a significance&#xD;
      level (alpha) of 0.05 and a drop-out of 25%, 12 participants per group in each center were&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ethical committees of each center approved the protocol of this study. The protocol&#xD;
      followed the ethical principles of Helsinki Declaration on the good conduct of clinical&#xD;
      trials. All patients were thoroughly informed on the treatment details and on the possibility&#xD;
      of being excluded from the study if missing any of the 3 months follow-up appointments or&#xD;
      showing poor compliance in general. After verbally accepting the conditions of the protocol,&#xD;
      patients signed the informed consent prior to study initiation. Figure 1 shows step by step&#xD;
      the study protocol that each patient followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design, randomization, allocation concealment and blinding This study was projected as&#xD;
      a controlled randomized multicenter triple blinded 12-month clinical trial to compare the&#xD;
      treatment of residual periodontal pockets using standard non-surgical mechanical debridement&#xD;
      with and without hyaluronic acid gel. The detailed description of the treatment and&#xD;
      evaluation is described in the following paragraphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The operators were trained and calibrated on treatment application and on PD measurement&#xD;
      prior to study initiation. A preliminary session of PD measurements on 3 periodontal patients&#xD;
      revealed an intra-class correlation coefficient ≥ 0.75 for each operator and among different&#xD;
      operators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic web-based online randomization system was used for this study including a&#xD;
      simulation version of the software for operator training prior to trial initiation. This&#xD;
      system had been approved by the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety (AGES). The system&#xD;
      parameters were set to randomization block size of 4, treatment code selection to random,&#xD;
      using 24 treatment codes per center, and using minimization method. Centers were included as&#xD;
      a factor for randomization process with assignment probability of 0,125 for each center (8&#xD;
      centers x 0,125 = 1.0) as the randomization ratio was 1:1 corresponding to treatment/ control&#xD;
      allocation ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each operator had a username and password to perform the randomization process for each&#xD;
      patient. An accurate audit trail showed each user log entry consisting of login-ID, center&#xD;
      number, investigator name, event code, date, and time of which the event occurred. The system&#xD;
      had trial specific features (role-based access control) where trial coordinators could manage&#xD;
      each user assigned specific role determining the user's access rights. For the present study,&#xD;
      the investigators role was to randomize without the ability to view the trial design or&#xD;
      randomization design. The access to full control, view randomizations, un-blind&#xD;
      randomization, was only granted to the independent trial coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the system provided high flexibility and security including verification for the&#xD;
      personal email for each investigator to guarantee that each investigator will perform the&#xD;
      randomization personally, setting a pre-defined randomization limit, the possibility to&#xD;
      include multiple users under each center, and an effective email notification and&#xD;
      confirmation upon each randomization performed. All transactions on the system were logged&#xD;
      and an audit trail could be analyzed at any time by the trial monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation concealment was done by means of independent computerized randomization&#xD;
      sequence process which can only be accessed by the independent trial coordinator. The&#xD;
      investigators were provided with online login and were instructed to perform the&#xD;
      randomization only after finishing the baseline measurements and mechanical debridement of&#xD;
      selected tooth. To ensure that, investigators were requested to write down the exact time on&#xD;
      provided case report forms upon finishing debridement. The computerized time stamp,&#xD;
      electronic logs of sent allocation served as a method for monitoring allocation concealment.&#xD;
      Furthermore, having the randomization as parallel with stratified (stratification by center)&#xD;
      permuted blocks, served as a second layer of preventing knowledge of upcoming patient's&#xD;
      assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical operators were kept blind until the moment of adjunctive treatment application&#xD;
      allocated by the randomizer. Patients remained blinded during the entire follow-up.&#xD;
      Microbiological evaluation and statistical interpretation of the results were made blinded on&#xD;
      the treatment performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedure Each center was provided with the same amount of HA , Eppendorf tubes,&#xD;
      curettes , tooth paste , tooth brushes ** and interdental brushesǁ. Patients were instructed&#xD;
      to use the modified Bass technique for brushing twice daily with the provided toothpaste free&#xD;
      of chlorhexidine and to use the interdental brush once daily. They were instructed not to use&#xD;
      any type of mouthwash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients underwent a full mouth debridement completed within 48h in two consecutive&#xD;
      visits. The debridement was performed using ultrasonic devices followed by curettes for all&#xD;
      pockets of more than 4 mm. The ultrasonic treatment was repeated to ensure all surfaces were&#xD;
      clean, followed by polishing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At reevaluation, a tooth entering the inclusion criteria was selected. After application of&#xD;
      local anesthetic, removal of plaque and polishing of the tooth surfaces was performed&#xD;
      followed by the local administration of hyaluronic acid gel for the test group and local&#xD;
      administration of anesthetic for the control group. The tip of blunt application needle&#xD;
      mounted on the syringe containing HA was delicately inserted in the pocket until resistance&#xD;
      was felt. The injection was performed until the remnants started getting out of the pocket.&#xD;
      Patients were advised not to drink or eat for 2 hours. This adjunctive treatment was&#xD;
      performed at baseline and at the 3 months control. For both groups cleaning of supragingival&#xD;
      tooth deposits and polishing was repeated at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Numerical variables were reported as median (IQR) while categorical&#xD;
      variables were reported as frequency (percentage). McNemar test was used to test for&#xD;
      differences in proportions between time points within groups and Chi-squared test was used&#xD;
      for differences in proportions between groups. For numerical variables, time-points&#xD;
      differences were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise comparisons were&#xD;
      performed with Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon signed rank test (for unrelated and related&#xD;
      measurements respectively). Holms correction was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. A&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. All the analytical tests were&#xD;
      performed using the statistical software R (version 3.6.0).&#xD;
