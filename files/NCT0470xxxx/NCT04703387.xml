  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both premature and delayed extubation prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation and the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay and increase morbidity and mortality. Therefore,&#xD;
      accurate prediction of postextubation distress and the early diagnosis of the causes&#xD;
      responsible for failure of a trial of pressure support ventilation are of paramount&#xD;
      importance to improve the outcome of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study is designed to test the ability of cardiac and diaphragm function&#xD;
      assessed by bedside ultrasound to predict extubation failure within 48 h and re-intubation&#xD;
      within 1 week after extubation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weaning from mechanical ventilation is the process of gradual ventilatory support reduction&#xD;
      to the patient subjected to mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours. Determining the&#xD;
      correct time to extubate mechanically ventilated patients is a crucial issue in the critical&#xD;
      care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is recommended to predict weaning outcome. However, 13% to&#xD;
      26% of patients who are extubated following a successful SBT need to be reintubated within 48&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional indicators, such as respiratory rate (RR), minute ventilation, tidal volume (VT),&#xD;
      and the rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI), can reflect patients' integral conditions, but&#xD;
      none has shown great prognostic accuracy for weaning failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are several causes of weaning failure, cardiac function deterioration during&#xD;
      the weaning process combined with acute pulmonary edema is considered the leading cause of&#xD;
      weaning failure. The transition from positive to negative thoracic pressure increases venous&#xD;
      return and left ventricular afterload, decreases left ventricular compliance and may induce&#xD;
      cardiac ischemia. All of these factors tend to increase ventricular filling pressures and may&#xD;
      consequently lead to weaning-induced pulmonary edema. The efficacy of echocardiography for&#xD;
      predicting weaning failure has been reported, however there is debate over the predictive&#xD;
      value of echocardiography in this setting continues due to differences in weaning technique&#xD;
      and outcome evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diaphragm is the principal respiratory muscle. With an excursion of 1 to 2 cm, it&#xD;
      provides nearly 75% of the resting pulmonary ventilation, while during the forced breathing,&#xD;
      its amplitude is up to 7 to 11 cm. However, the diaphragm is vulnerable to damage from&#xD;
      hypotension, hypoxia, and sepsis, which are very common in critically ill patients. While in&#xD;
      surgical patients, diaphragm dysfunction is often caused by acute insults such as trauma or&#xD;
      surgical procedures. In addition, mechanical ventilation itself can decrease the force of the&#xD;
      diaphragm and induce diaphragmatic dysfunction, named as ventilator-induced diaphragmatic&#xD;
      dysfunction. Many studies have shown that Diaphragm dysfunction is responsible for a number&#xD;
      of pulmonary complications, including atelectasis and pneumonia, which are risk factors for&#xD;
      extubation failure. and might lead to weaning failure and long-term mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have reported that diaphragmatic excursion (DE) or and diaphragmatic thickening&#xD;
      fraction (DTF) could predict extubation failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although transthoracic echocardiography and diaphragm ultrasound have been confirmed in&#xD;
      independently assessing extubation outcomes, few studies have shown their different roles in&#xD;
      the weaning process until now.&#xD;

    <description>Trans-mitral flow velocities (peak early diastolic E and peak late diastolic A) will be recorded with pulsed-wave Doppler, placing the sample volume at the mitral valve tips from the apical 4-chamber view; deceleration time of the E wave (DTE) will be measured. Peak early diastolic velocity will be obtained with tissue Doppler imaging (TDI), in the apical 4-chamber view, positioning the pulsed-wave Doppler sample volume at or 1 cm within the septal insertion sites of the mitral leaflets, so as to cover the longitudinal excursion of the mitral annulus in both systole and diastole. Then, the E/A ratio and the trans-mitral inflow E wave to mitral annular e' (E/e) will be calculated.Diaphragmatic thickness will be assessed in the zone of apposition of the diaphragm to the rib cage between the 8th and 10th intercostal spaces using a 3-12 MHz linear array probe , we will record changes in diaphragm vertical excursion using M-mode ultrasound.</description>
