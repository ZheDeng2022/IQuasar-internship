  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Overweight/obesity and loss of control eating (characterized by the sense that one cannot&#xD;
      control what or how much one is eating) are prevalent among children and adolescents, and&#xD;
      both are associated with serious medical and psychosocial health complications. Although our&#xD;
      recently published data suggest that youth with these conditions may have relative deficits&#xD;
      in neurocognitive functioning, particularly working memory, understanding of how these&#xD;
      processes and their neural correlates are related to change and stability in eating and&#xD;
      weight-related outcomes over time is limited, thereby impeding development of targeted,&#xD;
      optimally timed interventions. The present study aims to assess prospective associations&#xD;
      between general and food-specific executive functioning and underlying neural substrates, and&#xD;
      eating and weight outcomes among children at varying levels of risk overweight/obesity and&#xD;
      eating disorders, which will help guide research efforts towards the development of effective&#xD;
      prevention and intervention strategies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study will examine prospective associations among general and food-specific EF&#xD;
      and related neural substrates, and the developmental course of weight gain and LOC eating&#xD;
      from middle childhood through early adolescence. Specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate prospective associations between general and food-specific EF and z-BMI&#xD;
           trajectories. We expect that across risk groups, a) poorer baseline performance on both&#xD;
           general and food-specific behavioral EF measures will predict steeper z-BMI gain&#xD;
           trajectories; and b) worsening general and food-specific EF will track with the steepest&#xD;
           z-BMI gain trajectories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate associations between general and food-specific EF and LOC eating&#xD;
           trajectories. We expect that across risk groups, a) poorer baseline performance on&#xD;
           general and food-specific behavioral EF measures will predict worsening course of LOC&#xD;
           eating; and b) worsening general and food-specific EF will track with worsening course&#xD;
           of LOC eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate prospective associations between EF neural substrates and trajectories of&#xD;
           z-BMI and LOC eating. We expect that across risk groups, a) greater activation in&#xD;
           prefrontal regions associated with EF (e.g., dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsal&#xD;
           cingulate, parietal cortex) during general and food-specific WM tasks, and b) smaller&#xD;
           decreases in activation of these regions over 18 months, will predict steeper z-BMI gain&#xD;
           trajectories and worsening course of LOC eating.&#xD;
