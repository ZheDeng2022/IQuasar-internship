      The research title is the effect of hot footbath on the sleep quality of patients with&#xD;
      chronic schizophrenia. The research was a randomized controlled trial. The setting was the&#xD;
      chronic inpatient wards at a psychiatric teaching hospital in Northern Taiwan. A total of 63&#xD;
      participants, 30 in the hot footbath group and 33 in the control group, were completed the&#xD;
      study from November 2019 to June 2020. Participants were randomly allocated to the&#xD;
      experimental group and the control group. Through this method, we explored whether the trial&#xD;
      could effectively improve patients' sleep quality.&#xD;

      with a temperature of 41℃±1℃ for 20 minutes at about 1-2 hours before sleep, and this was&#xD;
      repeated five times a week for four weeks; the control group was given routine care for four&#xD;
      weeks. The CPSQI was used to collect the pre- and post-test data. Through this method, we&#xD;
      explored whether the trial could effectively improve patients' sleep quality.&#xD;
