  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine if a sputum colour chart can aid patient&#xD;
      self-management of COPD exacerbations, such that use of the chart is non-inferior to usual&#xD;
      care with respect to hospital admissions. There are also a range of other secondary&#xD;
      objectives as detailed in the secondary outcomes section. An integral pilot phase, economic&#xD;
      evaluation and process evaluation are also included.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic, individually randomized trial, set in primary care, comparing&#xD;
      usual care to the use of a sputum colour chart in patients at risk of hospital admission for&#xD;
      Acute Exacerbation of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (AECOPD), with the hypothesis&#xD;
      that use of a colour chart will be non-inferior to usual care with respect to hospital&#xD;
      admission rate after 12 months of follow-up, this being the primary outcome measure. Use of a&#xD;
      chart might reduce antibiotic use, and thus might also change patterns of antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance long term, such that these are important secondary outcomes. There is an internal&#xD;
      pilot phase, a detailed process evaluation and a cost-effectiveness study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial protocol also includes three sub-studies: 1) using a daily electronic symptom diary&#xD;
      capable of picking up symptom defined (but potentially unreported) AECOPD, since these are an&#xD;
      important prognostic marker (section 3); 2) collecting sputum samples from patients to assess&#xD;
      patterns of antibiotic resistance and 3) a qualitative study which will include staff (for&#xD;
      example, healthcare staff delivering the intervention) and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial uses a sputum colour chart as part of a self-management intervention that enables&#xD;
      patients with COPD to determine whether they have an exacerbation, and whether this requires&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment. The 5 point sputum colour chart, adapted from Bronkotest® is being&#xD;
      used.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Datasets generated and analysed during the current study will be available upon request from Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit (BCTU: bctudatashare@contacts.bham.ac.uk). Data will typically be available within 6 months after the primary publication unless it is not possible to share the data. Only scientifically sound proposals from appropriately qualified Research Groups will be considered for data sharing. The request will be reviewed by the BCTU Data Sharing Committee in discussion with the CI and, where appropriate (or in absence of the CI) any of the following: the Trial Sponsor, the relevant Trial Management Group, and the independent Trial Steering Committee. A formal Data Sharing Agreement (DSA) may be required between respective organisations once the release of the data is approved and before data can be released. Data will be fully anonymised unless the DSA covers the transfer of patient identifiable information. Data transfer will use a secure and encrypted method.</ipd_description>
