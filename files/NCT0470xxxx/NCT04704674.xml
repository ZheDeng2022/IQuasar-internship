      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria is a disease that affects many people in Liberia. It is caused by germs (parasites)&#xD;
      that are spread by mosquito bites. Researchers want to gather data that may help them&#xD;
      understand the best way to use a malaria vaccine in Liberia, which will be important in&#xD;
      getting rid of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find out how often people of all ages who live in Fleh-la and Marshansue, Liberia, get&#xD;
      malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy people ages 6 months and older who live in Fleh-la and Marshansue in a household with&#xD;
      adults and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam and questions about their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have monthly study visits. They will be asked about any symptoms of malaria&#xD;
      and their use of bednets. Their vital signs, such as blood pressure and temperature, will be&#xD;
      checked. Blood will be taken from the participant s arm or finger with a needle. If they have&#xD;
      a fever, they will get a malaria test. If positive, they will get drugs to treat malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a month, participants houses will be examined for mosquitoes. The team will remove all&#xD;
      mosquitoes they collect. As part of this collection, participants houses will be sprayed with&#xD;
      a chemical to kill mosquitoes and other insects. Participants will not be allowed in their&#xD;
      house while the team is inside. The spray will not harm the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a year, at the monthly visit, an additional blood sample will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the participants blood samples will be used for genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for up to 3 years....&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A vaccine that interrupts malaria transmission is critical to eradicate the disease, but&#xD;
      improved assays are needed to measure the efficacy of vaccines. Transmission-blocking&#xD;
      vaccines (TBVs) work by inducing antibodies that inhibit parasite development in the mosquito&#xD;
      interrupting transmission. Efficacy of vaccines may be estimated by in vitro membrane feeding&#xD;
      assays using immune sera and laboratory mosquitoes, but qualified assays that measure&#xD;
      transmission in the field are needed to assess transmission-blocking interventions in natura.&#xD;
      Clinical trials of TBVs have started elsewhere on the continent in Mali, and we expect to&#xD;
      expand TBV studies here in Liberia in the near future. This protocol will use a longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort to gather information of malaria transmission based on the rates of blood smear&#xD;
      positive individuals by month, season and year in Fleh-la and Marshansue, in Salala, Bong&#xD;
      County, Liberia. Individuals in the villages will be approached first for participation,&#xD;
      including permission to contact their household and neighbors of their compound for&#xD;
      participation. Households will be identified using census data and individuals will be&#xD;
      consented for participation. Malaria smears will be obtained at monthly visits, in&#xD;
      conjunction with mosquito collections in/around village residences. Parasite infection rates&#xD;
      in locally caught mosquitoes will be assessed longitudinally for differences by season and&#xD;
      year. A total of 400 volunteers from Fleh-la and Marshansue will be enrolled. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed for up to 3 years, to collect data that will guide the design of future&#xD;
      community-based trials of TBV.&#xD;
