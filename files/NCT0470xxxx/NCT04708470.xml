  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Often, metastatic human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers cannot be cured. They also do&#xD;
      not respond well to treatment. Some forms of colon cancer also have poor responses to&#xD;
      treatment. Researchers want to see if a new drug treatment can help people with these types&#xD;
      of cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of entinostat in combination with NHS-IL12 and bintrafusp alfa and to see&#xD;
      if this treatment will cause tumors to shrink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who have cervical, oropharyngeal, anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile,&#xD;
      squamous cell rectal, or another cancer that may be associated with HPV infection or&#xD;
      microsatellite stable small bowel or colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Their ability to do&#xD;
      daily activities will be assessed. They may have imaging scans of the brain and/or chest,&#xD;
      abdomen, and pelvis. They may have nuclear bone scans. They will have an electrocardiogram to&#xD;
      test heart function. They will have blood and urine tests. They may have a tumor biopsy.&#xD;
      Participants with skin lesions may have them photographed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be done in 28-day cycles. Participants will get bintrafusp alfa through an&#xD;
      intravenous catheter every 2 weeks. They will get NHS-IL12 as an injection under the skin&#xD;
      every 4 weeks. They will take entinostat by mouth once a week. They will complete a medicine&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get treatment for 2 years. They will have 1-2 follow-up visits in the 30&#xD;
      days after treatment ends. Then they will be contacted every 6 months to check on their&#xD;
      health.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although PD-1(L1) inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of over a dozen different&#xD;
      tumor types in recent years, the majority of patients with advanced cancer still do not&#xD;
      respond to these agents, including patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) colon cancer and&#xD;
      patients with checkpoint refractory cancers (e.g., oropharyngeal, cervical).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies suggest that treatment with a bifunctional fusion protein targeting PD-L1&#xD;
      and TGF beta (bintrafusp alfa) may help overcome resistance or refractoriness to anti&#xD;
      PD-1(L1) therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor&#xD;
      (HDAC inhibitor) concomitantly with anti PD-1(L1) therapy is safe and may help overcome&#xD;
      resistance or refractoriness to anti PD-1(L1) therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that treatment with a tumor targeted immunocytokine&#xD;
      (NHS-IL12) concomitantly with anti PD-1(L1) therapy is safe and may help overcome resistance&#xD;
      or refractoriness to anti PD-1(L1) therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies suggest that the use of a combination of multiple immunotherapy agents&#xD;
      may have improved anti-tumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, preclinical studies have shown that the combination of three immunotherapy&#xD;
      agents (1) an HDAC inhibitor, entinostat (2) a tumor targeted immunocytokine (NHS-IL12), and&#xD;
      (3) a bifunctional fusion protein targeting PD-L1 and TGF beta (bintrafusp alfa) produces&#xD;
      greater anti-tumor activity than single or dual combinations of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of entinostat in combination with&#xD;
      NHS-IL12 and bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) (PR+CR) according to Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria (RECIST 1.1) of the combination of entinostat, NHS-IL12, and bintrafusp&#xD;
      alfa in two separate populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Checkpoint refractory human papillomavirus (HPV) associated malignancies;&#xD;
&#xD;
      MSS small bowel or colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumor (Cohort 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic HPV associated malignancies (Cohort 2), or MSS small bowel or colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (Cohort 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the participant declines standard&#xD;
      treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have measurable disease per RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II trial of combination immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be treated with a week lead in of entinostat alone followed by the&#xD;
      combination of entinostat, NHS-IL12 and bintrafusp alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I (Arm 1) will be conducted using dose escalation/de-escalation of entinostat and dose&#xD;
      escalation of NHSIL12 with a fixed dose of bintrafusp alfa in Cohort 1 (up to 30 total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the combination of all three agents has been determined to be safe, participants from&#xD;
      Cohort 2 and Cohort 3 may enroll into Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: (Arm 2) will be conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 2 (checkpoint refractory HPV associated malignancies, 16 total) and cohort 3 (MSS&#xD;
      small bowel or colorectal cancer, 16 total) participants will each be enrolled to Arm 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one or more out of twelve participants in a given cohort (2 or 3) has an objective&#xD;
      response, accrual will be expanded to enroll 16 evaluable participants on that cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 3 or more of 16 (18.8%) participants respond in a given cohort-arm combination, that would&#xD;
      be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study of the combination in later trials in&#xD;
      that disease type.&#xD;

             adequately treated localized skin cancer, cervical carcinoma in situ, superficial&#xD;
             bladder cancer, or other localized malignancy which has been adequately treated or&#xD;
             malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
             which does not require active systemic treatment (e.g. low risk chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
             leukemia (CLL)).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with a known severe hypersensitivity reaction to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to any of study drugs (grade &gt;/= 3 NCI-CTCAE v5) will&#xD;
             be evaluated by the allergy/immunology team prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Pregnant women are excluded from this study because these drugs have not been tested&#xD;
             in pregnant women and there is potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with these immunotherapies, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated on this protocol.&#xD;
