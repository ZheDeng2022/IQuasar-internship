  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As more and more patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) become parents, we have studied parenting&#xD;
      concerns in this serious chronic disease in a first study (MucoPar) which is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study (MucoKids) is an extension of the previous MucoPar study and aims to&#xD;
      explore and collect the perceptions, expectations and needs of children whose one parent has&#xD;
      CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done in the context of individual interviews or in several small groups of&#xD;
      children led by a psychologist who will encourage them to develop what constitutes to be the&#xD;
      child of somebody with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected information should make it possible to develop and propose adapted&#xD;
      medico-psycho-social interventions, if necessary, in connection with patient associations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Life expectancy has improved significantly in cystic fibrosis in recent years. From pediatric&#xD;
      disease, it has become a disease of the adult, with the emergence of new issues, such as&#xD;
      becoming a parent. Parent patients still face the risk of complications and death while their&#xD;
      child is still young. However, there is very little data in the literature on parenting in&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis. In a first study which is ongoing (43 patients out of the 50 planned have&#xD;
      been included), we intended to study parenting, considering the sick parent's point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this question does not only concern parents and their spouses. It is also&#xD;
      fundamental to take into account the experience of the children, to understand their&#xD;
      experiences and their own needs in this context of serious illness of a parent with limited&#xD;
      life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore and collect the perceptions, expectations&#xD;
      and needs of children whose one parent has CF. Children are eligible from the age of 6 if&#xD;
      their parents agree.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will have semi-structured individual interviews or will participate in focus groups&#xD;
      with the study psychologist in order to express their feelings, difficulties, expectations&#xD;
      and needs in living with a parent who has CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thematic analysis of the content will first be done separately for individual interviews and&#xD;
      focus groups, and a global synthesis will be carried out.&#xD;
