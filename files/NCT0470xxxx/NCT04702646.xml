    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to determine the agreement between colon cleansing quality&#xD;
      assessed by a validated scale (Boston Bowel Preparation Scale, BBPS) and the perception of&#xD;
      the patient. Patients will be prepared with polyethylene glycol (PEG), PEG plus ascorbic acid&#xD;
      (PEG-Asc) or sodium picosulfate-oxide magnesium solution (PS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim is to assess predictors of poor bowel cleansing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although, current guidelines recommend a rate of inadequate bowel cleansing for colonoscopy&#xD;
      not higher than 10-15%, in clinical practice poor bowel cleansing in endoscopy units ranged&#xD;
      between 6.8% and 33 The patient's perception of their colon cleansing before colonoscopy has&#xD;
      been stated as a predictor of cleansing quality in a limited number of studies. In such a&#xD;
      way, if the agreement between the patient's reported colon cleansing and the quality during&#xD;
      colonoscopy is optimal, rescue cleansing strategies such as the administration of additional&#xD;
      bowel solution might be indicated. In the studies that assessed the relationship between&#xD;
      patient and colonoscopy assessment of colon cleansing quality the agreement was fair. The&#xD;
      main drawback of these studies is that they do not used a validated colonoscopy cleansing&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, ideally, patient-referred information regarding the quality of colon cleaning&#xD;
      could be a factor of great value in guiding rescue strategies. However, the available&#xD;
      evidence of the correlation between the patient's perception of the quality of colon&#xD;
      cleansing at the time of colonoscopy is scarce and has also not been adequately studied.&#xD;
      Evaluating this correlation in a cohort of unselected patients referred for outpatient&#xD;
      colonoscopy and using a universally accepted validated colon cleansing quality scale could&#xD;
      help to determine whether this system is a good predictor of inadequate colon cleansing and&#xD;
      can guide the implementation of rescue strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will offer to participate in the study to patients scheduled for a&#xD;
      colonoscopy who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      researchers will explain the purpose of the study and will ask to sign the informed consent.&#xD;
      They will give verbal and written information. Patients will fill out a questionnaire on the&#xD;
      day of colonoscopy on the perception of cleanliness based on the last stool. To do this, a&#xD;
      set with 4 figures (light liquid, light liquid with lumps, dark liquid or solid particles)&#xD;
      used in a previous study will be shown to the patient and the patient should indicate which&#xD;
      figure is more similar to the last bowel movement. Optionally, the patient will be able to&#xD;
      provide the investigating staff with a photo of their last deposition. Patients should also&#xD;
      note the hour of the last stool. Four researchers will chose the set considered more&#xD;
      appropriate for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, three sets compound of 4 pictures of different cleansing qualities will be&#xD;
      presented to a subgroup of patients to test which one is more similar to the last stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the colonoscopy will be performed and the cleaning quality will be scored&#xD;
      according to the BBPS considering suboptimal a cleaning quality of less than 2 points in a&#xD;
      segment of the colon. Patients will receive any of the routinely used colonic preparations in&#xD;
      the hospital, i.e. Casenglycol® (polyethylene glycol), Moviprep® (polyethylene glycol and&#xD;
      ascorbic acid) and Citrafleet® (picosulfate sodium, light magnesium oxide, citric acid).The&#xD;
      bowel cleansing quality following BBPS will be assessed by the endoscopist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the agreement between the colon cleansing quality assessed&#xD;
      by the BBPS and the patient reported colon quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our unit the percentage of colonoscopies with poor preparation in unselected population is&#xD;
      about 15-20% of patients undergoing colonoscopy. For the logistic regression model it is&#xD;
      necessary to include 10 patients with poor preparation for each variable. Initially&#xD;
      hypothesizing that we will include 9 variables, a total of 600 patients will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The t Student test will be used to compare groups in continuous variables. All values of p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 shall be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A univariate analysis will be performed comparing each of the possible predictor variables&#xD;
      with the dependent variable with the cleaning quality during colonoscopy (BBPS ≥ 2 in each&#xD;
      segment). Subsequently, a logistic regression analysis will be carried out to evaluate the&#xD;
      predictor factors of adequate quality evaluated by the BBPS including those with a&#xD;
      significance of ≤ 0.15.&#xD;
