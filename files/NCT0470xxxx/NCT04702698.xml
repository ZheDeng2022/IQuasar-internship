  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the effect of food on the Pharmacokinetic (PK) of a single dose of&#xD;
      peposertib administered as film-coated tablet under fed and fasted conditions. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the PK profile of peposertib administered as an oral suspension of disintegrated tablets and&#xD;
      as film-coated tablets will be compared under fasted conditions to evaluate the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability in healthy participants.&#xD;
