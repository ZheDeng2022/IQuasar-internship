    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the concentration of formaldehyde in the urine of&#xD;
      women with recurrent urinary tract infections on Hiprex; and then, assuming its urinary&#xD;
      presence is confirmed at the proper acid urinary pH, evaluate if such a therapy has favorable&#xD;
      effects in decreasing the rate of recurrent urinary tract infections over time.&#xD;
