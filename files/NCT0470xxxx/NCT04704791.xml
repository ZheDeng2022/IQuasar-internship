  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is common and increases the risk of stroke. Traditionally patients are&#xD;
      treated with blood thinning medications or at the time of surgery the part of the heart where&#xD;
      blood clots form is cut out. Surgically cutting out the left atrial appendage can be&#xD;
      difficult and complications can occur. An alternative strategy is to create a tunnel to&#xD;
      increase blood flow and wash out the part of the heart where clots form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This strategy has not been previously studied. The purpose of this study is to determine if&#xD;
      creating a tunnel to increase blood flow is feasible and safe.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to understand the potential avenues to increase Left Atrial Appendage (LAA) flow&#xD;
      in patients with Atrial Fibrillation (AF) to minimize systemic embolization risk. Flow&#xD;
      modeling demonstrates that the anatomy of the LAA results in decreased velocities in the LAA&#xD;
      apex. Introduction of a 3-4mm shunt in the apex can result in increased velocity, less stasis&#xD;
      and a lower propensity for thrombus formation. Small (&lt;8mm) inter-chamber shunts can exist in&#xD;
      humans with no long term hemodynamic consequences in otherwise structurally normal hearts -&#xD;
      making a strategy of pulmonary artery (PA) to LAA shunt an attractive potential therapy given&#xD;
      anatomic proximity and gradient differential between the cardiac chambers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a 5 patient first-in-human feasibility study. The population will include&#xD;
      patients undergoing CABG or other cardiovascular surgery with AF and a CHADS2 score &gt;1 in&#xD;
      whom the treating team deems traditional therapy with anticoagulants is prohibitive or&#xD;
      ineffective (dialysis or EGFR preoperatively &lt;15, previous bleeding with non-reversible&#xD;
      pathology, clinically deemed contraindicated to oral anticoagulant). The intervention will be&#xD;
      PA-LAA shunt creation at the time of surgery. As this is a single arm study there will be no&#xD;
      comparison group.&#xD;
