  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is still an ongoing lack of awareness about thalassemia among Indonesians despite high&#xD;
      disease prevalence, and this is associated with poor implementation of preventive and&#xD;
      promotive measures. Thalassemia experts argue that education and raising awareness about&#xD;
      thalassemia must be done from an early age in order to relieve the heavy disease burden of&#xD;
      thalassemia, especially in Indonesia as it is geographically located in the thalassemia belt.&#xD;
      In spite of this, there has been limited research on public perception towards thalassemia in&#xD;
      Indonesia, particularly among young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researcher will ask young people in Indonesia between the age of 15-24 who&#xD;
      are currently attending high school or university-level education to fill in an online&#xD;
      survey. The survey consists of questions about the participants' demographic information as&#xD;
      well as their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores towards thalassemia. The study&#xD;
      is expected to run from December 2020 to March 2021, with the online survey distributed in&#xD;
      January 2021. Data collection will immediately follow, and it will be analyzed using&#xD;
      univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using the appropriate statistical tests. The&#xD;
      findings gathered from this study will be vital in providing new insight into how the youth&#xD;
      sees thalassemia in Indonesia. Such public health information will prove to be important in&#xD;
      designing successful thalassemia intervention and education programs for Indonesian youth.&#xD;

      Research concept&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researcher will ask young people in Indonesia between the age of 15-24 who&#xD;
      are currently attending high school or university-level education to fill in an online&#xD;
      survey. The survey consists of questions about the participants' demographic information as&#xD;
      well as their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) scores towards thalassemia. The study&#xD;
      is expected to run from December 2020 to March 2021, with the online survey distributed in&#xD;
      January 2021. Data collection will immediately follow, and it will be analysed using&#xD;
      univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using the appropriate statistical tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of Indonesian youth, the study design used&#xD;
      will be observational, cross-sectional. An online questionnaire developed by the research&#xD;
      team along with several experts is expected to be disseminated to the target population in&#xD;
      January 2021. In light of the ongoing pandemic, this is expected to be a nationwide study&#xD;
      where most of the work is done via online methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and period of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted via online survey due to the ongoing pandemic situation. The&#xD;
      study is expected to run from December 2020 to March 2021.&#xD;
