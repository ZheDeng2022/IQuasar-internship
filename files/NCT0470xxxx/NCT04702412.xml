  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains problematic. Our team has thus developed a&#xD;
      new patient-reported measure of barriers to ART adherence (the I-Score) which will be&#xD;
      completed by HIV patients through the Opal patient portal for routine HIV care. This 6-month&#xD;
      mixed method pilot study will implement the I-Score/Opal intervention with 5 HIV physicians&#xD;
      at the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Quebec) and 30 of their patients. The&#xD;
      study's primary objectives are to assess patient and physician perceptions of the&#xD;
      intervention (e.g., acceptability) and evaluate the implementation strategy. The data&#xD;
      collected will help plan and determine the feasibility of a definitive effectiveness trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) remains problematic. Regular monitoring&#xD;
      of its barriers is clinically recommended, however, patient-provider communication around&#xD;
      adherence is often inadequate. Our team thus decided to develop a new electronically&#xD;
      administered patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) of barriers to ART adherence (the&#xD;
      I-Score) to facilitate the systematic capture of this data for physician consideration in&#xD;
      routine HIV care. To prepare for a controlled definitive trial to test the I-Score&#xD;
      intervention, a pilot study was designed. Its primary objectives are to evaluate patient and&#xD;
      physician perceptions of the I-Score intervention and its implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This one-arm, 6-month study will adopt a mixed method type 3&#xD;
      implementation-effectiveness hybrid design and be conducted at the Chronic Viral Illness&#xD;
      Service of the McGill University Health Centre (Montreal, Canada). Five HIV physicians and 30&#xD;
      of their HIV patients with known or suspected adherence problems will participate. The&#xD;
      intervention will involve having patients complete the I-Score in the Opal smartphone&#xD;
      application, before meeting with their physician. Both patient and physician will have access&#xD;
      to the I-Score results, for consideration during the clinic visits at Times 1, 2 (3 months),&#xD;
      and 3 (6 months). The implementation strategy will focus on stakeholder involvement,&#xD;
      education, and training; promoting the intervention's adaptability; and hiring an Application&#xD;
      Manager to facilitate implementation. Implementation, patient, and service outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected (Times 1-2-3). The primary outcome is the intervention's acceptability to patients&#xD;
      and physicians. Qualitative data obtained, in part, through physician focus groups (Times&#xD;
      2-3) and patient interviews (Times 2-3) will help evaluate the implementation strategy and&#xD;
      inform any methodological adaptations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study will help plan a definitive trial to test the efficacy of the I-Score&#xD;
      intervention. It will generate needed data on electronic PROM interventions in routine HIV&#xD;
      care that will help improve understanding of conditions for their successful implementation.&#xD;
