      This research study will assess the feasibility of using an implantable microdevice to&#xD;
      measure local intratumor response to chemotherapy and other clinically relevant drugs in&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with suspected or confirmed ovarian cancer whose treatment plan includes surgery&#xD;
      as a component of standard-of-care treatment will be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the study intervention involved in this study is: implantable microdevice&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participant will undergo percutaneous placement of several microdevices in a selected&#xD;
           tumor deposit prior to surgery. The microdevices will dwell in the tumor tissue for&#xD;
           approximately 24 +/- 8 hours to allow time for tissue effects of the drugs in the&#xD;
           microdevice reservoirs. Microdevices will then be removed by resection of the tumor mass&#xD;
           during a previously planned, and clinically indicated, surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that about 20 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining&#xD;
      this microdevice. The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the&#xD;
      microdevice as a tool to identify which cancer treatment is best for any disease.&#xD;

             defined as disease outside of the pelvis) ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal&#xD;
             cancer. If a patient has suspected ovarian cancer but final histologic analysis does&#xD;
             not show evidence of ovarian cancer, the patient will be removed from the study and&#xD;
             replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet one of the following clinical categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 1: Patients with a new or suspected diagnosis of ovarian cancer who are&#xD;
                  deemed surgical candidates for primary cytoreductive surgery (as per their&#xD;
                  surgical gynecologic oncologist) and who have not yet undergone surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 2: Patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancers who are being considered&#xD;
                  for either primary surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy by their surgical&#xD;

                  their candidacy for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cohort 3: Patients with recurrent ovarian cancer who are candidates for secondary&#xD;
                  cytoreduction, e.g. to confirm diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer and/or&#xD;
                  remove oligometastatic lesions.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must be deemed medically stable to undergo both percutaneous procedures and&#xD;
             standard-of-care surgical procedures by their treating gynecologic oncologist and&#xD;
             medical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will undergo laboratory testing within 7 days prior to the microdevice&#xD;
             placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients must have absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 75,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PT (INR) &lt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  PTT &lt; 1.5x control&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test (urine or&#xD;
                  serum)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be evaluated by a surgical gynecologic oncologist who will determine&#xD;
             the clinically appropriate treatment strategy (primary surgery or neoadjuvant&#xD;
             chemotherapy) based on clinical history and extent of disease. The patient's surgical&#xD;
             and/or medical gynecologic oncologist must also confirm the patient's medical fitness&#xD;
             to undergo an additional biopsy procedure and the indicated surgical procedure. The&#xD;
             patient must have a plan to undergo surgery for clinical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must have undergone an abdominal/pelvic CT scan that both assesses&#xD;
                  the extent of disease and identifies an area of tumor amenable to safe&#xD;
                  microdevice placement. CT scans with both oral and IV contrast media are&#xD;
                  preferred but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        CT scans performed at outside institutions are acceptable providing that the images are&#xD;
        considered adequate to assess the stage of the disease and to assess the safety and&#xD;
        feasibility of the placement of the microdevices and their retrieval during standard-of&#xD;
        care surgery. CT scan must be completed within 4 weeks prior to the microdevice placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has sufficient volume of disease as measured by CT scan to allow implantation&#xD;
             of the microdevice.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has sufficient volume of disease that removal of the lesion where the&#xD;
             microdevice is placed will not potentially affect adequate tissue for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A lesion can be selected where the microdevice is to be implanted that is&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amenable to percutaneous placement&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amenable to removal at the time of surgery or laparoscopy. If patient is&#xD;
                  undergoing laparoscopy, the lesion must be able to be removed using a&#xD;
                  laparoscopic approach in a manner that would not significantly alter the&#xD;
                  procedure or affect patient safety, per opinion of the surgical oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a&#xD;
                       written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients must be willing to undergo research-related genetic sequencing&#xD;
                       (somatic and germline) and data management, including the deposition of&#xD;
                       de-identified genetic sequencing data in NIH central data repositories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit the safety of a&#xD;
             biopsy and/or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because of the possible increased dose of&#xD;
             radiation from imaging associated with the microdevice placement and the potential&#xD;
             risk to the pregnancy of the biopsy/device placement in an abdominal lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncorrectable bleeding or coagulation disorder known to cause increased risk with&#xD;
             surgical or percutaneous biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant risk factors (including, but not limited to, high risk of venous&#xD;
             thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, stroke or myocardial infarction) precluding the safe&#xD;
             cessation of anticoagulation medication as per SIR guidelines. (Patients taking&#xD;
             low-dose aspirin only do not need to be excluded.)&#xD;
