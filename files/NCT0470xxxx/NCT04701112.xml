  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacing (BVP) is indicated for&#xD;
      patients with low ejection fraction and persistent symptoms of heart failure despite medical&#xD;
      therapy and a wide QRS-complex, preferably with a left bundle branch block. Unfortunately, up&#xD;
      to 40 % receiving CRT do not respond with subjective improvement or improved left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction from the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few therapeutic alternatives in patients not responding to CRT with BVP, and the&#xD;
      potential to improve cardiac function in these patients could make a large difference in&#xD;
      terms of life quality and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      His-bundle pacing (HBP) can be a suitable alternative, but is likely not possible in all&#xD;
      patients with failed CRT. Furthermore, upgrading to HBP does require a surgical procedure and&#xD;
      therefore exposes the patients to risk of complications (e.g. infection of the device).&#xD;
      Therefore, early identification of the patients who are likely to benefit from an upgrade to&#xD;
      HBP would be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate if patients with failed CRT treatment will benefit from&#xD;
      hemodynamic improvement if they are treated with temporary HBP, without opening the&#xD;
      device-pocket, and exposing the existing pacemaker-device to a risk of infection. A temporary&#xD;
      pacemaker lead and pacing sheath will be used, and placed in the heart via a blood vessel on&#xD;
      the right side of neck, using local anaesthesia. Acute effects on the pump function of the&#xD;
      heart will be measured during rest and during supine bicycle test (the equivalent of moderate&#xD;
      physical activity). Factors associated with a beneficial effect will be evaluated on a group&#xD;
      basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the individual patient experiences an improvement of cardiac function during the test,&#xD;
      he/she will be offered an upgrade to HBP and a replacement of the existing device.&#xD;

      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      His-bundle pacing will lead to a better stroke volume at rest compared to biventricular&#xD;
      pacing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stroke-volume (ml) at rest assessed by invasive hemodynamic measurements with the&#xD;
      thermodilution method using a Swan-Ganz catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the dedicated CRT outpatient clinic at Skane University&#xD;
      Hospital. This outpatient clinic evaluates all CRT recipients at 6 months after device&#xD;
      implant. If the patient is then a &quot;non-responder&quot; by subjective and objective measures, it is&#xD;
      unlikely that there will be any further benefit from the CRT device. Those patients&#xD;
      fulfilling the inclusion criteria but not the exclusion criteria will therefore be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Written information will be provided to all patients prior to&#xD;
      informed consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a temporary His-bundle stimulation and hemodynamic evaluation. The&#xD;
      procedure takes place at the dedicated laboratory for advanced hemodynamic evaluation at&#xD;
      Sk√•ne University Hospital in Lund. The first option for vascular access is the right external&#xD;
      jugular vein. Under sterile conditions, ultrasound guided venous puncture will be performed,&#xD;
      using standard Seldinger technique. A 7F catheter (Medtronic C315) will then be placed over a&#xD;
      long guidewire, and used to direct a dedicated pacemaker lead (Medtronic Select Secure 3830)&#xD;
      to the His bundle. In case of technical difficulties, a steerable 9F catheter will be used&#xD;
      instead (Medtronic C304 deflectable). If HBP is not possible using jugular access, an&#xD;
      alternate access via the right femoral vein may be used instead. If the femoral vein is used,&#xD;
      only resting measurements will be performed, since it is not possible to thread on the supine&#xD;
      bike with a catheter in situ via the femoral vein. In parallel, in a short 8F introducer, a&#xD;
      7F multilumen Swan Ganz catheter will be placed over a long guidewire, and advanced to the&#xD;
      left or right pulmonary artery. The catheter will then be wedged in a pulmonary segmental&#xD;
      artery to obtain left atrial pressure curves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pacing lead will be connected to an electrophysiology 12-lead ECG system with capability&#xD;
      of pacing and continuous ECG registration of external and intracardiac signals. His bundle&#xD;
      potential will be identified probing the correct anatomical area with the electrode, and&#xD;
      subsequently the pacing properties of the electrode will be tested. If the pacing properties&#xD;
      result in selective (or subsidiary non-selective) his bundle capture, the electrode will be&#xD;
      secured in place by 2-3 careful rotations of the entire electrode. The goal is to achieve a&#xD;
      stable position with minimal risk of damaging the conduction system by trauma. Since the&#xD;
      patients are paced using the CRT device anyway, trauma to the conduction system will not be&#xD;
      deleterious, but it may hamper the ability to place a permanent HBP lead at a later stage, if&#xD;
      that is indicated. When stable pacing conditions are in place, the stimulation program will&#xD;
      be initiated. Depending on randomization results, the intrinsic CRT system or the temporary&#xD;
      His-lead will be used for pacing. Pacing and sensing in the right atrium will be achieved&#xD;
      using atrial electrodes on the outside of the Swan Ganz catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are randomized to wither Biventricular pacing first or HBP first. The pacing&#xD;
      program involves both pacing at rest and pacing during sub maximal exercise test (supine&#xD;
      bicycle test). Each pacing step is sustained at steady state for at least 2 minutes prior to&#xD;
      measurement of intracardiac pressures, cardiac output and stroke volume calculations. After&#xD;
      the pacing protocol is finished, the catheters are withdrawn and the site of venopuncture is&#xD;
      manually compressed during 5 minutes. The patients are then observed during 2 hours, before&#xD;
      discharge and completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hemodynamic optimization will be performed regarding device settings for all patients.&#xD;
      Patients who have a positive hemodynamic response to HBP, compared to CRT pacing, will at a&#xD;
      follow-up stage be offered an upgrade to permanent HBP.&#xD;
