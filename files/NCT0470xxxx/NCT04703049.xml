  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our study, we aimed to investigate how whole blood viscosity (WBV) affects the development&#xD;
      of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI).&#xD;

      In our study, 500 patients who applied to the cardiology clinic and underwent PCI for&#xD;
      elective procedure, ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and non-STEMI were&#xD;
      prospectively included. Before the procedure, we calculated WBV using the formula [(0.12 ×&#xD;
      hematocrit) + (0.17 × (total protein - 2.07)]. We defined CIN as the absolute (≥0.5 mg/dl) or&#xD;
      relative increase (≥25%) in serum creatinine 48-72 h after exposure to a contrast agent&#xD;
      compared with baseline serum creatinine values.&#xD;

        The study started with the approval of the local ethics committee. Five hundred patients&#xD;
        between ages 18 and 90 who underwent PCI in our hospital between July 10, 2017, and October&#xD;
        31, 2017, were prospectively included. Informed consent forms were obtained from the&#xD;
        patients. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who underwent hemodialysis or&#xD;
        peritoneal dialysis for this reason and patients who underwent to coronary bypass surgery&#xD;
        within 48 h were excluded from the study.&#xD;
