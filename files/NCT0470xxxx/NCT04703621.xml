  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A multicenter clinical, open-label total dose-escalating phase II study with safety run-in to&#xD;
      explore the clinical activity, total dosage, and safety of daratumumab in adult ITP patients&#xD;
      who have not responded adequately or relapsed after corticosteroids and at least one&#xD;
      second-line therapy including rituximab and/or TPO-RA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with chronic ITP require repeated or continuous medications to maintain a safe&#xD;
      platelet count.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B-cell depletion with rituximab in ITP induces the differentiation of short-lived auto-immune&#xD;
      plasma cells into pathogenic long-lived plasma cells in the spleen that was not present&#xD;
      before treatment. It has been reported that refractory ITP is related to the presence of&#xD;
      long-lived plasma cells, which are resistant to steroids and immunosuppressants, including&#xD;
      rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings lead to the hypothesis that therapy directed against plasma cells may help&#xD;
      overcome treatment resistance. At least in a proportion of patients, treatment resistance is&#xD;
      caused by CD20 negative long-lived plasma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the efficacy, the optimal number of treatments, and safety of&#xD;
      anti-CD38 antibody daratumumab steroid-refractory or steroid-dependent in ITP patients who&#xD;
      fail to respond to at least one previous second-line therapy, including rituximab and/ or TPO&#xD;
      agonist.&#xD;
