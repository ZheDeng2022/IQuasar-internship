      The Automatic Tongue Diagnosis System (ATDS) was developed to capture tongue images and&#xD;
      extract features reliably to assist the diagnosis of TCM practitioners.This project will&#xD;
      employ the ATDS verified to extract the tongue features of patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease(CKD) including dialysis patients. A TCM indices derived through the non-intrusive&#xD;
      tongue diagnosis procedure can provide valuable information for clinical doctors to analyze&#xD;
      the current status of a patient and dynamically schedule a treatment plan, facilitating early&#xD;
      detection and diagnosis of CKD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important global public health problem. According to&#xD;
      related literatures, the prevalence of CKD is about 11% .CKD is a progressive disease. If it&#xD;
      progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal replacement therapy: dialysis and renal&#xD;
      transplantation, is required to maintain life. The growing prevalence and progression of&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) raises concerns about our capacity to manage its economic burden&#xD;
      to patients, caregivers, and society. The societal direct and indirect costs of CKD and&#xD;
      end-stage renal disease are substantial and increase throughout disease progression. There is&#xD;
      significant variability in the evidence about direct and indirect costs attributable to CKD&#xD;
      and end-stage renal disease, with the most complete evidence concentrated on direct health&#xD;
      care costs of patients with advanced to end-stage CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CKD, also called chronic kidney failure, is described as a sustained reduction in glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate or evidence of structural or functional kidney abnormalities.Chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) refers to all five stages of kidney damage, from very mild damage in stage 1 to&#xD;
      complete kidney failure in stage 5. CKD symptoms include pain, itch(pruritus), peripheral&#xD;
      numbness, sleep disturbances, depression, fatigue, nausea and vomiting. Factors that&#xD;
      contribute to these symptoms include anaemia, uraemic toxins, reduced renal capacity, chronic&#xD;
      disease-related inflammation, and psychological stress associated with long-term illness.If&#xD;
      it progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), renal replacement therapy, including&#xD;
      hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation, is required to maintain life.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is essential to find effective and conservative treatment methods to delay the&#xD;
      progression of CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is based on four procedures, observation,&#xD;
      smelling or listening, inquiry, and palpation. Tongue diagnosis, serving as a vital&#xD;
      non-invasive tool to provide useful clinical information, plays a pivotal role in TCM. The&#xD;
      tongue is considered to reflect the physiological and pathological condition of the body, as&#xD;
      well as the degree and progression of disease, through the meridians that connect the tongue&#xD;
      to the internal organs.By observing tongue features, TCM practitioners can probe qi-blood,&#xD;
      yin-yang disorders which are important in treatment selection and prognosis.Clinically,&#xD;
      practitioners observe tongue characteristics, such as tongue color and shape, fur color and&#xD;
      thickness, and the amount of saliva, to help deduce the primary pattern of a patient.&#xD;
      However, tongue diagnosis is often biased by subjective judgment, which originates from&#xD;
      personal experience, knowledge, diagnostic skills, thinking patterns, and color&#xD;
      perception/interpretation.The inconsistency of subjective diagnosis can be improved by using&#xD;
      the development of validated instruments. The automatic tongue diagnosis system (ATDS) has&#xD;
      shown high consistency and can provide objective and reliable information and analysis of&#xD;
      tongue features, facilitating doctors in making effective observations and diagnoses of&#xD;
      specific diseases.Previous studies have been conducted on exploring the association between&#xD;
      tongue characteristics and specific diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
      breastcancer,type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, eczema, dysmenorrhea and functional&#xD;
      dyspepsia, gastroesophageal reflux disease.However, to the best of our knowledge, no study&#xD;
      has yet been performed on the comprehensive scrutiny of tongue features in patients with CKD&#xD;
      using ATDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this protocol are to apply the noninvasive ATDS to evaluate tongue&#xD;
      manifestations in patients with CKD, and to provide valuable information for clinical&#xD;
      doctors, which can be used to facilitate the early detection and diagnosis of CKD, to analyze&#xD;
      the current status of patients, and to dynamically schedule treatment plans.&#xD;
