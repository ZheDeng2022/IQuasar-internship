    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of duvelisib as a&#xD;
      monotherapy in subjects diagnosed with follicular lymphoma (FL) that is relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory to either chemotherapy or radioimmunotherapy (RIT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, multi-center clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of duvelisib administered to subjects who have been diagnosed with follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      that is relapsed or refractory to either chemotherapy or RIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects (n=57) will receive 25 mg duvelisib twice daily (BID) over the course of 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycles for up to 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing 12 treatment cycles of duvelisib, subjects may continue to receive&#xD;
      additional cycles of duvelisib until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. However,&#xD;
      to receive additional cycles of duvelisib beyond 12 cycles, subjects must have evidence of&#xD;
      response (CR, PR or SD) by the end of Cycle 12.&#xD;
