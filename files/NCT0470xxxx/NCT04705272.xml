  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Excessive weight gain during pregnancy can promote subsequent obesity or increase&#xD;
      pre-existing maternal obesity, lead to complications during pregnancy, such as gestational&#xD;
      diabetes, hypertension and pre-pregnancy eclampsia, which affect fetal growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What are the determinants of excessive weight gain? The first determinant of excessive weight&#xD;
      gain is related to healthy living place and physical activity, noted as &quot;PA&quot;. Many&#xD;
      meta-analyses have demonstrated the role of PA in gestational weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the role of the living environment in the PA practice of&#xD;
      pregnant women and to identify the socio-environmental construction contributing to the&#xD;
      disparities in the practice of PA in women during their pregnancy. This thesis is based on an&#xD;
      innovative approach in France, combining both epidemiology and geography approaches to meet&#xD;
      priority research objectives in a public health context. With regard to the general issue&#xD;
      &quot;What are the contextual determinants of pregnant women's PA practice beyond their individual&#xD;
      characteristics that could explain the disparities in practice according to their&#xD;
      socio-economic position?&quot; This question underlies the following assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) In addition to their individual characteristics, women with low PA and who have reduced PA&#xD;
      during pregnancy reside in a more socio-economically deprived neighborhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii)Beyond the socio-economic dimension, the physical characteristic of the residential place&#xD;
      influences the level of PA practice of pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii) The combination of the socio-economic, physical and psychosocial environment contributes&#xD;
      to reducing the level of PA among pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv) Pregnant women with an unfavourable living environment and low PA have adverse pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
