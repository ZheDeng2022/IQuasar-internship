    <textblock>
      Individuals with prediabetes have a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the effect of combination of ketogenic diet and aerobic exercise&#xD;
      interventions versus ketogenic diet alone on the glucose level in prediabetes female with&#xD;
      normal weight.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-diabetes is the preceding condition of diabetes, where the blood sugar level is higher&#xD;
      than normal but lower than the diagnostic criteria of type II diabetes and in most of the&#xD;
      cases, this ultimately leads to the development type II diabetes. It has been estimated that&#xD;
      the number of pre-diabetic cases will increase to more than 470 million people worldwide, and&#xD;
      this is understandably a worrying trend . Many studies have been done on diabetes patients.&#xD;
      However, little is known about the pre-diabetic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosed Prediabetes was stated as any participants who did not have diabetes but who had&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose level of 100 - 125 mg/dL, an HbA1c level of 5.7% - 6.4%, or 2-hour&#xD;
      plasma glucose level of 140 - 199 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of pre-diabetes and prevention of the development of pre-diabetes to T2DM,through&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention mainly includes nutritious dietary and exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining a ketogenic diet with exercise is a powerful way to reducing insulin resistance,&#xD;
      control blood glucose levels and achieve weight loss. As ketogenic diets are nowadays&#xD;
      predictable as being useful, there is presently a shortage of research studies examining just&#xD;
      how useful the combination of exercise and a ketogenic diet&#xD;
