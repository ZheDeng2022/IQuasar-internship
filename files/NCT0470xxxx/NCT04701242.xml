      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with acute coronary syndromes are at an increased risk for recurrent adverse&#xD;
      coronary events, particularly during the early period following their initial presentation.&#xD;
      Early (in-hospital) initiation of high-intensity statins reduces the risk of recurrent events&#xD;
      and is therefore recommended by the best current practice guidelines.(1,2) However, the&#xD;
      delayed onset of action of statin therapy and given the frequent failure of patients to&#xD;
      achieve the recommended LDL-C targets using statins alone (as per the current practice&#xD;
      guidelines recommendations), might be placing large number of patients at increased risk&#xD;
      during such a vulnerable period early after an ACS.(3) More rapid and effective reduction of&#xD;
      LDL-C levels using combination therapy from the outset may therefore be beneficial in these&#xD;
      patients. This hypothesis has been tested with combining Evolocumab and a statin in the&#xD;
      recent EVOPACS study, in which this combination after ACS has shown to be safe and more&#xD;
      effective in achieving LDL-C targets at 6 weeks compared to statin monotherapy.(4) However,&#xD;
      Evolocumab (a PCSK9i) is an expensive drug which is not affordable by many healthcare systems&#xD;
      in low- and middle-income countries. Ezetemibe, on the other hand, is a safe and a cheap drug&#xD;
      that can prove to be extremely cost-effective if a meaningful and timely reduction in LDL-C&#xD;
      levels can be achieved when combined with a statin early after an ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction, with baseline LDL-C&#xD;
      levels not likely to achieve recommended targets on statin monotherapy. This is assumed to be&#xD;
      with LDL-C level &gt; 125 mg/dl for those not on lipid lowering therapy; or with LDL-C &gt; 100&#xD;
      mg/dl on moderate intensity statin therapy at the time of presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Prospective randomized controlled single-blinded trial. A sample size of 500&#xD;
      patients, 250 in each arm, was calculated to provide a power of 0.9 and an adjusted type 1&#xD;
      error as 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients achieving target LDL-C levels (&lt;70 mg/dl) at 6 weeks interval.&#xD;
           (Efficacy endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Freedom from alanine transaminase elevation (ALT) more than 3 folds upper reference&#xD;
           limit &quot;URL&quot; or statin associated muscle symptoms associated with CK elevation more than&#xD;
           4 folds URL. (Safety endpoint) Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of patients achieving &gt; 50% reduction of LDL-C and to levels below 70mg/dl at&#xD;
           6 weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Percentage of LDL-C reduction at 6 weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduction of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) from baseline to 6 weeks&#xD;
           interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlating statins efficacy to reduce LDL-C and likelihood to cause statins related&#xD;
           adverse effects to genetic alleles of ABC [ATP Binding Cassette] types A1, G5 and G8,&#xD;
           and of CYP450 isoenzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MACE free survival at 1 year, (CV death; non fatal-MI; hospitalization for ACS, urgent&#xD;
           unplanned revascularization and stroke).&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a major event of &quot;atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot; ASCVD, like a stroke or&#xD;
      &quot;Acute Myocardial infarction&quot; AMI, best practice clinical guidelines strongly recommend&#xD;
      prompt initiation of high-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention of recurrent&#xD;
      events.1-4 Owing to its plaque stabilization effects, pleotropic anti-inflammatory effects,&#xD;
      besides its &quot;Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol&quot; LDL-C lowering effects, statins received&#xD;
      the highest levels of recommendations in these settings.5,6 We learnt from the Cholesterol&#xD;
      Treatment Trialist &quot;CTT&quot; collaboration through studying 170,000 cases from 26 trials, that&#xD;
      the magnitude of LDL-C reduction is translated into a proportionate reduction of adverse&#xD;
      events.7 It was found that every 1 mmol/L (38.8 mg/dl) reduction in LDL-C is paralleled by a&#xD;
      22% in major vascular events (AMI-death- stroke- any revascularization); 23% in major adverse&#xD;
      coronary events; 20% in coronary artery disease deaths; 17% in total stroke and by 10% in&#xD;
      total deaths.7 Hence, in secondary prevention of ASCVD, guidelines clearly instructs for&#xD;
      aggressive reduction of LDL-C by at least 50% of baseline values and to levels &lt;70 mg/dl or&#xD;
      &lt;55 mg/dl for ACC or ESC guidelines respectively.1,2 Nevertheless, both guidelines instructed&#xD;
      to initiate statins monotherapy after the index event, and to add other agents (mainly;&#xD;
      Ezetimibe or PCSK9i) if targets were found not have been achieved in follow-ups.1,2 High&#xD;
      intensity statins as monotherapy are expected according to ESC and ACC guidelines1,2 to&#xD;
      reduce LDL-C levels by about 50%, while according to the NICE guidelines4 by 40%. However,&#xD;
      most reports from real life experience quite often revealed no more than 35%-to-40%&#xD;
      reductions.8,9 Thus, failures to achieve target LDL-C levels is quite prevalent, and&#xD;
      obviously is more common with higher baseline LDL-C levels. In the data published from the&#xD;
      PINNACLE registry involving 1.9 million patients with ASCVD, only 31.9% of those on statin&#xD;
      monotherapy could achieve LDL-C &lt;70 mg/dl.10 Similar results were reported in the NHANES,&#xD;
      EUROASPIRE and GOULD registries.8,11,12 There is large body of evidence that the early period&#xD;
      after an ASCVD event is the most vulnerable period for recurrent events.7,13,14 The&#xD;
      previously mentioned benefits in CTT were observed over 5 years of follow-up, yet, the&#xD;
      magnitude of risk reduction in the earliest 12 months was equal to the cumulative reduction&#xD;
      in the subsequent 4 years.7 In a sub-analysis from the FOURIER trial, intensifying LDL-C&#xD;
      reduction by combining Evolocumab with maximum tolerated statins resulted in larger risk&#xD;
      reduction in those with recent (≤12 months) MI compared to those with remote (&gt;12 months) MI;&#xD;
      with a RRR for CV death, MI or stroke of 25% vs 15%).15 Plausibly, the absolute benefit of&#xD;
      intensified preventive measures is maximized when the absolute risk is more. It can be&#xD;
      arguable that initiating combination LDL-C lowering therapies promptly after AMI would be&#xD;
      more appropriate than endangering more than two thirds of the patients who would fail to&#xD;
      achieve LDL-C targets through such a vulnerable period awaiting to establish the indication&#xD;
      in follow-up visits. This is of particular concern in patients with high baseline LDL-C&#xD;
      expected not to achieve goals with statins alone.1,2 The EVOPACS study, &quot;Evolocumab for Early&#xD;
      Reduction of LDL-Cholesterol Levels in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes&quot; tested&#xD;
      atorvastatin 40 mg alone compared to combining atorvastatin 40 mg plus PCSK9 Evolocumab 420&#xD;
      mg started during index hospitalization and repeated after 4 weeks.9 At 8 weeks interval,&#xD;
      LDL-C was reduced by 35.4% in the atorvastatin group compared to 77.1% in Evolocumab +&#xD;
      atorvastatin (from 3.42±0.94 mmol/L to 2.06±0.63 and from 3.61±1.00 mmol/L to 0.79±0.46&#xD;
      respectively). Worth mentioning that by the 8 weeks follow up time, achieving LDL-C &lt; 70&#xD;
      mg/dl (1.8 mmol/L) occurred only in 37.6% in the statin monotherapy compared to 95.7% in the&#xD;
      combination arm.9 Despite the high potency of PCSK9 inhibitors in LDL-C reduction, the ACC&#xD;
      describes them as overpriced and not cost-effective in the contemporary prices.2 Ezetimibe is&#xD;
      a very affordable agent that inhibits exogenous cholesterol absorption by acting on&#xD;
      Nieman-pick C1 like1 protein. It is a safe and well tolerated drug that need no dose&#xD;
      reduction or adjustment in moderate renal or hepatic dysfunction. Because of acting at&#xD;
      different hinge points, Ezetimibe acts additively to statins and leads to further 20%&#xD;
      reduction of serum LDL-C levels.16,17 The current ACC 2018 guidelines for cholesterol&#xD;
      management gave a class (I) level of evidence (B) that patients with ASCVD judged to be at&#xD;
      very high risk and are considered for PCSK9 inhibitors, should be receiving maximally&#xD;
      tolerated statins and ezetimibe.2 In the IMPROVE-IT, &quot;IMProved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin&#xD;
      Efficacy International Trial&quot;, adding Ezetimibe to Simvastatin 40 mg reduced MACE by 6.4%&#xD;
      compared to Simvastatin 40 mg alone in patients with ACS and LDL-C &gt; 125 mg/dl.17 Though such&#xD;
      results are in favor of combining Ezetimibe with statins after ACS, yet Simvastatin at the&#xD;
      dose of 40 mg is a moderate intensity statin and up titration to 80 mg is strongly&#xD;
      discouraged.1,2 Moreover, Simvastatin is characterized by multiple drug-drug interactions, an&#xD;
      issue that increased chances for side effects, intolerance and thus treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      compared to the currently more often used atorvastatin and rusovastatin.2,16 Being safe and&#xD;
      affordable, upfront combination of high intensity statin plus ezetimibe to AMI patients might&#xD;
      be more effective in achieving LDL-C targets and reducing adverse events compared to the&#xD;
      current practice of initiating statin monotherapy and deferring intensification&#xD;
      weeks-to-months till the time of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Work Evaluate safety and efficacy of initiating combined ezetimibe plus statin&#xD;
      therapy compared to statin monotherapy early after AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations The study shall be launched after ethical committee approval. Informed&#xD;
      consents will be obtained from eligible participants prior enrollment to the study. Patients&#xD;
      will be fully oriented about the benefits and potential adverse effects by participation.&#xD;
      They will be given a shortcut access (through the study team direct contact) in cases any&#xD;
      problems or complaints occurred. Possible side effects of any of the used medications will be&#xD;
      thoroughly discussed with the patients for early identification and swift reporting to the&#xD;
      research team. Patients will be informed about the schedule of follow up visits and about the&#xD;
      study-dictated laboratory workup. Patients' identity and data are completely confidential and&#xD;
      will not be disclosed except to treating physicians. All clinical, laboratory data and data&#xD;
      from genetic tests will be dealt with complete confidentiality. Data for analysis and&#xD;
      laboratory results will be anonymized before they are given to the statistical team, and thus&#xD;
      study results will be devoid of any personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology I. Study design A Prospective Randomized Controlled Study. II. Study setting and&#xD;
      location The study will be conducted in and fully supported by Aswan Heart Centre, Magdi&#xD;
      Yacoub Foundation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers do not have any connections to industry, did not (and will not) receive funds&#xD;
      or support from any sponsors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study population Patients presenting by acute myocardial infarction, (both STEMI and&#xD;
      NSTEMI are included). Diagnosis will depend on clinical presentation, twelve-lead ECG,&#xD;
      cardiac biomarkers and echocardiography when diagnosis is doubtful as recommended by the 4th&#xD;
      universal definition of myocardial infarction.18 IV. Eligibility Criteria Patients presenting&#xD;
      by AMI who are likely not to achieve LDL-C targets on statin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Acute myocardial infarction (STEMI or NSTEMI) within 48 hours from the onset of&#xD;
           symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline LDL-C above 125 mg/dl for those who were not on consistent lipid lowering&#xD;
           therapy; or above 100 mg/dl for those who were compliant (≥ 90 days) on moderate&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Having conditions (or taking medications) that would not allow concomitant safe statins&#xD;
           use. [such as patients receiving Cyclosporine - Gemfibrozil -Pazopanib - Tipranavir -&#xD;
           Itraconazole - Ketoconazole]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Those who are already compliant on high intensity statins.&#xD;

        -  Pregnant or contemplating pregnancy in the following 12 months. [relevant for females in&#xD;
           the child-bearing period] V. Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Randomization Within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, a computer-generated&#xD;
                sequence will be used for randomization into 1:1 fashion to allocate eligible&#xD;
                patients into either; statin monotherapy (will receive atorvastatin 80 mg) or&#xD;
                statins-ezetimibe combination (will receive atorvastatin 80 mg + ezetimibe 10 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study Protocol A baseline lipid profile will be checked within 48 hours from the&#xD;
                AMI onset. A fasting lipid profile will be ordered if the triglycerides were &gt; 400&#xD;
                mg/dl in the non-fasting results. Eligible patients will be recruited after&#xD;
                explaining the study protocol and acquiring a written informed consent. A venous&#xD;
                blood sample for genetic analysis will be provided to perform cutting edge next&#xD;
                generation sequencing to investigate for genetic alleles of ATP Binding Cassette&#xD;
                (ABC) types A1, G5, G8 and CYP450 and correlate isoform variants with statins&#xD;
                responsiveness and efficacy to achieve LDL-C targets. Genetic sequencing will be&#xD;
                performed using high throughput sequencers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of the AMI will be according to the most recent guidelines' recommendations&#xD;
      including both the interventional and the medical aspects. The statin monotherapy arm will&#xD;
      receive atorvastatin 80 mg once daily as their lipid lowering therapy, compared to the&#xD;
      combination therapy arm who will receive atorvastatin 80 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg once daily.&#xD;
      To ensure blinding and compliance, participants will be provided free of charge with 2&#xD;
      differently colored packings for lipid control through the 12 months of the study. In the&#xD;
      statins alone arm both will contain atorvastatin 40mg tablets, while for the combination arm&#xD;
      one of them will contain atorvastatin/ezetimibe 40/10mg and the other will be atorvastatin&#xD;
      40mg tablets. Patients will be instructed to have 1 tablet from each packing at night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from LDL-C management, life-style interventions and all other guidelines directed&#xD;
      medical therapy (GDMT) will be equally implemented in both arms. The study team, as part of&#xD;
      the general practice in AHC, will be consolidating advices for compliance to life-style&#xD;
      interventions and all other GDMT, but will not be providing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hs-CRP, ALT, CK and lipid profile will be tested at baseline and at 6 weeks of the study.&#xD;
      Repeating these or ordering any other laboratory workup will be allowed at any other time&#xD;
      deemed clinically indicated. Patients on the statin monotherapy arm not achieving target&#xD;
      LDL-C levels on the 6-weeks follow-up will be prescribed ezetimibe in addition to their&#xD;
      regimen (as per current best practice guidelines) but will remain labelled as initial&#xD;
      monotherapy group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a clinical follow-up visit at 6 weeks, 6 months then at 1 year.&#xD;
      However, they will be instructed to contact the research team at any relevant clinical&#xD;
      complaint or emergency. Magdi Yacoub foundation is completely responsible for the management&#xD;
      of any clinical complication or adverse events resulting from (or related to) the study&#xD;
      agent. After the study ends (1 year), participants will be offered the regular follow-up&#xD;
      appointments according to AHC institutional policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Study outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent of patients who achieve required LDL-C targets according to the ACC&#xD;
                guidelines (&lt;70 mg/dl) at 6 weeks interval. (Efficacy endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Freedom from Alanine Transaminase elevation (ALT) more than 3 folds upper reference&#xD;
                limit OR muscle pains associated with CK elevation more than 4 folds upper&#xD;
                reference limit. (Safety endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent of patients achieving &gt; 50% reduction from baseline and to a level &lt;70&#xD;
                mg/dl of LDL-C to 6 weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent of LDL-C reduction from baseline to 6 weeks interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduction of high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) from baseline to 6 weeks&#xD;
                interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Correlating efficacy of statins to reduce LDL-C and/or cause statins related&#xD;
                adverse effects to genetic alleles of ABC types A1, G5 and G8 and CYP450 which are&#xD;
                believed to impact statins pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MACE free survival at 1 year, (cardiovascular death; non fatal-MI; hospitalization&#xD;
                for ACS, urgent unplanned revascularization, and cerebrovascular stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis I. Sample size Sample size was calculated using MedCalc Statistical&#xD;
      Software version 19.0.4 (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium; https://www.medcalc.org; 2019)&#xD;
      adjusting margin for type 1 error as 0.05 and utilizing a study power of 90%. The expected&#xD;
      proportion of patients on statin monotherapy achieving LDL-C targets was adjusted to 50% (it&#xD;
      was 37.6% in the control arm of EVOPACS 9) and we expected that this proportion to be 70% in&#xD;
      the combination group. Accordingly, a minimum sample of 268 patients randomized in 1:1&#xD;
      fashion was suggested. The research group planned to have a sample of 500 patients on 2&#xD;
      groups of 250 each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Statistical analysis Statistical package for social science (SPSS) software, version 22&#xD;
      for Microsoft Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be presented as frequency and percentages (n (%)) and correlations&#xD;
      among them will be analysed by chi square test. Continuous data will be checked for normality&#xD;
      using Shapiro-Wilk test and will be presented as mean (standard deviation) or median&#xD;
      (interquartile range) as appropriate. Continuous data will be analysed using one-way analysis&#xD;
      of variance (ANOVA). Repeated measures will be analysed using analysis of variance (ANOVA)&#xD;
      for repeated measures with post-hoc pairwise comparisons using the Tukey and Bonferroni&#xD;
      tests. A probability p value less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
