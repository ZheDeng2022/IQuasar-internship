  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate DS-6000a in participants with advanced renal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (RCC) and ovarian cancer (OVC). The main goals of this study will be to investigate the&#xD;
      recommended dose of DS-6000a that can be given safely to participants, assess the side&#xD;
      effects of DS-6000a, and evaluate the effectiveness of DS-6000a.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DS-6000a is an antibody drug conjugate that specifically binds to CDH6 on the cell surface of&#xD;
      target cells, which leads to the internalization of DS-6000a into the cells. MAAA-1181a that&#xD;
      is released from DS-6000a in the target cells inhibits cell replication and induces cell&#xD;
      apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate DS-6000a given as a single agent once every 21 days. The dose&#xD;
      escalation phase will enroll participants with OVC and RCC, and is designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of DS-6000a and to determine the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD)/recommended dose for expansion (RDE). Following the selection of the RDE, the dose&#xD;
      expansion phase will be initiated to evaluate clinical activity of DS-6000a.&#xD;
