      Various clinical studies have evaluated the role of probiotics in children with atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis, with some studies showing improvement in clinical outcome after supplementation&#xD;
      of probiotics and others showing no additional benefit. This study is to provide clinical&#xD;
      evidence of effect of a mixture of probiotics in Atopic Dermatitis (AD) patients based on&#xD;
      improvement in SCORAD (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis) index.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the common chronic inflammatory skin disease with relapsing courses&#xD;
      that often start in infancy and childhood. It is characterized by erythema, itchy papules,&#xD;
      occasionally vesicles (in infants), which may become excoriated and lichenified and have a&#xD;
      typical flexural distribution. Atopy is defined as a &quot;personal or familial tendency to&#xD;
      produce immunoglobulin antibodies in response to even low doses of allergen, and associated&#xD;
      with development of AD, asthma and rhinoconjunctivitis.The worldwide prevalence of AD is&#xD;
      estimated to be 20% in children and 2-10% in adults. The incidence of AD has increased by 2&#xD;
      to 3 folds in past 3 decades in the industrialized countries and represents a major public&#xD;
      health burden. According to the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood&#xD;
      (ISAAC) phase 3, the prevalence of AD among the age group of 13 to 14 in Africa and Latin&#xD;
      America was at 12-14% and 6-10% respectively. The Asian Pacific countries, the Eastern&#xD;
      Mediterranean region and the Indian subcontinent, it was 3-6% among the same age groups&#xD;
      (13-14 years). Whereas among 6 to 7 years children, for Asian Pacific countries, Africa and&#xD;
      Latin America the prevalence of AD was around 10% and in Indian subcontinent and Eastern&#xD;
      Mediterranean region, value was lower at 3-5%&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nepal the frequency of AD in all age group was 2% as per a year hospital based study done&#xD;
      by Singh S and Agrawal S et.al in 2012. (Unpublished data, on personal communication)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of AD appears to result from interaction between various genetic and&#xD;
      environmental factors. It is associated with skin barrier dysfunction and immune&#xD;
      dysregulation. The barrier dysfunction is early feature of AD which may be a primary but may&#xD;
      also be a secondary to skin inflammation. Lack of exposure to microbial stimuli in early life&#xD;
      programs the immune system towards Th2-type allergic response as described by 'hygiene&#xD;
      hypothesis'.In allergic disorders there is shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards a&#xD;
      Th2 response, and causes the release of Interleukin-4, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13 as&#xD;
      well as Immunoglobulin E production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of AD is mainly clinical as there is no specific test for AD. Diagnosis of AD&#xD;
      is based on specific a criterion which includes patient's history, clinical presentations as&#xD;
      well as family history. In 1980 Hanifin and Rajka proposed major and minor diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria based on clinical symptoms of AD. Williams coordinated a UK working party to attempt&#xD;
      to simplify and refine the criteria given by Hanifin and Rajka in 1994. Severity of disease&#xD;
      is evaluated by using widely accepted SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD), based on extent of&#xD;
      area involved, severity of symptoms and intensity of the subjective symptoms of pruritus and&#xD;
      sleep disturbances.The chronic and recurrent nature of AD negatively impacts the quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) of patients as well as their family members. The symptoms of AD limit patient's&#xD;
      physical, psychosocial development and quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goals of treatment are to improve the skin barrier function and hydration, to&#xD;
      suppress inflammation and to control microbial colonization. It can be achieved through&#xD;
      emollients, topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitor like tacrolimus. Oral&#xD;
      drugs like corticosteroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine are reserved for severe cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics are defined by World Health Orgnization as &quot;live microorganisms, which when&#xD;
      consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host.&quot;Under the hypothesis that&#xD;
      probiotics have global allergy protective effect, they have been extensively used for several&#xD;
      conditions like inflammatory bowel disease, bronchial asthma and other allergic diseases. If&#xD;
      children who are genetically predisposed to AD are supplemented with probiotics early in&#xD;
      their life, series of events like antigenic competition, immune regulation and stimulation of&#xD;
      innate immunity will occur, all of which might minimize their susceptibility to allergic&#xD;
      disorders. Hence, investigators planned this study to see its role in AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statement of problem and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this therapeutic option is based on well-established effects of bacteria on&#xD;
      cellular immune responses. The probiotics has an immunomodulatory property that plays an&#xD;
      essential role in the development of normal immune tolerance. Early life exposure to these&#xD;
      microbial agents plays an important role in maturation of Type 1 helper cell (Th1) immune&#xD;
      responses and could inhibit development of allergic Type 2 helper cell (Th2) responses and&#xD;
      IgE antibody production. Therefore the onset of AD could be prevented by probiotics and this&#xD;
      treatment strategy could also be effective even when AD is already established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a meta-analysis conducted in 2017, involving 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) with&#xD;
      1,070 children, significant difference in SCORAD values favoring probiotics over the control&#xD;
      group was observed. Though, a high degree of heterogeneity was observed across these 13&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cochrane review, 2018 which included 39 RCTs found that probiotic treatment may slightly&#xD;
      reduce SCORAD value. However the researcher concluded that the differences were not&#xD;
      clinically significant. Recent review in 2019 on &quot;prebiotics and probiotics in atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis&quot; based on various RCT and meta-analysis support the supplementation of probiotics&#xD;
      for at least 8 weeks in improving severity score of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have observed conflicting results of different studies with some showing&#xD;
      significant advantages while some studies revealing no benefit. Almost all of the studies&#xD;
      have suggested further research in different populations. Therefore, we are conducting this&#xD;
      study to find out the effect of probiotics in AD in our institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective: To investigate the efficacy of oral probiotics in the clinical&#xD;
           outcome of Atopic dermatitis based on the SCORAD index&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives: To find out the total duration of topical corticosteroid use in&#xD;
           the interventional and conventional group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of AD in children's family members based on FDLQI (Family Dermatology&#xD;
      Life Quality Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Type of study design: Assessor blinded, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      Setting: Hospital (Dermatology Outpatient Department, BPKIHS, Dharan). The probable duration&#xD;
      of the study will be one year after approval from the Institutional Review Committee and&#xD;
      Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC). Ethical Clearance: taken from the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Committee (IRC), BPKIHS, and Nepal Health Research Council (NHRC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of the sample size: According to a study done by Ekaputri et.al, it is reported&#xD;
      that mean± SD of SCORAD index after intervention in probiotic group and control group was&#xD;
      (18.09 ± 8.59) and (23.21± 8.71) respectively. Considering the least difference, 5.12 and&#xD;
      pooled SD- 8.65, the sample size has been calculated at 95% CI and 80% power, using two means&#xD;
      formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 44.56, adding 10% in calculated value for lost to follow-up, final sample size is 45 in&#xD;
      each group. Thus a total of 98 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      n = 2σ2 (Z α/2 + Z β) 2 (μ1- μ2) 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      n= sample size of each group. σ = standard deviation 8.65 Z = reliability coefficient. 1.96 α&#xD;
      = significance level. 0.05 Zβ= at 20% power 0.84 μ1 = mean (Probiotic) 18.09 μ2 = mean&#xD;
      (Control) 23.21 d = mean difference 5.12&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and allocation concealment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A block randomization list will be generated with the block sizes 4, 6 and 8. Two parallel&#xD;
      groups (1:1 ratio) of patients following computerized randomization will be produced. Prior&#xD;
      to the enrollment of the patients a sequentially generated number with the treatment group&#xD;
      will be written in sealed envelope, which will be prepared by independent dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional and conventional groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional group: Children with AD meeting eligibility criteria receiving probiotics and&#xD;
      conventional treatment (topical corticosteroid, topical tacrolimus, an oral antihistamine and&#xD;
      emollients) Conventional group: Children with AD meeting eligibility criteria, under&#xD;
      conventional treatment only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be asked for their follow up at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks of commencing&#xD;
      treatment. In each follow up, every patient will be evaluated for the side effects and&#xD;
      compliance to treatment. SCORAD index will be measured at baseline and at 4, 8, 10 and 12&#xD;
      weeks. FDLQI will be measured at baseline and at 8 weeks. Parents will be provided a card to&#xD;
      record for flare of symptoms; total days of steroid use for the same and total flare episode&#xD;
      will be recorded during 12 weeks follow up. Flare is defined as worsening of clinical&#xD;
      features leading to use of corticosteroids for at least 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family dermatology life quality index:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or guardian of each children will be asked to fill the questionnaire intended to&#xD;
      measure quality of life of family members whose relative have dermatological conditions. The&#xD;
      standardized nepali version of FDLQI (MKA Basra, AY Finlay. Cardiff University 2005) will be&#xD;
      used. Questions concern the influence of disease on parents QOL in the last month. Each&#xD;
      question can be answered by selecting 1 out of 4 answers scored 0-3. The maximum score is 30&#xD;
      points and minimum 0 point. The higher the score lower the parents QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity Index (SCORAD) It uses the rule of nine to assess extent of disease and evaluates&#xD;
      five clinical characteristics to determine disease severity: i) erythema, ii) edema/&#xD;
      papulation, iii) oozing/crusts, iv) excoriation and v) lichenification. It also assesses&#xD;
      subjective symptoms of pruritus and sleep loss with Visual Analogue Scales (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on SCORAD score, AD is categorized as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mild AD (SCORAD &lt;25)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Moderate (SCORAD 25-50)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe (SCORAD &gt;50)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be conducted both per protocol and intention to treat population&#xD;
      (defined as all enrolled children to whom study drug will be given; with the last observation&#xD;
      carried forward) basis using two sided tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods proposed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Descriptive statistics will be summarized as mean, median, percentage, standard&#xD;
           deviation (SD) and interquartile range along with appropriate graphical and tabular&#xD;
           presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intragroup SCORAD index and FDLQI score will be compared by paired t-test and between&#xD;
           the groups by independent t- test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In case of nonparametric data Mann- Whitney U test for independent groups and Wilcoxon&#xD;
           signed- rank test for paired group will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Chi-square test will be used to compare the categorical data. All statistical tests will&#xD;
           be carried out at a significance level P&lt;0.05.&#xD;
