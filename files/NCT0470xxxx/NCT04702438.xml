  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few decades, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have rapidly&#xD;
      developed as effective, and probably the most cost-effective tools to connect most aspects of&#xD;
      family lives. Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in promoting family&#xD;
      well-being, there is also an increasing appreciation that ICTs such as internet-enabled&#xD;
      devices and web-based applications can offer many advantages compared to traditional&#xD;
      face-to-face approaches when delivering behaviour change programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain more understanding of the potential new avenues of using ICT in programme&#xD;
      implementation, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has initiated the Jockey Club SMART&#xD;
      Family-Link Project in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This project aimed at helping 26 NGO-operated&#xD;
      Integrated Family Service Centres and Integrated Service Centres (Centres), making effective&#xD;
      use of information and communications technology (ICT) and data analytics, to enhance the&#xD;
      quality and efficiency of their family service. The present study aims to supplement the&#xD;
      existing services and interventions delivered by the FRU, FSU and FCU, a series of brief&#xD;
      ICT-based family interventions that promote family communication, cohesion, support and&#xD;
      well-being and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of ICT-based interventions.&#xD;

      With the increasing use of ICT, family information can be easily accessed. According to the&#xD;
      findings from FHinTs 2016, ICT was increasingly used as a method of family information&#xD;
      seeking: 66.7% of respondents sought family information from online websites, compared with&#xD;
      53.6% in 2009. About 30.9% sought family information from social media such as Facebook, and&#xD;
      22.8% sought family information from instant messaging platforms such as WhatsApp. Family&#xD;
      information such as recreation (46.6%), family health (22.9%) and elderly-related topics&#xD;
      (17.9%) was most commonly sought. Also, family information seeking was associated with higher&#xD;
      levels of family health, happiness, harmony, and overall family well-being. The associations&#xD;
      were observed regardless of the type of sharing methods, such as face-to-face sharing or&#xD;
      sharing via ICT means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in promoting family well-being, there&#xD;
      is also a growing appreciation that ICTs such as internet-enabled devices and web-based&#xD;
      applications can offer many advantages compared to traditional face-to-face approaches when&#xD;
      delivering behaviour change programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family services in Hong Kong In light of the review on family services in Hong Kong in 2000,&#xD;
      pilot projects on the Integrated Family Service Centre (IFSC) service mode were conducted in&#xD;
      2002. Having received positive feedback from the community on the pilot projects, 61 IFSCs&#xD;
      were established in 2004 to provide public-funded family services in Hong Kong. These IFSCs&#xD;
      comprise three important components, including the family resource unit (FRU), family support&#xD;
      unit (FSU), and family counselling unit (FCU) to provide preventive, supportive, and remedial&#xD;
      services respectively. They are operated by the Social Welfare Department and subvented&#xD;
      non-governmental organizations to support and strengthen individuals and families,&#xD;
      particularly single parents, new arrivals, ethnic minorities, and deprived families receiving&#xD;
      Comprehensive Social Security Assistance (CSSA), in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jockey Club SMART Family-Link Project Family well-being is the cornerstone of a harmonious&#xD;
      society, and early support for families in need will avert a crisis. The Hong Kong Jockey&#xD;
      Club Charities Trust has funded to a four-year (2018-2021) &quot;Jockey Club SMART Family-Link&#xD;
      Project&quot; to advance the use of Information and Communications Technology (&quot;ICT&quot;) in family&#xD;
      services. Interventions leveraging ICT (i-Action) is one of the project components, which&#xD;
      leverage ICT to help social workers offer ICT-based interventions in their work to add to&#xD;
      their face-to-face interventions. ICT tools and mobile apps will be designed and interactive&#xD;
      games will be provided to engage children and young family service users through e-platforms.&#xD;
      Social workers will also be able to connect with service users between face-to-face sessions&#xD;
      using these e-platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to reduce stress, enhance resilience and promote personal and family&#xD;
      well-being through Zentangle. We will conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluation.&#xD;
