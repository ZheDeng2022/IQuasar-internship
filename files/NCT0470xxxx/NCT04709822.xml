  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single case series feasibility study is designed to investigate the feasibility of&#xD;
      remote recruitment and delivery of a brief visuospatial interference intervention for&#xD;
      decreasing the number of intrusive memories of trauma among trauma-exposed women in Iceland.&#xD;
      The current study is an extension on two studies already preregistered (NCT04209283 and&#xD;
      NCT04342416) that included some aspects of in-person recruitment and/or intervention delivery&#xD;
      (rather than fully remote as we aim for here). The intervention is a simple cognitive task (a&#xD;
      memory cue followed by playing the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) with accompanying information. A&#xD;
      within-subjects multiple baseline AB design is used, in that the length of baseline ('A'; no&#xD;
      intervention) and intervention ('B') phases vary within-subjects across individual intrusive&#xD;
      trauma memories. Participants will aim to complete at least one week of the baseline ('A')&#xD;
      phase followed by at least two intervention sessions with a researcher remotely (via&#xD;
      telephone or secure video platform). Intervention sessions comprise the simple cognitive task&#xD;
      alongside accompanying information presented in the form of brief animated videos (e.g.,&#xD;
      explaining the target symptom). Participants are instructed that they may continue using the&#xD;
      technique self-guided in subsequent weeks, and they may opt for additional intervention&#xD;
      sessions with remote researcher support (maximum 6 intervention sessions). Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to monitor the occurrence of intrusive memories of trauma in a daily diary. It is&#xD;
      predicted that participants will report fewer total intrusive memories in the fifth week&#xD;
      after the second intervention session (primary outcome) compared to in the first baseline&#xD;
      week. The investigators will also explore whether the frequency of targeted intrusive&#xD;
      memories is going to decrease relative to non-targeted intrusive memories. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators will explore whether having fewer intrusive memories is related to functioning&#xD;
      and/or PTSD, depressive or anxiety symptoms.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants complete a total of 3-9 sessions with researchers and sessions will be conducted&#xD;
      remotely via telephone or secure video platform (Kara Connect). In the baseline session,&#xD;
      questionnaires are administered and the individual intrusive trauma memories will be logged&#xD;
      for monitoring their frequency in a daily diary. Participants will record their intrusive&#xD;
      memories in the daily diary for at least one week (Week -1) before commencing the&#xD;
      intervention. In the first intervention session, a memory will be selected and targeted with&#xD;
      the intervention (memory reminder followed by 25 min gameplay with mental rotation). We aim&#xD;
      to deliver a second intervention session soon after the first (within approx. one week),&#xD;
      targeting the same or a different intrusive memory. Participants are instructed that they may&#xD;
      continue using the technique self-guided after the first intervention session, and they may&#xD;
      opt for additional intervention sessions with remote researcher support (maximum 6&#xD;
      intervention sessions). Participants continue to monitor the frequency of both targeted and&#xD;
      non-targeted intrusive memories in the daily diary throughout Weeks 0-5. Follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires are completed at Week 1, 1-month, and 3-months after the second intervention&#xD;
      session. The primary outcome is change in total number of intrusive memories from the&#xD;
      baseline week (Week -1) to the fifth week after the second intervention session (Week 5).&#xD;
      Participants will also monitor the frequency of their intrusive memories for one week at the&#xD;
      3-month follow-up. The investigators note that the intended time-frames may differ slightly&#xD;
      across participants depending on availability and the practicalities of remote delivery.&#xD;
