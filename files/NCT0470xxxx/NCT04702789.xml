    <masking_description>After signing the informed consent form (ICF), every subject will receive a coded patient number. Randomization will take place through and integrated web response system (IWRS). In the first step, during the eligibility visit, all patients will be assigned the same treatment (Gaap Ofteno PF®). After one month, patients that once again comply with the inclusion criteria will be assigned randomly (1:1) to one of the two investigation products, either Krytantek Ofteno PF® or Eliptic Ofteno PF®.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -30 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 0 (basal visit), 14 (± 2) (first follow-up visit), 30 (± 2) (second follow-up visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through Goldman tonometer in milligrams of mercury (mmHg). After instillation of topical anesthetic (tetracaine 0.5%) and fluorescein stain, IOP is evaluated at 9:00 and at 11:00 hrs. (± 30 minutes). Both measurements and their average will be registered. Normal values are considered between 10 and 21 mmHg.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -30 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 0 (basal visit), 14 (± 2) (first follow-up visit), 30 (± 2) (second follow-up visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>With the patient's best possible refractive correction, visual acuity will be evaluated through the Snellen chart. Its notation (fraction or decimal) is described as the distance from the chart at which the test is performed, divided by the distance at which a letter equals vertically 5 minutes of arc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in optic nerve cup/disc ratio</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -30 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 0 (basal visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Both clinical and imaging evaluation will be performed. For clinical evaluation, after the application of a topical ophthalmic mydriatic (tropicamide 0.8% / phenylephrine 5%), indirect ophthalmoscopy will be performed through the aid of a fundus lens in a slit lamp. For imaging, optic coherence tomography (OCT) will be used.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in nerve fibers and ganglion cell thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (basal visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Spectral domain OCT is a non invasive tool that will be used to evaluate quantitatively the thickness of retinal nerve fibers and ganglion cell layers.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in optic nerve image</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -30 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 0 (basal visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Through a fundus camera a photograph will be taken to obtain a faithful record of any possible changes to the optic nerve head characteristics.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in central corneal thickness</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (basal visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through ultrasonic pachymetry, three assessments will be performed, these and its average will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in visual fields</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (basal visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Visual fields will be evaluated with a SITA standard automated white-on-white perimetry performed with a Humphrey perimeter. To be considered reliable, fixation losses, false positives and false negatives must be under 20%. Mean deviation (MD) and pattern standard deviation (PSD) will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in ocular surface integrity (conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and corneal fluorescein staining)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -30 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 0 (basal visit), 14 (± 2) (first follow-up visit), 30 (± 2) (second follow-up visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>By means of a slit lamp, conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and corneal fluorescein staining will be evaluated. Conjunctival hyperemia will be graded according to Efron's scale (5 grades: Normal (0), Very Mild (I), Mild (II), Moderate (3), and Severe (4)). Chemosis will be evaluated as present (if conjunctiva separates from the sclera in ≥ 1/3 of the palpebral opening area or if it exceeds the eyelid's gray line) or absent. Fluorescein staining evaluation will take place after applying the fluorescein stain on the ocular surface and evaluating the resulting staining pattern. This will be measured through the Oxford scale which includes 6 grades: Absent (0), Minimal (I), Mild (II), Moderate (III), Marked (IV), Severe (V).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day: 75 (± 3) (safety call)</time_frame>
    <description>Presence/absence adverse events, defined as the appearance of any unfavorable reaction in a patient participating in a clinical investigation in which any pharmaceutical product is being administered, regardless of the causal attribution.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Ocular Comfort Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: -30 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 0 (basal visit), 14 (± 2) (first follow-up visit), 30 (± 2) (second follow-up visit) and 60 (± 2) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular Comfort Index (OCI) Questionnaire will be used for evaluation of tolerability through incidence and severity of dry eye symptoms in a scale from 0 to 100. Greater scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
