  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether the Nevisense device can provide useful&#xD;
      information about atypical moles to complement the usual assessments done during routine&#xD;
      screening for melanoma. Assessing particpants' moles with the Nevisense device may help&#xD;
      improve screening methods for the early detection of melanoma in people with atypical mole&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

        Potential research subjects will be identified by a member of the patient's treatment team,&#xD;
        the protocol investigator, or research team at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center&#xD;
        (MSKCC). If the investigator is a member of the treatment team, s/he will screen their&#xD;
        patient's medical records for suitable research study participants and discuss the study&#xD;
        and their potential for enrolling in the research study. Potential subjects contacted by&#xD;
        their treating physician will be referred to the investigator/research staff of the study.&#xD;
