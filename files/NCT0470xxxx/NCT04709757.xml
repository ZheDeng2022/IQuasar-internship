  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) delivered at 10kHz frequency (HF10 Therapy) has demonstrated&#xD;
      superiority to traditional SCS for leg and back pain. Intermittent dosing (ID) refers to the&#xD;
      cycling of stimulation, in which there is a designated time period of stimulation being&#xD;
      active (ON) and inactive (OFF). Previous studies have demonstrated the safe and effective use&#xD;
      of intermittent dosing. However, there still remains a paucity of clinical data on the use of&#xD;
      intermittent dosing and which doses (i.e. on/off cycle time periods) are most effective.&#xD;
      Furthermore, no previous studies have utilized HF10 therapy when evaluating intermittent&#xD;
      dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic back and/or leg pain who have undergone permanent spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulator implantation delivered by the Nevro Omnia Neurostimulation System and who are&#xD;
      reporting decreased efficacy of continuous HF10 therapy will be randomized into one of two&#xD;
      treatments: 1) Intermittent Dosing therapy at 30 seconds ON, 90 seconds OFF 2)Intermittent&#xD;
      Dosing therapy at 30 seconds ON, 360 seconds OFF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, each consented subject will present to clinic at which time will first&#xD;
      be seen by a team of investigators, sub-investigators, and/or study staff. After evaluation&#xD;
      and collection of baseline data, a clinical specialist for the Nevro Omnia Neurostimulation&#xD;
      system will program the subject's SCS system according to the treatment group to which they&#xD;
      have been randomized, under direct physician supervision&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's will be seen and evaluated prior to randomization, and thereafter at 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
      weeks. At the 6-week time period, patients will be crossed over to the other study arm and&#xD;
      thereafter evaluated at 2, 4 and 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As our primary endpoint, we hypothesize that ID HF10 therapy will provide non-inferior pain&#xD;
      relief as measured by VAS scores when compared to continuous HF10 therapy. Other endpoints&#xD;
      include: charging frequency, EQ-5D scores of wellbeing; PROMIS score for physical function,&#xD;
      pain interference, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress; chronic pain acceptance&#xD;
      questionnaire 8 (CPAQ-8), patient satisfaction scores, and patient global impression of&#xD;
      change&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) delivered at 10kHz frequency (HF10 Therapy) has demonstrated&#xD;
      superiority to traditional SCS for leg and back pain. This mode of stimulation entails&#xD;
      delivery of a greater charge per second compared to traditional tonic spinal cord stimulation&#xD;
      and corresponding implications for battery usage. Although not yet studied in novel modes of&#xD;
      SCS such as HF10 and Burst3 due to their relative infancy, the possibility of decreased pain&#xD;
      relief over time very much exists. This has been well-documented with the use of tonic spinal&#xD;
      cord stimulation. Furthermore, the most common cause of spinal cord stimulator explant&#xD;
      remains the lack or loss of efficacy. In order to mitigate the potential for waning pain&#xD;
      relief over time and downstream consequences of increased charge burden, other paradigms of&#xD;
      stimulation within the framework of HF10 therapy must be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermittent dosing (ID) refers to the cycling of stimulation, in which there is a designated&#xD;
      time period of stimulation being active (ON) and inactive (OFF). Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated the safe and effective use of intermittent dosing. In 2020, Deer et al. reported&#xD;
      the efficacy of intermittent dosing of Burst stimulation with settings ranging from 30&#xD;
      seconds ON and 90 seconds OFF, to 30 seconds ON and 360 seconds OFF. In this 50 subject&#xD;
      study, 45.8% of patients preferred stimulation with 30 seconds ON and 360 seconds OFF.&#xD;
      However, there still remains a paucity of clinical data on the use of intermittent dosing and&#xD;
      which doses (i.e. on/off cycle time periods) are most effective. Furthermore, no previous&#xD;
      studies have utilized HF10 therapy when evaluating intermittent dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to prospectively compare continuous HF10 therapy versus two intermittent&#xD;
      dosing HF10 (ID HF10) therapies - 1) 30 seconds ON and 120 seconds OFF; 2) 30 seconds ON and&#xD;
      360 seconds OFF - in patients endorsing decreasing efficacy of continuous HF10 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that ID HF10 therapy will provide non-inferior pain relief as measured by NRS&#xD;
      scores when compared to continuous HF10 therapy. The primary outcome for this study will be&#xD;
      NRS pain scores (0 to 10 where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst pain ever in 0.5 increments).&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include: charging frequency, EQ-5D scores of wellbeing, PROMIS scores for&#xD;
      physical function, pain interference, sleep disturbance, and emotional distress; chronic pain&#xD;
      acceptance questionnaire 8 (CPAQ-8), patient satisfaction scores, and patient global&#xD;
      impression of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic back and/or leg pain who have undergone permanent spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulator implantation delivered by the Nevro Omnia Neurostimulation System, have had the&#xD;
      system in place for at least 1 year, utilizing continuous HF10 therapy, and now endorsing&#xD;
      decreasing efficacy of continuous HF10 therapy will be randomized to 2 groups, in a&#xD;
      single-blinded, 1:1 fashion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ID HF10 therapy at 30 seconds ON, 90 seconds OFF&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ID HF10 therapy at 30 seconds ON, 360 seconds OFF&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's will be seen and evaluated prior to randomization, and thereafter at 2, 4 and 6&#xD;
      weeks. At the 6-week time period, patients will be crossed over to the other study arm and&#xD;
      thereafter evaluated at 2, 4 and 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be performed using a computer-generated random sequence generator with&#xD;
      equal selection probabilities to all groups. Subjects will be blinded to their randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, each consented subject will present to clinic at which time will first&#xD;
      be seen by a team of investigators, sub-investigators, and/or study staff. After evaluation&#xD;
      and collection of baseline data, a clinical specialist for the Nevro Omnia Neurostimulation&#xD;
      system will program the subject's SCS system according to the treatment group to which they&#xD;
      have been randomized, under direct physician supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will be subsequently seen at 2, 4 and 6-weeks in a clinic setting. At each interval,&#xD;
      the patient will be seen by a team of investigators, sub-investigators, and/or study staff to&#xD;
      administer questionnaires and collect data. .&#xD;
