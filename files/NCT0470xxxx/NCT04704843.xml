    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are AEs with onset during the treatment phase or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 28</time_frame>
    <description>TEAEs are AEs with onset during the treatment phase or that are a consequence of a pre-existing condition that has worsened since baseline. A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life-threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect; is a suspected transmission of any infectious agent via a medicinal product; is medically important.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Marsh-Oberhuber Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in marsh-oberhuber scores will be reported. Marsh-Oberhuber score is a classification system which grades histology specimens on 6 levels from normal to total villus atrophy to characterize tissue.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Celiac Disease Symptom Diary (CDSD) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in CDSD scores will be reported. The CDSD is a daily electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessing the presence or absence of a broad range of celiac disease symptoms (diarrhea, spontaneous bowel movements, abdominal pain, bloating, nausea and tiredness). The CDSD includes 2 types of scores: a weekly symptom-specific severity score and a weekly total score. For each of the symptoms there is a possible score of 0 to 70. The total score for each week is then calculated by dividing each symptom-specific score by 10 and then summing them to get a possible total score of 0 to 70.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Celiac Disease-Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (CeD-GSRS) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in CeD-GSRS will be reported. The CeD-GSRS is a modified version of the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS). The GSRS is a questionnaire consisting of 15 symptom-specific items each graded on a 7-point Likert scale each with descriptive anchor. The scores are calculated by taking the mean of items within each of five scales: Abdominal Pain (AP), reflux, diarrhea, indigestion and constipation. The CeD-GSRS assesses 10 questions of the original GSRS. Higher scores represent more severe symptoms.</description>

             no evidence of recurrence for at least 3 months before the first study intervention);&#xD;
             known history of lymphoproliferative disease, including monoclonal gammopathy of&#xD;
             unknown significance, lymphoma, or signs and symptoms suggestive of possible&#xD;
