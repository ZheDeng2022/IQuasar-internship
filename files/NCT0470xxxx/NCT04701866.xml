  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of music on patients receiving a course of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), both unipolar and&#xD;
      bipolar. The primary outcome is changes in in systolic blood pressure throughout each&#xD;
      40-minute infusion. Secondary outcomes include repeated measures of mood, anxiety,&#xD;
      suicidality, and psychological/physical pain. Aspects of the treatment experience, with and&#xD;
      without music, will also be explored.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is the first cause of disability worldwide, and approximately 1 in 3 patients will&#xD;
      fail to respond to current treatments. Intravenous (IV) low-dose ketamine has remarkable&#xD;
      efficacy in even the most treatment-resistant depression (here defined as failure to at least&#xD;
      two adequate trials of Level 1-evidence psychiatric medications), inducing remission in&#xD;
      25-50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over 100 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show that music can mitigate hemodynamic and&#xD;
      psychological stress caused by even highly invasive medical procedures. Though never studied,&#xD;
      music may similarly improve ketamine tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, single-blind (assessors will not know whether participants receive music&#xD;
      or not) single-center trial, 20 participants with TRD will receive 1) curated music or 2) no&#xD;
      music during their course of 6 IV ketamine treatments (0.50mg/kg bodyweight) over 4 weeks.&#xD;
      The primary aim is to compare changes in systolic blood pressure from the beginning to the&#xD;
      end (40 minutes, peak plasma concentration) of each infusion between groups.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Systolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>From 0 to 40 minutes of each infusion.</time_frame>
    <description>For the primary outcome data analysis, we will adopt the generalized linear model (GLM) to investigate the change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 40 minutes versus at 0 minutes between intervention and control groups. Specifically, we treat the difference between the average of the triplicate SBP measurements (measured by a calibrated Welch Allyn Blood Pressure Device at 0 minutes and the average of the triplicate SBP measurements at 40 minutes at each infusion as the outcomes in the GLM, adjusting for covariates such as intervention, age and sex. The generalized estimating equation (GEE) technique is proposed to estimate the regression coefficients, and the corresponding variances are estimated by the sandwich estimators.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bipolar and unipolar depressive episode, current episode of depression (DSM-V) despite&#xD;
             at least two adequate trials of Level 1-evidence psychiatric medications.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Not of childbearing potential, defined as: Postmenopausal (defined as no menses for 12&#xD;

             (FSH) level (&gt;40 IU/L or mIU/mL in the postmenopausal range) will be used to confirm a&#xD;
             postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement&#xD;
             therapy, however in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement&#xD;
             is insufficient;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Permanently sterile: permanent sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
             salpingectomy, bilateral tubal occlusion/ligation procedures, and bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             the beginning and be willing to use a highly effective method of contraception during&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must practice a highly effective method of&#xD;
             contraception (failure rate of &lt;1percent per year when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly) beginning at least two weeks before and continued while receiving ketamine&#xD;
             infusions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who are sexually active with a woman of childbearing potential must&#xD;
             agree to use a double-barrier method of contraception (eg, diaphragm or cervical/vault&#xD;
             caps plus condom with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects who are sexually active with a woman who is pregnant must agree to use a&#xD;
             condom. Male subjects must also agree to not donate sperm during the treatment and for&#xD;
             a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as approximately 90 days) after&#xD;
             receiving the last dose of ketamine;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abstention from consuming grapefruit juice (a potent 3A4 cytochrome inhibitor) on the&#xD;
             day of the ketamine infusions as it may alter the metabolism of ketamine;&#xD;

          -  Provision of written informed consent after reading the participant information&#xD;
             handout;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline blood pressure within normal limits, i.e. below 140/90 mmHg, when measured&#xD;
             thrice in a quiet room.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant hearing impairment not improved with hearing aids and/or sound&#xD;
             amplification or unwillingness to listen to music during treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject's depressive symptoms have previously demonstrated non-response to&#xD;
             esketamine or ketamine in the current major depressive episode;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known intellectual deficiency or autism spectrum disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to accommodate regular visits to the Depressive Disorders Program at the&#xD;

             immunodeficiency syndrome;&#xD;

             dependence) and/or recent history (last 12 months) of alcohol or cannabis abuse or&#xD;
             dependence, as defined by DSM-5 criteria. (Cannabis will be considered similarly to&#xD;
             alcohol for the purpose of this study, as it is clinically, in the context of its&#xD;
             legalization in Canada. That is, recreational use that does not meet criteria for a&#xD;
             substance use disorder and/or is not deemed to be negatively impacting participants'&#xD;
             physical and mental health will not justify exclusion from the study just as it does&#xD;
             not justify exclusion from purely clinical treatment by ketamine.)&#xD;

          -  A clinical finding that is unstable or that, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
             clinician(s), would be negatively affected by, or would affect, the medication (e.g.,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Liver function tests AST and ALT three times the upper normal limit at screening.&#xD;
