  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently in 2016, a new interfascial plane nerve block was developed for thoracic analgesia&#xD;
      known as the erector spinae plane block (ESPB). Since its development for thoracic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain, the ESPB has been shown to be effective in pain control in multiple&#xD;
      procedures including thoracotomies. However, there have been a few published case reports of&#xD;
      using ESPB for analgesia in rib fracture management and only one retrospective study which&#xD;
      demonstrated improved NRS pain scores and increased incentive spirometry volumes (ICV)&#xD;
      post-ESPB compared to pre-ESPB values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ESPB as an alternative method to&#xD;
      the current standard of care at Stanford Health Care (SHC) for pain management in traumatic&#xD;
      rib fractures. At the investigator's institution, the current standard of care is intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) and enteral multimodal analgesia that consists primarily of opioids and a continuous IV&#xD;
      lidocaine infusion. Although IV lidocaine has shown some benefit in improving post-surgical&#xD;
      pain scores, evidence for its use in MRF is lacking. The purpose of this study is to perform&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial comparing outcomes in pain control and incentive spirometry&#xD;
      volumes between continuous ESPB catheters and IV lidocaine infusions in adult patients with&#xD;
      acute traumatic rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to determine if ESPB can provide improved pain control in patients&#xD;
      admitted for traumatic rib fractures compared to IV Lidocaine. The aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of ESPB on OME consumption, pain scores, incentive spirometry volumes,&#xD;
      cough strength, respiratory complications, inflammatory biomarkers and hospital LOS. Findings&#xD;
      from this study can help improve analgesia, quality of care, and patient satisfaction at&#xD;
      Stanford Healthcare and for other acute pain and trauma surgery providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study involves pain management for patients with acute traumatic rib&#xD;
      fractures and therefore must involve human subjects.&#xD;
