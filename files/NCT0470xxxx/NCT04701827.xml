  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Affective disorders are associated with impaired functioning and quality of life, as well as&#xD;
      comorbid somatic disorders and increased mortality. Despite different medical and&#xD;
      psychological treatment options, the prognosis for affective disorder remains largely&#xD;
      unchanged. Consequently, the field needs new intervention strategies especially targeting the&#xD;
      patient groups having impaired functioning. The core idea of the AWARE project is to focus on&#xD;
      improving functioning and quality of life in patients with affective disorders every-day life&#xD;
      using a comprehensive 360 degrees intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial has a randomized, controlled, parallel-group design. Study participants will be 140&#xD;
      outpatients, male or female age 18-60 with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or recurrent&#xD;
      depressive disorder, in a current state of remission, with an objectively rated impaired&#xD;
      functioning. Participant will be randomized to six month AWARE intervention or treatment as&#xD;
      usual (TAU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments encompassing Activities of Daily Living (ADL), neuropsychological testing, mood&#xD;
      ratings, physical health and questionnaires on subjective cognitive complaints, psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning, quality of life are, sleep quality and satisfaction with psychiatric treatment&#xD;
      are carried out at baseline and after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: It is hypothesised that the AWARE arm in comparison with standard care will&#xD;
      improve observed ability to perform Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and improve Quality of&#xD;
      Life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite different medical and psychological treatment options, the prognosis for affective&#xD;
      disorder remains largely unchanged. Consequently, the field needs new intervention strategies&#xD;
      especially targeting the patient groups having impaired functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The core idea in the AWARE project is to focus on improving functioning and quality of life&#xD;
      in patients with affective disorders every-day life using a comprehensive 360 degrees&#xD;
      intervention. The present AWARE intervention represent an integrated treatment avenue to&#xD;
      improve functioning in patients with affective disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is, in a pragmatically Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT), to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of a 360 degrees intervention based on the ICF Brief Core Set for BD and unipolar&#xD;
      disorder targeting functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will upon inclusion, be randomised to participate in either 6 months AWARE&#xD;
      treatment or standard care. The control group will receive standard care consisting of the&#xD;
      standard out-patient mental health service routines in The Capital Region of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The AWARE intervention targets multiple aspects of the described enhancers of functioning&#xD;
      based on on the ICF Brief Core Set, including ADL ability as a part of carrying out daily&#xD;
      routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study carried out in a randomized design. The investigators who assess the patients are&#xD;
      blinded to whether the patient has participated in the active or passive treatment arm, so&#xD;
      the results will be valid. In addition, validated standardized survey methods according to&#xD;
      all the outcomes is applied.&#xD;
