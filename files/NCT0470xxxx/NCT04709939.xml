  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of using a mobile-health approach to&#xD;
      gather clinical data from patients following discharge from the hospital on outpatient&#xD;
      parenteral antibiotic therapy (OPAT). The study population will consist of adult participants&#xD;
      who have a smartphone that is capable of both text messaging and pairing with a Bluetooth&#xD;
      thermometer that will be provided. Following discharge, patients will be asked to respond to&#xD;
      two daily text messages. They will also be reminded to take and send in photos of any skin&#xD;
      rashes that may develop as well as their PICC-line site during dressing changes. Text&#xD;
      messages will be sent for up to 30 days, but will be stopped sooner if the patient is&#xD;
      readmitted to the hospital or if OPAT is discontinued. At the end of the 30 days, all&#xD;
      patients will be sent a text message survey about usability, the time it took to complete the&#xD;
      study tasks, suggestions for future improvements, and whether they would be willing to be&#xD;
      interviewed via phone. A subset of the participants will be interviewed via phone to obtain&#xD;
      more detailed feasibility data. Information from the patient's medical record will be&#xD;
      collected at the time of hospital discharge as well as at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a focus group (via conference call) will be conducted with all research team&#xD;
      members and infectious disease physicians involved in OPAT who did not use the system to&#xD;
      gauge their needs and to get ideas for future applications of our tools.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following hospital discharge on OPAT, patients will be asked to respond to two daily text&#xD;
      messages, one in the morning and one in the evening. The message will 1) ask them to take&#xD;
      their temperature using the provided thermometer, 2) will provide a link to a web-based&#xD;
      survey that will ask about any symptoms as well as provide a free text response field, and 3)&#xD;
      remind them to take and send in any photos of any skin rashes that may develop as well as&#xD;
      their PICC-line site during dressing changes. Text messages will be sent for up to 30 days,&#xD;
      but will be stopped sooner if the patient is readmitted to the hospital or if OPAT is&#xD;
      discontinued. At the end of the 30 days, all patients will be sent a text message survey&#xD;
      about usability, the time it took to complete the study tasks, suggestions for future&#xD;
      improvements, and whether they would be willing to be interviewed via phone. A subset of the&#xD;
      participants will be interviewed via phone to obtain more detailed feasibility data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information will also be collected from the patient and their medical record at&#xD;
      the time of hospital discharge (patient caregiver situation, pronouns to address them,&#xD;
      artificial material in joints or bones, biological sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, BMI,&#xD;
      zip code, insurance, reason for OPAT, organisms in cultures, where patient is receiving&#xD;
      discharge medication, discharge medications, and any other diagnoses/co-morbidities) as well&#xD;
      as 2 months after enrollment (any readmission dates and reasons, emergency room visit dates&#xD;
      and reasons, clinic visit dates and reasons, and medication changes within 30 days of&#xD;
      starting OPAT). These data will be collected 2 months after enrollment to ensure that all&#xD;
      readmissions, visits, and medication changes are captured in the medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The software will save time-stamped responses to all web-based surveys, photos sent in, and&#xD;
      temperatures taken by the thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a focus group will be conducted (via conference call) with all research team&#xD;
      members and infectious disease physicians involved in OPAT who did not use the system to&#xD;
      gauge their needs and to get ideas for future applications of our tools. This conference call&#xD;
      will be video and audio recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be any long-term follow up for the study.&#xD;
