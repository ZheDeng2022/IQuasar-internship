      Research Question: Does 4 weeks of supplementation with 'SPM Active' lead to a statistically&#xD;
      significant increase in plasma SPM concentration for obese human subjects? Primary Aim 1: To&#xD;
      compare plasma SPM concentrations and immunological fitness pre- and post- oral SPM&#xD;
      administration in the obese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1a: To quantify plasma SPM concentrations in plasma (pg/mL), serum (pg/mL) and PBMCs&#xD;
           before and after 4 weeks of supplementation with 'SPM Active.' The concentration of SPMs&#xD;
           in plasma, in addition to other PUFA-derived metabolites that share the same enzymatic&#xD;
           pathways as SPMs, will be established at baseline and post-intervention using mass&#xD;
           spectrometry-based metabololipidomics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Aim 1b: To measure in vitro antibody responses of B cells in PBMC pool with in vitro&#xD;
           stimulation and cytokine production before and after 4 weeks of supplementation with&#xD;
           'SPM Active.' In addition, researchers will quantify the relative abundance of differing&#xD;
           immune cell populations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: Specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) are a superfamily of lipid metabolites,&#xD;
      predominantly derived from the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) eicosapentaenoic (EPA)&#xD;
      and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA). Previous research has established that obese mice and humans&#xD;
      have lower circulating levels of SPMs relative to lean controls. In this study, SPMs will be&#xD;
      administered as a dietary supplement to obese human subjects to establish: 1) their&#xD;
      bioavailability in plasma, serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and 2) their&#xD;
      effects on immune cell abundance and in vitro antibody production. The rationale for focusing&#xD;
      on immune cells is that SPMs may be targeting their abundance and phenotype. This study does&#xD;
      not intend to make any health or health-related claims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: A total of 24 (n=12 men + 12 women) obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2) euglycemic and&#xD;
      pre-diabetic subjects (fasting glucose 70-125 mg/dL or HbA1c of 5.7-6.4%) aged 50-65 years&#xD;
      will be recruited by Dr. Erik Butler from the UNC Family Medicine Center in Chapel Hill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): This is a non-randomized uncontrolled clinical trial. The study will&#xD;
      provide the intervention 'SPM Active' provided by Metagenics. All subjects will be advised to&#xD;
      take 4 capsules per day (2 capsules with breakfast and 2 capsules with dinner) of 'SPM&#xD;
      Active' for 4 weeks total. Each capsule contains 145 mg of SPMs for a total daily dose of 580&#xD;
      mg. Fasting blood will be drawn pre- and post-intervention using phlebotomy available under&#xD;
      the direction of Dr. Butler. The scientific approach will rely on mass-spectrometry based&#xD;
      metabololipidomics, immunophenotyping with flow cytometry, and anthropomorphic/blood&#xD;
      pressure/BMI measurements (anthropometric measures are only intended for use in statistical&#xD;
      analysis for confounding variables).&#xD;
