    <textblock>
      Wheezing in infants and children less than 3 years of age children is a frequent feature that&#xD;
      might be difficult to diagnose when only the caregivers reporting is available. Indeed, in&#xD;
      this age group the usual reversible flow limitation measure during pulmonary function testing&#xD;
      (PFT) is missing because PFT techniques require the full patient cooperation to perform&#xD;
      respiratory tests. Infants PFTs have been developed to measure the same indexes than those&#xD;
      measured in adults, but they are difficult to set-up and require medication- induced sleep&#xD;
      during day time. However, when flow limitation is sufficient it can be detected during tidal&#xD;
      breathing as measured during spirometry using pneumotachograph (PNT). In this test, the tidal&#xD;
      breathing flow-volume (TBFV) loop is recorded and studied using different indices to assess&#xD;
      the airflow limitation. But, there again, when addressing infants or very young children&#xD;
      quiet breathing can only be achieved during sleep and medication- induced sleep necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impedance pneumography (IP) is a method for measuring changes in the thoracic electrical&#xD;
      impedance through skin electrodes, which varies as a function of lung aeration i.e.&#xD;
      breathing. This technique has mainly been applied to monitor respiratory rate in intensive&#xD;
      care settings, but recent technical advancements in IP signal processing and electrode&#xD;
      placement strategy have enabled IP to be used for accurate non-invasive tidal flow signal&#xD;
      measurement. Compared to direct PNT, high agreement in flow signal and TBFV indices has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in young children as well as in infants, even during induced&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction. Moreover, in overnight recordings at home, IP was found feasible for&#xD;
      quantifying nocturnal TBFV variability in young children with lower respiratory symptoms. In&#xD;
      this study, it was shown that preschool children with high risk of asthma present with&#xD;
      increased variation of tidal flow profile shape, and momentarily lowered chaoticity, compared&#xD;
      to children with lower risk of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently a study in Tampere University Hospital (TAUH) Allergy centre (Tampere, Finland, PSHP&#xD;
      ethical committee code R14027, ClinicalTrials.gov code NCT02164968) finished collecting&#xD;
      overnight TBFV using impedance pneumography on 70 young children with suspected asthma. The&#xD;
      preliminary analysis of this data shows that the effect of asthma treatment can be seen in&#xD;
      TBFV variability, but to assess the diagnostic capacity of this new method, healthy control&#xD;
      sample should be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology developed by the Finnish medical device company Revenio Research Oy enables to&#xD;
      evaluate the variability of the expiratory flow-volume curve. It is calculate as the&#xD;
      expiration variability index (EVI) which is decreased in case of bronchoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to explore very young children (less than 3 years of age) unable to participate to&#xD;
      any awake lung function test, we set-up a study aiming to: 1) establish reference value for&#xD;
      EVI in healthy children 2 months to 3 years old 2) test the variation of EVI in case of acute&#xD;
      disease with or without wheezing in this age group children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational prospective multicenter study, we will include 110 asymptomatic healthy&#xD;
      subjects to compute reference values of EVI. We will also include 35 previously healthy&#xD;
      subjects who have developed an acute non wheezing disease such as fever, rhinitis, otitis or&#xD;
      bronchitis to compare their EVI to the reference values. And finally, we will recruit 35&#xD;
      young subjects with an acute wheezing episode. All measurements will be performed at home by&#xD;
      the parents, except for some wheezy children who could be hospitalized. It will be proposed&#xD;
      to record 2 consecutive nights in healthy asymptomatic children in order to evaluate the&#xD;
      night-to-night variability which has already shown to be small in older children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this multicentre study 120 children will be recruited by the present study in France and&#xD;
      the remaining 60 children in another English centre using the same design and technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that only children with acute wheezing episode will have a significantly low&#xD;
      EVI compare to the reference values established by this study.&#xD;

      Decrease airway caliber induces airflow limitation which, in turn, will determine a decrease&#xD;
      in the tidal breathing variability. While sleeping, tidal breathing variability will not be&#xD;
      influenced by extra-respiratory muscle activity and therefore it will describe the&#xD;
      physiological airway caliber change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impedance pneumography (IP) is a method for measuring changes in the thoracic electrical&#xD;
      impedance through skin electrodes, which varies as a function of lung aeration i.e.&#xD;
      breathing. This technique has mainly been applied to monitor respiratory rate in intensive&#xD;
      care settings, but recent technical advancements in IP signal processing and electrode&#xD;
      placement strategy have enabled IP to be used for accurate non-invasive tidal flow signal&#xD;
      measurement. Compared to direct pneumotachograph, high agreement in flow signal and tidal&#xD;
      breathing flow-volume (TBFV) indices has been demonstrated in young children as well as in&#xD;
      infants, even during induced bronchoconstriction. Moreover, in overnight recordings at home,&#xD;
      IP was found feasible for quantifying nocturnal TBFV variability in young children with lower&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms. In this study, it was shown that preschool children with high risk of&#xD;
      asthma present with increased variation of tidal flow profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technology developed by the Finnish medical device company Revenio Research Oy enables to&#xD;
      evaluate the variability of the expiratory flow-volume curve. It is calculate as the&#xD;
      expiration variability index (EVI) which is decreased in case of bronchoconstriction, and&#xD;
      momentarily lowered chaoticity, compared to children with lower risk of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that EVI measured during natural night sleep in children under 3 years of age,&#xD;
      could be able to detect airway obstruction and measure its resolution. In this way this&#xD;
      technology could be useful to follow children with repeated airway obstruction (wheezing). As&#xD;
      a first step, we set-up a study to establish reference values of EVI in children less than 3&#xD;
      years and look at its relevance when children are sick with or without wheezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to determine the reference values of EVI in healthy 2 to&#xD;
      36 months old children during night sleep. Primary outcome is the EVI measured using all TBFV&#xD;
      curves recorded by Ventica® CE marked medical device (Revenio Company).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are: study night-to-night IVE reproducibility over 2 consecutive nights;&#xD;
      determine the relevance of EVI in case of wheezing or non-wheezing acute episodes; identify&#xD;
      any environmental and anthropometric determinant of EVI; study safety and easiness of the use&#xD;
      of the device at home by the parents. Secondary outcomes are: concordance of EVI measurements&#xD;
      recorded 2 consecutive nights in an asymptomatic healthy child; number of nights with correct&#xD;
      recording (at least 5 hours/night) compared to number of trials of recording; difference&#xD;
      between values measured during an acute wheezing episode or during fever or acute rhinitis,&#xD;
      otitis, bronchitis in previously healthy children; anthropometric data and environmental&#xD;
      exposure of asymptomatic healthy children; questionnaire in parents to evaluate the use of&#xD;
      the device and potential side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre transversal cohort study conducted in healthy and sick children aged 2&#xD;
      to 36 months. Healthy and sick boys and girls will be recruited from the nursery of&#xD;
      participating hospitals or, for sick children only, from the paediatric ward. Two nights&#xD;
      recording will be proposed to asymptomatic healthy children and 1 night to sick children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria are: for all children, 2 to 36-months-olds, term birth (&gt; 37 ga), birth&#xD;
      weight &gt; 3 Percentile, no hospitalisation for newborn respiratory distress, family aware of&#xD;
      the use of the medical device, family of legal guardian consent to the study. According to&#xD;
      the group, group 1: no history of chronic rhinitis, bronchiolitis or asthma, no respiratory&#xD;
      allergy, no current acute disease, group 2: no history of chronic rhinitis, bronchiolitis or&#xD;
      asthma, no respiratory allergy, no history of chronic rhinitis, bronchiolitis or asthma, no&#xD;
      respiratory allergy, presence of current non-wheezing respiratory disease or fever, group 3:&#xD;
      presence of current wheezing episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria are: palatine tonsils hypertrophy with respiratory consequences;&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea sleep syndrome; any chronic disease which could impact pulmonary function;&#xD;
      cutaneous disease which hampers the correct positioning of the electrodes; patient having a&#xD;
      pace-maker or any other implanted connected electronic device or other medical device (eg&#xD;
      ECG…); for groups 1 an 2 the use of short acting bronchodilator in the previous 8 hours;&#xD;
      daily anti-asthma medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No serious side-effects are expected. A spontaneous degressive flushing of the skin where the&#xD;
      electrodes would have stood for the night might be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain statistical power with correct validity the inclusion of 180 children is necessary&#xD;
      (110 asymptomatic healthy, 35 with non-wheezing disease, 35 of during a wheezing episode),&#xD;
      but two third of this population will be included in this b-centre French study. The 60&#xD;
      remaining subjects will be recruited from a third English centre using the same protocol with&#xD;
      same methodology and device. The number of children included between 2 and 12 months, 12 and&#xD;
      24 months, and 24 and 36 months of age will be similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France 2 centres (Paris and Nancy) will include children during 18 months. Reference&#xD;
      values will be computed according to E.M. Wright and P Royston (Simplified estimation of&#xD;
      age-specific reference intervals for skewed data, Statistics in Medicine 1997, vol 16,&#xD;
      2785-2803) using STATA software. EVI values will be described according to most determinant&#xD;
      factors (height, age, weight…).&#xD;
