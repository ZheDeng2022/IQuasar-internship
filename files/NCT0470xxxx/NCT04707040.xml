      The effects of Neurocognitive Exercise Program (NEP) on ADHD symptoms and executive functions&#xD;
      in children with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Twenty-nine boys (14 ADHD, 15 Healthy Controls) between 7 and 13 years&#xD;
      of age will be recruited in the study and The Conners parent rating scale-revised short&#xD;
      (CPRS-RS), Stroop Test, Wisconsin test and Y-Balance test will be performed . All tests and&#xD;
      measurements will be performed for ADHD group before NEP, after NEP, 6 months and 12 months.&#xD;
      The control group will be evaluated only once.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Stroop color-word test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Stroop Color-Word Test is a color-word task assessing executive function involving processing speed, concentration, and attention (Stroop, 1935). Stroop Test was applied in five sections. These sections and related cards are as follows in their application order: (1) The card with the color names printed in black (1st card), (2) the card with the color names printed in different colors (2nd card), (3) the card with the colored printed circles (3rd card), (4) in the card with neutral words without the color name (4th Card), (5) The section where the colors of the words in the 2nd Card are spelled, with the names of colors printed in different colors. Stroop test gives information about many cognitive processes such as selective attention, focused attention, response inhibition, interference control, and information processing speed.</description>

    <measure>Conners parent rating scale-revised short (CPRS-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>CPRS-RS is a 27-item scale that determines the severity of ADHD. The items consist of three sub-scales (Disagree-QA, Cognitive Problems-Inattention CP-I, Hyperactivity-HI) and an auxiliary scale (ADHD Index). The questions are answered by the parents on a four-point Likert scale. &quot;Never&quot;, &quot;rarely&quot;, &quot;often&quot; and &quot;always&quot; options are scored as &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot; respectively</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WCST is a test used for executive function assessment, which includes measurements related to strategic planning, updating, shift cognitive set, modulating impulsive responding, and perseveration (Greve et al., 2005). The computer version of the test was used in this study (Heaton, 2008). The WCST included four stimulus cards and 128 response cards. Respondents were required to sort response cards based on one of three characteristics (i.e., color, form, and number) of the four stimulus cards. The computer gives 'correct' or 'wrong' feedback after each response. The ranking category changes when the participant selects the appropriate card for 10 cards. The test is completed after the participant has completed 6 categories or at the end of 128 response cards.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Y-Balance test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Y-Balance Test (YBT) was used to evaluate the dynamic balance of children. YBT was performed in three directions (anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral). The test protocol was applied based on the learning effect (Hertel et al., 2000). After measuring the leg length (anterior superior iliac spine to the medial malleolus) of the children, the average of three measurements taken after 6 attempts in both directions with both feet was taken as the test score. [YBT normalized value: (Average of 3 reach distances) / limb length x 100; YBT composite score: (Anterior + Posteromedial + Posterolateral) / (3 x Limb Length) x100)].</description>

    <description>The group received NEP for 10 weeks, one hour per week conducted by the same physiotherapist with 6 years of experience in this field. Children with ADHD were given home exercises for the other six days of the week without a NEP session. Home exercises were followed with an exercise diary under the control of children's parents. The home exercise program consisted of visual-motor and auditory-motor coordination tasks (daily 15 min).</description>

    <description>Neurocognitive Exercise Program (NEP) is defined as a multimodal exercise program including different motor coordination exercises and cognitive tasks. Exercise progression is performed from easy to difficult, and consist of simple and complex tasks. Different sports equipment (such as different sizes of balls, racket, tulle, pilates ball, eye band, rope, etc.) is used in motor coordination exercises where multiple extremities can be used in NEP. These materials are used during different exercises including cross-limb movements, throwing, jumping, walking, involving different cognitive tasks. The cognitive task used and the degree of difficulty of the task are provided by different visual (colored cards, numbered cards, gestures, etc.) or auditory (keywords, ring signal, etc.) signs. For example, showing a red card might indicate throwing a ball with the left hand, while showing a blue card indicates throwing a ball with the right hand and walking forward</description>
