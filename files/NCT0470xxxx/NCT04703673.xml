      This non-interventional study investigates the Quality of Life of patients suffering from&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis. Patients who seek advice in a pharmacy and choose to intake Sinolpan® or&#xD;
      Sinolpan® forte or to use nasally applied α-sympathomimetics can participate in this&#xD;
      anonymous patient survey.&#xD;

      Within the scope of this non-interventional observational study, the quality of life of&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis patients under self-medication with the 1,8 - cineole preparation Sinolpan® or&#xD;
      Sinolpan® forte (Sinolpan® group) or with a nasally applied α-sympathomimetic (control group)&#xD;
      is investigated during conditions of daily life. Patients who seek advice from a pharmacy&#xD;
      regarding the treatment of their symptoms and who choose Sinolpan® (forte) or a nasal&#xD;
      α-sympathomimetic can participate in this study and are asked to complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      before and after the treatment. For organizational reasons, the recruitment of patients for&#xD;
      the Sinolpan® group (planned number of patients: 500) or the control group (planned number of&#xD;
      patients: 50) is conducted in different pharmacies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this anonymous data collection is to assess the quality of life in&#xD;
      patients with rhinosinusitis. The German version of the Rhinosinusitis Quality of Life&#xD;
      questionnaire, which was only recently validated in a doctoral thesis, is used for this&#xD;
      purpose. Additionally, for patients in the Sinolpan® group who also suffer from bronchitis,&#xD;
      the bronchitis severity score is determined. In addition, data on side effects and&#xD;
      tolerability of the treatment as well as on patients' satisfaction are collected.&#xD;

    <description>The Rhinosinusitis Quality of Life is a validated questionnaire (Atlas et al., Qual Life Res 2005, 14, 1375-1386). It includes 5 symptom severity items (sinus headache/facial pain/facial pressure, blocked or stuffy nose, post-nasal drip, thick nasal discharge, runny nose).&#xD;
It also includes 9 symptom impact items (tired or fatigued, trouble sleeping, harder to concentrate, harder to do the things you normally do, embarrassed, frustrated, irritable, sad or depressed, think about).&#xD;
The score of the frequency of severity items and the score of the symptom impact items covers a Likert-scale: 1 to 5 with 1 = none of the time, 2= a little of the time, 3 = some of the time, 4 = most of the time and 5 = all of the time.&#xD;
The score of the bothersomeness covers a scale from (not bothered at all) to 10 (bothered a lot).&#xD;
The sum values of the individual subscores are normalised towards 100, resulting in values between 0 and 100.</description>

    <measure>Bronchitis severity score (BSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (before first administration) and at day 10 resp. after end of treatment</time_frame>
    <description>For patients suffering additionally from bronchitis: severity of bronchitis Symptoms&#xD;
The BSS comprises the following five symptoms typical for acute bronchitis:&#xD;
cough, sputum, rales on auscultation, chest pain on coughing, and dyspnoea. These symptoms are each assessed according to a 5-point Likert scale: 0=absent, 1=mild, 2=moderate, 3=severe and 4=very severe. The points allocated to each of the symptoms are added to make the total score. This can therefore vary between 0 and 20 points and should show a one-dimensional degree of severity in the clinical signs of acute bronchitis.</description>
