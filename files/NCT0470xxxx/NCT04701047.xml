      The rationale of the study is to investigate the results of a prolapse treatment in adult&#xD;
      women with a vaginal prolapse. The investigators will investigate this by taking&#xD;
      questionnaires in women undergoing a surgical prolapse repair and in women that are being&#xD;
      treated by a vaginal pessary. The objective is to compare the results of the different&#xD;
      methods with each other and to observe the evolution of the symptoms in patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery or pessary use. The investigators would also like to discover existing problems in&#xD;
      pessary use and adverse effects.&#xD;

      The rationale of the study is to investigate the results of a prolapse treatment in adult&#xD;
      women with a vaginal prolapse. The investigators will investigate this by taking&#xD;
      questionnaires in women undergoing a surgical prolapse repair and in women that are being&#xD;
      treated by a vaginal pessary. The objective is to compare the results of the different&#xD;
      methods with each other and to observe the evolution of the symptoms in patients undergoing&#xD;
      surgery or pessary use. The investigators would also like to discover existing problems in&#xD;
      pessary use and adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires that will be used are the PFDI-20 (pelvic floor distress inventory),&#xD;
      PFIQ-7 (pelvic floor impact questionnaire), PISQ-9 (Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary&#xD;
      Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire) and a custom-made questionnaire to further investigate the&#xD;
      behavior towards pessary use of our patients and the adverse effects they are dealing with.&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be taken before the treatment has started, 6 weeks post treatment&#xD;
      start, one-year post treatment start, two years post treatment start and 5 years post&#xD;
      treatment start. A POP-Q (Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification) investigation will be&#xD;
      performed to estimate the degree of vaginal prolapse before the start of the treatment. Since&#xD;
      clinical follow up is not necessarily needed after one year for the women who undergo&#xD;
      surgery, their questionnaires will be taken via telephone or e-mail. For women that are being&#xD;
      treated with pessaries the investigators will also take our custom-made questionnaire at 4&#xD;
      and 8 months after starting the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to recruit 100 women for this study, older than 18 years old who&#xD;
      have not undergone a previous treatment with a pessary or surgery for vaginal prolapse.&#xD;
      Another exclusion criterium are women who still have a child wish and women who have&#xD;
      contraindications for surgery. The investigators will also exclude women who don't speak&#xD;
      Dutch or women who cannot give a written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that woman being treated with one year of pessary use are&#xD;
      overall not having more symptoms than woman that underwent a surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that woman being treated with five years of pessary use are overall having less&#xD;
      symptoms than woman that underwent a surgery.&#xD;
