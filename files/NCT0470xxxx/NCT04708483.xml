      DCE-CT of thoracic tumors as an early biomarker for treatment monitoring in comparison with&#xD;
      morphologic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rationale of the clinical investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the evaluation of response to anti-tumoral therapy in thoracic tumors, merely&#xD;
           morphologic information is often not sufficient for early response evaluation as&#xD;
           dimensions of the oncologic lesions are not changing during the first weeks of&#xD;
           treatment. To be able to measure functional changes, dynamic contrast-enhanced CT&#xD;
           (DCE-CT) seems promising as a biomarker for early therapy monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Having an early biomarker for treatment monitoring will allow to increase patients'&#xD;
           prognosis if a non-responder is earlier detected, will optimize the use of expensive&#xD;
           treatments, is expected to shorten hospitalization and shorten absence at work, and to&#xD;
           decrease side-effects of (adjuvant) medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1.Primary objectives The primary objective is to investigate the potential of functional&#xD;
      imaging (i.e. DCE-CT), as analyzed by the Hyperfusion analytic software, as an early&#xD;
      biomarker for the evaluation of therapy response in primary thoracic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2.Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To define internal system parameters and perfusion parameter thresholds that maximize&#xD;
           the accuracy of the outcomes and to define the correct category (PD, SD, PR, CR); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the predicted categorization to the assessed RECIST1.1 categorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endpoints 3.1.Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is to directly compare the biomarker&#xD;
           of the HF analysis software at week 3 (+- 1 week) and week 8 (+- 3 weeks) with the&#xD;
           eventually reported Progression-Free Survival (PFS) intervals and Overall Survival (OS)&#xD;
           in this study. PFS intervals are determined by the clinician and are based on RECIST1.1&#xD;
           and additional clinical and biochemical progression markers. The focus will be on&#xD;
           evaluating the accuracy of the prediction as well as how early the prediction was&#xD;
           correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2.Secondary Endpoints There are two secondary endpoints corresponding to the two secondary&#xD;
      objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The internal parameters for the HF biomarker, e.g. magnitude of the Ktrans decrease, and&#xD;
           the change in volume of unhealthy tissue, need to be determined to define the&#xD;
           classification (PD, SD, PR and CR) by the HF analysis software. These parameters are&#xD;
           optimized to optimally predict the classification according to PFS and OS. This will be&#xD;
           done by splitting the data into a train and test set to ensure generalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The classification of the HF analysis software will be compared to the purely&#xD;
           morphological classification by RECIST1.1 to identify correlation. Furthermore, some&#xD;
           cases will be investigated where the HF analysis performs noticeably better or worse&#xD;
           than RECIST1.1 in predicting PFS and OS. Finally, the difference in time to the first&#xD;
           correct prediction is compared between HF and RECIST1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is part of the clinical β-phase. We aim to test pre-release versions&#xD;
      of the Hyperfusion.ai software under real-world working conditions in a hospital (clinical)&#xD;
      setting. It is important to note, though, that the results of the software analysis will not&#xD;
      be used by interpreting physicians to alter clinical judgement during the course of the&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study including 100 inoperable patients in UZ Gent suffering from primary&#xD;
      thoracic malignancy (≥15mm diameter) will be conducted. For this study, in total 3 CT scan&#xD;
      examinations of the thorax will be performed (a venous CT examination of the thorax in&#xD;
      combination with a DCE-CT scan of the tumoral region).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recruited from the pulmonology department. Oncologic patients are&#xD;
      clinically referred with certain intervals for a clinically indicated CT scan (being part of&#xD;
      standard care). In the study, two clinical CT examinations that are performed standard of&#xD;
      care (baseline CT examination and CT examination at week 8 (+- 3 weeks) after start of&#xD;
      systemic therapy) will be executed by also adding a DCE-image of the lung adenocarcinoma to&#xD;
      this examination. This DCE-image is performed during the waiting time before the&#xD;
      venous/morphologic phase. Consequently, from a clinical point-of-view, the time to scan&#xD;
      remains exactly the same. With regard to the contrast agent, an identical amount is injected&#xD;
      as is the case in standard of care, but the contrast bolus is split in two parts - see also&#xD;
      addendum with DCE protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study there is one additional CT-examination (DCE-scan of the thoracic malignancy in&#xD;
      combination with venous CT scan of the thorax) at week 3 (± 1 week).&#xD;

      Introduction Background information&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below, you will find an overview the publications on DCE-CT, in the context of the evaluation&#xD;
      of treatment effect in cancer patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strauch L et al (Diagnostics 2016: 21;6(3) - doi: 10.3390/diagnostics6030028) provide an&#xD;
      overview of the literature available on DCE-CT as a tool to evaluate treatment response in&#xD;
      patients with lung cancer. In studies where patients were treated with systemic chemotherapy&#xD;
      with or without anti-angiogenic drugs, four out of the seven studies found a significant&#xD;
      decrease in permeability after treatment. Four out of five studies that measured blood flow&#xD;
      post anti-angiogenic treatments found that blood flow was significantly decreased. This&#xD;
      review concluded that DCE-CT may be a useful tool in assessing treatment response in patients&#xD;
      with lung cancer. It seemed that particularly permeability and blood flow are important&#xD;
      perfusion values for predicting treatment outcome. However, the heterogeneity in scan&#xD;
      protocols, scan parameters, and time between scans makes it difficult to compare the reviewed&#xD;
      papers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group of van Elmpt W and Lambin P (Radiother Oncol 2017: 125(3):379-384)&#xD;
      identified tumor subregions with characteristic phenotypes based on pre-treatment&#xD;
      multi-parametric functional imaging and correlated these subregions to treatment outcome. The&#xD;
      subregions were created using imaging of metabolic activity (FDG- Positron Emission&#xD;
      Tomography (PET)/CT), hypoxia (HX4-PET/CT) and tumor vasculature (DCE-CT). Thirty-six&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients underwent functional imaging prior to radical&#xD;
      radiotherapy. Kinetic analysis was performed on DCE-CT scans to acquire blood flow (BF) and&#xD;
      volume (BV) maps. HX4-PET/CT and DCE-CT scans were non-rigidly co-registered to the planning&#xD;
      FDG-PET/CT. Two clustering steps were performed on multi-parametric images: first to segment&#xD;
      each tumor into homogeneous subregions (i.e. supervoxels) and second to group the supervoxels&#xD;
      of all tumors into phenotypic clusters. Patients were split based on the absolute or relative&#xD;
      volume of supervoxels in each cluster; overall survival was compared using a log-rank test.&#xD;
      Unsupervised clustering of supervoxels yielded four independent clusters. One cluster (high&#xD;
      hypoxia, high FDG, intermediate BF/BV) related to a high-risk tumor type: patients assigned&#xD;
      to this cluster had significantly worse survival compared to patients not in this cluster (p&#xD;
      = 0.035). It was concluded that subregional analysis for multi-parametric imaging in NSCLC&#xD;
      has the potential as a biomarker for prognosis. This methodology allows for a comprehensive&#xD;
      data-driven analysis of multi-parametric functional images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qiao P et al (Clin Transl Oncol 2016: 18(1):47-57) have studied the feasibility and clinical&#xD;
      value of DCE-CT for early evaluation of targeted therapy efficacy in non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC). They measured tumor diameter, peak height (PH), time to peak (TP), tumor&#xD;
      mass-aortic peak height ratio (M/A), and blood perfusion (BP) in 20 patients with advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC using DCE-CT before and 7 days after treatment. Therapy efficacy was assessed with&#xD;
      conventional CT 4-6 weeks post-treatment. Patients were grouped into those with partial&#xD;
      response (PR), stable disease (SD), and progressive disease (PD) according to the therapy&#xD;
      efficacy assessment at 4-6 weeks post-treatment. The PR group primary tumor diameter (P =&#xD;
      0.0007) and BP (P = 0.0225) were reduced at 7 days post-treatment; the SD group DCE-CT value&#xD;
      changes were not significant. The PD group M/A (P = 0.0443) and BP (P = 0.0268) were&#xD;
      increased 7 days post-treatment. The BP decrease group had significantly longer&#xD;
      progression-free survival than the BP increase group (median, 54 vs. 6 weeks). This study&#xD;
      concluded that DCE-CT can evaluate targeted therapy efficacy at 7 days post-treatment.&#xD;
      Decreased primary tumor diameter and BP indicate tumor sensitivity to therapy; increased BP&#xD;
      with unchanged tumor diameter suggests the tumor is not sensitive to therapy. Reduced BP&#xD;
      suggests treatment effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hwang et al (Eur Radiol 2013: 23(6):1573-81) compared tumor enhancement patterns measured&#xD;
      using DCE-CT with tumor metabolism measured using PET-CT in patients with non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) and stable disease after chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. After treatment,&#xD;
      75 NSCLC tumors in 65 patients who had stable disease on DCE-CT according to Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) were evaluated using PET-CT. On DCE-CT, relative&#xD;
      enhancement ratios (RER) of tumor at 30, 60, 90, 120 s and 5 min after injection of contrast&#xD;
      material were measured. Metabolic responses of tumors were classified into two groups&#xD;
      according to the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) by PET-CT: complete metabolic&#xD;
      response (CR) with an SUVmax of less than 2.5, and non-complete metabolic response (NR) with&#xD;
      an SUVmax of at least 2.5. Using the optimal RER₆₀ cutoff value of 43.7 % to predict NR of&#xD;
      the tumor gave 95.7 % sensitivity, 64.2 % specificity, and 82.1 % positive and 95.0 %&#xD;
      negative predictive values. After adjusting for tumor size, the odds ratio for NR in the&#xD;
      tumor with an RER60 of at least 43.7 % was 70.85 (95 % CI = 7.95-630.91; P &lt; 0.05). Even when&#xD;
      disease was stable according to RECIST, DCE-CT predicted hypermetabolic status of residual&#xD;
      tumor in patients with NSCLC after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of the clinical investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the evaluation of response to anti-tumoral therapy in thoracic tumors, merely morphologic&#xD;
      information is often not sufficient for early response evaluation as dimensions of the&#xD;
      oncologic lesions are not changing during the first weeks of treatment. To be able to measure&#xD;
      functional changes, dynamic contrast-enhanced CT (DCE-CT) seems promising as a biomarker for&#xD;
      early therapy monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having an early biomarker for treatment monitoring will allow to increase patients' prognosis&#xD;
      if a non-responder is earlier detected, will optimize the use of expensive treatments, is&#xD;
      expected to shorten hospitalization and shorten absence at work, and to decrease side-effects&#xD;
      of (adjuvant) medication.&#xD;

      biomarker for the evaluation of therapy response in primary thoracic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      There are two secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To define internal system parameters and perfusion parameter thresholds that maximize the&#xD;
      accuracy of the outcomes and to define the correct category (PD, SD, PR, CR); and To compare&#xD;
      the predicted categorization to the assessed RECIST1.1 categorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is to directly compare the biomarker of the&#xD;
      HF analysis software at week 3 (+- 1 week) and week 8 (+- 3 weeks) with the eventually&#xD;
      reported Progression-Free Survival (PFS) intervals and Overall Survival (OS) in this study.&#xD;
      The prediction of the four classes (PD, SD, PR and CR) is based on &quot;significant changes&quot; (see&#xD;
      7.2) in HF biomarker. PFS intervals are determined by the clinician and are based on&#xD;
      RECIST1.1 and additional clinical and biochemical progression markers. The focus will be on&#xD;
      evaluating the accuracy of the prediction as well as how early the prediction was correct.&#xD;

      investigated where the HF analysis performs noticeably better or worse than RECIST1.1 in&#xD;
      predicting PFS and OS. Finally, the difference in time to the first correct prediction is&#xD;
      compared between HF and RECIST1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, monocentric (currently, however we do foresee to collaborate with other&#xD;
      centres to include patients with colorectal liver metastases; also other types of solid&#xD;
      tumors could be included; see ) study is part of the clinical β-phase. We aim to test&#xD;
      pre-release versions of the Hyperfusion.ai software under real-world working conditions in a&#xD;
      hospital (clinical) setting. It is important to note, though, that the results of the&#xD;
      software analysis will not be used by interpreting physicians to alter clinical judgement&#xD;
      during the course of the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study including 100 inoperable patients in UZ Gent suffering from primary&#xD;
      thoracic malignancy (≥15mm diameter) will be conducted. For this study, in total 3 CT scan&#xD;
      examinations of the thorax will be performed (a venous CT examination of the thorax in&#xD;
      combination with a DCE-CT scan of the tumoral region).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be recruited from the pulmonology department. Oncologic patients are&#xD;

      standard care). In the study, two clinical CT examinations that are performed standard of&#xD;
      care (baseline CT examination and CT examination at week 8 (+- 3 weeks) after start of&#xD;
      systemic therapy) will be executed by also adding a DCE-image of the primary thoracic&#xD;
      malignancy to this examination. This DCE-image is performed during the waiting time before&#xD;
      the venous/morphologic phase. Consequently, from a clinical point-of-view, the time to scan&#xD;
      remains exactly the same. With regard to the contrast agent, an identical amount is injected&#xD;
      as is the case in standard of care, but the contrast bolus is split in two parts - see also&#xD;
      addendum with DCE protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study there is one additional CT-examination (DCE-scan of the thoracic malignancy in&#xD;
      combination with venous CT scan of the thorax) at week 3 (± 1 week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Number of subjects At least one hundred patients will be included in this study.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Inoperable patients suffering from primary thoracic malignancy or second&#xD;
      line patients having had a therapy pause of at least 6 weeks; at least one tumoral&#xD;
      lesion/component should be at least 15mm in diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria All patients less than 18-years-old. Documented allergy for iodine.&#xD;
      Neutropenia (absolute White Blood Cell count ≤ 1.5 × 109/l). Thrombopenia (absolute platelet&#xD;
      count ≤ 100 × 109/l). Renal insufficiency: serum creatinine ≥ 1.5× the upper limit of normal&#xD;
      (ULN); 24-hours creatinine clearance ≤ 50ml/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum bilirubine ≥ 1,5 x ULN, AST ≥ 2,5 x ULN, ALT ≥ 2,5x ULN. Brain metastases. Withdrawal&#xD;
      and replacement of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for withdrawal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may prematurely discontinue from the clinical investigation at any time. Premature&#xD;
      discontinuation from the study is to be understood when the subject did not undergo end of&#xD;
      study examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects can be withdrawn under the following circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
      at their own request; if the investigator feels it would not be in the best interest of the&#xD;
      subject to continue; if the subject violates conditions laid out in the informed consent form&#xD;
      or disregards instructions by the clinical investigation personal; in case of significant&#xD;
      study intervention non-compliance;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases, the reason why subjects are withdrawn will be recorded in detail in the CRF and&#xD;
      in the subject's medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she fails to return for the scheduled&#xD;
      visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site staff. The following actions must be&#xD;
      taken if a subject fails to return to the clinic for a required study visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site will attempt to contact the subject and reschedule the missed visit. Before a&#xD;
      subject is deemed lost to follow-up, the investigator or designee will make every effort to&#xD;
      regain contact with the subject (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a&#xD;
      certified letter to the subject's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods).&#xD;
      These contact attempts should be documented in the subject's medical record or study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the subject continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have withdrawn&#xD;
      from the study with a primary reason of being lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should the clinical investigation be discontinued prematurely, all clinical investigation&#xD;
      materials will be retained and the sponsor will notify the relevant regulatory authorities&#xD;
      and ethical committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drop-outs will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Restrictions and prohibitions for the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must refrain from any food and drinks at least 4 hours before the CT-examination&#xD;
      (standard of care).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible advantages and risks for the subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this stage there are no advantages for the patients studied. As a result of this study, we&#xD;
      anticipate that DCE-CT and the concurring Hyperfusion.ai analysis will function as an early&#xD;
      biomarker for treatment monitoring, thereby optimizing tumor treatments. So, for future&#xD;
      patients it is hoped that this study will prolong the PFS (progression-free survival).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no other risks than those associated with an intravenous injection of iodine-based&#xD;
      contrast-agent (fully comparable with standard of care IV injections of iodine). In this&#xD;
      patient population, there is no risk associated with the increased x-ray dose applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical device description&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended use and instructions for use Intended use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperfusion.ai's software as a medical device is intended to be used by physicians in order&#xD;
      to perform a post-processing analysis of DCE-imaging, with the intention of accurately&#xD;
      calculating perfusion parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperfusion.ai's software is a radiological computer-assisted therapy monitoring software&#xD;
      device intended to be used concurrently by interpreting physicians while analysing DCE-images&#xD;
      that stem from medical imaging types and modalities, such as compatible computed tomography&#xD;
      scanners (CT), magnetic resonance imaging scanners, and others. The system computes perfusion&#xD;
      parameters within one scanning session and calculates the relative difference between&#xD;
      different scanning sessions. These findings assist interpreting physicians in evaluating&#xD;
      tumor response rate that may be confirmed or dismissed by the interpreting physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, this software is perceived as Class IIb, according to (Rule 11) of the MDR&#xD;
      2017/745, in the idea that Hyperfusion's software is 'intended to provide information which&#xD;
      is used to take decisions with diagnosis or therapeutic purposes.'&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivery of the medical device The medical device software will not be accessible at the site&#xD;
      during the course of the clinical trial. Hyperfusion's software analysis is cloud-based and&#xD;
      can currently only be accessible by personnel of the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the clinical trial, the site (Department of Radiology) will be asked to&#xD;
      send the DICOM-data to Hyperfusion.ai via a highly-secure DNS-server that will be provided by&#xD;
      Hyperfusion.ai.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The processing result will be made available to the physician for download at an agreed cloud&#xD;
      location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Storage of the medical device&#xD;
&#xD;
      The output of Hyperfusion.ai software analysis, will be stored at the highly-secure cloud&#xD;
      storage servers Hyperfusion uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packaging and labeling of the medical device&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be provided to the physician in a digital form including the perfusion&#xD;
      parameter maps and the generated PDF-report. There will be a supporting document&#xD;
      (Instructions for use) to aid physicians in accurately interpreting the report. The following&#xD;
      information will be mentioned as 'label' on the PDF report:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medical Device Regulation 2017/745 requires for each investigational device to be&#xD;
      specifically labelled. As this concerns a software analysis (without user interface) which&#xD;
      generates a PDF-report for the user, the first page of this (unique) report contains the&#xD;
      following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of the investigational device Hyperfusion.ai Kleemburg 1, 9050 Gentbrugge&#xD;
      Belgium info@hyperfusion.ai&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Specific Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit This step is standard of care. At time of the first referral consultation&#xD;
      within the framework of the patient's oncologic rehabilitation, the pneumonologist will&#xD;
      determine whether the patient is eligible for systemic treatment, and fits the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be explained to the patient at first by the study coordinator. If the&#xD;
      patient is willing to participate more detailed information is communicated by the physician.&#xD;
      Final informed consent is obtained by the physician and 3 CT examinations (baseline, week 3&#xD;
      and week 8) will be planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline CT examination A baseline CT-examination is standard of care. Maximally 28 days&#xD;
      before the start of systemic treatment the baseline CT examination is performed. This&#xD;
      includes a standard of care CT in combination with a study specific DCE-CT scan. Detailed&#xD;
      information on how to perform the study specific DCE-CT scan can be found in addendum with&#xD;
      DCE-CT protocol. The patient receives an identical dose of intravenous iodine based contrast&#xD;
      agent as in standard of care (venous phase) CT examination (contrast agent bolus is split in&#xD;
      2 parts - see explanation earlier/above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit 1 The follow-up visit 1 is standard of care. 3 weeks (+/- 1 week) after the&#xD;
      start of the systemic treatment, a study specific DCE-CT scan will be scheduled at this visit&#xD;
      in combination with a venous phase CT. Detailed information on how to perform the study&#xD;
      specific DCE scan can be found in addendum with DCE-CT protocol. The patient receives an&#xD;
      identical amount of contrast agent during this CT examination when compared to standard of&#xD;
      care (venous) CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visit 2 The follow-up visit 2 is standard of care. 8 weeks (+/- 3 weeks) after the&#xD;
      start of the systemic treatment follow-up visit 2 is planned. This visit is identical as&#xD;
      follow-up visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up until PFS. After follow-up visit 2, no study specific assessments will be performed&#xD;
      anymore. Data on the morphologically (standard of care) CT examinations based RECIST 1.1 will&#xD;
      be collected until PFS (and potentially Overall Survival). All patients will be in follow-up&#xD;
      at least until PFS (even after closing the clinical trial when the last patient has been&#xD;
      included). A maximum term for follow-up is however set at 1 year after the initiation of&#xD;
      therapy in all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients are followed-up in standard care until PFS. For this clinical trial we aim at&#xD;
      following-up the patient until PFS but a maximum term for follow-up is set at 1 year after&#xD;
      the initiation of therapy for the patient. Data on adverse events will not be collected&#xD;
      anymore during follow-up until PFS. Only 'Death' will be reported to the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical trial, data on tumor-type, applied systemic treatment, medical history,&#xD;
      gender and age will be collected.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Overall, the end of the study is reached when PFS is reached in all included patients or 1&#xD;
      year after the last patient has started treatment. Between the end of study intervention and&#xD;
      PFS, data of standard of care CT examinations based on RECIST 1.1 will be collected.&#xD;

      Study analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred patients will be used as a sample size. A preliminary power analysis for&#xD;
      determining the sample size was performed. Preliminary results have shown that a Ktrans&#xD;
      reduction of 40% would be indicative for differentiating between treatment responders and&#xD;
      non-responders. A preliminary power analysis under these assumptions shows that for a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in mean value of 0.6 results in a power of 0.8439 for&#xD;
      100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis would be performed in-house by Ir. Verhack, PhD&#xD;
      (ruben@hyperfusion.ai) and Ir. Van den Abeele, PhD (floris@hyperfusion.ai).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following, two analyses will be proposed that support the primary endpoint and the&#xD;
      second secondary endpoint. Both analyses will be performed twice, once using the HF&#xD;
      prediction at week 3 (+- 1 week) and once using the prediction of week 8 (+- 3 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two interim analyses will be performed over the course of the clinical study. The first will&#xD;
      be after 10 patients have been followed up for 6 months, and the second will be when 50&#xD;
      patients have been followed up for a year. The final analysis will be performed at the end of&#xD;
      the year 2 follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Analysis of correlation between HF biomarker and PFS and OS&#xD;
&#xD;
           First, the goal is to investigate if the HF biomarker based on Ktrans is indeed a viable&#xD;
           early biomarker to indicate treatment response or not. Therefore, a to-be-defined&#xD;
           descriptive statistic of the evolution of Ktrans (i.e. HF biomarker) will be compared to&#xD;
           the binary dependent variable responder/non-responder. The dependent variable is&#xD;
           determined from PFS and, in parallel, from OS. If there has been no event (progression&#xD;
           or death) before the last follow-up, then the patient is considered to be a &quot;responder&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two hypotheses will be tested. The first hypothesis states that the HF biomarker does&#xD;
           not significantly decrease for the responders group. The second hypothesis states that&#xD;
           for the non-responder group, there is no significant decrease in the HF biomarker. In&#xD;
           order to assess statistical significance for testing the null hypotheses, a paired&#xD;
           t-test is used with a p-value of 0.05 is considered. Note that the above sample size&#xD;
           calculation is based on this analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Second, an analysis will be performed in which the survival curves of each prediction&#xD;
           class (CR, PR, SD, PD) is compared. As such, the duration until progression is taken&#xD;
           into account as well. Alternatively, these categories can be grouped into responders&#xD;
           (CR, PR) and non-responders (SD, PD). The survival curves are estimated using&#xD;
           Kaplan-Meier estimates [Friedman2010], keeping in mind the common pitfalls in working&#xD;
           with censored data using PFS [Korn2013].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analysis of the correlation between the HF classification and RECIST1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both prediction strategies result in the same classification which involves ordinal data with&#xD;
      four choices (CR, PR, SD, PD). The statistical analysis will investigate the correlation&#xD;
      between the two ordinal variables. The null hypothesis is that there is no linear relation&#xD;
      between the two variables. A p-value of 0.05 will be used to determine statistical&#xD;
      significance. The two ordinal variables will be compared using cross tabulation, Pearson and&#xD;
      Spearman's correlation coefficient. Alternatively, if there are issues with this statistical&#xD;
      analysis, e.g. it might be difficult for the HF software to distinguish between SD and PD,&#xD;
      then these two categories will be merged accompanied by an explanation.&#xD;

      Indemnity insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their participation in the clinical investigation the patients will be insured as&#xD;
      defined by legal requirements. An insurance with no fault responsibility has been foreseen by&#xD;
      the sponsor in accordance with the Belgian law concerning experiments on humans, 7 May 2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Report&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one year after the final completion of the study, a full final report will be written&#xD;
      by the sponsor and submitted to the central ethical committee and competent authority. The&#xD;
      Sponsor will pass this report to all local Principal Investigators for submission to their&#xD;
      local EC if defined by their institution's procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication policy&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be registered at Clinicaltrials.gov prior to inclusion of the first subject.&#xD;
      Results information from this study will be submitted to Clinicaltrials.gov. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      sponsor &amp; cooperating departments aim to publish in the following journals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The New England Journal of Medicine British Medical Journal The Lancet Oncology Journal of&#xD;
      Clinical Oncology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Handling Case Report Form (CRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The source documents are to be completed at the time of the subject's visit. The CRFs are to&#xD;
      be completed within reasonable time after the subject's visit. For this study a digital CRF,&#xD;
      Smart-Trial software will be used. The following data might be collected in the CRFs over the&#xD;
      course of the clinical trial:&#xD;

      PET/CT-examinations: DICOM-images of other examinations that will be performed over the&#xD;
      course of this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each subject enrolled the CRF will be signed by the principal investigator or&#xD;
      co-investigator. This also applies to those subjects who fail to complete the study. If a&#xD;
      subject withdraws from the study, the reason must be noted on the CRF. CRF entries and&#xD;
      corrections will only be performed by study site staff, authorized by the investigator and in&#xD;
      accordance with ISO 14155.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Errors will be logged by the software and corrections will be initiated and dated by the&#xD;
      study member that made the correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entries will be checked by trained personnel (Monitor) and any errors or inconsistencies will&#xD;
      be changed immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original completed and signed CRFs will be collected at the end of the study by the&#xD;
      sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal investigator must verify that all data entries in the CRFs are accurate and&#xD;
      correct. If certain information is Not Done, Not Available or Not Applicable, &quot;N.D.&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;N.AV.&quot; or &quot;N.AP&quot;, should be entered in the appropriate space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data directly collected in the CRF (no source available)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DCE-images (in DICOM-format) can be regarded as sources-files and will, consequently, be&#xD;
      collected in the CRF directly. They will be pseudonymized before being sent to the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudonymized data will be sent to the cloud where it can be downloaded by Hyperfusion.ai.&#xD;
      Hyperfusion.ai analysis will be performed in a pseudonymised way. A PDF-report will be shared&#xD;
      after each CT examination to the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access to source data / documents&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will permit trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory&#xD;
      inspection(s), providing direct access to source data/documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archiving&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and sponsor specific essential documents will be retained for at least 20&#xD;
      years. At that moment, it will be judged whether it is necessary to retain them for a longer&#xD;
      period, according to applicable regulatory or other requirement(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance and periodic monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the&#xD;
      study to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified. These documents&#xD;
      will be classified into two different categories: investigator's file, and subject clinical&#xD;
      source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's file will contain the documents as per EUROPEAN Standard of EN ISO 14155&#xD;
      (incl. GCP) and local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular monitoring will be performed by Hiruz CTU according to ICH GCP and ISO 14155. Data&#xD;
      will be evaluated for compliance with the protocol and accuracy in relation to source&#xD;
      documents. Following written standard operating procedures, the monitors will verify that the&#xD;
      clinical trial is conducted and data are generated, documented and reported in compliance&#xD;
      with the protocol, ISO 14155 and the applicable regulatory requirements. To be ISO 14155&#xD;
      compliant at least 3 monitoring visits are scheduled. An initiation visit, one routine visit&#xD;
      and a final visit after the last patient had finished the study. The monitor will be working&#xD;
      according to SOPs and will provide a monitoring report after each visit for the sponsor and a&#xD;
      follow-up letter to the investigator. Depending on the quality of the data, additional&#xD;
      monitoring visits will be necessary according to the sponsor's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More detailed information regarding the monitoring can be found in the monitoring plan which&#xD;
      will be the responsibility of the HIRUZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
