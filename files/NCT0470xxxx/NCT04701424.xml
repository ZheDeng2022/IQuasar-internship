  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and utility of fully&#xD;
      automated closed-loop glucose control in the home setting over an 8 week period in adults&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study builds on previous and on-going studies of closed-loop&#xD;
      systems that have been performed in Cambridge in adults with type 1 diabetes in the home&#xD;
      setting, and in adults with type 2 diabetes in the inpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, single centre, randomised, cross-over study, involving two home study&#xD;
      periods during which glucose levels will be controlled either by a fully automated&#xD;
      closed-loop system or by participants' usual insulin therapy in random order. Each treatment&#xD;
      arm is 8 weeks long with a 2-4 week washout period between treatments. A total of up to 30&#xD;
      participants with T2D will be recruited through outpatient clinics to allow for 24 completed&#xD;
      participants available for assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive appropriate training by the research team on the safe use of the&#xD;
      study devices (insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and closed-loop insulin&#xD;
      delivery system). Participants in the control arm will continue with standard therapy and&#xD;
      will wear a blinded CGM system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is time spent with glucose levels in the target range between 3.9 and&#xD;
      10.0 mmol/L as recorded by CGM. Secondary outcomes are the time spent with glucose levels&#xD;
      above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other CGM-based metrics in addition to&#xD;
      insulin requirements. Safety evaluation comprises the tabulation of severe hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
