  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective biomarker of allergic rhinitis severity is necessary for monitoring disease&#xD;
      severity and response to treatment in clinical setting and for research. We believe that&#xD;
      psychological factors are the missing link between patient-perceived severity of allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis and objective biomarkers. In our pilot study, several psychological factors were&#xD;
      studied in relation to patient reported outcomes for severity of allergic rhinitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monitoring allergic rhinitis (AR) severity with objective biomarkers is important for the&#xD;
      clinical management of patients as well as for research purposes. The most commonly used tool&#xD;
      for the assessment of AR severity is the Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS). Objective&#xD;
      biomarkers like skin prick test size or specific IgE levels don't correlate with TNSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We studied skin prick test size and specific IgE and several patient reported outcomes&#xD;
      including symptom score, medication scores, combined score and Juniper mini rhinitis quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaire (RQLQ). Psychometric evaluation was performed using 5 different&#xD;
      psychological questionnaires that measure 13 different psychological factors.&#xD;
