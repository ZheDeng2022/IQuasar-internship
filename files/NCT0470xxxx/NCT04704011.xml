    <description>-Patients will receive a phone call from a research team member 2-4 weeks before their colposcopy appointment. The team member will remind the patient of the date and time of their appointment and conduct a basic needs assessment. Those who have at least one unmet basic need or are unsure of their current needs will be referred to the 24-hr assistance hotline, 2-1-1 United Healthy Way Missouri. After the date of their appointment, patients will be contacted to ask whether they contacted 2-1-1 and used any recommended services.</description>

    <description>Study participants will be asked to rate the amount of distress that they have experienced in the past week (scale of 0 to 10, 10=extreme distress) and indicate areas of concern including practical basic needs and family, emotional, spiritual, and physical problems. They will also be asked to rate the amount of distress (scale 0-10) that they attribute to their abnormal cervical cancer screen.</description>

    <description>This brief, 5-minute survey will be performed either in person or by phone after the participants arrive to their colposcopy appointment or after 6 weeks of their scheduled visit if they are nonadherent. The research team will ask patients regarding any changes in the status of their unmet basic needs (resolved, improved, worsened, or stayed the same) and how useful they found the 2-1-1 resource.</description>
