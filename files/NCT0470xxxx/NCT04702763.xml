      This study aims to compare measurements obtained through the e-VOG application (mobile&#xD;
      application, usable on mobile phones or tablets, to measure eye movements) with measurements&#xD;
      from the standard video-oculography device (Eye-Tracker®T2), in patient with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on literature, investigators hypothesize that it would be relevant to focus more&#xD;
      broadly on subclinical abnormalities of oculomotricity in multiple sclerosis (MS). However,&#xD;
      the difficulty of accessing video-oculography platforms (or eye-tracking devices) is probably&#xD;
      one of the main limitations to performing this type of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To respond this problem, the &quot;Resources and Skills Center-Multiple Sclerosis&quot; (CRC SEP) team&#xD;
      at the Nice University Hospital Center (France) has developed a mobile application (named&#xD;
      e-VOG), usable on mobile phones or tablets, to measure eye movements. e-VOG reproduces the&#xD;
      classic paradigms of video-oculography to collect data similar to standard video-oculography&#xD;
      recording (saccade latency and speed, anti-saccade error rate, presence of fixation&#xD;
      abnormalities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-VOG will not replace standard video-oculography platforms, because its technical&#xD;
      characteristics are not as high. But investigators hypothesize that this application could&#xD;
      constitute a screening tool for subclinical oculomotor abnormalities, usable by neurologists&#xD;
      in consultation, directly on their mobile, which would make it possible to select a smaller&#xD;
      population of patients in whom a further exploration by standard video-oculography would be&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory Center of the Rainier III Gerontologic Center (Princess Grace Hospital - Monaco) is&#xD;
      equipped with a standard video-oculography device, also named eye-tracking device&#xD;
      (Eye-Tracker®T2), which records eye movements at a high frequency and measures saccades&#xD;
      parameters (latency, speed, amplitudes etc...).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a collaborative study between the Center Rainier III team and the CRC SEP team&#xD;
      in Nice. Its objective will be to compare measurements obtained through the e-VOG application&#xD;
      with measurements from the standard video-oculography device.&#xD;

        Participants will be recruited from patients with MS for whom a standard video-oculography&#xD;
        exam is prescribed by the CRC SEP of the CHU de Nice (France) as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Standard video-oculography exam is carried out at the Center Rainier III (Princess Grace&#xD;
        Hospital - Monaco), in accordance with usual practices. It is used at the Centre Rainier&#xD;
        III since August 2014. It is a non-invasive device for eye movements recording, allowing&#xD;
        doctors and researchers to measure standard parameters related to eye movements. Developed&#xD;
        by the Eye Brain Company (France), this is a Class IIa medical device, CE marking,&#xD;
        according to Annexe IX of the directive 93/42/CE&#xD;
