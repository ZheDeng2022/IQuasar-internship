  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SMART is a program for adult individuals with sub-optimally controlled epilepsy. It involves&#xD;
      educational and behavioral interventions intended to enhance epilepsy self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial group session is in-person where individuals receive curriculum materials and&#xD;
      learn to utilize the Web format (such as Adobe Connect or ZOOM) and a teleconferencing&#xD;
      service needed to access the remainder of the group sessions. These sessions are held over an&#xD;
      8 week time period and are co-lead by a trained nurse educator and a trained peer educator.&#xD;
      The peer educator is someone with epilepsy and a history of NHEs. Educators use a written&#xD;
      curriculum delivered online, and the interactive sessions last 60-90 minutes. Groups are&#xD;
      limited to about 6 -12 adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the group sessions are done, individuals have 8 telephone maintenance sessions with the&#xD;
      nurse educator and the peer educator spaced approximately 2 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMART is intended for adults with epilepsy, especially those who belong to disadvantaged sub&#xD;
      groups such as rural populations, veterans with epilepsy and those who are underinsured.&#xD;
      People with epilepsy who belong to disadvantaged sub-groups are more likely to have poor&#xD;
      outcomes and often end up using expensive crisis-oriented care, and thus potentially might&#xD;
      benefit the most from self-management programs if they can be actively engaged.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In spite of advances in biological therapies, many people with epilepsy have poor outcomes&#xD;
      including negative health events (NHEs), such as frequent seizures, accidents, and emergency&#xD;
      department visits, and low quality of life. Risk factors for poorly controlled epilepsy&#xD;
      include limited social supports, poor medication adherence, and comorbidities like mental&#xD;
      illnesses. People with epilepsy who live in rural or under-served communities face additional&#xD;
      challenges such as social isolation, limited access to care, and low levels of epilepsy&#xD;
      awareness. The Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network has been a national leader in developing,&#xD;
      testing and disseminating evidence-based epilepsy self-management programs. One of these,&#xD;
      Self-management for people with epilepsy and a history of negative health events (SMART), is&#xD;
      a remotely-delivered group-format program that has been demonstrated to reduce NHEs and&#xD;
      improve quality of life and physical and mental health functioning in individuals with&#xD;
      epilepsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 5-year prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), written in response to Special&#xD;
      Interest Project (SIP) 19-003 Managing Epilepsy Well (MEW) Network 2.0 Collaborating Center,&#xD;
      will investigate the effects of the SMART program among people with epilepsy who have had&#xD;
      recent NHEs vs. a 6-month wait-list control. Phase 1 is intended to set the stage for a&#xD;
      successful RCT that will inform future dissemination and implementation efforts should RCT&#xD;
      findings be positive. Qualitative evaluation of barriers and facilitators to participation in&#xD;
      a self-management program as well as input from informed and committed local stakeholders&#xD;
      will help develop a robust recruitment strategy and set of practices that will maximize&#xD;
      engagement and retention. Phase 2, the RCT will be conducted in Iowa, led by a team from the&#xD;
      University of Iowa, in Iowa City, Iowa in collaboration with local and regional epilepsy care&#xD;
      stakeholders and partners. This new partnership will substantially strengthen representation&#xD;
      of the U.S. &quot;heartland&quot;/Midwestern states in the MEW Network, increasing overall&#xD;
      generalizability of MEW Network programs. Key foci of the study are to replicate the efficacy&#xD;
      findings of the original SMART study and to obtain new information on how SMART is perceived&#xD;
      among people with epilepsy, their families, clinicians and other stakeholders in rural and&#xD;
      underserved communities. We hypothesize that at 6-month follow-up, SMART will be associated&#xD;
      with a reduction in NHEs compared to wait-list control. We also expect that SMART will be&#xD;
      associated with improved quality of life and functioning, and reduced depression, with&#xD;
      improvement maintained at 18-month follow-up. An additional component of the proposed project&#xD;
      is the continued development of the MEW database to supplement site-specific data and provide&#xD;
      a source for secondary analyses including identification of patient-level and other factors&#xD;
      that may identify individuals who may have difficulty engaging in and sustaining&#xD;
      participation in evidence-based epilepsy self-management programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Iowa will serve as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Record over one&#xD;
      relying site, Case Western Reserve University (CWRU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 is intended to set the stage for a successful RCT that will inform future&#xD;
      dissemination and implementation efforts should RCT findings be positive. Qualitative&#xD;
      evaluation of barriers and facilitators to participation in a self-management program as well&#xD;
      as input from informed and committed local stakeholders will help develop a robust&#xD;
      recruitment strategy and set of practices that will maximize engagement and retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-3 focus groups comprised of people with epilepsy and their family members from rural&#xD;
      communities in Iowa will be convened to collect information on perceived barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators to participation in an epilepsy self-management program. We will also conduct&#xD;
      2-3 focus groups comprised of rural health providers, social services agency&#xD;
      administrators/staff or other professionals working in rural health. Focus groups will last&#xD;
      60-90 minutes in duration and will use a semi-structured interview guide adapted from&#xD;
      previous studies in self-management of neurological conditions conducted by the CWRU&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Building upon strong existing partnerships between members of the study team and&#xD;
      epilepsy/neurological care partners across the states of Iowa and of Ohio, the study team&#xD;
      will obtain input from relevant community stakeholders to develop an a priori recruitment and&#xD;
      retention strategy intended to maximize enrollment of typically hard-to-reach individuals&#xD;
      with epilepsy from underserved and rural communities. There will be 3 video-conference calls&#xD;
      (using Zoom) prior to the RCT. Zoom is a cloud-based technology that offers a full spectrum&#xD;
      of conferencing tools. Zoom allows the meeting organizer full control of the meeting such as&#xD;
      muting all microphones and controlling attendees' presentation access. Attendees can&#xD;
      virtually raise their hand allowing the session leader/instructor greater control over the&#xD;
      collaborative classroom setting by ensuring thoughts and opinions are shared in turn. Zoom&#xD;
      also includes a chat utility that can be used to communicate directly with the session&#xD;
      leader/instructor or with other attendees. Given the additional features of Zoom, including&#xD;
      the ability to have individual meeting links, breakout sessions, and phone conference&#xD;
      bridges, this tool would be better suited to our needs than Skype Business.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first call, community advisory board (CAB) members (from both Iowa and Ohio) will&#xD;
      review the SMART curriculum and identify potential barriers to recruitment and retention. In&#xD;
      the 2nd meeting, CAB members will review the list of barriers and suggest solutions and&#xD;
      strategies for reaching people with epilepsy who may not be initially help-seeking and&#xD;
      discuss potential methods of retaining these individuals in the program once they are&#xD;
      recruited. In the 3rd CAB meeting, the list of strategies will be finalized and the&#xD;
      investigators will obtain input on how these strategies might be best operationalized. CAB&#xD;
      meetings will be audio recorded and assessed qualitatively as a complement to the focus group&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SMART will consist of 8 group-format, 45-60 minute sessions (up to 10 participants per&#xD;
      group), which will be collaboratively delivered by a Nurse Educator and a Peer Educator. The&#xD;
      intervention will be delivered in a web-based format using a secure web teleconferencing&#xD;
      system (such as Zoom) that will allow us to set up a virtual meeting room. Participants will&#xD;
      be able to log on and interact via audio and/or video. Telephone call-in will be available&#xD;
      for those who do not have internet access. Supplemental printed materials, providing the same&#xD;
      information as provided on the web site, will be sent out in advance to the individuals who&#xD;
      do not have internet access. Research staff will be available to help manage any difficulties&#xD;
      that participants may have in accessing the sessions via web or telephone. Following the&#xD;
      group-session series, participants will have 3 monthly telephone maintenance sessions lasting&#xD;
      around 15 minutes. Maintenance session web/telephone calls will be made to study participants&#xD;
      by a Nurse Educator with experience in epilepsy and/or chronic health condition management.&#xD;
      Participants in both study arms will be followed for an additional 12 months after the&#xD;
      completion of the primary comparative trial, for a total of 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waitlist (WL) Control: Individuals randomized to WL at the conclusion of their baseline&#xD;
      assessment will continue in their usual care. After they complete their 13-week and 6-month&#xD;
      assessments, which are identical to the SMART group assessment, WL individuals will begin&#xD;
      participating in the SMART intervention for the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer Educators: The PIs and the Nurse Educators will train up to 8 Peer Educators in two&#xD;
      half-day sessions. The Peer Educators will be provided with a semi-structured &quot;introduction&quot;&#xD;
      session to identify themselves and to get a chance to know each other a little better. The PI&#xD;
      will then describe the study and the SMART intervention, reviewing each session individually.&#xD;
      Each Peer Educator will receive a binder including all the materials to keep and review as&#xD;
      convenient. In addition to going over each SMART session, the training will include self-care&#xD;
      topics, communication skills, group leading/co-leading, and assistance with help-seeking&#xD;
      pathways. This will involve role-play and repetition as needed depending on the materials and&#xD;
      Peer Educator comfort/knowledge. Some of the Peer Educators from the previous SMART efficacy&#xD;
      trial will be invited to serve as Peer Educators for this SMART trial in order to further&#xD;
      increase overall group comfort and support among new Peer Educators. Since approximately&#xD;
      16-20 &quot;waves&quot; or &quot;cohorts&quot; of SMART groups (8-10 participants/group) will be conducted during&#xD;
      the proposed study it is expected that each of the 8 Peer Educators will run at least 2 waves&#xD;
      or cohorts, and some Peer Educators will run 3 or more waves or cohorts. The decision on&#xD;
      which Peer Educator will lead a given cohort (with the Study Nurse Educator who will co-lead&#xD;
      all sessions) will be made by consensus within the group de-briefing sessions.&#xD;
