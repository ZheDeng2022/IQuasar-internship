  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of a digital application (app), BNT001, on&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral stress management in patients with stage I-III breast or lung cancer.&#xD;
      The app is designed for cancer patients to treat anxiety and depressive symptoms related to&#xD;
      their cancer diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to develop and refine procedures for&#xD;
      eligibility screening, suicide risk assessment, and delivery of the app prior to the launch&#xD;
      of a phase III randomized trial. The impact of the app in managing stress and improving&#xD;
      quality of life and mood is a secondary aim.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the feasibility of implementing and evaluating a digital cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
      stress management (CBSM) device, BNT001, in stage I-III breast or stage I-III non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer currently undergoing treatment or recently completed treatment (&lt; 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect preliminary data regarding the efficacy of the intervention with regard to&#xD;
      improvements in patients' reported symptoms of distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate patient safety and risks associated with screening procedures (severe anxiety&#xD;
      or depression) as well as during receipt of the digital intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to participating in the study patients complete an online baseline questionnaire to&#xD;
      assess anxiety and depression and general quality of life, as well as some specific questions&#xD;
      related to their coping. They are also interviewed by a clinician who rates their level of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression. After this, patients use the BNT001 app and undergo 10 sessions of&#xD;
      CBSM over 45-60 minutes each consisting of cancer-specific educational videos, guided&#xD;
      relaxation training, interactive exercises, and discussion modules. Following completion of&#xD;
      the 5th session, patients undergo a telephone check-in assessment to see how things are&#xD;
      going, update their treatments and medications, and schedule a phone call to assess for&#xD;
      adverse events. At the end of the 10th session, patients complete a post-treatment online&#xD;
      questionnaire and a phone debriefing interview to discuss their experience with the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated by the rate of recruitment, total number of screens and number of screen fails, treatment adherence (as measured on the backend based on time and regularity of engaging with the digital platform), and number of study completers versus enrolled. The analytic strategy will be primarily descriptive and qualitative. Will also obtain qualitative feedback on participation in the study and study intervention through the end of study de-briefing interview.</description>
