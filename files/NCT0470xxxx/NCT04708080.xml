  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elderly patients have a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality due to the interaction of&#xD;
      various factors such as decreased physiological reserves, concomitant comorbidities, multiple&#xD;
      drug use, cognitive dysfunction, and frailty. Surgical stress, pain and associated lung&#xD;
      complications are common problems in open heart surgeries that can affect morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. With a good postoperative pain control and improved respiratory mechanics,&#xD;
      complications that may develop in patients can be significantly prevented, and the hospital&#xD;
      cost can be reduced and the workforce loss of patients can be reduced by reducing the length&#xD;
      of hospital stay in the intensive care unit. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is an&#xD;
      anesthetic analgesia method that has positive effects on many organ systems as well as&#xD;
      providing good pain control and is frequently used in open heart surgery. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the effects of TEA on postoperative respiratory mechanics in&#xD;
      geriatric patients, based on analgesia levels, extubation times, length of stay in intensive&#xD;
      care, arterial blood gases, morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      It has been shown that stress response suppression by providing good analgesia with local or&#xD;
      systemic methods in the postoperative period reduces mortality and morbidity in many types of&#xD;
      surgery. Especially the physiological changes that occur with aging, comorbid diseases and&#xD;
      the drugs used in the treatment of these diseases, the type of surgery performed, the&#xD;
      postoperative pain treatment and the anesthesia method chosen affect mortality and morbidity&#xD;
      Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) has provided similar benefits in open heart surgery by&#xD;
      suppressing stress response and increasing functional residual capacity with positive effects&#xD;
      on the diaphragm, as well as providing good analgesia with thoracic sympathetic block.TEA has&#xD;
      positive effects on postoperative pulmonary and circulatory system in selected eligible&#xD;
      patients; It allows earlier extubation and provides excellent analgesia. It has been reported&#xD;
      that TEA combined with general anesthesia in elective cardiac surgery offers a significant&#xD;
      advantage compared to general anesthesia in terms of intensive care and hospital stay,&#xD;
      improvement or morbidity. Studies have shown that TEA reduces surgical stress response,&#xD;
      improves hemodynamic stability, and reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia after&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) as well as supraventricular arrhythmias in the&#xD;
      postoperative period .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these studies, the investigators determined the effects of TEA combined with general&#xD;
      anesthesia on postoperative respiratory mechanics, analgesia levels, extubation times, length&#xD;
      of stay in intensive care, arterial blood gases, effects on organ functions, morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in geriatric patients with open heart surgery in our hospital. the investigators&#xD;
      aimed to contribute to the literature by reviewing it retrospectively.&#xD;

    <description>A thoracic epidural catheter is routinely placed in patients undergoing open heart surgery in our hospital, at least 1 hour before heparin administration during the operation. After standard monitoring (ECG, SpO2, NIBP) is applied to the patients in the operating room, sedoanalgesia is provided with 1-3mg of midazolam and 50-100mcg of fentanyl. Then, by providing sterilization conditions, an epidural catheter is inserted through the T5-T6 interval with Tuohy needle. After confirming the location of the epidural catheter, 25mg / 10ml bupivacaine is administered as a bolus and then 3ml / hour bupivacaine infusion is started from the solution prepared as 3mg / ml and continues until the 48th postoperative hour. On the postoperative 2nd day, the catheter is removed 10-12 hours after LMWH administration and 2-4 hours after UFH, as recommended by the guidelines, paying attention to the anticoagulant administration times applied to the patients.</description>
