      The purpose of this prospective crossover study is to determine if noninferiority exists in&#xD;
      the use of the Thermazone cryotherapy machine when compared to Breg Polarcare, the current&#xD;
      standard-of-care cryotherapy machine, for control of pain and reduction in postoperative&#xD;
      narcotic medication consumption following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators propose to test the hypothesis that in adults having&#xD;
      arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs, the Thermazone device is non-inferior to Breg Polarcare on&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid use over the initial 8 postoperative days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryotherapy has traditionally been used for the acute treatment of musculoskeletal injuries&#xD;
      and following operative procedures. Cryotherapy currently represents the standard of care&#xD;
      following common orthopaedic procedures to the knee and shoulder. In addition to relieving&#xD;
      pain and swelling during the acute inflammatory period following surgery, cryotherapy has&#xD;
      also been shown to reduce muscle spasms, promoting quicker functional recovery, accelerating&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation and return to regular activities. Multiple investigations have&#xD;
      demonstrated the benefit of cryotherapy following both shoulder and knee surgeries when&#xD;
      compared to ice alone or no cryotherapy, however conflicting data prevents consensual&#xD;
      agreement regarding the success of cryotherapy when compared to other post-operative pain&#xD;
      control modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of cryotherapy has been extensively studied in the shoulder following operative&#xD;
      procedures. Kraeutler et al. compared compressive cryotherapy versus ice alone, reporting no&#xD;
      reduction in pain between the two modalities following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair or&#xD;
      subacromial decompression. Singh et al. reported in their randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      patients undergoing arthroscopic procedures to the shoulder reported lower pain intensity on&#xD;
      Days 1, 14 and 21 with the use of cryotherapy compared to patients in the non-cryotherapy&#xD;
      group. Meanwhile, Speer et al. found in their prospective study that use of cryotherapy in&#xD;
      the post-operative period was associated with reduced pain and swelling, decreased opioid use&#xD;
      and better sleep quality following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similar results have been reported in patients treated with cryotherapy following anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament reconstruction. Seacrist et al. performed a systematic review, identifying&#xD;
      10 randomized controlled trials investigating the effects of cryotherapy/compression on pain&#xD;
      management following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Cryotherapy was found to&#xD;
      improve analgesia compared to patients treated without cryotherapy in 4 trials, while in 4&#xD;
      trials ice water and water at room temperature provided equivalent analgesic effects. Raynor&#xD;
      et al. found in their meta-analysis that cryotherapy following anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction significantly improved post-operative pain control, while no improvements in&#xD;
      postoperative range of motion or drainage were appreciated. Meanwhile, a combined&#xD;
      cryotherapy-compression device was found to result in a significantly higher percentage of&#xD;
      patients discontinuing narcotics 6 weeks post-operatively with a significantly greater&#xD;
      decrease in VAS scores from pre-operative levels at 2 and 6 weeks post-operatively when&#xD;
      compared to ice packs alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse reactions to cryotherapy including frostbite, cutaneous necrosis and neuropathy are&#xD;
      rare, but have been reported, necessitating the need for appropriate use guidelines,&#xD;
      recognition and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, despite multiple studies examining the post-operative impact of cryotherapy&#xD;
      following shoulder and knee procedures, no definitive conclusions on the effectiveness of&#xD;
      cryotherapy on outcomes related to the use of post-operative analgesic medication, pain&#xD;
      control, functional outcomes and range of motion have been determined. The conflicting&#xD;
      reports regarding the benefit of cryotherapy may be related to the failure to achieve&#xD;
      required decreases in intra-articular temperatures. Additional investigations are needed to&#xD;
      better understand the impact of cryotherapy following arthroscopic rotator cuff, shoulder&#xD;
      labral repair, anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and meniscal repair/resection&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breg polarcare is a commonly used cryotherapy device that has a variety of clinical&#xD;
      applications. The polarcare device requires ice and water, which is then circulated through a&#xD;
      pad which the patient applies directly to the affected area. The Thermazone device does not&#xD;
      require the use of ice and allows for osscilation between hot and cold temperatures.&#xD;
      Currently, both cryotherapy devices are approved for use following surgery. However, no study&#xD;
      to date has compared the Breg polarcare and thermazone devices in the context of arthroscopic&#xD;
      rotator cuff surgery.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators propose a randomized crossover trial involving the use cryotherapy machines as a means of pain control following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery. Patients will be randomized into receiving one of two possible cryotherapy devices immediately after surgery: Breg Polarcare or Thermazone. Randomization will occur with the use of a randomization excel spreadsheet. On post-operative day 3, patients who were originally randomized to Breg will then use Thermazone and patients who were randomized to Thermazone will use Breg for post-operative days 3 and 4. Both groups will alternate between both cryotherapy devices every two days post-operatively for 8 days total. Both groups will maintain a pain journal during the 8 study days post-operatively to document VAS scores, number of narcotic pain medications taken, and any adverse reactions from the cryotherapy devices. At 2 and 6-weeks follow-up, both groups will complete a functional evaluation.</intervention_model_description>
