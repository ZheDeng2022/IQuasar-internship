  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For decades, deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapies have been employed very successfully to&#xD;
      alleviate segmental motor symptoms (tremor, brady-kinesia or rigidity) in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease (PD). Unfortunately these therapies often fail to alleviate, or can even&#xD;
      aggravate, axial deficits such gait and balance disorders. This is presumably due to the&#xD;
      divergence in the dynamics of the circuits that control leg function, which are not well&#xD;
      addressed with commonly employed stimulation protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, patients still endure life-long debilitating gait difficulties that severely affect&#xD;
      their everyday mobility, independence and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, a handful of studies have proposed new paradigms, for instance using&#xD;
      different stimulation parameters that are thought to be better suited for targeting the&#xD;
      circuits that control lower limb function. Although promising, the resulting observations&#xD;
      have been far from conclusive. As a result, the relevant approaches for therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention remain unclear, and the underlying mechanisms largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances on the use of implantable neuromodulation devices and of tech-nologies for&#xD;
      monitoring whole-body movement currently allow to study locomotor deficits in ecological&#xD;
      environments, enabling the recording and modulation of motor and neural signals while&#xD;
      patients perform activities of daily living, chronically, wirelessly and in real time.&#xD;

      This project seeks to leverage the latest technological innovations for monitoring and&#xD;
      modulating motor and neural states chronically, in order to comprehensively characterize gait&#xD;
      deficits in PD, and to clarify the improvements ushered in by varying DBS parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The resulting observations will establish a rigorous understanding that will open new avenues&#xD;
      for the design of evidence-based, clinically-relevant DBS strategies for locomotor deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advances on the use of neural implants for electrical neuromodulation of deep brain&#xD;
      structures are opening the unique opportunity to probing the function of dysfunctional&#xD;
      circuits in patients suffering from a variety of neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, acute experiments using deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants, either in&#xD;
      intra-operative setups or shortly after surgery during so-called &quot;externalization&quot; phases,&#xD;
      have widened our understan-ding of the neural signatures that underlie various motor and&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms, and helped optimi-ze therapeutical parameters to better address such&#xD;
      impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For instance, DBS therapies in Parkinson's disease (PD) have been refined over the past&#xD;
      decades based on experiments that synergistically (i) explored and uncovered readouts of&#xD;
      movement perfor-mance in response to changing stimulation parameters, (ii) identified the&#xD;
      underlying neural biomar-kers from recordings of local field potentials, and even (iii)&#xD;
      tested closed-loop strategies able to adapt in real-time to ongoing patient-specific&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These advances have mostly been applied to (and been successful for) improving motor signs of&#xD;
      the upper-limb such as tremor, bradykinesia or rigidity, which exhibit fast dynamical&#xD;
      responses to changes in neuromodulation (in the range of minutes), and which can be studied&#xD;
      in the context of simple motor tasks using tethered technologies while patients are safely&#xD;
      sitting or lying. These conditions have made it possible to tweak, tune and optimize&#xD;
      parameters based on simple easily measurable readouts of motor dysfunction, and to record&#xD;
      neural signals with minimal movement-related artefacts in the meantime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, these straightforward experimental conditions do not apply to the study of&#xD;
      axial motor signs, such as locomotion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First, gait deficits are multi-faceted and high dimensional: Impairments are not merely&#xD;
           restricted to leg movements, but also critically affect lower- and upper-limb&#xD;
           coordination, trunk and pelvis oscillations, posture and balance. Their characterization&#xD;
           thus requires of multi-modal sensing technologies and analytical methods able to capture&#xD;
           all these aspects concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second, the emergence of key deficits (e.g. freezing of gait) necessitates of&#xD;
           behavioural tasks that are more physically demanding and potentially risky, often&#xD;
           involving multiple repetitions of back-and-forth stepping over longer distances or in&#xD;
           environments that resemble everyday life activities. Patients thus need to be in a&#xD;
           stable medical condition, and technologies must allow recordings of motor and neural&#xD;
           states to be performed wirelessly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, the modulation of neural circuits controlling gait have considerably slower&#xD;
           dynamics in response to changes in DBS (up to several hours10) than those controlling&#xD;
           upper limb function, hence imposing that monitoring and tuning protocols are stretched&#xD;
           in time to appropriately capture such changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These requirements critically put forward the need to study and devise novel therapies for&#xD;
      gait deficits in the chronic state, using multi-modal technologies that can concurrently&#xD;
      record neural and motor states remotely, in real-time and for long periods of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project seeks to leverage the latest technological innovations for monitoring and&#xD;
      modulating motor and neural states chronically, in order to comprehensively characterize gait&#xD;
      deficits in PD while patients execute a range of activities of daily living, and to clarify&#xD;
      the improvements brought in by varying DBS parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In past years, a handful of studies have proposed new stimulation paradigms aimed to better&#xD;
      target the neural circuits that control lower limb function during gait11. For instance&#xD;
      strategies sought to combine varying DBS frequencies, or to target additional anatomical&#xD;
      targets. They all highlighted promising, yet far-from-conclusive results. To date, the&#xD;
      relevant approaches for therapeutic intervention remain unclear, and the underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms largely unknown. Patients still endure life-long, debilitating gait difficulties&#xD;
      that severely affect their everyday mobility and independence: they often feel insecure about&#xD;
      leaving their homes due to the high risk of fall-related injuries, require personal&#xD;
      assistance, and in general see their quality of life significantly diminished.&#xD;
