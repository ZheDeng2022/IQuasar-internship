        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed, metastatic non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
             whom:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Have already received standard-of-care tissue genotyping using Next Generation&#xD;
                  Sequencing (NGS) for lung cancer at clinician's discretion, including at least&#xD;
                  EGFR, ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK fusions, MET, BRAF, HER2 and KRAS, in the last 90&#xD;
                  (ninety) calendar days of enrollment or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Are scheduled to receive standard-of-care tissue genotyping using Next Generation&#xD;
                  Sequencing (NGS) for lung cancer at clinician's discretion, including at least&#xD;
                  EGFR, ALK, RET, ROS1, NTRK fusions, MET, BRAF, HER2 and KRAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Tissue genotyping is to be performed by Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) either&#xD;
             in-house (at study site laboratory) or at an outside CAP-accredited laboratory by&#xD;
             sending out tissue for analysis. Tissue CGP must be performed by Next Generation&#xD;
             Sequencing (NGS). Other genomic platforms and methodologies for tissue genomic&#xD;
             profiling, such as PCR, FISH or IHC are not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Eligible subjects whose physician intends to order tissue for genotyping at study&#xD;
             enrollment, but there is insufficient material for analysis are still eligible for&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with no previous surgical treatment, such as cancer resection, except&#xD;
             patients with previously resected early stage NSCLC (stage I-IIIA), now with recurrent&#xD;
             and metastatic disease, if tissue from a site of metastatic disease has been obtained&#xD;
             within a 90 (ninety) calendar-day window of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment naïve patients for metastatic disease, i.e., no previous systemic therapy&#xD;
             such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy or immunotherapy for metastatic disease.&#xD;
             Adjuvant therapy is allowable for eligible patients who have received prior adjuvant&#xD;
             molecularly targeted therapy and they have completed this therapy at least 6 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with previously treated localized NSCLC (stage I-IIIA) are eligible if&#xD;
             primary surgical resection and/or radiation treatment was completed at least 6 months&#xD;
             prior to the development of metastatic disease and adjuvant chemotherapy, or targeted&#xD;
             therapy completed at least 6 weeks prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No past history of any histologically confirmed malignant invasive neoplasm (excluding&#xD;
             the current diagnosis of lung cancer and any non-melanoma skin cancer that was treated&#xD;
             surgically with curative intent) in the last 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Ability to understand a written informed consent and willingness to sign it.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ≥ 21 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who are unwilling to follow-up for evaluation of response to therapy&#xD;
