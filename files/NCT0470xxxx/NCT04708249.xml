  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      D-chiroinositol (DCI), is known as second messenger of insulin pathway, but recently several&#xD;
      works have reported the influence of DCI on steroidogenesis. In particular, the DCI&#xD;
      capabilities to regulate aromatase expression and testosterone biosynthesis are arising. In&#xD;
      this regard, DCI administration in case of reduced levels of testosterone, could be a good&#xD;
      therapeutic opportunity. For this reason, the treatment of Late-Onset Male Hypogonadism (LOH)&#xD;
      in undoubtedly an interesting target. LOH is a reduction of testosterone level due to&#xD;
      advancing age, currently treated with Testosterone Replacement Therapy (TRT). Unfortunately,&#xD;
      there is a lack of information about TRT safety, especially in older men. For these reasons,&#xD;
      the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of DCI treatment on testosterone accumulation&#xD;
      in LOH patient.&#xD;
