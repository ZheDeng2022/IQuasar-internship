  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium (POD) is the most common adverse neurologic complication that can&#xD;
      occur in patients of any age. Its incidence varies across age groups and is substantially&#xD;
      influenced by patient-related risk factors. POD occurs in 17%-61% of major surgical&#xD;
      procedures. Several risk factors which contribute to the development of POD include age more&#xD;
      than 60 years, pre-existing cognitive dysfunction, presence of comorbidities, sensorial&#xD;
      deficits, malnutrition, polypharmacy, impaired physical mobility and frailty. Postoperative&#xD;
      delirium has several wide ranging and adverse outcomes that are consistently associated with&#xD;
      delirium such as mortality, increased length of hospital stay, and increased hospital costs.&#xD;
      A recently devised tool for rapid assessment of delirium is the 4 A's test. It has now been&#xD;
      validated for identifying delirium in the surgical population. The proposed prospective&#xD;
      observational study will be conducted on 150 patients belonging to ASA Physical Status I-III&#xD;
      of either sex, scheduled to undergo non-cardiac surgery under general anaesthesia (GA),&#xD;
      requiring at least 24 hours of postoperative inpatient care. This prospective, observational&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of postoperative delirium in&#xD;
      elderly patients more than 65 years of age undergoing non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postoperative delirium (POD) following major surgery ranges from 17% to&#xD;
      61%.POD is the most frequent neurological complication that can occur in both the young and&#xD;
      old, and its rate is considerably impacted by patient-related risk issues. The elderly&#xD;
      population is believed to be more susceptible to POD, by virtue of being host to conditions&#xD;
      such as a variety of comorbidities, malnutrition, concurrent cognitive dysfunction, frailty,&#xD;
      sensorial and functional deficits, and polypharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors for delirium may be further identified as predisposing factors and precipitating&#xD;
      factors. Predisposing factors are those that are present on admission and are not changeable,&#xD;
      e.g. age, number and severity of co-morbid medical conditions, sensory impairment, history of&#xD;
      cognitive impairment, sleep deprivation, immobility, and dehydration.Precipitating factors&#xD;
      are those that trigger delirium while the patient is hospitalized. These may be infections,&#xD;
      constipation, bladder catheterisation, procedures involving instrumentation, immobility, and&#xD;
      sensory impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative delirium, especially in the elderly, significantly compromises patient recovery&#xD;
      and imposes a heavy toll on patient well-being and the healthcare system. Postoperative&#xD;
      delirium has several wide-ranging and adverse outcomes associated with it, such as mortality,&#xD;
      increased length of hospital stay and increased hospital costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several tools have been developed to track changes in mental status that could point to the&#xD;
      onset of delirium. Among the tools employed for this purpose are the Sedation Scale, the&#xD;
      Nursing-Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC), and the Confusion Assessment Method for the&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of consensus on the use of an appropriate tool to evaluate delirium&#xD;
      in the postoperative period. The 4A's test is a screening instrument that has been designed&#xD;
      for rapid and initial assessment of delirium. It has the added advantage of evaluating not&#xD;
      only delirium but also postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) which is the second most&#xD;
      common complication in elderly surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delirium is a condition that is presumed to be avoidable in 30%-40% of cases which emphasizes&#xD;
      the importance of attention to primary prevention.5 After the onset of delirium, little can&#xD;
      be done to influence its duration, severity, or the possibility of recurrence. Thus, the&#xD;
      necessity for identifying those at risk of developing postoperative delirium. It is&#xD;
      imperative that hospitals should implement multimodal non-pharmacologic delirium prevention&#xD;
      methods to identify and monitor patients at risk of developing this morbid condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been scant research in the developing world, including India in the sphere of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium, a condition germane to practically all medical specialities and&#xD;
      especially in the elderly population. Our study will research POD we expect to obtain&#xD;
      evidence that will find the clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will be focused on evaluating the incidence of POD in the elderly who will be&#xD;
      posted for non-cardiac surgical procedures. We will also assess the association of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium with risk factors such as frailty, cognitive dysfunction, impaired&#xD;
      functional status, presence of comorbidities and polypharmacy. Other postoperative adverse&#xD;
      events such as sedation, pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting will be recorded. Patient's&#xD;
      length of stay in the hospital (LOS), any unanticipated ICU admission and mortality within 30&#xD;
      days will also be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be recorded in all the patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Postoperative delirium: It will be evaluated using 4 A's test, three times in the first&#xD;
           24 hours postoperatively. A score of 0 suggests absence of delirium or severe cognitive&#xD;
           impairment, score 1-3 suggests presence of possible cognitive impairment, and a score &gt;&#xD;
           4 suggests the presence of delirium/ cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Frailty: All eligible patients will be assessed preoperatively using the 9-point CFS.&#xD;
           Score varies from 1-9 with fitness level very fit to terminally ill as depicted in the&#xD;
           table&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cognitive dysfunction: Preoperative cognition will be assessed using the 5-point&#xD;
           Mini-cog test. A score &lt; 4 will be taken as cut-off for impaired cognitive function&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Impaired physical mobility: All preoperative mobile patients will be subjected to Timed&#xD;
           Up and Go (TUG) test. A score of &lt;10 s is normal and score of &lt;20 s need assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Intraoperative hemodynamics (pulse, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure,&#xD;
           and mean arterial blood pressure) will be recorded every 5-minutes intraoperatively and&#xD;
           every 15-minutes postoperatively in the postoperative care unit (PACU) till discharge. A&#xD;
           mean arterial blood pressure &lt;65 mmHg persisting for greater than 5-minutes despite&#xD;
           treatment will be defined as an episode of intraoperative hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Postoperative sedation:Sedation will be assessed postoperatively using the Richmond&#xD;
           Agitation and Sedation Scale. Score varies from +4 to -5 and patient will be categorised&#xD;
           from combative to unarousable as depicted in table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Postoperative pain will be assessed using the 10-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) It will be assessed using 3-point Likert scale&#xD;
           (0- no nausea and vomiting, 1- nausea only, 2- vomiting)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Length of stay in the hospital and any unanticipated ICU admission will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. All patients will be followed up postoperatively for 30-days and any occurrence of&#xD;
           mortality will be noted.&#xD;
