    <textblock>
      Prospective multi-site randomized sham-controlled crossover feasibility study evaluating&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of noninvasive peripheral nerve stimulation (NPNS) for patients&#xD;
      with moderate-severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Response to NPNS investigational&#xD;
      device was compared to sham control in a 2x2 crossover design such that subjects were&#xD;
      assigned to receive 2 weeks of NPNS and 2 weeks of sham, in randomized order.&#xD;
