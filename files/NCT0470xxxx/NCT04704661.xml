    <textblock>
      The dose escalation phase of this trial identifies the best dose and safety of ceralasertib&#xD;
      (AZD6738) when given in combination with trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201a) in treating&#xD;
      patients with solid tumors that have a change (mutation) in the HER2 gene or protein and have&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (advanced). The dose expansion phase (phase Ib) of this&#xD;
      trial compares how colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers with HER2 mutation respond to&#xD;
      treatment with a combination of ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan alone. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked&#xD;
      to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells&#xD;
      in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Ceralasertib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate safety, tolerability and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of trastuzumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan (DS-8201a) in combination with ceralasertib (AZD6738) in advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      with HER2 expression. (Escalation Phase) II. Assess differential pharmacodynamic (PD) profile&#xD;
      of tumor tissue (deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA] damage &amp; repair) between Top1 inhibition and&#xD;
      dual inhibition of Top1 and ATR in patients with colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal&#xD;
      cancer with HER2 expression. (Expansion Phase)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To evaluate pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      DS-8201a and AZD6738 and immunogenicity of DS8201a.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate association between HER2 heterogeneity and response to DS-8201a plus (+) AZD6738&#xD;
      therapy using central protein expression assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine predictive biomarkers (including but not restricted to: HER2 protein levels,&#xD;
      HER2 gene copy number, alterations of TP53, ATM and RAS) of DS-8201a + AZD6738 efficacy in&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors (specifically colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal cancer) with HER2&#xD;
      expression III. To characterize PD biomarkers for efficacy of DS-8201a + AZD6738 efficacy in&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors (specifically colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal cancer) with HER2&#xD;
      expression (such as pRAD50 and SLFN11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To establish a biorepository of tissue, blood and pre-clinical models (PDXs) for HER2&#xD;
      expressing advanced solid tumors (specifically colorectal cancer and gastroesophageal&#xD;
      cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ceralasertib with fixed dose trastuzumab&#xD;
      deruxtecan followed by a dose-expansion study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      ceralasertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. NOTE: During the dose-expansion&#xD;
      phase, the first 6 patients in each disease cohort (gastroesophageal cancer [cohort A] and&#xD;
      colorectal cancer [cohort B]) receive only trastuzumab deruxtecan for the first cycle,&#xD;
      followed by trastuzumab deruxtecan and ceralasertib together in subsequent cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

                       loads were undetectable during this same chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must have an undetectable viral load and a CD4 count &gt;= 250 cells/mcL within&#xD;
                  7 days of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  They must not be currently receiving prophylactic therapy for an opportunistic&#xD;
                  infection and must not have had an opportunistic infection within the past 6&#xD;
                  months. HIV-infected patients should be monitored every 12 weeks for viral load&#xD;
                  and CD4 counts&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients with evidence of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, the HBV viral&#xD;
             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with clinically inactive brain metastases may be included. Subjects with&#xD;
             treated brain metastases that are no longer symptomatic and who require no treatment&#xD;
             with corticosteroids or anticonvulsants may be included in the study if they have&#xD;
             recovered from the acute toxic effect of radiotherapy. A minimum of 2 weeks must have&#xD;
             elapsed between the end of whole-brain radiation therapy and study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with new or progressive brain metastases (active brain metastases) or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease are eligible if the treating physician determines that&#xD;
             immediate central nervous system (CNS) specific treatment is not required and is&#xD;
             unlikely to be required for at least 4 weeks (or scheduled assessment after the first&#xD;
             cycle of treatment), and a risk-benefit analysis (discussion) by the patient and the&#xD;
             investigator favors participation in the clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;
             investigational regimen are eligible for this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents as well as AZD6738 are&#xD;
             known to be teratogenic; thus, women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to&#xD;
             use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)&#xD;
             prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 7&#xD;
             months (women of childbearing potential [WOCBP] only) after the last dose of study&#xD;
             drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 6&#xD;
             months after completion of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a&#xD;
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
             spontaneous amenorrhea (in questionable cases, a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL [&lt; 147 pmol/L]&#xD;
             is confirmatory) are eligible. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods&#xD;
             outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT&#xD;
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4&#xD;
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval&#xD;
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive&#xD;
             method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the&#xD;
             study period, and at least 6 months after the final study drug administration.&#xD;
             Preservation of sperm should be considered prior to enrolment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of&#xD;
             screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after&#xD;
             the final study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;

             starting study treatment is 5 weeks for enzalutamide or phenobarbital and 3 weeks for&#xD;
             other agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a pleural effusion, ascites, or pericardial effusion that requires&#xD;
             drainage, peritoneal shunt, or cell-free and concentrated ascites reinfusion therapy&#xD;
             (CART). (Drainage and CART are not allowed within 2 weeks prior to screening&#xD;
             assessment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord&#xD;
             blood transplantation (dUCBT)&#xD;

             conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to AZD6738&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients cannot be receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine. Patients receiving&#xD;
             these drugs must have a washout period of &gt; 14 days before enrollment/randomization&#xD;
