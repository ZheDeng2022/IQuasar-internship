    <textblock>
      Neurocysticercosis(NCC) is the commonest parasitic infection of the central nervous system.&#xD;
      It is the commonest cause of focal seizures in India. It can also present with headaches,&#xD;
      movement disorders, stroke, cognitive decline and multitude of complications depending on its&#xD;
      location. Parenchymal NCC is more common than extraparenchymal NCC. There is considerable&#xD;
      variation in the treatment practices including administration of anti-helminthic agents and&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Extra-parenchymal NCC is rare and can occur in the subarachnoid space or&#xD;
      intraventricularly. Extra-parenchymal NCC is managed surgically in several instances. There&#xD;
      is scant literature on the long term follow up of this condition. This registry will enable&#xD;
      collection of data on the clinical, laboratory and imaging features, treatment trends and&#xD;
      long term outcomes of both parenchymal and extra-parenchymal neurocysticercosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Neurocysticercosis (NCC) is the commonest parasitic infection of the central nervous system.&#xD;
      It can affect the brain, meninges, eyes as well as other parts of the body. Disseminated&#xD;
      cysticercosis involves brain and one other organ such as muscles, viscera etc. NCC is common&#xD;
      in tropical countries and is the commonest cause of focal seizures. It is quite frequently&#xD;
      also found incidentally in imaging done for unrelated conditions such as headaches and&#xD;
      trauma. NCC can be parenchymal or extra-parenchymal. Parenchymal NCC is commoner than&#xD;
      extra-parenchymal lesions. Some patients with parenchymal NCC have less than three cysts and&#xD;
      they have seizures which are well controlled with medication. On the other hand some have&#xD;
      multiple cysts and present with complications such as stroke, cognitive decline, aphasia,&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, increased intra-cranial pressure etc. Cysts occurring extra-parenchymal&#xD;
      locations such as inside the ventricular system or sub-arachnoid space are less common than&#xD;
      parenchymal ones, but can be more symptomatic due to obstruction in the CSF flow leading to&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, arachnoiditis and impaired CSF absorption etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though NCC is very common in the Indian subcontinent, there is no consensus on optimum&#xD;
      management strategies. There is a wide variation in the practices of prescribing&#xD;
      anti-helminthic drugs, corticosteroids, steroid sparing agents etc. Clinical experience&#xD;
      suggests that some patients with NCC need long term corticosteroids and on withdrawing&#xD;
      corticosteroids, they develop peri-lesional edema and they become symptomatic. In such&#xD;
      patients, steroid sparing agents such as methotrexate are recommended.2 However there is no&#xD;
      data on the long term follow up of such patients especially from India. Similarly, patients&#xD;
      with intraventricular NCC treated surgically are given varying types of anti-helminthic&#xD;
      therapy ranging from none to combination therapy after surgical /endoscopic resection of the&#xD;
      cysts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is high time, that a registry is established and patient data collected systematically, to&#xD;
      enable analysis of clinical features as well as to study the patterns of treatment offered by&#xD;
      individual physicians. This will also promote the development of hypothesis for planning&#xD;
      trials in future.&#xD;
