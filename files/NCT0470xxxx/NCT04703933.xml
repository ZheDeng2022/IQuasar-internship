      This study aims to evaluate the level of knowledge and attitude of the operating room nurses&#xD;
      about radiation exposure.This descriptive study was conducted with 100 nurses working in the&#xD;
      operating room of two university hospitals in Istanbul. Descriptive statistical analyses were&#xD;
      performed using IBM SPSS 23 (Statistical Package for Social Sciences for Windows, Version&#xD;
      23.00, Armork NY).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Operating rooms are dynamic places where advanced technology is used, and teamwork is best&#xD;
      exhibited. Operating room personnel face many biological, physical, and infectious risk&#xD;
      factors. One of these risk factors is ionizing radiation. Radiation in the operating room may&#xD;
      be spread from non-ionizing devices such as portable X-ray devices and lasers, as well as by&#xD;
      radiological methods such as X-ray and fluoroscopy, which have been widely used in recent&#xD;
      years as it shortens the duration of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation is used in many applications in operating rooms and long-term exposure to radiation&#xD;
      may occur. Operation room personnel are affected by radiation in three different ways:&#xD;
      direct, reflection, and leakage. Influence in the form of leakage is associated with the&#xD;
      fluoroscope use and the reflection may occur by transfer from the patient's body or from the&#xD;
      objects in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation can cause serious adverse effects on hematopoietic, immune, reproductive,&#xD;
      circulatory, respiratory, musculoskeletal, endocrine, nervous, digestive, and urinary&#xD;
      systems. The negative effects of radiation exposure are generally defined in two ways. The&#xD;
      first is acutely occurring determinant effects, and the second is later occurring&#xD;
      probabilistic effects. Determinant effects occur as a result of exposure of cells to&#xD;
      radiation, in addition to being directly related to cell death. These effects may result in&#xD;
      infertility, cataract, leukemia, skin burns, and death. Probabilistic effects are associated&#xD;
      with the absorption of radiation accumulated in tissues and may occur even at the lowest&#xD;
      dose. Genetic disorders and cancer formation are some of the consequences of probabilistic&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of protective equipment has a very important role in reducing radiation exposure. The&#xD;
      use of masks ensures protection from respiratory hazards, the use of protective clothing&#xD;
      ensures that the radioactive substance does not damage the skin and hair, and the use of&#xD;
      personal dosimeters ensures the management of the duration of stay in an area with high&#xD;
      radiation levels and the monitoring of accumulated doses. Accordingly, the radiation exposure&#xD;
      of the operating room nurses is very high. Therefore, nurses should have sufficient&#xD;
      information about radiation and protection from radiation. This study was carried out to&#xD;
      evaluate the knowledge level and attitude of operating room nurses about radiation exposure.&#xD;
