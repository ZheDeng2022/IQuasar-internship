  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Study is to find out if Iyengar-Yoga has a rejuvenating effect on women&#xD;
      after menopause. The biofunctional status of the study participants will be assessed before&#xD;
      and after a 12-week yoga program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postmenopausal women qualifying as participants for the study are patients at the&#xD;
      Universitätsklinik für Frauenheilkunde in Bern or are recruited through public advertisement.&#xD;
      After giving informed consent the patients will be screened for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria and their biofunctional Status will be assessed. The participants of the study will&#xD;
      then be randomly assigned to the intervention group (12 week yoga program) or to the control&#xD;
      group. In addition to the 90 minutes yoga sessions instructed by a professional yoga teacher,&#xD;
      the participants of the intervention group are asked to perform two yoga sessions lasting 45&#xD;
      minutes per week at home and document these in a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 12 weeks the biofunctional Status of all participants of the study will be&#xD;
      reassessed.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Decrease of the biofunctional age (BFA) through a 12 week Iyengar yoga intervention compared to the control group with no yoga classes. In order to evaluate the BFA a biofunctional Status (BFS) has to be assessed.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BFS is a generic, age- and sex-specific test battery comprising holistic characteristics from physical, mental-emotional and social areas. The single values of the BFS test battery were scaled and differentiated for chronological age (CA) and sex. Their summation makes up the so-called Bio-functional Age Index BFAI (BFAI = Σ (B-X/B-L)n/n). The BFAI is a relative measure compared to a reference population, out of which norm charts were developed. By definition, the reference population's BFAI is identical with its CA. A BFAI of an individual may be transformed into BFA (years) by means of gerontologic aging tables. This BFA (years) relates to the mean value of a certain CA. The BFA is based on a sex-specific regression and factor analysis of functional age (Mathieu et al., 2018. Illness perception in overweight and obesity and impact on bio-functional age. Archives of gynecology and obstetrics, 298(2), p. 417)</description>
