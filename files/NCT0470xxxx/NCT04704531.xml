    <textblock>
      Phase II, comparative, controlled, multicenter, parallel group, open, randomized clinical&#xD;
      study. The main outcome variable will be the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)&#xD;
      questionnaire. Three dosage schemes of topical ophthalmic application of Multidose Lagricel®&#xD;
      Ofteno (Sodium Hyaluronate 0.4%; preservative free) are to be evaluated in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with mild to severe dry eye. Each group will be exposed to one of the following&#xD;
      administration schemes: 1 drop bis in die (BID), 1 drop quater in die (QID), or 1 drop six&#xD;
      times per day; instillation will take place in both eyes (OU).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (baseline visit) and 31 (+1) (final visit),</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-item questionnaire used to evaluate symptoms associated with dry eye disease, as well as classify their severity. According the obtained score, categories are as follows: normal (0-12 points), mild (13-22 points), moderate (23-32 points), or severe (33-100 points).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 33 (+ 1) (safety call).</time_frame>
    <description>Presence/absence adverse events, defined as the appearance of any unfavorable reaction in a patient participating in a clinical investigation in which any pharmaceutical product is being administered, regardless of the causal attribution.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in tear break-up time (BUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (baseline visit),15 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 (+ 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>After application of fluorescein stain, using a slit lamp and its cobalt blue filter, the time elapsed after instructing the patient to blink 1 or 2 times and the appearance of dry spots on the ocular surface will be counted and reported as BUT. Normally, this parameter is ≥ 10 seconds.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in conjunctival and corneal staining with lissamine green</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (baseline visit),15 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 (+ 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation will take place after applying the lissamine green stain on the ocular surface and evaluating the resulting staining pattern. This will be measured through the Oxford scale which includes 6 grades: Absent (0), Minimal (I), Mild (II), Moderate (III), Marked (IV), Severe (V).</description>

    <measure>Change in incidence of chemosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (baseline visit),15 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 (+ 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>Chemosis will be evaluated as present (if conjunctiva separates from the sclera in ≥ 1/3 of the palpebral opening area or if it exceeds the eyelid's gray line) or absent.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (baseline visit),15 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 (+ 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>With the patient's best possible refractive correction, visual acuity will be evaluated through the Snellen chart. Its notation (fraction or decimal) is described as the distance from the chart at which the test is performed, divided by the distance at which a letter equals vertically 5 minutes of arc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in intraocular Pressure (IOP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (baseline visit),15 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 (+ 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>Measured through Goldman tonometer in milligrams of mercury (mmHg). After instillation of topical anesthetic (tetracaine 0.5%) and fluorescein stain, IOP will be evaluated. Normal values are considered between 10 and 21 mmHg.</description>
