  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stereotactic radiation therapy is an important and common method of treating brain metastases&#xD;
      in patients with malignant disease. Today, however, there are no methods available to&#xD;
      determine the metastasis' radiation sensitivity in advance and treatment responses can only&#xD;
      be seen by changing of the size of the metastasis on conventional X-ray examinations,&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Changes in the size of the&#xD;
      metastases is something that is often seen weeks / months after treatment is completed. At&#xD;
      Lund University Hospital, a new imaging technique, diffusional variance decomposition&#xD;
      (DIVIDE), has now been developed. With this technique, the scatter in isotropic and&#xD;
      anisotropic diffusion can be measured for each measuring point, which provides significantly&#xD;
      more information about the properties of the tissue compared to current methods.&#xD;
