      the aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of instrumented assisted soft tissue&#xD;
      mobilization versus integrated neuromuscular inhibition technique on mechanical non-specific&#xD;
      neck pain&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical neck pain is a prevalent condition in various populations. Neck pain occurrence is&#xD;
      affected by several factors, involving environmental, psychological, and social aspects. Neck&#xD;
      pain represents the fourth major disorder responsible for a person's year lived with&#xD;
      disability and ranked eleventh as disability-adjusted life years of a person. The neck pain&#xD;
      incidence ranges from 10.4 to 23.3% in 1-year time, while the range of prevalence was 0.4 to&#xD;
      86.8%. It has a high prevalence among computer users, office workers, and females, especially&#xD;
      females aged 35 to 49 years old. Myofascial trigger point (MTrP) might play an important role&#xD;
      in the formation of mechanical neck pain and is known as a hyperirritable spot in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle that is accompanied with a hypersensitive palpable nodule in a taut band. IASTM and&#xD;
      integrated play an important role in the treatment of mechanical neck pain.this trial has&#xD;
      three groups; one will receive IASTM+ conventional, the second will receive integrated +&#xD;
      conventional and the third will receive conventional treatment for four week&#xD;

    <description>the patients will receive instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization:The subject was seated in a relaxed sitting position. M2T blade was used to find specific areas of restriction on RT upper trapezius. Then treatment plane 1 - 2 and 3 were used.The lubricant (Vaseline) was applied to the skin around the neck area prior to treatment and the tool was cleaned with an alcohol preparation pad. Then by using M2T blade with angle 45, we were giving long slow strokes without causing any discomfort or pain over muscle starting from its insertion up to its origin approximately for 2 to 3 min repeated two times.</description>
