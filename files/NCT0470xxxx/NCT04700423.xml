    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to provide evidence on the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of co-administered moxidectin and albendazole compared to co-administered ivermectin and&#xD;
      albendazole, and to assess the efficacy of the drug combinations compared to monotherapies in&#xD;
      adolescents aged 12-19 years against infection with T. trichiura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the different treatments will be determined 14-21 days, 5-6 weeks and 3&#xD;
      months post-treatment. Two fecal samples will be collected at each time-point assessment. The&#xD;
      geometric mean based egg reduction rate (ERR) of T. trichiura egg counts will be assessed by&#xD;
      Kato-Katz microscopy pre-treatment and 14-21 days post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted as a school-based study on Pemba Island (Zanzibar, Tanzania).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed a non-inferiority trial to show that co-administered moxidectin and albendazole&#xD;
      is non-inferior compared to co-administered ivermectin and albendazole in adolescents aged&#xD;
      12-19 years on Pemba Island (Tanzania). From previous studies conducted by our group, we&#xD;
      expect similar efficacies from the combination moxidectin/ albendazole compared to&#xD;
      ivermectin/ albendazole. However, moxidectin might be advantageous in terms of the drug's&#xD;
      longer half-life and in areas with possible emerging ivermectin resistance. This study will&#xD;
      allow comparing the efficacy of the two available co-administrations and will provide further&#xD;
      insights on the potential value of moxidectin/ albendazole. Our data will pave the way for&#xD;
      possible large scale, multi country follow-up studies. As recommended for new combination&#xD;
      therapies, we simultaneously assess superiority of the drug combinations compared to&#xD;
      monotherapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to demonstrate that co-administered moxidectin (8 mg) / albendazole&#xD;
      (400 mg) is non-inferior to ivermectin (200 µg/kg) / albendazole (400 mg) in terms of egg&#xD;
      reduction rates (ERRs) against T. trichiura infections assessed by Kato-Katz at 14-21 days&#xD;
      post-treatment in adolescents aged 12-19 years using a non-inferiority margin of 2&#xD;
      percentage-points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy assessments of combination therapies require demonstration of superiority&#xD;
           against the respective monotherapies. Therefore, the trial has five different treatment&#xD;
           groups: moxidectin (8 mg) / albendazole (400 mg) combination, ivermectin (200 µg/kg) /&#xD;
           albendazole (400 mg) combination, albendazole (400 mg) monotherapy, ivermectin (200&#xD;
           µg/kg) monotherapy and moxidectin (8 mg) monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the CRs of the drug regimens against T. trichiura&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to determine the CRs and ERRs of the treatment schemes in study participants infected&#xD;
           with hookworm and A. lumbricoides&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to investigate potential extended effects on follow-up helminth prevalences (5-6 weeks&#xD;
           and 3 months post-treatment) of the treatment regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to assess diagnostic performance and compare CRs based on egg counts retrieved from&#xD;
           novel diagnostic tools (FECPAK-G2 and/or PCR) compared to standard microscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. to characterize population PK parameters, as well as drug-drug interactions of active&#xD;
           study treatments following single and co-administration in T. trichiura infected&#xD;
           adolescents. If a dose-response is observed, a PK/PD analysis will further be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in adolescents aged 12-19 years attending secondary schools on&#xD;
      Pemba Island, Tanzania. After consenting, all participants will be asked to provide two stool&#xD;
      samples (within a maximum of 7 days) at each time-point assesment. From each stool specimen,&#xD;
      duplicate Kato-Katz thick smears (41.7 mg each) will be prepared and read under a microscope&#xD;
      for eggs of T. trichiura, A. lumbricoides and hookworm by experienced technicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After randomization, all eligible adolescents will be treated with the respective single or&#xD;
      combination treatment regimen according to their assigned treatment arm at day 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All drugs will be administered in the presence of the PI and/ co-PI, and ingestion confirmed.&#xD;
      This will be recorded with the time and date of dosing. Participants will be kept for 3 hours&#xD;
      after treatment administration to observe any possible acute AEs and reassessment will be&#xD;
      done at 24h post-treatment. Additionally, interviews will be conducted to determine the&#xD;
      emergence of clinical symptoms such as headache, abdominal pain, itching, nausea, vomiting&#xD;
      and diarrhea directly before treatment within the scope of baseline assessment. At 3 and 24&#xD;
      hours after treatment and retrospectively at days 14 - 21 as well as 5-6 weeks and 3 months&#xD;
      post-treatment, participants will again be interviewed for the assessment of adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egg reduction rate calculated from the geometric means of co-administered moxidectin/&#xD;
      albendazole and ivermectin/ albendazole against T. trichiura assessed at 14-21 days&#xD;
      post-treatment is the primary endpoint in our study.&#xD;
