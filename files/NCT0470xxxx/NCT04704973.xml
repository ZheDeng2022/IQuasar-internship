      The project aims to investigate the effects of a short-term cbt-based psychotherapy&#xD;
      intervention for a diagnostically mixed group of psychiatric inpatients. In a multiple&#xD;
      baseline single subject design, 5-10 patients with mixed diagnoses that are treated at any of&#xD;
      the inpatient units at the Hospital of Västmanland, Västerås, Sweden, will be offered a short&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic intervention. The intervention is cbt based, and consists of focused&#xD;
      functional analysis with identification of the main problem to be treated; an experiential&#xD;
      exercise called the life line, in which obstacles to living a valued life are investigated,&#xD;
      and in which alternative steps to be taken in spite of psychiatric symptoms are formulated; a&#xD;
      summary excercise called the pause, in which central principles of the treatment are&#xD;
      repeated, and in which a relapse prevention plan is formulated. The intervention will consist&#xD;
      of approximately 2-5 sessions. The primary research question is whether such an intervention&#xD;
      is effective in terms of causal change in problem areas identified as personally meaningful&#xD;
      by the individual patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most severely ill psychiatric patients are treated on inpatient wards. On most Swedish&#xD;
      inpatient wards, psychological treatment is not routinely offered. At the same time, research&#xD;
      show that psychological treatment often adds a clinically significant effect to routine care.&#xD;
      However, it is a great challenge to handle the diagnostically complex picture present in this&#xD;
      context. Often, diagnoses are unclear or preliminary, or there are many co-morbid conditions&#xD;
      to be treated simultaneously. Available treatment protocols are often developed for an&#xD;
      outpatient population, and for a specific diagnostic group. This, combined with cultural and&#xD;
      organizational challenges inherent to the inpatient context, makes the implementation of&#xD;
      psychological treatment for these patients a great challenge. Factors such as form of care&#xD;
      (voluntary or mandatory), the patient's motivation, and other unforeseen events add to the&#xD;
      fact that the length of any given episode of inpatient care is difficult to estimate. This is&#xD;
      also a fact that a psychological treatment model must adapt to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There seems to be a need for developing psychological treatment models in a way that makes&#xD;
      them suitable for the special challenges that psychiatric inpatient care present. Looking at&#xD;
      the existing research so far, combined with clinical experience, transdiagnostic&#xD;
      applicability and flexibility in terms of time frame, context and level of functioning in the&#xD;
      individual patient seem to be key factors for a potentially successful model. One way of&#xD;
      developing such a model is to individually tailor each treatment, with the support of a few&#xD;
      well establish principles. Some form of clinical functional analysis is fundamental for most&#xD;
      treatment models based on cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), which is in general the form of&#xD;
      therapy that has the broadest evidence base for the most common psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
      Functional analysis is idiographic in nature, and takes the individual patient's problems as&#xD;
      its starting point, no matter the diagnosis. It is a tool that, at least in theory, is&#xD;
      applicable to all behavior. This means that even complex psychopathology such as psychosis or&#xD;
      suicidality is potentially amenable to analysis and change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The challenge with using psychological treatment in an inpatient context is to identify and&#xD;
      treat some part of a complex condition, in a way that is possible to combine with other forms&#xD;
      of care given on the ward. Functional analysis is a flexible tool in this respect. For&#xD;
      example, it would be possible to formulate a meaningful plan for behavioral activation or&#xD;
      limited exposure, in the context of a complex psychiatric condition such as schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides functional analysis as a basic tool, there are interventions from various therapy&#xD;
      models that have been shown effective in an inpatient context. One CBT-based treatment model&#xD;
      that has been investigated in an inpatient context with promising results is Acceptance &amp;&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy (ACT). In short, ACT aims to promote psychological flexibility in relation&#xD;
      to disturbing experiences, for example symptoms of a psychiatric disorder. One of the central&#xD;
      processes that ACT targets are so called values. Values are defined as freely chosen concepts&#xD;
      that are connected to patterns of action that give a sense of meaning, and that are able to&#xD;
      coordinate behavior over time. One example of such a concept might be being a present parent.&#xD;
      This is connected to a pattern of various behaviors, with each one giving the person a sense&#xD;
      of meaning, because they are connected to an overarching quality of action. Values, in this&#xD;
      respect, are different from concrete and reachable goals. Values are not reachable but point&#xD;
      to a direction for action more generally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generally, some form of maintenance plan is also central for change in psychotherapy to last&#xD;
      over time. One method for constructing a maintenance plan is to summarize central principles&#xD;
      in a form that the patient can take with them when treatment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Looking at the challenges that have been identified in terms of implementing psychological&#xD;
      treatment models in a psychiatric inpatient context, and clinical experiences with using&#xD;
      flexible interventions in this context, the purpose of the present project is to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of a transdiagnostic short-term psychotherapy for psychiatric inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is individually tailored transdiagnostic short-term psychotherapy based on functional&#xD;
      analysis, clarification of values, and the establishment of a maintenance plan effective in&#xD;
      an inpatient context, in terms of causal change in personally meaningful problem areas&#xD;
      defined by the individual patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method Design The study is designed as an experimental sincle case study, with a multiple&#xD;
      baseline across participants. Data will be collected during a baseline period (A) of&#xD;
      approximately two days (2-3 data points will be collected daily) in order to establish a&#xD;
      stable baseline of at least 5 data points. Thereafter, the intervention (B) will be&#xD;
      introduced, and data will be continuously collected 2-3 times daily during treatment.&#xD;
      Approximately 5 data points will be collected after treatment is complete. In order to&#xD;
      control for measurement effects, the length of the baseline will be varied so that it will be&#xD;
      prolonged for some participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Approximately 5-10 participants will be included. The number needed is dependent&#xD;
      on the variability of the dependent variable, the length of the baselines, possible trends in&#xD;
      baseline and intervention phases, the size of the change that can be expected, and how fast&#xD;
      the effect on the dependent variable can be reached after introducing treatment.&#xD;
      Meta-analyses of the effect of psychological treatment for inpatients have shown small to&#xD;
      medium effects. Even if the modality of treatment and diagnoses vary in studies included in&#xD;
      meta-analyses, and compared to the project being described here, it seems reasonable when&#xD;
      including patients to expect a quite limited (while clinically significant) effect. It is&#xD;
      estimated that at least five patients will be needed to establish sufficient experimental&#xD;
      control in the project being described here. However, more might be needed, or fewer if the&#xD;
      baselines are stable enough, and the effect of treatment is clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context Data will be collected on the inpatient wards of the Hospital of Västmanland,&#xD;
      Västerås, Sweden, where the main researcher Mårten Tyrberg has his clinical position. In the&#xD;
      hospital, there are 6 inpatient wards, each with 10-15 beds. Patients suitable for inclusion&#xD;
      will be identified on routine rounds, where the main researcher participates regularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures Outcome measures and dependent variables are the Personal Questionnaire&#xD;
      (PQ), the Bull's-Eye Values Survey (BEVS) and objectively observable behaviors such as&#xD;
      as-needed medication, amount of self-harm or degree of activity. PQ is a procedure for&#xD;
      constructing reliable and personally relevant questionnaires for rating mental health. In an&#xD;
      assessment interview, one or more so called illness statements are formulated, that describe&#xD;
      the central problem with the patient's own words (for example, &quot;I can't stand my anxiety&quot;).&#xD;
      For each illness statement an improvement statement is formulated, that is meant to describe&#xD;
      some degree of improvement (for example &quot;At times, I can handle my anxiety&quot;), and a recovery&#xD;
      statement that is meant to describe a situation where treatment is no longer needed (for&#xD;
      example &quot;I can handle my anxiety in a good way most of the time&quot;). Every statement is paired&#xD;
      with each other statement on a total of three cards. The order in which the statements are&#xD;
      presented is varied on the three cards. The cards are presented for the patient, and for each&#xD;
      card they get to choose the statement that best describes their present condition. 1-4 points&#xD;
      are obtained for each illness statement, higher points representing worse mental health. BEVS&#xD;
      is an instrument that measures, on a scale from 0-28, to what extent a patient is living&#xD;
      according to their values. On a visually presented dart board, the patient marks with a cross&#xD;
      somewhere on the board to indicate degree of values-based living, a cross closer to the&#xD;
      middle (the bull's-eye) representing better health. BEVS has shown satisfying reliability and&#xD;
      validity. Objectively observable behaviors such as use of as-needed medication can be tracked&#xD;
      in the patients charts, degree of activity can be measured using an actigraph, and amount of&#xD;
      self-harm can be tracked in patient charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention, transdiagnostic short-term psychotherapy The treatment is a flexible&#xD;
      application of clinical functional analysis and a few chosen interventions that in clinical&#xD;
      experience have shown to work well with the patient group under study (psychiatric inpatients&#xD;
      with complex symptoms), each being adjustable to suit the kind and degree of problems being&#xD;
      presented. The first step is functional analysis and case conceptualization, in the form of a&#xD;
      clinical interview. This is based on four focus questions that are helpful in conducting a&#xD;
      quick analysis and isolating a treatable problem: What are you seeking? What have you tried?&#xD;
      How has it worked? What has it cost you? The questions aim to focus in on the patient's main&#xD;
      problem, as well as previous strategies that they have tried, in terms of their long- and&#xD;
      short-term functionality, and in relation to central values. The second step is a simplified&#xD;
      version of an experiential exercise called the lifeline. Potentially, this exercise can&#xD;
      function as a concretization, where the findings of the functional analysis can be put into&#xD;
      action, resulting in a plan for behavior change that is connected to personally meaningful&#xD;
      life areas. The lifeline exercise is conducted as an exercise where both therapist and&#xD;
      patient stand up and use the physical properties of the room to clarify life directions in a&#xD;
      concrete way. Aids such as post-its are often used to concretize obstacles in one's valued&#xD;
      direction, where key words describing symptoms are noted. According to clinical experience,&#xD;
      this concrete way of working has been particularly helpful for patients with complex&#xD;
      diagnoses, including some cognitive deficits, as it helps them register and remember central&#xD;
      principles of the treatment (such as the need for acceptance in relation to experiences that&#xD;
      can't be changed). The exercise has also proven adjustable to different kinds of problems.&#xD;
      The third step is a repetition and a summary of the previous two steps, where an exercise&#xD;
      called the pause is given to the patient, in the form of a printed card that the patient gets&#xD;
      to keep. This is used as a maintenance plan. The exercise consists of the following steps:&#xD;
      pause and slow your breathing; use the observer perspective; experience thoughts and feelings&#xD;
      as they are; formulate a direction and act.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Data will be analyzed using visual analysis, focusing on differences in outcome&#xD;
      measures between A and B phases concerning central location, trend and variability.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be used in the form of Kendall's Tau to analyze trends in A and B&#xD;
      phases, and non-overlap of all pairs (NAP) to analyze differences between A and B phases.&#xD;
