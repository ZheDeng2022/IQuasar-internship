    <textblock>
      In order to evaluate the safety and value of the improved ship-shaped fixing on tracheal&#xD;
      intubation patients and provide theoretical basis for clinical therapy, we conducted this&#xD;
      research to compare the fixed effectiveness, complications, nursing workload and medical&#xD;
      expenses about application of ship-shaped adhesive tape fixation on patient undergoing&#xD;
      tracheal intubation.&#xD;

    <description>Cutting method of 3M adhesive tape of ship shape: cut a piece of 20cm×3cm elastic adhesive tape, fold it in half to form a rectangle of 10cm×3cm, cut 5cm straight line from the middle point of the crease, cut it at an Angle of 45°, fold and open the 3M elastic adhesive tape in half, which is the adhesive tape required for fixing. The final shape is similar to that of a ship, and it is named as 3M adhesive tape of ship shape.&#xD;
Fixation method: The ship shape with 3M adhesive tape was pasted upward on the opposite cheek (near zygomatic), and the endotracheal intubation was wound around for two rounds and then glued to the near cheek (near zygomatic).Put the tooth pad next to the endotracheal intubation and wrap the tooth pad and catheter together for two turns with a short 3M adhesive tape of 12cm×1.5cm.Finally, fasten it with a lacing.</description>

    <description>During fixation, the endotracheal intubation and dental pad were located in the center of the mouth, and one end of one piece of medical cloth adhesive was pasted on the patient's cheek near the side. When it reached one side of the mouth, the endotracheal intubation and dental pad were wound around twice, and then the other side of the adhesive tape was pasted on the cheek opposite the side from the other side of the mouth,The other is fixed in reverse with the same sticking method, and the two pieces of adhesive tape are finally crossed and fixed at the corners of the mouth.Finally, fasten it with a lacing</description>
