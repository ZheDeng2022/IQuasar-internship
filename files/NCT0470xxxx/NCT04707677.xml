      Objective: The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare ceramic and titanium&#xD;
      implants with respect to the esthetic and clinical parameters, and patient reported outcome&#xD;
      measures (PROMs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods: Thirty patients received thirty implants (8-12 mm in length, 3.3 mm&#xD;
      diameter and a tissue level design) to replace the absence of a single tooth in the anterior&#xD;
      maxilla. Patients were randomly allocated to receive a ceramic or a titanium implant.&#xD;
      Esthetic and clinical parameters and PROMs were evaluated 18 months after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT), with a parallel&#xD;
      design, comparing ceramic (test group) and titanium (control group) implants, for the&#xD;
      replacement of a single-tooth in the anterior maxilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were randomized and assigned to each of the study groups through a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical and restorative procedures In the test group, a Tissue Level Ceramic monotype&#xD;
      implant was placed (Straumann PURE Ceramic implants®; Institut Straumann, Basel, Switzerland)&#xD;
      and in the control group a Tissue Level SLA Titanium implant (Straumann Standard Plus Narrow&#xD;
      Neck CrossFit®; Institut Straumann, Basel, Switzerland). The length of the implants was 8, 10&#xD;
      and 12 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the Implant Crown Aesthetic Index (ICAI). It consists of nine&#xD;
      sections: mesiodistal dimension of the crown, position of the incisal edge of the crown,&#xD;
      labial convexity of the crown, color and translucency of the crown, crown surface, position&#xD;
      of the gingival margin of the peri-implant mucosa, position of the interdental papilla,&#xD;
      contour of the vestibular mucosa and color and surface of the vestibular mucosa. These&#xD;
      sections were compared with the adjacent and contralateral tooth as a reference and assigned&#xD;
      the following score: 0, excellent; 1 or 2 satisfactory; 3 or 4 moderate; 5 or more bad.&#xD;
