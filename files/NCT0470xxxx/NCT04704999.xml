  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tafenoquine was recently approved by regulatory authorities in the USA and Australia.&#xD;
      Tafenoquine is an alternative radical curative treatment to primaquine acting against the&#xD;
      dormant liver stage of Plasmodium vivax (the hypnozoite). Tafenoquine (an 8-aminoquinoline)&#xD;
      has the substantial advantage of single dosing as compared to a 14-day course of primaquine&#xD;
      to achieve radical cure. The recommended tafenoquine dose is 300 mg, which was shown to be&#xD;
      significantly worse in radical curative efficacy to a total primaquine dose of 3.5 mg/kg in&#xD;
      Southeast Asia. The cure rate of tafenoquine 300 mg in Southeast Asian study sites was only&#xD;
      74%. The comparator 3.5 mg/kg total primaquine dose is the standard and most commonly used&#xD;
      dose globally, but in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific, higher doses of primaquine are&#xD;
      needed for radical cure. This study aims to determine the optimal dose of tafenoquine in&#xD;
      Southeast Asia.&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 600 participants will be enrolled and randomised to one of three arms: low mg/kg&#xD;
      single dose tafenoquine (5 mg/kg); medium mg/kg single dose tafenoquine (9 mg/kg); and high&#xD;
      mg/kg dose tafenoquine (12.5 mg/kg). Due to tablet packaging, doses will be weight dependent&#xD;
      and equal to 200, 300, 400, or 600 mg given as a single dose for the description of the study&#xD;
      treatment arms). Each arm will have 200 participants (~120 participants per country). The&#xD;
      schizonticidal agent used will be determined by the study site for description of&#xD;
      schizonticidal treatment). Tafenoquine will be given concomitantly with the schizonticidal&#xD;
      agent on the day of enrolment. The participant will be followed daily until the malaria smear&#xD;
      is negative for asexual parasites or until the schizonticidal treatment is completed,&#xD;
      whichever occurs last. Follow up will continue on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 then every month&#xD;
      until month 6. Participants will be instructed to follow up in between visits if they are&#xD;
      feeling unwell. This is an open label randomised trial and neither participants nor clinical&#xD;
      study staff will be blinded to the treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited from the outpatient setting at the following sites:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU), Cambodia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lao Oxford Mahosot Hospital Wellcome Trust Research Unit (LOMWRU), Lao PDR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Myanmar Oxford Clinical Research Unit (MOCRU), Myanmar&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mahidol Vivax Research Unit (MVRU), Thailand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoklo Malaria Research Unit (SMRU), Thailand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oxford University Clinical Research Unit (OUCRU), Vietnam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Enrolment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients presenting with fever or history of fever and have asexual P. vivax parasitaemia by&#xD;
      microscopy will be approached for informed consent. After written informed consent has been&#xD;
      provided, study staff who have been trained in phlebotomy will draw approximately 7.19 mL of&#xD;
      blood. Medical history, participant weight, vital signs and physical examination, point of&#xD;
      care haemoglobin, quantitative glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase testing, and urine pregnancy&#xD;
      testing will be performed to determine if the volunteer can be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be done by sequentially numbered sealed envelopes. The randomized arms&#xD;
      will be low (5 mg/kg), medium (9 mg/kg) or high (12.5 mg/kg) single dose tafenoquine. The&#xD;
      doses will be provided in a dosing table in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no control arm per se (i.e. with primaquine, the current standard of care) as&#xD;
      the study is designed to evaluate the relationship of the tafenoquine dose (drug exposure)&#xD;
      with the therapeutic response (P. vivax recurrence within 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Observation of Drug Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure complete adherence to the prescribed drug regimens, all drug&#xD;
      administration will be directly observed by study staff. Study staff will provide the&#xD;
      participant with the appropriate dosing of the drug for that day and observe the participant&#xD;
      taking the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are to be performed for each direct observation of drug&#xD;
      administration subsequent to the first dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record adverse events as reported by participant or observed by study staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record the date and time of study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff will review any available laboratory findings prior to drug administration. The&#xD;
      investigator will determine if any adverse event requires discontinuation of the study&#xD;
      medication or results in inability to continue to comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed daily until the malaria smear is negative once or when the&#xD;
      schizonticidal treatment is completed, whichever is later. Follow up will continue on days 7,&#xD;
      14, 21, and 28, then months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (total of 12 visits depending on parasite&#xD;
      clearance time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily visits must occur on the exact day scheduled. The visit windows for the day 7, 14, and&#xD;
      21 visits are +/- 3 days, for the day 28 visit + 2 weeks/- 3 days, and for the months 2, 3,&#xD;
      4, 5 and 6 visits are +/- 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following procedures are to be performed for each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication history and concomitant medication use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record adverse events as reported by participant or observed by study staff&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record vital signs and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect blood samples for laboratory tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review all available laboratory results&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study exit on month 6, any participant with ongoing, unresolved adverse events will be&#xD;
      referred to care for appropriate clinical follow-up in the outpatient department. If the&#xD;
      participant has a P. vivax recurrence, they will be treated as per the randomisation arm and&#xD;
      study activities (blood sampling and follow up) will restart as episode 2, day 0. The total&#xD;
      study duration will remain the same. This means that the study completion date is 6 months&#xD;
      from the date of enrolment for all participants regardless of the number of P. vivax&#xD;
      episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missed Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a no-show at the clinic for a scheduled study visit, study personnel (or community&#xD;
      engagement) will call the participant if the participant has a phone. Study personnel (or&#xD;
      community engagement) may visit the participant's home to remind the participant of the study&#xD;
      visit. Maximum efforts will be made to ensure complete follow-up in the trial, including&#xD;
      routine education for participants on follow-up schedules. For participants who do not&#xD;
      complete a scheduled visit within the visit window, that visit will be documented as &quot;missed&quot;&#xD;
      and follow up will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Withdrawal or Termination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant has the right to withdraw consent for study at any time. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigator may discontinue a participant from the study at any time if the investigator&#xD;
      considers it necessary for any reason including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ineligibility (either arising during the study or retrospective having been overlooked&#xD;
           at screening)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Significant non-compliance with treatment regimen or study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An adverse event which requires discontinuation of the study medication or results in&#xD;
           inability to continue to comply with study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the case report form (CRF). If the participant&#xD;
      is withdrawn due to an adverse event, the investigator will arrange for follow-up visits or&#xD;
      telephone calls until the adverse event has resolved or stabilized. Participants who have&#xD;
      been withdrawn or terminated from the study will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial hypothesis is that radical curative efficacy is determined by the total drug&#xD;
      exposure, approximated by the total area under the whole blood tafenoquine concentration-time&#xD;
      curve. This trial aims to characterise the dose-efficacy relationship of single-dose&#xD;
      tafenoquine by randomising patients to receive target doses close to 5, 9 and 12.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      (corresponding approximately to the previously tested Southeast Asian adult doses of 300,&#xD;
      450, or 600 mg, constrained by available tablet sizes). The clinically relevant primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint (which for a single dose regimen is the equal to the effectiveness) is the&#xD;
      occurrence of a microscopy detectable recurrent vivax malaria after treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators have used previous data from the study sites on infection rates, P. vivax&#xD;
      relapse rates, and a published model of tafenoquine population pharmacokinetics to construct&#xD;
      a simulation model which allows for approximate determination of the sample size required to&#xD;
      characterise the exposure-response curve for the hypnozoiticidal activity of tafenoquine. The&#xD;
      population pharmacokinetic model of tafenoquine was used to generate area under curve&#xD;
      exposure values as a function of the randomised doses and simulated patient weights. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators used estimates from the phase 2 studies of the area under curve -&#xD;
      hypnozoiticidal efficacy relationship (pharmacodynamic model) to generate plausible estimates&#xD;
      for the dose-response curve. The resulting pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic simulation model,&#xD;
      adapted to Southeast Asia (where higher doses of 8-aminoquinoline treatment are needed),&#xD;
      accounting for inter-site variability, estimated that 200 patients per arm (approximately 120&#xD;
      per country) were needed to provide 90% power to characterise the dose-response relationship&#xD;
      (Figure 7). Sparse pharmacokinetic sampling, with 4 blood samples in the first week and&#xD;
      additional samples at 14 and 28 days, will allow for subsequent determination of individual&#xD;
      patient area under curve values, and an accurate characterisation of the population&#xD;
      dose-efficacy curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection All study data will be recorded on standard paper Case Report Forms (CRFs).&#xD;
      Data will be entered on a secure database in accordance with standard operating procedures&#xD;
      (SOPs). A study-specific data management plan will detail procedures for collection, curation&#xD;
      and storage of study data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source documents are original documents, data, and records from which participants' CRF data&#xD;
      are obtained. These include, but are not limited to, hospital records (from which medical&#xD;
      history and previous and concurrent medication may be summarized into the CRF), clinical&#xD;
      charts, laboratory, correspondence, log books, and CRFs. For most variables, the CRF will be&#xD;
      considered the source document.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All documents will be stored safely in confidential conditions. On all study-specific&#xD;
      documents, other than the signed consent and screening logbook, the participant will be&#xD;
      referred to by the study participant number/code, not by name.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Access&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be identified by a study identification number in the study database.&#xD;
      The name and any other identifying detail will NOT be included in any study data electronic&#xD;
      file. The database linking the volunteer's clinical identification number (ie. hospital&#xD;
      number) to the study identification number will be kept by the individual study sites and the&#xD;
      data analysis team will not have access to this information. All records will be kept locked&#xD;
      and all databases will be password protected such that clinic staff and study staff will have&#xD;
      access to their respective databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct access will be granted to authorized representatives from the sponsor, host&#xD;
      institutions and the regulatory authorities to permit trial-related monitoring, audits and&#xD;
      inspections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Storage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study site will maintain, and store securely, complete, accurate and current study&#xD;
      records throughout the study. In accordance with the University of Oxford's policy, research&#xD;
      data and records should be retained for five years for adults, and for children until the&#xD;
      youngest child participating in the trial reaches 21, or in accordance with the&#xD;
      local/in-country regulation. Applicable records include source documents, site registration&#xD;
      documents and reports, informed consent forms, and notations of all contacts with&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sharing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant's data and results from blood analyses stored in the database may be shared&#xD;
      according to the terms defined in the MORU data sharing policy or other researchers to use in&#xD;
      the future. All personal information will be anonymised so that no individual can be&#xD;
      identified from their treatment records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Control and Quality Assurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in accordance with the current approved protocol, International&#xD;
      Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP), relevant regulations,&#xD;
      standard operating procedures, and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The&#xD;
      Clinical Trials Support Group (CTSG) at MORU will provide study oversight, quality&#xD;
      management, and study monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline participant characteristics will be compared across study arms using standard&#xD;
      descriptive statistics. To assess the primary and secondary endpoints of microscopy and&#xD;
      sub-microscopic P. vivax recurrence, respectively, logistic regression will be used to&#xD;
      compare rates of P. vivax infection between study arms and determine whether age or other&#xD;
      demographic factors, mg/kg tafenoquine dose, tafenoquine area under curve or CYP2D6 status&#xD;
      are predictive of recurrence. Logistic regression will also be used to analyse the presence&#xD;
      of gastrointestinal adverse effects associated with use of concomitant medication, drug&#xD;
      exposure, and CYP2D6 status. Methaemoglobin levels and association with tafenoquine area&#xD;
      under curve will be analysed using linear regression. The estimated tafenoquine area under&#xD;
      curve model will be based on previous work on primaquine pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      analysis using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling.&#xD;
