  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gait is specifically impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). External auditory cue based on a&#xD;
      binary rhythm tested in PD patients disappear when the stimulus is removed. Golden Ratio&#xD;
      (GR)is intrinsic in the human gait, but in PD patients this GR has been found impaired. Aim&#xD;
      of the study is the administration of an auditory external cue based on a personalized Golden&#xD;
      Ratio-rhythm which could potentially assist people with PD to cope with the difficulties that&#xD;
      they experience while walking, thus increasing their mobility and autonomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gait is specifically impaired in Parkinson's disease (PD). External auditory cue based on a&#xD;
      binary rhythm has been successfully used in people with PD to improve their gait quality, but&#xD;
      the beneficial effects disappear when the stimulus is removed. Recent evidences have shown&#xD;
      that, in healthy subjects, the structure of walking relies on a number, called Golden Ratio&#xD;
      (GR), based on a perfect proportion between different gait phases. While GR is known to be&#xD;
      impaired in people with PD, there are few evidences that a GR-based auditory stimulus could&#xD;
      support people with PD in counteracting gait alterations. As hypothesis, an auditory external&#xD;
      cue based on a personalized GR-rhythm could assist people with PD to cope with the&#xD;
      difficulties that they experience while walking, thus increasing their mobility and autonomy,&#xD;
      and that the nature of this GR-rhythm allows to maintain the beneficial effects in time. Two&#xD;
      personalized auditory rhythms (a binary rhythm and a GR-rhythm) will be alternatively&#xD;
      administered to each participant (see diagram below). Patient-specific rhythms will&#xD;
      administered by a user-friendly ad-hoc app for smartphone. Two assessments will be performed&#xD;
      during these 24 weeks, to assess treatment efficacy. At the end of the 24th week, half of&#xD;
      patients will continue with the GR-rhythm and, in a final assessment, we will see if the&#xD;
      effect lasts over time.&#xD;
