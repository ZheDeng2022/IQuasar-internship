    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study how to adapt and implement the 3-Step Workout for&#xD;
      Life program in a local home health agency. A series of learning cycles will be conducted to&#xD;
      adjust the treatment dose and delivery mode. The specific aims include to evaluate the&#xD;
      implementation outcomes and clinical outcomes, and to identify facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      associated with the implementation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Medicare beneficiaries admitted to home health agencies are often in a frail status with&#xD;
      decreased muscle strength and difficulty in performing activities of daily living. The&#xD;
      purpose of the proposed research is to study how to adapt and implement the 3-Step Workout&#xD;
      for Life program by the physical therapists and occupational therapists in a local home&#xD;
      health agency. A series of learning cycles will be conducted to adjust the treatment dose and&#xD;
      delivery mode, so that the program can be implemented at low cost but remains effective in&#xD;
      improving self-care ability for Medicare beneficiaries. The specific aims include to evaluate&#xD;
      the implementation outcomes and clinical outcomes, and to identify facilitators and barriers&#xD;
      associated with the implementation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-care items from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from admission to discharge which is a period of about two months</time_frame>
    <description>The self-care items are selected from the OASIS. OASIS is a comprehensive assessment to collect information in home health Medicare patients. The self-care items evaluate the degree of independence in seven activities: eating, oral hygiene, toileting hygiene, upper body dressing, lower body dressing, shower/bathe, and putting on/removing footwear. Each activity is scored on a six-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally dependent) to 6 (totally independent). The home health care provider scores the patient based on information obtained from observation and interview. If an activity was not attempted, the reason would be documented (for example, the patient refused, not applicable because the patient did not perform this activity prior to the current illness, not attempted due to environmental limitations, medication conditions, or safety concerns). A ratio score will be computed to adjust for items that are not attempted.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mobility items from the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from admission to discharge which is a period of about two months</time_frame>
    <description>The mobility items are selected from the OASIS. The mobility items evaluate the degree of independence in the following activities: roll left and right, sit to lying, lying to sitting on side of the bed, sit to stand, chair/bed-to-chair transfer, toilet transfer, car transfer, walk 10 feet, walk 50 feet with two turns, walk 150 feet, walking 10 feet on uneven surfaces, 1 step (curb), 4 steps, 12 steps, picking up an object from the floor, wheel (use a wheelchair or scooter) 50 feet with two turns, &amp; wheel 150 feet.&#xD;
Each activity is scored on a six-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally dependent) to 6 (totally independent). The home health care provider scores the patient based on information obtained from observation and interview. If an activity was not attempted, the reason would be documented. A ratio score will be computed to adjust for items that are not attempted.</description>

    <measure>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from admission to discharge which is a period of about two months</time_frame>
    <description>Canadian Occupational Performance Measure is a client-centered measure that examines a patient's self-perceived changes in areas of daily activity performance that are meaningful to the patient. The patient identifies meaningful activities, rates their degree of performance, and rates their satisfaction of performance on a 10-point Likert scale. A higher score indicates a better performance or higher satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EuroQoL (EQ-5D-5L)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from admission to discharge which is a period of about two months</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQoL is a self-reported, health-related, quality of life questionnaire. It measures the quality of life on 5 domains, including mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each domain is rated on a 5-level scale, with a higher level indicates a better outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activity Measure Post Acute Care (AM-PAC): Home Care Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from admission to discharge which is a period of about two months</time_frame>
    <description>AM-PAC home care short form is a patient-report outcome measure. It assesses patients' degree of difficulty doing daily activities, basic mobility, and functional cognition tasks (e.g., remember to take medications). A higher level indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive the 3-step Workout for Life program given by their physical therapy or occupational therapy providers. The program includes single-joint and multiple joint progressive resistance exercise and activities of daily living exercise training. During the resistance exercise sessions, participants will use resistance tubing to strengthen major muscle groups of the upper extremity and lower extremity. During the activities of daily living exercise, participants will practice activities of daily living that they experience difficulty. The intervention volume, duration, and frequency will be modified to enhance practicality in a home health care setting over the implementation phase. In addition to the 3-Step Workout for Life, participants may also receive other routine rehabilitation treatment determined and provided by their therapists to facilitate their functional recovery.</description>
