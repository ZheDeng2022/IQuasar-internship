  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most efficient system for airways controll during general anesthesia is oro-tracheal&#xD;
      intubation, in order to allow mechanical ventilation and bronchial suction and to prevent&#xD;
      gastric intake. However, in the period after exhumation, traumatism of tube placement causes&#xD;
      in 21% to 72% of patients, sore throat (POST), generally associated hoarseness. The incidence&#xD;
      of POST is influenced by numerous factors such as age, smoke history, duration of tube&#xD;
      positioning maneuvers, diameter of the endotracheal tube, pressure present in the headset,&#xD;
      duration of intubation. Although analgesics and systemically administered anti-inflammatories&#xD;
      have been found to be effective, topical therapies based on the application of&#xD;
      corticosteroids, NSAIDs and lidocaine are an interesting alternative because they are also&#xD;
      effective, but devoid of the effects collateralises of systemic administration. The proposed&#xD;
      methods for the prevention and treatment of POST in cardiac surgery patients, subjected to&#xD;
      long-term interventions with consequent need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      therefore orotracheal intubation even in the post-operative period. The propose of trial is&#xD;
      that the sub-glottal intake door can also be used for the peat administration of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs in order to prevent pain caused by endotracheal intubation. This drug&#xD;
      thus administered will directly reach the anatomical structures most involved in the genesis&#xD;
      of post-intubation pain, that is, the vocal cords and the expected part of the trachea.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Orotracheal intubation is the most efficient system for controlling the airways during&#xD;
      general anesthesia, in order to keep them harmful, to prevent gastric intake and to allow&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation and bronchial suction. However, a percentage ranging from 21% to 72%&#xD;
      of patients undergoing orotracheal intubation have, in the period after exhumation, sore&#xD;
      throat (POST) generally associated hoarseness. This complication stems from traumatism caused&#xD;
      by tube placement and pressure exerted on the vocal cords and trachea wall during in situ&#xD;
      parking. The incidence of POST is influenced by numerous factors such as age, smoke history,&#xD;
      duration of tube positioning maneuvers, diameter of the endotracheal tube, pressure present&#xD;
      in the headset, duration of intubation. The proposed methods for the prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of POST are manifold and the literature on the subject is extensive. Several studies have&#xD;
      assessed the effectiveness of systemic administration of opioids and NSAIDs or their peat&#xD;
      application, by oral rinse and gargles, and the lubrication of the endotracheal tube cap with&#xD;
      cortisonic or lidocaine-based ointments. Although analgesics and systemically administered&#xD;
      anti-inflammatories have been found to be effective, topical therapies based on the&#xD;
      application of corticosteroids, NSAIDs and lidocaine are an interesting alternative because&#xD;
      they are also effective, but devoid of the effects collateralises of systemic administration.&#xD;
      Among the drugs used in this mode there is also flurbiprofen, an NSAID successfully used in&#xD;
      inflammation of the first airways which has also proven effective in the forms resulting from&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation and the placement of the laryngeal mask. There are studies in the&#xD;
      literature that have evaluated the oral administration of flurbiprofen spray. Recently,&#xD;
      endotracheal tubes have been marketed to remove secretions that accumulate above the headset,&#xD;
      sucking them through an accessory light. These secretions come from the upper airways and&#xD;
      penetrate the initial part of the trachea because the presence of the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      prevents the adduction of the vocal cords. The permanence of secretions facilitates bacterial&#xD;
      growth and, in the long run, their passage under the cap, into the tracheobronchial tree. For&#xD;
      this reason, the use of these tubes has been effective in reducing the incidence of pneumonia&#xD;
      associated with invasive mechanical ventilation. The accessory light (sub-glottal suction&#xD;
      door) has also been used to carry out washing with physiological solution, always in order to&#xD;
      prevent material stagnation and bacterial growth above the headset. The propose of trial is&#xD;
      that the sub-glottal intake door can also be used for the peat administration of&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs in order to prevent pain caused by endotracheal intubation. In fact,&#xD;
      a drug thus administered will directly reach the anatomical structures most involved in the&#xD;
      genesis of post-intubation pain, that is, the vocal cords and the expected part of the&#xD;
      trachea. The population studied will be cardiac surgery, subjected to long-term interventions&#xD;
      with consequent need for prolonged mechanical ventilation and therefore orotracheal&#xD;
      intubation even in the post-operative period.&#xD;
