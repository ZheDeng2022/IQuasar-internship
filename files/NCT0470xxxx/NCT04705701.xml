    <textblock>
      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is an important risk factor for coronary and valvular cardiac&#xD;
      disease leading to cardiac surgery. with concern for higher post-op complications with volume&#xD;
      overload and coagulopathies in this patient' outcomes as mentioned above in patients who&#xD;
      receive early post-op dialysis versus hemodialysis on day 1 or thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ed for mechanical ventilation and rs of clinical course and mortality. Previous studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that presence of ESRD is an independent risk factor for post-operative&#xD;
      respiratory failure and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, partially mediated&#xD;
      through volume overload and prolonged mechanical ventilation, as well as coagulopathy&#xD;
      attributed to platelet dysfunction and uremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prolonged mechanical ventilation after cardiac surgery has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      higher morbidity and mortality. Fluid overload is a predictor of length of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation and intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Therefore early restoration of volume and&#xD;
      electrolyte homeostasis and clearance of uremic toxins should be one of the principal goals&#xD;
      in the immediate post operative period in patients with ESRD. However, to the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, the effect of timing of post-operative renal replacement therapy, specifically&#xD;
      hemodialysis, on clinical outcomes has not been studied in ESRD patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

      Accordingly, we have conducted this study to evaluate the effect of early population&#xD;
      affecting their overall hospital course including longer duration of ICU stay, need for&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation support and blood products transfusion we are planning to conduct this&#xD;
      study and compare the short term hemodialysis treatment after cardiac surgery, on clinical&#xD;

      End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is an important risk factor for coronary and valvular cardiac&#xD;

      factor for post-operative respiratory failure and mortality in patients undergoing cardiac&#xD;
