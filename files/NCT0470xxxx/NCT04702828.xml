  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most of previous studies are cross-sectional studies, and rarely explore the changes in&#xD;
      physical activity, mental state, cognitive and motor functions over time after a fall.&#xD;
      Therefore, we hope to find out what changes in the elders' physiological and psychological&#xD;
      functions after a fall.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Falls are the main cause of accidental injuries that are common among the elderly. In Taiwan,&#xD;
      the incidence of falls is about 15% to 34%. Falling can cause subsequent serious injuries and&#xD;
      post-fall syndromes. Post-fall syndrome is common after a fall. The symptoms of&#xD;
      self-restricted activity for fear of falling again affect about one-fifth of older fallers.&#xD;
      This syndrome develops within a short period of time after a fall, which not only causes&#xD;
      serious problems but also affects psychological symptoms and dependence on daily life&#xD;
      functions. All of these reduce the function of movement and increase the chance of falling&#xD;
      again. However, most of the past studies are cross-sectional studies, and rarely explore the&#xD;
      changes in physical activity, mental state, cognitive and motor functions over time after a&#xD;
      fall. Therefore, the study will investigate the changes in physiological and psychological&#xD;
      functions after a fall among older adults who experiences a recent fall within 2 months.&#xD;
      Additionally, the physiological and psychological functions will be compared between older&#xD;
      adults with and without a history of falls.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Vision acuity will be measured by the Snellen Chart. The Snellen chart is printed with eleven lines of block letters. The first line consists of one very large E letter. Subsequent rows have increasing numbers of letters with decrease in size. Participant will take the test by covering one eye from 6 meters away, and read aloud the letters of each row, beginning at the top. The smallest row that can be read accurately indicates the visual acuity in that specific eye.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive function (dementia)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Mental State Examination(MMSE) is used extensively in clinical and research settings to measure cognitive impairment, covering attention, calculation, recall, language, ability to follow simple commands and orientation. It is commonly used in medicine and allied health to screen for dementia; used to estimate the severity and progression of cognitive impairment and to follow the course of cognitive changes in an individual over time; thus making it an effective way to document an individual's response to treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear of falling</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of falling will be measured by the Falls Efficacy Scale International(FES). The FES rated each daily task from no confident at all to completely confident. The total score between 16 and 64, and the score more than 28 indicates higher level of fear of falling.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The confidence of balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The confidence of balance will test by Activities-specific Balance and Confidence (ABC) Scale. The ABC Scale is a 16-item questionnaire. Each item is rated from 0% (no confidence) to 100% (complete confidence) by all participants. The higher score, the more confidence they have.</description>

    <measure>Basic Activity of Daily Living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Basic activities of daily living will be measured by the Barthel Index. It is an ordinal scale used to measure performance in activities of daily living (ADL). Ten variables describing ADL and mobility are scored, a higher number being a reflection of greater ability to function independently following hospital discharge. Time taken and physical assistance required to perform each item are used in determining the assigned value of each item. The Barthel Index measures the degree of assistance required by an individual on 10 items of mobility and self care ADL. The score of 0-20 indicates &quot;total&quot; dependency, 21-60 indicates &quot;severe&quot; dependency, 61-90 indicates &quot;moderate&quot; dependency, and 91-99 indicates &quot;slight&quot; dependency.</description>
