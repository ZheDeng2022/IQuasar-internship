    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the lifestyle intervention on life quality and mental&#xD;
      health among overweight adults with severe mental illness in Shenzhen, China. A total of 210&#xD;
      overweight adults with severe mental illness will be randomly allocated to intervention group&#xD;
      and control group. Participants in the intervention groups will receive a 10-month lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention while the control group will be waitlisted. A group of investigators will&#xD;
      measure the anthropocentric indicators, blood pressure, lifestyle, life quality, and mental&#xD;
      health for all participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies suggest that overweight is an important risk factor for life quality and&#xD;
      mental health among patients with severe mental illness. Findings on Chinese adults regarding&#xD;
      this issue are limited. Thus, we aim to assess the lifestyle intervention on life quality and&#xD;
      mental health among overweight adults with severe mental illness in Shenzhen, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 210 overweight adults with severe mental illness will be randomly allocated to two&#xD;
      groups. Participants in the intervention groups will receive a 10-month lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention while the control group will be waitlisted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group, participants will receive lifestyle education delivered by trained&#xD;
      staffs from Wuhan university. The main objective of the lifestyle education is to raise&#xD;
      participants' awareness regarding the health complications related to obesity and&#xD;
      subsequently to promote weight loss through behavioural modifications. Participants will be&#xD;
      advised to reduce energy intake by having three main meals and avoiding snacks; limiting&#xD;
      intake of sugary food and beverages as well as fried and fatty foods; increasing intake of&#xD;
      fruits and vegetables, etc. They will be asked to increase physical activity, aiming for a&#xD;
      minimum 150 min of moderate-intensity exercise per week and/or 10,000 steps per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement include height, weight, blood pressure, dietary habits, sleep, physical&#xD;
      activity, life quality, and mental health that will be measured by a group of trained&#xD;
      investigator for all participants.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>BMI</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' height (in meters) and weight (in kilograms) will be measured by a group of investigators. weight and height will be combined to report BMI in kg/m^2.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life quality</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Life quality will be investigated by the short form version of the quality of life enjoyment and satisfaction questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF). Each item uses a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good). A total score is derived from 14 items with a maximum score of 70 and with higher scores indicating greater life satisfaction and enjoyment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). This is a 20-item measure that asks participants to rate how often over the past week they experienced symptoms associated with depression. Response options range from 0 to 3 for each item. Scores range from 0 to 60, with high scores indicating greater depressive symptoms.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Sleep</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep status will be assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI is a self-report questionnaire consisting of 19 items and five additional questions. The 19 items are combined to form seven sleep quality component scores. Each component score can range from 0 to 3. The seven component scores are summed to yield a global PSQI score ranging from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicate poorer sleep quality.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Physical activity will be assessed by International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). This IPAQ consists of seven questions assessing the frequency and duration of participation in vigorous, moderate-intensity, and walking activity as well as the time spent sitting during a weekday. The sum of the three activity scores gives an indicator of total physical activity.</description>
