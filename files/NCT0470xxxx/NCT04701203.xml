  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the first 26 weeks of the trial, participants will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      groups: one group will receive TransCon PTH and one group will receive placebo. All subjects&#xD;
      will start with a fixed dose of study drug and will be individually and progressively&#xD;
      titrated to an optimal dose over a 10 week period, followed by an individualized dosing&#xD;
      period up to 16 weeks. TransCon PTH or placebo will be administered as a subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection using a pre-filled injection pen. Neither trial participants nor their doctors will&#xD;
      know who has been assigned to each group. After the 26 weeks, participants will continue in&#xD;
      the trial as part of a long-term extension study. During the extension, all participants will&#xD;
      receive TransCon PTH, with the dose adjusted to their individual needs. This is a global&#xD;
      trial that will be conducted in, but not limited to, the United States, Canada, Germany, and&#xD;
      Denmark.&#xD;

             at least 26 weeks. Diagnosis of HP is established based on historic hypocalcemia in&#xD;
             the setting of inappropriately low serum PTH levels&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Requirement for doses of SoC (e.g., calcitriol, alfacalcidol, calcium supplements) at&#xD;
