  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects were randomly assigned to groups for treatment with either an EGF-containing&#xD;
      ointment (the study group) or the vehicle alone (petrolatum; the control group). The EGF&#xD;
      ointment included recombinant human EGF (1 μg/g). Random numbers used for assignment to&#xD;
      groups were provided by the randomization function of SAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects received one session of laser treatment with a Q-switched (QS) 532-nm Nd:yttrium&#xD;
      aluminum garnet (YAG) laser of their solar lentigines after enrollment. . The end point of&#xD;
      laser treatment for lentigines was immediate whitening. The subjects then applied the EGF&#xD;
      ointment or vehicle twice daily (morning and evening) to the lesion for 4 weeks after laser&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
