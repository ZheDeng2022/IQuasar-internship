  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an open phase I trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, safety and&#xD;
      clinical activity profiles of anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody SM03 in patients with active RA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open phase I trial to evaluate the PK, PD, safety,tolerability, efficacy, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of SM03 in patients with RA. The total study duration was approximately 16&#xD;
      weeks for each participant, including a screening period of maximally 4 weeks, a&#xD;
      multiple-dose period of 2 weeks (day 0 ~ day 14), and a post-treatment follow-up period of 10&#xD;
      weeks (day 15 ~ day 84).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 2,4,8,12</time_frame>
    <description>American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Responder Index is based on a set of evaluations: the Investigator Tender Joint Count/Number of Tender Joints (out of 68 Joints); Investigator Swollen Joint Count/Number of Swollen Joints (out of 66 Joints); Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity (PGAD); Investigator Global Assessment of Disease Activity (IGAD); Patient Global Assessment of Pain (PGAP); Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI); and ESR. ACR response indicates percent change (ie, improvement) from baseline (20%, 50%, 70%) PGAD &amp; IGAD</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28-ESR) at Week 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0,2,4,8,12</time_frame>
    <description>The DAS28 is a composite score to measure disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, derived from the following variables:&#xD;
The number of swollen and tender joints assessed using the 28-joint count; Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR); Patient's global assessment of disease activity measured on a 10 cm visual analog scale.&#xD;
The DAS28 score ranges from zero to ten. A DAS28 score above 5.1 means high disease activity whereas a DAS28 less than or equal to 3.2 indicates low disease activity. Remission is achieved by a DAS28 lower than 2.6.</description>
