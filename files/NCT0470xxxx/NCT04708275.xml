  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression often occurs in early childhood. Moreover, later depression is frequently preceded&#xD;
      by early childhood Depression (ECD). However, at present, there is a lack of evidence-based&#xD;
      tratestments (EBTs) for ECD, posing a core research desideratum highlighted by both the&#xD;
      American and German practice parameters for ECD. The current study seeks to redress this&#xD;
      research gap, by evaluating the feasibility and dose-dependent effectiveness of manualized&#xD;
      short-term psychoanalytic child psychotherapy (PaCT) compared to waitlist in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) among clinically referred 3 to 8-year-olds with ECD. Comprising 20-25&#xD;
      sessions in alternating settings (child-only, caregiver(s)-child, caregiver(s)-only), PaCT&#xD;
      focuses on internal conflicts and representations underlying depressive disorders. PaCT&#xD;
      targets the child-therapist relationship, using interpretative, play and mentalization-based&#xD;
      techniques, aiming to elicit the interpersonal meaning of the child's symptoms within the&#xD;
      child-caregiver relationship(s).&#xD;

      For this trial, 62 clinically referred children meeting criteria for DSM-5 depressive&#xD;
      disorders, will be randomized randomized to PaCT (n=31) or waitlist (n=31). The overarching&#xD;
      aim is to engender reduction in depressive symptoms and diagnoses following PaCT vs. waitlist&#xD;
      in order to determine effect sizes which can be used in power calculations for future&#xD;
      large-scale clinical trials. Moreover, effects of PaCT will also be examined at mid-treatment&#xD;
      to provide a first insight into the necesary therapeutic dose. Moreover, the trial will also&#xD;
      be used as a first opportunity to examine feasibility of PaCT in young children, treatment&#xD;
      integrity, as well as treatment acceptability.&#xD;
