    <textblock>
      This research study investigates the use of a drug, cabergoline, given immediately after&#xD;
      second-trimester abortion or perinatal loss to decrease breast engorgement. Cabergoline is a&#xD;
      medication approved for the symptomatic treatment of pituitary adenomas that result in a&#xD;
      hyperprolactinemic state (a brain tumor that results in milk leakage). The benefit of&#xD;
      stopping milk leakage has also been studied and used in populations who shouldn't breastfeed.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to clarify if cabergoline is effective in preventing breast engorgement&#xD;
      and milk leakage after second-trimester abortions or perinatal loss (stillbirth). Breast&#xD;
      engorgement causes physical pain and emotional distress as lactation is uniquely associated&#xD;
      with parenthood and those undergoing second-trimester abortions are doing so because they&#xD;
      choose not to parent or a previously desired pregnancy is now complicated by anomalies. As&#xD;
      there are no current recommendations for management of this painful engorgement beyond&#xD;
      icepacks and support bras, the investigators aim to validate the use of this pharmacologic&#xD;
      option in this setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Breast pain following second-trimester abortion is common. Breast engorgement and milk&#xD;
      leakage following second-trimester perinatal loss and abortion can cause both physical pain&#xD;
      and emotional distress. Dopamine agonists have previously been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      lactation inhibition for third-trimester fetal/neonatal loss or contraindications to&#xD;
      breastfeeding. In a head-to-head trial, cabergoline was more effective with a better safety&#xD;
      profile than bromocriptine and has thus emerged as preferred treatment for term lactation&#xD;
      inhibition internationally. Despite the frequency of breast symptoms after second-trimester&#xD;
      abortions, there are no current guidelines for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, superiority trial of&#xD;
      participants undergoing abortion or experiencing intrauterine fetal demise between 18 and&#xD;
      28-weeks gestation at Stanford Health Care. Participants will be randomized to either&#xD;
      cabergoline 1mg or placebo the day of procedure. Participants will complete the Bristol&#xD;
      Breast Inventory, a survey to assess symptoms and side-effects at baseline and Day 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      7, and 14 after the procedure. A score of zero means no symptoms, a score of five reflects a&#xD;
      participant that is highly symptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is breast symptoms on Day 4 as reported on the Bristol Breast Inventory.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include satisfaction, acceptability, and side-effects. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that cabergoline is superior to placebo for preventing breast engorgement after&#xD;
      second-trimester abortion or loss. A sub-study of 10 participants will return for serum&#xD;
      prolactin levels on Days 2, 4, 7, 14.&#xD;
