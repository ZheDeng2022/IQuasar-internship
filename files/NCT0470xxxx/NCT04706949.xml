    <description>Pyrotinib: oral administration within 30 minutes after breakfast, 400mg / day, continuous administration for 21 days as a cycle; each continuous pause time and the cumulative pause time of each cycle should not exceed 14 days. It is allowed to suspend the drug for many times due to adverse events.&#xD;
Pemetrexed: the recommended dosage is 500mg / m2, once every three weeks. 3) Carboplatin: the dosage was determined according to Calvert formula, in which AUC was 5mg / ml / min.</description>
