      The objective of this randomized cross-over trial is to evaluate whether Heparin based wet&#xD;
      suction technique, compared with dry suction technique, shall present a higher quality tissue&#xD;
      core by using quantitative macroscopic and microscopic scale.&#xD;

      Background &amp; aim Endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) is the main tool&#xD;
      for tissue acquisition and pathological diagnosis of pancreatic solid mass because of its&#xD;
      superior accuracy and lower complication rate compared to CT-guided biopsy. However, the&#xD;
      tissue adequacy and diagnostic yield remained unsatisfactory for 2 reasons. First, the&#xD;
      conventional dry suction technique (DST) often get small tissue and 3 or more needle passes&#xD;
      (i.e. biopsies) are required to obtain enough specimen. Second, blood contamination of the&#xD;
      acquired tissue interfered with microscopic examination. Investigator aim to develop a novel&#xD;
      technique to improve tissue acquisition within a fewer needle passes and avoid blood&#xD;
      contamination by using heparin-based modified wet suction (H-MWST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This study will be a randomized crossover clinical trial. Patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      solid mass indicated for EUS FNB will be enrolled. EUS FNB will be done by one experienced&#xD;
      endoscopists in National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio to receive EUS FNB with either dry suction technique (DST) or H-MWST first for the&#xD;
      initial 2 needle passes, and then crossover to another suction technique for a total of 4&#xD;
      needle passes. The obtained tissue of each needle pass will be sent separately and examined&#xD;
      by a pathologist who is unaware of the procedure order. Procedure related complications will&#xD;
      be recorded. The primary outcome will be the acquired tissue quality quantified comparison.&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will be the overall diagnostic yield, the specimen adequacy, and&#xD;
      complication rate by each suction technique.&#xD;
