      AIM AND OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To determine the association between periodontal bone loss and maxillary sinus changes&#xD;
      through cone beam computed tomography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES Primary objectives- 1. To compare the presence of maxillary sinus changes in&#xD;
      patients with radiographic evidence of periodontal bone loss with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the correlation between severity of periodontal bone loss with the changes&#xD;
           in maxillary sinus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the mean maxillary sinus mucosal thickening in patients with radiographic&#xD;
           evidence of periodontal disease with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN A retrospective study will be conducted in the department of Oral Medicine and&#xD;
      Radiology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SETTING Hospital based study - CBCT volumes which are available in the archives of Oral&#xD;
      Medicine and Radiology department will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PERIOD This study will be completed in 6 months. STUDY SUBJECTS CBCT volumes of&#xD;
      patients who have undergone CBCT examination between May 2019 and December 2020 for various&#xD;
      dental purposes will be evaluated and the volumes fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      included in the study. The subjects will be divided into 2 groups- Periodontal disease group&#xD;
      and Healthy group, INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Good quality images with visualization of maxillary sinus and maxillary posterior teeth of&#xD;
      at least one side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Signs of endodontic pathology like periapical radiolucency, root canal fillings etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of metal artifacts interfering with the view of the maxilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of trauma or pathologies such as tumours, cysts or malignancies that obscure&#xD;
           the view of the region of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE A minimum sample size of 71 maxillary scans in each group has been calculated to&#xD;
      expect a difference of 26.84% in the prevalence of the 2 groups as ascertained from a pilot&#xD;
      study, at a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since group one will further be divided into 3 classes, a sample size of 225 in each group&#xD;
      shall be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT volumes of patients who have undergone CBCT for various dental purposes between May&#xD;
           2019 to December 2020 available in the archives of Department of Oral medicine and&#xD;
           radiology will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  These scans will be screened for radiographic evidence of periodontal disease i.e.&#xD;
           horizontal or vertical bone loss and bone loss at the furcation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Further, the periodontal bone loss scans i.e. 225 will be divided into 3 groups of 75&#xD;
           each: mild (&lt;25%), moderate (25-50%) and severe (&gt;50%) according to the amount of bone&#xD;
           loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The group with no bone loss will be taken as the control group i.e. 225.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maxillary sinuses will be evaluated according to the following criteria; score range&#xD;
           from 0 to 6 ; 0 - no mucosal changes.,1 - area without cortical bone and with soft&#xD;
           tissue density, thickness &gt;3 mm, parallel to sinus bone wall,2- sinus polyp, 3-antral&#xD;
           pseudo cyst, 4- non-specific opacification,5- periostitis,6- antrolith.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Data will be tabulated in Microsoft Excel sheet. The&#xD;
      results will be expressed as the frequency (%) of maxillary and Mean + Standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) for maxillary sinus mucosal thickening. Normality of data will be assessed and&#xD;
      Chi-square or student T test shall be used for non-parametric and parametric data&#xD;
      respectively. All analysis will be performed by SPSS software version 21. A p value less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered significant for all outcomes.&#xD;

      TITLE: &quot;Association between Periodontal bone loss and Maxillary sinus changes determined&#xD;
      using Cone beam computed tomography-A retrospective study.&quot; RATIONALE: Odontogenic maxillary&#xD;
      sinusitis (OMS) is a type of inflammation of the maxillary sinus mucosa which results from&#xD;
      dental infections such as chronic apical periodontitis, periodontal infections, tooth&#xD;
      extractions and sinus lift procedures. The first and second molars are close to the floor of&#xD;
      the maxillary sinus followed by the premolar teeth and occasionally canine.5In the&#xD;
      otorhinolaryngological literature, the incidence of odontogenic sinusitis has been&#xD;
      underreported in the past, with 10-12% of OMS cases attributed to odontogenic infections.&#xD;
      However, recent studies are suggestive of a much higher incidence i.e. 40% of all cases of&#xD;
      CMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal disease has been attributed as one of the causes of odontogenic maxillary&#xD;
      sinusitis by various studies. The studies done so far offer some limitations such as lack of&#xD;
      a control group, lack of corelation with disease severity, not taking focal sinus thickening&#xD;
      adjacent to the infected tooth into consideration, small sample sizes and lack of clinical&#xD;
      correlation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims to determine the association between periodontal disease and maxillary&#xD;
      sinusitis through cone beam computed tomography in an Indian subpopulation attempting to&#xD;
      overcome the limitations of the previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTION P: Population (Patients with radiographic evidence of periodontal disease&#xD;
      in their CBCT images) I: Intervention (none) C: Control(Patients with no evidence of&#xD;
      periodontal disease in their CBCT images) O: Outcome (Radiographic signs of maxillary sinus&#xD;
      changes) T: Time Frame (6 months) S: Study Design (Retrospective study) Setting in Haryana ,&#xD;
      India Is periodontal bone loss a risk factor for development of maxillary sinus changes?&#xD;
