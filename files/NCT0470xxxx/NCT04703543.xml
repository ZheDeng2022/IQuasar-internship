  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the detection rate of local relapse after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy with either PSMA or 64Cu-PET/CTs and whether the delineation of relapsed&#xD;
      lesions using both methods can facilitate/change the therapeutic strategy of the radiation&#xD;
      oncologist&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PET/TC is a diagnostic tool potentially able to detect, in a single session, both local and&#xD;
      distant disease. However, the sensitivity of 18-F-PET/CT in the identification of relapse on&#xD;
      the prostatic bed, varies greatly and depends on the value of PSA with which the examination&#xD;
      is carried out, the size of the relapse in the lodge, the acquisition protocol and it is&#xD;
      limited by the physiological hyperaccumulation of the tracer in the bladder. The sensitivity&#xD;
      of 18F-Choline PET/TC in our hands is significantly higher than the one that is generally&#xD;
      reported in the literature (76% with PSA values &gt;1 ng/ml after radical prostatectomy), but&#xD;
      still lower than the one of mpMR. PET/CT with 64Cu exceeds the limits of 18F-choline PET/TC&#xD;
      in the study of the prostatic bed, as the tracer used (64Cu) is not excreted by urinary route&#xD;
      and therefore does not accumulate in the bladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: - To evaluate the detection rate of both 64Cu-PET/CT and PSMA-PET/CT of&#xD;
      relapses in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and subsequent biochemical recurrence;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess any change in radiation therapy strategy in terms of lesion delineation and&#xD;
           dose distribution at planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate the performance of both methods (mpMR and PSMA/64Cu-PET/CT) in assessing the&#xD;
           response to radiotherapy with or without androgen deprivation&#xD;
