    <textblock>
      This cohort study aims to evaluate the outcomes of appropriate surgical treatment strategies&#xD;
      in diabetic foot ulcers with different rate of popliteal artery stenosis(&lt;50% or ≥50%). In&#xD;
      this study, patients with Texas university grade 2-4(stage C-D) ischemic diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      will be included. Data of patients who underwent surgical treatment in the past will be&#xD;
      retrospectively collected. The patients with follow-up time less than 12 months will continue&#xD;
      to follow up. Also the postoperative patients will be prospectively collected. Effects of&#xD;
      different surgical strategies, including wound healing therapy, interventional therapy and&#xD;
      tibial transverse bone transport therapy will be measured by several indexes.&#xD;

    <description>In the anteromedial area of the proximal tibia of the affected limb, the external fixation frame was compared with the area along the midline of the medial longitudinal axis of the proximal tibia. Subsequently, two 3.0 Steinmann pins were inserted through the single layer of cortical bone. The skin was cut along the long axis with the 3.0 Steinmann pin as the centre, and the subcutaneous tissue was separate bluntly to expose the periosteum. The Steinmann pins were used as the centre point for the drilling on four sides with a 2.0 drill bit and use of a rapid osteotomy device; the length of each side was 2.5 cm. Subperiosteal osteotomy was performed with a 5-mm narrow bone knife at an angle of 15°-30° to the bone surface. The surgeons should pay attention to protect the blood supply of the periosteum during this procedure. The external fixators were fixed with 4.0 Steinmann pins at the distal and proximal ends. The subcutaneous tissue and skin were sutured.</description>
