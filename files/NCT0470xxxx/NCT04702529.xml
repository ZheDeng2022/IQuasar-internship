    <textblock>
      A multi-treatment proof of concept clinical study is to evaluate the safety, and efficacy of&#xD;
      multiple treatments with Soliton's Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) device for the improvement in&#xD;
      the appearance of fibrotic scars&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soliton's Rapid Acoustic Pulse(RAP) device is an electrohydraulic (EH) device using Soliton's&#xD;
      Rapid Acoustic Pulse (RAP) technology developed to minimize the appearance of scars through&#xD;
      both micro-disruption of the scar matrix leading to scar remodeling and down regulation of&#xD;
      the 'fibrotic fibroblasts'&#xD;
