  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in corneal re-epithelialization (time)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 1 (baseline visit), 2 (±1) (first follow-up visit), 3 (±1) (second follow-up visit), 7 (±1) (third follow-up visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Corneal re-epithelialization will be evaluated through direct observation and photographic recording after application of fluorescein stain. After instillation of a drop of topical anesthetic (tetracaine 0.5%) a fluorescein strip will be applied on the inferior cul de sac while the patient looks upward. Using a slit lamp with magnification of 6x and 16x photographs (at least 6 images for each magnification) will be obtained.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day: 15 (±1) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Presence/absence adverse events, defined as the appearance of any unfavorable reaction in a patient participating in a clinical investigation in which any pharmaceutical product is being administered, regardless of the causal attribution.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 1 (baseline visit), 2 (±1) (first follow-up visit), 3 (±1) (second follow-up visit), 7 (±1) (third follow-up visit) and 15 (±1) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>With the patient's best possible refractive correction, visual acuity will be evaluated through the Snellen chart. Its notation (fraction or decimal) is described as the distance from the chart at which the test is performed, divided by the distance at which a letter equals vertically 5 minutes of arc.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Ocular Comfort Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 7 (±1) (third follow-up visit) and 15 (±1) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular Comfort Index (OCI) Questionnaire will be used for evaluation of tolerability through incidence and severity of dry eye symptoms in a scale from 0 to 100. Greater scores mean a worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain perception</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 1 (baseline visit), 2 (±1) (first follow-up visit), 3 (±1) (second follow-up visit), 7 (±1) (third follow-up visit) and 15 (±1) (final visit)</time_frame>
    <description>Through a questionnaire, patients will be directly questioned about presence and severity of pain and associated symptoms. The scale will be as follows for severity: absent (0), very mild (1), mild (2), moderate (3) and severe (4); and for frequency: never (0), almost never (1), 50% of the time (2), almost all the time (3) and all the time (4).</description>
