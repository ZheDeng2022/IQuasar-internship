  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Sweden, approximately 43,000 people have undergone surgery with ileo-, colo- or urostomy.&#xD;
      The most common type of stomy is a sigmoidostomy. A large proportion, about 50%, of patients&#xD;
      who receive a permanent sigmoidostomy develop a parastomal hernia which may have major&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are indications that specific abdominal exercise may reduce the risk of parastomal&#xD;
      hernias, but randomized studies are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the effect of specific exercise to counteract the development of parastomal&#xD;
           hernia in sigmoidostomy and the hernia's impact on ostomy function, physical function&#xD;
           and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine patients' experience of living with parastomal hernia. The study plans to&#xD;
           include 240 patients who on will undergo surgery and receive a sigmoidostomy. These will&#xD;
           be randomized to receive only advice according to the usual routine to avoid the&#xD;
           development of parastomal hernia or these advice with the addition of specific abdominal&#xD;
           muscle training. The training is initiated before the operation and is then carried out&#xD;
           during the first postoperative year. Follow-up will be done with a clinical assessment&#xD;
           and with measurement of bulge and size of the parastomal hernia manually, with&#xD;
           electronic measuring equipment and via computed tomography images. Patients will assess&#xD;
           their stoma and stoma function and assess any discomfort and its consequences of hernia&#xD;
           via a study-specific questionnaire. Type of ostomy bandage will also be registered. The&#xD;
           evaluation will be carried out 6, 12 and 36 months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of sub-study a, the planned measurement methods to assess whether a&#xD;
      parastomal hernia is present will be tested for validity. In addition, a group of patients&#xD;
      (≥15 people) with parastomal hernia will be included in a qualitative sub-study where they&#xD;
      will be interviewed about their experiences of the hernia hernia and how it may affect daily&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will be able to answer whether specific exercise can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      parastomal hernia. Methods for clinically assessing and evaluating bulging and hernias will&#xD;
      be tested and evaluated in relation to patient-reported symptoms. In addition, the study will&#xD;
      provide information about the patient's experience of having a parastomal hernia and how it&#xD;
      affects daily life and physical activity. The results will provide an increased understanding&#xD;
      of parastomal hernias, which may change the follow-up of patients in the future.&#xD;
