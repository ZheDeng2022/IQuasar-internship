  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been used in many studies as a novel&#xD;
      intervention to treat disorders associated with stroke, including paralysis or dysphagia,&#xD;
      hemispatial neglect, pain, and aphasia. Number of studies have demonstrated that&#xD;
      low-frequency rTMS over the unaffected hemisphere can be useful for enhancing recovery in&#xD;
      aphasic patients.. It is expected that application of high-frequency (facilitatory) rTMS over&#xD;
      the dominant speech area would have a beneficial effect on improving speech performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of excitatory high frequency rTMS on recovery&#xD;
      of aphasia in chronic aphasic patients due to cerebrovascular stroke. Twenty patients with&#xD;
      post-stroke aphasia were enrolled in this study. Patients were selected from those attending&#xD;
      the stroke clinic of Neurology department, Cairo University during the period from June 2020&#xD;
      to November 2020. The protocol of the study was approved by the ethical committee of the&#xD;
      Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University. The aim and procedures of the&#xD;
      study were explained and written consent forms were taken from all patients prior to&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The eligibility criteria were: chronic post stroke nonfluent aphasia due to first-ever&#xD;
      ischemic stroke in the distribution of middle cerebral artery diagnosed clinically and&#xD;
      documented by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging on the brain, right&#xD;
      handedness, both sexes, age ranged from 33 to 66 years old, duration at least 4 months from&#xD;
      stroke onset, patients not receiving speech therapy and educated at least 10 years of&#xD;
      education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were: aphasia due to head injury or neurological disease other than&#xD;
      stroke, other clinical forms of aphasia, unstable cardiac dysrhythmia or cardiac pacemaker,&#xD;
      unstable or critically ill patients, current or history of epilepsy, skull wounds and&#xD;
      pregnant females. Also patients with severe grade of weakness which interfere with writing&#xD;
      ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of aphasia was assessed for every patient using the Aphasia Severity Rating&#xD;
      Scale (ASRS). According to this scale, language deficits were recognized ranging from 0 to 5&#xD;
      points.Every patient was then assessed for linguistic deficits using Kasr El-Eini Arabic&#xD;
      Aphasia test (KAAT), which is a simple, rapid, standardized, valid, and reliable bedside test&#xD;
      for Egyptian patients, literate and illiterate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging studies (computerized tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of&#xD;
      the brain) were done for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Real rTMS was applied three times per week for 10 sessions. Fifty trains of 10-Hz&#xD;
      stimulation, each lasting for 5 seconds with an intertrain interval of 15 seconds were given&#xD;
      through a figure-of-8 coil (9-cm diameter loop) positioned over the left Broca's area of the&#xD;
      affected hemisphere (25 trains over pars triangularis followed by 25 trains over pars&#xD;
      opercularis.The intensity of stimulation was set at 80% of the resting motor threshold (rMT)&#xD;
      for the first dorsal interosseous of unaffected hemisphere.Two parts of Broca's area were&#xD;
      sequentially stimulated: the anterior part (pars triangularis-PTr) and the posterior part&#xD;
      (pars opercularis-POp). To target the regions of interest precisely, the coil was positioned&#xD;
      on the scalp according to the coordinates used by Gough et al.The anterior stimulation site&#xD;
      was 2.5 cm posterior to the canthus along the canthus-tragus line and 3 cm superior to this&#xD;
      line; the posterior stimulation site was 4.5 cm posterior and 6 cm superior to the&#xD;
      canthus-tragus line. The stimulation was applied in the same session with 1000 pulses over&#xD;
      pars triangularis followed by 1000 pulses over pars opercularis in left hemisphere.All&#xD;
      patients were evaluated before, after the end of last session of rTMS and after one month&#xD;
      with ASRS and KAAT. The outcome measures were collected and statistically analyzed&#xD;
