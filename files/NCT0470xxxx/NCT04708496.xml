  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal is a Randomized clinical trial to optimize treatment of malaria in HIV -malaria co&#xD;
      infected patients. It has been demonstrated that, when the antimalarial drug Artemether&#xD;
      Lumefantrine is co administered with Efavirenz based ART in HIV-malaria co-infected&#xD;
      individuals, sub therapeutic levels of the drug are achieved hence resulting in poor malaria&#xD;
      treatment outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study then hypothesizes that, : HIV-malaria co-infected individuals receiving&#xD;
      efavirenz-based ART plus a double-dose or 5-day course of artemether-lumefantrine will&#xD;
      achieve higher and adequate artemether-lumefantrine serum concentrations with adequate 42-day&#xD;
      treatment outcomes compared to individuals with HIV-malaria co-infection receiving&#xD;
      efavirenz-based ART plus a standard-dose of artemether-lumefantrine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria and HIV have significant interactions at various levels. The geographical and&#xD;
      epidemiological overlap increases risk for co-infection and co-treatment. The immune&#xD;
      suppression due to HIV increases malaria incidence, severity and risk for poor treatment&#xD;
      outcomes including mortality and adverse pregnancy outcomes such as anemia and low birth&#xD;
      weight. Malaria infection increases HIV viral replication. Both malaria and HIV are treated&#xD;
      with combination therapy to enhance treatment outcomes and reduce risk for development of&#xD;
      resistance, consequently creating potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) when the two&#xD;
      diseases are treated concomitantly. Previous studies demonstrated significant reduction in&#xD;
      systemic exposure to Artemether, its metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and the long acting&#xD;
      partner drug lumefantrine when the ACT artemether-lumefantrine was co-administered with&#xD;
      efavirenz-based ART to HIV-malaria co-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure to sub therapeutic antimalarial drug concentrations poses a risk for poor malaria&#xD;
      treatment outcomes such as prolonged morbidity, anemia, death and poor birth outcomes for&#xD;
      pregnant women plus increased economic costs and risk for drug resistance. There are&#xD;
      currently limited drug options available for both malaria and HIV treatment especially in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa, thus the need to protect drug effectiveness. There are very scanty data&#xD;
      on effects of drug interactions on malaria clinical outcomes, and such studies would be&#xD;
      unethical currently. Despite these gaps, co-administration of antimalarial and antiretroviral&#xD;
      drugs occurs with no guidance on therapeutic interventions to overcome these deleterious&#xD;
      effects. Data are therefore urgently needed to optimize treatment of malaria for HIV-malaria&#xD;
      co-infected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective: To utilize innovative interventions to overcome drug interactions between&#xD;
      artemether-lumefantrine and efavirenz to guide malaria treatment for individuals co-infected&#xD;
      with HIV and malaria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the safety and Pharmacokinetics of the double dose artemether-lumefantrine&#xD;
           when administered to healthy volunteers (malaria negative and HIV negative individuals).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the safety and Pharmacokinetics of the 5-day course of&#xD;
           artemether-lumefantrine when administered to healthy volunteers (malaria negative and&#xD;
           HIV negative individuals).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and malaria treatment outcome of a standard&#xD;
           dose of artemether-lumefantrine compared to double of the standard dose for weight and a&#xD;
           5-day course of artemether-lumefantrine for treatment of uncomplicated malaria among&#xD;
           HIV-Malaria co-infected individuals receiving efavirenz (400mg) based ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the safety and Pharmacokinetics of artemether-lumefantrine when&#xD;
           administered with Dolutegravir based ART among HIV-malaria co-infected individuals.&#xD;

    <description>The Primary outcome measure will be the malaria treatment outcome adjusted by genotyping and classified as reinfection or recrudescence.&#xD;
Treatment outcomes will be classified on the basis of an assessment of the parasitological and clinical outcomes of antimalarial treatment according to the latest WHO guidelines. Thus, all patients will be classified as having early treatment failure, late clinical failure, late parasitological failure or an adequate clinical and parasitological response.&#xD;
Clinical Treatment outcomes will be assessed according to WHO criteria as; early treatment failure and late treatment failure. Parasitological treatment outcomes will be classified as late parasitological failure and adequate clinical and parasitological response.</description>
