  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nurses can include the child in their occupational activities by using the therapeutic&#xD;
      communication techniques they have learned during their education. However, there is no&#xD;
      occupational-based nursing program that is routinely implemented for children in pediatric&#xD;
      clinics. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of occupational-based&#xD;
      nursing program on increasing child satisfaction as well as reducing the symptoms of&#xD;
      chemotherapy in pediatric oncology patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stressful processes that pediatric oncology patients may be exposed to in the hospital can&#xD;
      have a negative effect on the child's anxiety, decrease in activities, and consequently&#xD;
      recovery and participation in hospital care. These processes are very difficult for school&#xD;
      children as well as for all children. Hospitalization becomes a limiting factor for the&#xD;
      school-age child in this period when he is open to mental and physical development, and he&#xD;
      starts to attach more importance to socialization and independence. In addition, problems&#xD;
      such as painful diagnosis and treatment procedures, side effects of chemotherapy drugs, and&#xD;
      insufficient activity support in the hospital may cause the child to stay away from&#xD;
      activities. For these reasons, pediatric oncology patients spend their time in their rooms&#xD;
      during chemotherapy treatments. With non-pharmacological approaches that can be applied to&#xD;
      pediatric oncology patients, chemotherapy-induced symptoms such as fatigue, pain, anxiety and&#xD;
      nausea can be reduced, as well as helping to spend the time in the hospital more enjoyable&#xD;
      and active. In the studies conducted, it is stated that these approaches are mostly&#xD;
      distracting methods. In this context, the use of distraction methods in nursing care is a&#xD;
      valuable aspect of care. In our country, randomized controlled studies in which nurses use&#xD;
      non-pharmacological methods are quite limited. With the increase of these studies, the use of&#xD;
      effective non-pharmacological methods for pediatric oncology patients will be widespread.&#xD;
      This study was planned to examine the effect of occupational-based nursing program (OBaNuP)&#xD;
      in pediatric oncology patients in reducing the symptoms of chemotherapy and on child&#xD;
      satisfaction. In the experimental part of the study; It is planned to conduct a randomized&#xD;
      controlled single blind experimental study with 60 pediatric oncology patients, including 30&#xD;
      interventions and 30 controls, who received chemotherapy treatment. It is planned to apply&#xD;
      OBaNuP to the initiative group for an average of 30 minutes a day for five days. Since there&#xD;
      is no routine occupational-based nursing program applied to children in the clinic, it is&#xD;
      thought that this study can contribute to both the literature and nursing practices.&#xD;
      Therefore, in the planned study; It is predicted that OBaNuP applied to pediatric oncology&#xD;
      patients can reduce the symptoms of chemotherapy and increase satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>First Session (Rug Weaving Activity): The child and the caregiver will be informed about the purpose and process of the research. The researcher will show in detail how to use rug weaving materials. Rug weaving activity will be started with the child. At the end of the 30-minute practice, the second session with the child will be planned and the session will be ended.&#xD;
Second Session (Rug Weaving Event Continues). Third Session (Rug Weaving Activity Continues): Rug weaving activity will be completed and the session will be ended by planning the fourth session with the child.&#xD;
Fourth Session (Origami Activity): A figure will be made with origami with the child. The child will be given support to make another figure. The fifth session hour will be planned with the child and the session will be ended.&#xD;
Fifth Session (Shape Making Activity with Chenille): A shape will be created with the child with chenille.</description>
