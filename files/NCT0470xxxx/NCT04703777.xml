  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidemics have always affected the most disadvantaged social categories more intensely. This&#xD;
      social inequality is expressed in the use of care and emergencies: greater frequency but also&#xD;
      greater seriousness. Our hypothesis is that, during a period of confinement, the most&#xD;
      disadvantaged populations are more affected by the COVID-19 infection than the rest of the&#xD;
      population. The number of remedies is greater, as is the severity of the forms of infection.&#xD;
