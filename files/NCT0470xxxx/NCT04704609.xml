      1. Perform observational study utilizing real-time quantification of ocular inflammation to&#xD;
           determine minimal important change.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In our current experiments, we have calculated reliability measurements including the&#xD;
           standard error of measurement (SEM) for our software tools. Our hypothesis is that the&#xD;
           minimal important change seen clinically will be at least equal to the standard error of&#xD;
           measurement. This is based on previous work observing the use of SEM as the minimal&#xD;
           important change on outcome scales.56-58 We hypothesize that changes in the imaging&#xD;
           quantification of inflammation scores (IQI) of greater than SEM, will lead to observed&#xD;
           changes in visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To test our hypothesis we will prospectively observe 25 patients with uveitis who are&#xD;
           either active or were recently active in the previous 6 months. All of the patients will&#xD;
           have standard clinical exams at baseline and image quantification of their inflammation&#xD;
           using OCT, OCTA and UWFFA (if needed). At baseline, ETDRS vision, contrast sensitivity,&#xD;
           hand held electroretinography and a visual function questionnaire (NEI-VFQ 25) will be&#xD;
           administered. Patients will be followed for 6 months. During follow-up repeat imaging&#xD;
           quantification of inflammation will be performed along with standard examinations,&#xD;
           visual acuity and contrast sensitivity measurements and hand held ERG. At the final&#xD;
           visit, all tests will be repeated. Data collected will be analyzed using statistical&#xD;
           software package. Correlations between changes in imaging quantification of inflammation&#xD;
           scores and changes in visual acuity, clinical grades of inflammation, visual function&#xD;
           scores and contract sensitivity will be calculated. Expected outcomes include&#xD;
           confirmation that a change in IQI scores greater than standard error of measurement will&#xD;
           result in a clinically meaningful change. We now would have a definition of improvement&#xD;
           and worsening based on changes in IQI scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Image acquisition protocols will depend on subtype of uveitis. In those with anterior&#xD;
           uveitis, only OCT, OCTA and anterior segment OCT will be obtained by study staff. In&#xD;
           those with posterior segment uveitis, UWFFA will be obtained as part of standard of&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective use of changes in imaging quantification of inflammation (IQI) scores in&#xD;
           determining treatment decisions As the above experiment will have defined the scores&#xD;
           required for improvement and worsening, we will assess the use of these tools in making&#xD;
           clinical treatment decisions. We hypothesize that clinician use of imaging based&#xD;
           quantification of inflammation (IQI) scores will impact clinical decision making. We&#xD;
           intend to test our hypothesis with the following experiment. 25 patients with active or&#xD;
           recently active (within 6 months) uveitis will be enrolled in a prospective study. At&#xD;
           baseline patients will have standard of care examinations performed and IQI scores will&#xD;
           be acquired using OCT, OCTA and UWFFA. Patients will be followed over a period of 1&#xD;
           year. At subsequent follow-up visits, IQI scores will be obtained. Prior to the&#xD;
           clinician examining the patient, the IQI scores will be reviewed and compared to the&#xD;
           previous visit(s). The clinician will then fill out a survey form indicating if (s)he&#xD;
           would treat based on IQI scores, observe based on IQI scores, or can't decide by IQI&#xD;
           alone. At this point the clinician would then examine the patient and fill out a second&#xD;
           questionnaire evaluating whether (a) clinical exam agreed with IQI, (b) clinical exam&#xD;
           did not agree with IQI (c) clinical exam did not pick up changes that IQI found. The&#xD;
           patient will then be treated by clinical judgment with clinical exam and IQI scores&#xD;
           available to the physician. The data collected will be analyzed using a statistical&#xD;
           software package. (SAS) Percentage agreement, correlation between exam results and IQI&#xD;
           scores will be assessed.&#xD;
