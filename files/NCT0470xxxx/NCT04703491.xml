    <textblock>
      TreadWill is a fully automated digital intervention that provides a multi-modal treatment for&#xD;
      depressive symptoms. It includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Slides and interactive text-based conversations based on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy&#xD;
           (CBT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mindfulness videos;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Game-based Cognitive Bias Modification paradigms;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An empathetic chatbot. This study's primary aim is to test the differential&#xD;
           effectiveness of this full-featured version of TreadWill compared to a text-based CBT&#xD;
           program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TreadWill is an online tool to deliver automated intervention for depressive symptoms.&#xD;
      TreadWill helps the participants learn the concepts of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT),&#xD;
      and practice mindfulness in an interactive manner. It also has games based on Cognitive Bias&#xD;
      Modification (CBM) and an empathetic chatbot. We hypothesize that participants using&#xD;
      TreadWill will show a significant reduction in depressive symptoms and will show engagement&#xD;
      with the program. To test this hypothesis, we are conducting a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
      We will randomize participants into three groups: experimental, active control, and waitlist.&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the experimental group will get access to the full-featured&#xD;
      version of TreadWill as described above. Participants randomized to the active control group&#xD;
      will have access to a limited version of TreadWill designed to deliver basic CBT in plain&#xD;
      text format. The waitlisted participants will be put on a waitlist for 6 weeks.&#xD;
