      study aim is to determine the effect of whole body vibration training (WBVT) on body mass&#xD;
      index, serum prolactin concentration as a risk factors for breast cancer and severity of hot&#xD;
      flashes in obese postmenopausal women.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is a physiological process characterized by spontaneous cessation of menstrual&#xD;
      cycle lasting at least 12 months, it is normally occurring in women aged 45 - 55 years .&#xD;
      Postmenopausal women have higher prevalence of menopausal symptoms that significantly affect&#xD;
      their quality of life more than pre- and perimenopausal women .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased adiposity, as measured by high body mass index, is associated with more severe&#xD;
      menopausal symptoms also, obese female has a high risk lifestyle for the development of&#xD;
      post-menopausal breast cancer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between BMI and breast cancer risk is likely to be due to increased concentrations&#xD;
      of bioavailable estradiol, which results in turn from an increase in the production of&#xD;
      estrogens by aromatase in the adipose tissue, conversion of hormones in fatty tissue and a&#xD;
      decrease in the serum concentration. This is likely to explain the higher risk of breast&#xD;
      cancer in overweight post-menopausal women .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopause is also associated with atherogenic changes, including a worsening of CVD risk&#xD;
      factors and decreased aerobic fitness compared with premenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initially may be due to a decrease in endogenous estrogen levels, and likely further&#xD;
      exacerbated by increased adiposity and reductions in exercise habits or physical activity&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post menopausal women recorded a high serum prolactin concentration however, they have a&#xD;
      significant chance of normalizing their prolactin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum prolactin levels rise transiently after several physiological states including&#xD;
      pregnancy, breast-feeding, exercise, meals, sexual intercourse, minor surgical procedures,&#xD;
      general anesthesia, other forms of acute stress and menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogen is another key regulator of prolactin and has been shown to increase the production&#xD;
      and secretion of prolactin from the pituitary gland. In addition to dopamine and estrogen, a&#xD;
      whole range of other hormones can both increase and decrease the amount of prolactin released&#xD;
      in the body, with some examples being thyrotropin-releasing hormone, oxytocin and&#xD;
      anti-diuretic hormone .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole-body vibration training is a promising adjunct intervention therapy for management of&#xD;
      obesity, as there is few evidence that it can reduces body mass index and enhances muscles&#xD;
      strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In initial stage of obesity management, WBVT is highly recommended because it allows a mild&#xD;
      joints stress, deconditioning for obese patient with poor motivation because it achieve its&#xD;
      target without provoking an excessive fatigue. In addition, Passive vibrations do not involve&#xD;
      voluntary movement and need a lower contribution of central command, so WBVT is as effective&#xD;
      as aerobic and resistance exercise in reducing fat mass and moderating the deficit of the&#xD;
      relative muscle strength . Lastly, WBVT may be effective in vascular health promotion and&#xD;
      prevention in young obese women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole body vibration training(WBVT) has been recognized as an effective alternative exercise&#xD;
      modality to resistance exercise for its ability in enhancing force and power, generating&#xD;
      capacity in skeletal muscle, increasing bone mass, improving cardiovascular function,&#xD;
      reducing fat mass and moderating the deficit of the relative muscle strength. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      the effect of resistance exercise on prolactin has not been extensively studied .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, this study was conducted to evaluate the effect of whole body vibration training on BMI,&#xD;
      waist circumference, serum prolactin concentration and hot flashes in obese postmenopausal&#xD;
      women.&#xD;
