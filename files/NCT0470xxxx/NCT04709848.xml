    <textblock>
      Strongyloidiasis is a worm infection which affects more than 100 million people, mostly in&#xD;
      Africa, Asia and Latin America, and can cause severe illness in people with reduced immunity.&#xD;
      In the UK, the number of people with Strongyloides is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust (ICHNT) , screening for Stongyloides has recently&#xD;
      been introduced as a standard-of-care for all patients undergoing BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will perform two cross-sectional surveys and report the&#xD;
      prevalence of Strongyloides in BMT recipients at ICHNT , as well as comparing clinical&#xD;
      outcomes before/after the introduction of routine testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Strongyloidiasis is a worm infection which affects more than 100 million people, mostly in&#xD;
      Africa, Asia and Latin America. Infection can persist for decades, and usually causes mild&#xD;
      symptoms. In some people with reduced immune systems (for example those who have bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation), the worms can multiply and cause severe illness and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the UK, the number of people with Strongyloides is not known. However, in many other&#xD;
      non-tropical countries, rates are high in immigrant populations (including those who are&#xD;
      having bone marrow transplantation, BMT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At ICHNT, screening for Stongyloides has recently been introduced as a standard-of-care for&#xD;
      all patients undergoing BMT. All adult patients with forthcoming BMT at ICHNT will now be&#xD;
      screened. Additionally, any patients who have already undergone BMT in the last two years&#xD;
      will be screened as part of a look-back exercise as part of their clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will perform two cross-sectional surveys. Those who underwent&#xD;
      BMT between Jun 2018 - July 2020 will form a 'pre-screening group', and those between July&#xD;
      2020 - July 2021 will form a 'screened group'. It is anticipated that 320 participants will&#xD;
      be included in the pre-screening group and 160 in the screened-group (total 480).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected retrospectively and the prevalence of Strongyloides in BMT recipients&#xD;
      at ICHNT will be reported. Comparison of clinical outcomes between the first and second&#xD;
      groups will be undertaken, in order to determine whether the introduction of screening has&#xD;
      had an impact.&#xD;
