      Study objectives: To determine if, for critically ill patients on renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (RRT) for acute kidney injury (AKI), randomization to receive albumin fluid (25%) boluses&#xD;
      versus normal saline placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Reduces hemodynamic instability and/or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improves achievement of fluid removal goals with RRT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Ontario, approximately 15% of patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) develop&#xD;
      severe kidney failure that necessitates treatment with dialysis. Dialysis is a blood-cleaning&#xD;
      treatment that replaces kidney function but does not actually help the kidneys to heal. While&#xD;
      dialysis is life-saving, the treatments themselves may actually prevent the kidneys from&#xD;
      recovering. This is because many patients experience low blood pressure (hypotension) during&#xD;
      dialysis treatments. Hypotension can cause further damage to these patients' already-injured&#xD;
      kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies show that patients with higher blood levels of a protein called albumin may be&#xD;
      protected from having hypotension during dialysis. Whether or not giving patients intravenous&#xD;
      albumin can prevent hypotension during dialysis and lead to faster kidney recovery is&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will determine if increasing ICU patients' blood albumin levels by giving them&#xD;
      intravenous albumin fluid during dialysis treatments can prevent hypotension. The findings of&#xD;
      this study could lead to faster kidney recovery and less need for ongoing dialysis treatments&#xD;
      for patients who get severe kidney failure in ICU.&#xD;
