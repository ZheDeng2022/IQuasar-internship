    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, 3-way crossover randomized study in adult healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      evaluate the relative bioavailability of TT-00420 tablet and capsule formulations and to&#xD;
      evaluate food effect on the pharmacokinetics of TT-00420 tablet.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment sequences. Each sequence will contain&#xD;
      up to 8 subjects. In each treatment sequence, subjects undergo a baseline/screening period,&#xD;
      three treatment periods, and a follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be administered a single dose of TT-00420 on Day 1 of either TT-00420 tablet&#xD;
      under fed condition, TT-00420 tablet under fasting condition, or capsule under fasting&#xD;
      condition and crossed over after at least a 14-day washout period.&#xD;
