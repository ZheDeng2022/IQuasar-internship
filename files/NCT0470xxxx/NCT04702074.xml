  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCM syndrome differentiation treatment&#xD;
      on the rehospitalization rate of discharged elderly patients with community acquired&#xD;
      pneumonia(CAP)and to explore its mechanism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence and mortality of elderly patients with CAP are on a rising trend, especially&#xD;
      the mortality of those over 65 years old are the highest. The elderly patients with CAP have&#xD;
      more complications and drug resistance, which makes it difficult to treat and have heavy&#xD;
      burden on the society. The discharged elderly patients with CAP are still facing the risk of&#xD;
      readmission or even death due to recurrent pneumonia or other reasons. Research reports&#xD;
      showed that TCM syndrome differentiation treatment had a certain role in improving the&#xD;
      condition of discharged elderly patients with CAP. Our previous exploratory studies suggested&#xD;
      that TCM syndrome differentiation treatment on the discharged elderly patients with CAP had&#xD;
      good clinical efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of TCM syndrome differentiation on the rehospitalization rate of&#xD;
      discharged elderly patients with CAP and to explore its mechanism. 292 patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to experimental group or control group for 2 months&#xD;
      treatment and 6 months follow-up.The experimental group will be given by Bu Fei Jian Pi Hua&#xD;
      Tan granule or Yi Qi Yang Yin Qing Fei granule based on TCM syndrome differentiation. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes are rehospitalization rate. The secondary outcomes include mortality,&#xD;
      assessment of disease severity(CURB65 scores),quality of life (SF-36), treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction(ESQ-CAP),Clinician Reported Outcome for CAP,Patient Reported Outcome for&#xD;
      CAP,nutritional status (MNA-SF).&#xD;
