  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the efficacy of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) in treating patients with novel&#xD;
      coronavirus (COVID-19) infection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, prospective, observational cohort study. A total of 150 cases who&#xD;
      test positive for the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) will be recruited. Presenting to the&#xD;
      emergency room of the study site, these cases will be treated with N-acetylglucosamine (NAG)&#xD;
      in 700 mg doses every 12 hours as first-line treatment for 30 days. Standard of care (e.g.,&#xD;
      remdesivir approved for emergency use in severe cases, ventilator for patients with&#xD;
      respiratory failure, etc.) will be provided based on the patient's clinical needs, which will&#xD;
      be at the discretion of the treating physician. Upon admission, the research team will record&#xD;
      patient demographics, comorbidities, symptoms, disease severity (as assessed by the World&#xD;
      Health Organization Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement), need for supplemental oxygen,&#xD;
      and time from symptom onset until hospital arrival. The research team will also collect&#xD;
      bloodwork for the following at admission: white blood cell count (WBC), hematocrit (HCT),&#xD;
      hemoglobin (HBG), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). During the study period, discretionary treatments and&#xD;
      interventions will be recorded daily until study exit. The primary outcomes of interest are&#xD;
      rate of intubation, hospital length of stay, and mortality. Secondary outcomes of interest&#xD;
      include intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU length of stay (LOS), supplemental oxygen&#xD;
      duration, rate of hospice initiation, and poor clinical outcome (defined as combined&#xD;
      death/hospice initiation).&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>The conclusions that can be drawn from this study are limited by the relatively small number of participants, lack of randomization, use of a retrospective control arm, use of consecutive patients, temporality of different study arms in different stages of the pandemic, taking place at a single center, concomitant therapies, and potentially confounding baseline variables. These limitations were considered necessary costs in order to rapidly provide information during the COVID-19 pandemic.</limitations_and_caveats>
