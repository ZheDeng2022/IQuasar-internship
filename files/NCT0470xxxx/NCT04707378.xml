  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depressive symptoms are common non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease and&#xD;
      seriously affect the quality of life and prognosis of patients. Currently, treatment measures&#xD;
      for patients with Parkinson's disease with depression are mainly limited to pharmacotherapy,&#xD;
      but the side effects of antidepressants and their interaction with anti-Parkinsonian drugs&#xD;
      limit the use of pharmacotherapy. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a&#xD;
      new painless and non-invasive neuromodulation technique that is commonly used in the&#xD;
      treatment of depression. As the number of people with Parkinson's disease increases in China,&#xD;
      the number of patients with Parkinson's disease and depression requiring rTMS treatment will&#xD;
      also increase. The size and shape of individual brains, the distance between the stimulation&#xD;
      coil and the responding neuronal tissue, and the location and orientation of anatomical&#xD;
      structures are all different, and the use of common localization methods is usually limited&#xD;
      by these individual anatomical differences. The traditional method relies on manual&#xD;
      positioning of the coil, which is time-consuming and inefficient, and it is difficult to meet&#xD;
      the requirements of position, angle, and coil orientation simultaneously. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that the benefits of using navigation for rTMS treatment are up to twice as high as those of&#xD;
      non-navigation methods. Therefore precise localization is a must for the future standardized&#xD;
      application of rTMS in the development of patients with Parkinson's disease with depression.&#xD;
      In this study, we applied repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation with neuronavigation&#xD;
      to treat patients with Parkinson's disease and depression, and reconstructed cephalometric&#xD;
      models with individual cranial imaging data to individualize and precisely target stimulation&#xD;
      sites, making rTMS more precise and effective in treating patients with Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      and depression, and providing new avenues for further clinical and scientific research.&#xD;

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is an effective instrument used to measure the quality and patterns of sleep in adults. It differentiates &quot;poor&quot; from &quot;good&quot; sleep quality by measuring seven areas (components): subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunction over the last month. A total score is then calculated of all items which can range from 0 to 21. A higher score is indicative of worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire that's routinely used to assess daytime sleepiness. The person filling in the questionnaire rates how likely they are to doze off during the day in different situations. Each of the activities listed has an assigned score from 0 to 3 that indicates how likely a person is to fall asleep during the activity, and the total score can range from 0 to 24. A higher score is associated with increased sleepiness.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS-2) allows people with Parkinson's Disease to self-rate and quantify the level of sleep disruption being experienced. Each of the sleep disruption listed has an assigned score from 0 to 4 that indicates the sleep disruption frequency within a week, and the total score can range from 0 to 60. A higher score is associated with increased sleep disruption.</description>
