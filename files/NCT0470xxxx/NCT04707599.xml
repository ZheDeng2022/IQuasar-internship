  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Missed appointments to outpatient substance use treatment are common and costly and can have&#xD;
      a negative effect on the health of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this quasi-experimental study, the investigators used an on-off design to examine whether&#xD;
      a reminder &quot;plus&quot; intervention (telephone call from therapist before first appointment) would&#xD;
      increase attendance and improve cancellation and rebooking practices. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      included satisfaction with treatment and intention to complete the treatment program.&#xD;
