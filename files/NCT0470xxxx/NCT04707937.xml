  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although brachytherapy is an effective treatment modality for gynecological cancer, a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients develop late treatment-related vaginal toxicity,&#xD;
      negatively impacting their quality of life and limiting recurrent disease detection by&#xD;
      preventing adequate clinical examination during the post-treatment surveillance period.&#xD;
      Consistent with the literature, results from a study at Princess Margaret revealed that&#xD;
      current vaginal toxicity management education and training may be inadequate. The&#xD;
      investigators seek to implement and evaluate a new online brachytherapy discharge education&#xD;
      program (BrachDEP) to support patient engagement in self-management.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy used to treat patients with gynecological&#xD;
      cancers. Brachytherapy delivers radiation to cancerous tissue by inserting or placing the&#xD;
      radiation next to the target tissue. A common side effect that develops as a result of&#xD;
      repeated brachytherapy is fibrosis, a thickening and hardening of tissue, as well as&#xD;
      narrowing of the vagina, known as vaginal stenosis. To reduce the impact of vaginal stenosis,&#xD;
      vaginal dilation is recommended upon discharge of brachytherapy. Vaginal dilation involves&#xD;
      the insertion of a smooth plastic tube into the vagina 3 to 4 times per week. Despite the&#xD;
      benefits of vaginal dilation, use of vaginal dilators is low among patients following&#xD;
      brachytherapy. This poor adherence to vaginal dilator use may be due to embarrassment,&#xD;
      discomfort, and lack of awareness of the benefits to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the whether an online brachytherapy&#xD;
      discharge education program increases patient satisfaction with education and care. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine whether the online education program increases patient quality of&#xD;
      life, improves vaginal dilator compliance and reduces rates of vaginal stenosis&#xD;
      post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will use a randomized, controlled trial study design. The impact of the&#xD;
      online education program will be identified by comparing the outcomes of participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm against those patients in the control arm. Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      and randomized to one of two arms that will determine whether they will receive the education&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance The results from this study will be used to improve the brachytherapy discharge&#xD;
      education program.&#xD;
