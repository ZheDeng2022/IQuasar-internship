      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analyze prospectively the prevalence of subclinical oculomotor disorders (OMDs) in&#xD;
           different phenotypes of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and to study correlations with brain MRI&#xD;
           T2 data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  highlight link between modification of visual exploration strategies to decode emotions,&#xD;
           and social behavioral disorders, in patients with demyelinating disease, from early to&#xD;
           clinically definite stages.&#xD;
