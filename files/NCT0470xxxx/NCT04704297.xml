    <textblock>
      Rationale: Low back pain (LBP), or myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) of the low back, accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 2.63 million visits in the United States, or 2.3 percent of annual&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) visits. An estimated 100 billion dollars per year is lost from LBP.&#xD;
      Approximately one-third of this is direct costs. Previous studies have established the safety&#xD;
      of trigger point injections (TPI). However, the results of these studies are highly&#xD;
      heterogeneous regarding TPI's ability to treat pain or improve functional outcomes. The two&#xD;
      most promising TPI studies conducted in the ED have been published in the last two years.&#xD;
      They both suffered from a small sample size. Additionally, they suffered from a combination&#xD;
      of limitations including: lack of randomization, inconsistent medical management, lack of a&#xD;
      follow-up assessment, and lack of patient centered functional outcomes. These studies were&#xD;
      both two armed and either compared standard medical management to TPI with local anesthetic&#xD;
      or TPI with local anesthetic to TPI with Normal Saline (NS). One of these studies concluded&#xD;
      that TPI is generally beneficial. The other concluded that TPI with NS is superior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that standard therapy (ST) plus TPI with 8&#xD;
      mL of 0.5 percent Bupivacaine is superior to ST alone or ST plus TPI with 8 mL of NS for the&#xD;
      treatment of the pain associated with MPS of the low back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: This will be the first TPI study to compare ST, to TPI with local anesthetic,&#xD;
      and TPI with NS for LBP conducted in an ED. It will also be the first TPI study to&#xD;
      incorporate a patient centered functional outcome and patient follow-up after discharge from&#xD;
      an ED. TPI's are a popular treatment modality for LBP among many Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      Providers. However, to date, there is limited evidence for or against it. The investigators&#xD;
      are hopeful that this study will answer whether or not trigger point injections are&#xD;
      benefiting patients and, if so, which type of TPI is most beneficial.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Significance: Low back pain (LBP) is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department (ED), accounting for 2.63 million visits in the united states and 2.3 percent of&#xD;
      ED visits annually.1 An estimated 100 billion dollars per year is lost from low back pain.&#xD;
      One-third of this is direct costs.2 For the United States military, in 2015, 195,844 acute&#xD;
      cases of LBP were identified, leading to significant loss of person-hours.3 The definitions&#xD;
      of durations, or types, of LBP vary among sources. For example, the American Association of&#xD;
      Family Physicians defines acute low back pain as six to 12 weeks of pain and chronic pain as&#xD;
      anything more than 12 weeks.4 A more specific definition used by The American College of&#xD;
      Physicians defines acute LBP from 0-4 weeks, subacute LBP as 5-12 weeks, and chronic low back&#xD;
      pain as greater than 12 weeks.5 A specific definition of chronic low back pain is essential&#xD;
      if including acute on chronic low back pain in a study. These specific definitions will not&#xD;
      only be used for demographics, they will also aid in excluding other causes of LBP from the&#xD;
      study such as fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.6,7 The&#xD;
      investigators will include exacerbations of chronic LBP, but they will have to satisfy a&#xD;
      specific definition. An excepted definition of an exacerbation of chronic low back pain is an&#xD;
      increase of 1.5 cm above baseline pain on a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS). The&#xD;
      justification is that this is outside the standard deviation of typical back pain&#xD;
      estimations.8 As this study of LBP focuses on TPIs, the investigators are narrowing the&#xD;
      definition of LBP to myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) of the low back. The investigators chose&#xD;
      this definition as MPS is defined by trigger points.9 Use of MPS is also consistent with&#xD;
      prior TPI studies of LBP.10-15 The trigger points of MPS are recognized clinically by having&#xD;
      two out of three of the following criteria: a taut band of muscle on exam, reproduction of&#xD;
      pain upon palpation, and referred pain along a band of muscle upon palpation.16-18 The two&#xD;
      most promising TPI studies previously conducted in the ED have been published in the last two&#xD;
      years.19,20 They both suffered from a small sample size. Additionally, they suffered from a&#xD;
      combination of limitations including: lack of randomization, inconsistent medical management,&#xD;
      lack of a follow-up assessment, and lack of patient centered functional outcomes.19,20 These&#xD;
      studies were both two armed and either compared standard medical management to TPI with local&#xD;
      anesthetic or TPI with local anesthetic to TPI with Normal Saline (NS).19,20 One of these&#xD;
      studies concluded that TPIs are generally beneficial.19 The other concluded that TPIs with NS&#xD;
      are superior.20 The investigators endeavor to complete a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      that definitively answers whether TPIs with local anesthetic are superior to TPIs with NS in&#xD;
      an ED setting. The investigators will also be comparing both of these treatments to standard&#xD;
      therapy (ST). Bupivacaine was chosen as it is the longest acting commonly available local&#xD;
      anesthetic in most EDs.21 The investigators hypothesize that TPIs with Bupivacaine are&#xD;
      superior to TPIs with NS or ST. If the investigators are correct this simple and inexpensive&#xD;
      treatment could have a large impact on the financial burden and loss in person-hours caused&#xD;
      by MPS of the low back.1-3,21&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The invistigators will innovate by building upon lessons learned from previous TPI studies&#xD;
      for MPS conducted in the ED.19,20 The study has also been designed with the best practices of&#xD;
      CONSORT standards in mind.22 Unlike previous studies, this RCT will include three groups, ST,&#xD;
      ST plus TPI with Bupivacaine, and ST plus TPI with NS. Additionally, each of these treatment&#xD;
      arms will be highly regimented to improve the quality of evidence the investigators produce.&#xD;
      The investigators will also follow up with study participants via telephone at 60-72 hours to&#xD;
      determine if the treatment provided more than temporary pain relief. Lastly, the&#xD;
      investigators will incorporate a patient centered functional score.23 A measure of functional&#xD;
      ability is particularly relevant to MPS given its associated cost in lost person-hours.2 To&#xD;
      date, such an endeavor to investigate TPIs in the ED has not been undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in the Emergency Department at Madigan Army Medical Center on&#xD;
      Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Tacoma, WA. This is an academic center and level II trauma center&#xD;
      with an annual Emergency Department census of 60,000. It is home to an Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      Residency program and serves as a tertiary referral center for Department of Defense&#xD;
      personnel in the Pacific Region. This study has approval from the local Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective 3-armed RCT. The first arm will be ST. The second army will be ST&#xD;
      plus TPI with 8 mL of 0.5 percent Bupivacaine. The third arm will be ST plus TPI with 8 mL of&#xD;
      NS. The first arm will be single blinded as it will be obvious to medical professionals that&#xD;
      the patient is not receiving trigger points. The remaining two arms will be double blinded.&#xD;
      The ST arm will be highly standardized to eliminate variation in treatment. It will also&#xD;
      contain no narcotics or benzodiazepines. ST will consist of 975mg of Acetaminophen PO and&#xD;
      either 30mg of Ketorolac IM or 15 mg IV. Upon discharge ST will consist of prescriptions for&#xD;
      acetaminophen 650mg every 4 hours by mouth, Ibuprofen 400mg every 4 hours by mouth, and 10 mg&#xD;
      of cyclobenzaprine nightly by mouth. If a potential participant is allergic to any of the&#xD;
      study medications, they cannot participate. Additionally, participants will be provided a&#xD;
      handout going over these medications and the use of heat for low back pain and instructions&#xD;
      on the performance of McKenzie stretching exercises for low back pain.4 Bupivacaine was&#xD;
      chosen as it is the longest acting local anesthetic commonly available in most EDs. With a&#xD;
      toxic dose of 2mg/Kg, 8 mL is well within safety limits for the study population as it only&#xD;
      contains 40mg of Bupivacaine.21 NS was chosen as the third arm as it is the primary TPI&#xD;
      treatment that local anesthetic TPIs are compared to, Bupivacaine and NS are also identical&#xD;
      in appearance.12,21 It is possible that participants will be able to tell which TPI they have&#xD;
      received based on Bupivacaine's anesthetic properties.21 To address this, the investigators&#xD;
      will be asking participants that received a TPI to guess which medication they received on&#xD;
      the data collection form. 30-minutes following study medication administration, data will be&#xD;
      collected. 60-72 hours after treatment is initiated, telephone follow-up will be completed by&#xD;
      a member of the study team. This time frame was chosen as it is a clinically relevant&#xD;
      timeframe for ED bounce backs.24 Additionally, this time frame is well beyond four half-lives&#xD;
      of Bupivacaine (2.7 hours x 4 = 10.8 hours).21 This ensures that the data collected at&#xD;
      telephone follow-up will not be influenced by any lingering impact of the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to begin enrolling participants January 2nd, 2021. The institution's&#xD;
      Research Pharmacist will contact one of the institution's statisticians to obtain a&#xD;
      randomization scheme. The investigators will then be sent pre-drawn up and pre-randomized&#xD;
      medications for storage in the ED medication refrigerator. Participants randomized to ST will&#xD;
      be represented by empty syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to enroll participants as a convenience sample. Although continuous&#xD;
      enrollment would be ideal, the research team consists of nine investigators, five of which&#xD;
      are Emergency Medicine Residents. Given off-service rotations and a small research team,&#xD;
      providing 24-hour coverage for enrollment is not feasible. Review of the EDs census over the&#xD;
      last three months revealed that the ED sees a minimum of 40 patients a month for the chief&#xD;
      complaint (CC) of &quot;low back pain&quot;. A review of the census in the three month prior to the&#xD;
      COVID-19 outbreak revealed that this number is less than half of the number of patients the&#xD;
      investigators usually see for the CC of &quot;low back pain&quot;. This is very likely due to a&#xD;
      decreased ED utilization rates for non-emergent CC's during COVID-19. The investigators&#xD;
      suspect that as vaccinations become more widely available, these numbers will normalize.&#xD;
      However, if the census remained as is and the investigators operate under the assumption that&#xD;
      the investigators could reasonably capture 50 percent of the LBP patients that came through&#xD;
      the Emergency Department, it would take us a minimum of nine months to complete the study.&#xD;
      With these assumptions, enrollment would be complete in June of 2022.&#xD;
