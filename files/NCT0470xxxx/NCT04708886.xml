    <textblock>
      This two-year open-label pilot clinical trial will evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      romosozumab to treat bone loss in females with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and&#xD;
      osteoporosis (OP). Participants will receive monthly injections of romosozumab during the&#xD;
      first 12 months of the study. During the second year, participants will take oral alendronate&#xD;
      tablets on a weekly basis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, singe-arm, open-label pilot study to evaluate safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      sequential drug treatment (12 months of romosozumab injections followed by 12 months with&#xD;
      alendronate tablets) to treat bone loss in women with chronic SCI and OP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first year, participants will receive monthly subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      romosozumab 210 mg. This drug works by increasing bone formation and is FDA-approved for&#xD;
      treating OP in post-menopausal women at high risk of fracture or those who did not benefit&#xD;
      from using other available OP treatments. During the second year, participants will take&#xD;
      weekly oral alendronate 70 mg. Alendronate is FDA-approved for the treatment of osteopenia&#xD;
      and the treatment of OP in post-menopausal women and men as well as for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of glucocorticoid-induced OP. In this study, it will be used to help maintain any&#xD;
      increases in bone mass gained from the year of treatment with romosozumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve participants will receive the study drug treatment, take daily supplements (calcium&#xD;
      and vitamin D), and return to the research site for study visits over the course of two&#xD;
      years. Computerized tomography (CT) imaging, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) imaging,&#xD;
      and serum bone markers will be collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
