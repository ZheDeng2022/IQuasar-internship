  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection remains the only curative option for primary or metastatic liver cancer, but&#xD;
      a more accurate prediction of post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is needed to further&#xD;
      reduce morbidity and mortality and to extend the indication to a wider patient population.&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance Imaging (MRI) is a promising new source of liver function tests as it can&#xD;
      provide segmental function alongside measurements of perfusion, tissue structure and standard&#xD;
      morphological assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of HEPARIM is to determine if quantitative MRI biomarkers of liver function&#xD;
      and perfusion can improve predictions of post-hepatectomy liver function, as measured by an&#xD;
      indocyanine green (ICG) liver function test. Secondary aims is to validate the MRI&#xD;
      measurements of liver function against ICG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HEPARIM is an observational cohort study recruiting patients referred locally for a one- or&#xD;
      two-stage liver resection of 2 segments or more. Before surgery, all participants will&#xD;
      undergo an ICG liver function test and a Dynamic Gadoxetate-enhanced (DGE) MRI scan of the&#xD;
      liver. The ICG test will be repeated at one day after surgery. The Gadoxetate Clearance (GC)&#xD;
      of the future liver remnant (FLR-GC) will be determined from the DGE-MRI data and correlated&#xD;
      to the post-operative ICG R15 as primary outcome measure. Preoperative ICG R15 will be&#xD;
      correlated against GC of the whole liver (WL-GC) to address the secondary objective. In&#xD;
      patients that undergo a staged hepatectomy, an additional MRI and ICG test will be performed&#xD;
      before the first stage to assess its effect on volumetric and functional growth of the FLR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional pre- and postoperative data will be collected from medical records including&#xD;
      demographics and medical histories, biochemistry, pathology and radiology reports, and any&#xD;
      long-term outcome data collected in the 90-day follow-up visit. These data will be used in a&#xD;
      multi-variate analysis to determine which preoperative biomarkers are most predictive of&#xD;
      immediate and long-term outcomes, to identify the added value of functional MRI over routine&#xD;
      clinical markers, and to derive a multi-variate prediction model that can be validated in&#xD;
      future studies.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) To determine if DGE-MRI can improve predictions of post-hepatectomy liver function; (2)&#xD;
      To validate DGE-MRI based measurements of liver function against gold-standard liver function&#xD;
      tests; (3a) to determine if preoperative DGE-MRI can improve predictions of post-operative&#xD;
      PHLF; (3b) to develop a multi-parametric prediction model for 90-day post-operative outcome&#xD;
      combining MRI, clinical chemistry and patient history; (3c) To determine the relationship&#xD;
      between volumetric and functional liver growth after portal vein embolisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients considered for major liver resection will be identified at the Hepatobiliary&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team (MDT) meeting at St James University Hospital Leeds, and contacted by&#xD;
      phone. Patients will have at least 3 days to consider this information, and after that they&#xD;
      will be contacted by the member of their clinical care team to schedule the baseline visit.&#xD;
      Formal written consent will be obtained on the day of the visit. If they don't consent to&#xD;
      participation, then only the MRI scans will be collected and stored in their medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE VISIT&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial dataset will be captured incorporating the patient's medical history and&#xD;
      up-to-date investigations. This will be obtained through a combination of patient interview,&#xD;
      review of paper notes and review of the patient's electronic medical record. An MRI safety&#xD;
      screening form will be administered. If a contraindication to MRI is found at this point, the&#xD;
      visit will be cancelled, and the patient will be excluded from the study. An ICG safety&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to exclude patients with contraindications to ICG use. Patients&#xD;
      excluded from ICG testing at this point will not be excluded from the study as other measures&#xD;
      of liver function will still be available for analysis of tertiary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be cannulated and ICG will be administered intravenously as a bolus dose of 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg through the cannula. The ICG will be reconstituted with 5 ml of water for injection for&#xD;
      every 25 mg of ICG, leading to a dilution of 5mg ICG per 1 ml. Serial percutaneous ICG&#xD;
      measurements will then be taken using an ICG clearance meter using a finger clip device&#xD;
      (LiMON; Maquet, Germany). Patients will lie in the supine position and calibration will be&#xD;
      performed before testing starts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to derive absolute ICG concentrations, two separate blood samples of 2.5mL each will&#xD;
      be taken, both after ICG injection (pre-operative). The samples will be processed and stored&#xD;
      in a dedicated facility in the Leeds Institute for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine&#xD;
      (LICAMM) and analyzed as a batch at the end of the study. The remaining samples will be&#xD;
      stored for a maximum of 5 years to measure metabolomics data for secondary research. After 5&#xD;
      years any remaining samples will be destroyed according to standard LICAMM procedure for&#xD;
      sample disposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI will be performed straight after ICG measurement in the 3 T MRI by radiographers of&#xD;
      the department. The scan will last max 1.5hrs and will include the injection of a standard&#xD;
      dose of MRI contrast agent Gadoxetate (Primovist, Bayer AG). The same cannula will be used to&#xD;
      administer the MRI contrast as for the ICG test. Other scans that will be taken in the same&#xD;
      session include T1- and T2-weighted anatomical imaging, T2*-mapping, T1-mapping,&#xD;
      proton-density fat fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGERY AND FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline visit some patients will require re-discussion in the MDT and all patients&#xD;
      will attend for a preoperative clinic appointment. A proportion of patients will not progress&#xD;
      to surgery due to clinician or patient choice; these patients will not be followed up&#xD;
      further. The data that has already been collected will be used for addressing the secondary&#xD;
      objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative measurements of the resected liver segments will be taken, including weight&#xD;
      and volume (measured using fluid displacement). After surgery, data obtained as part of the&#xD;
      patient's standard intra and post-operative care will be collected from their medical&#xD;
      records. This includes any blood tests during admission, the characteristics of the&#xD;
      operation, complications and length of stay. Pathology results will be collected. The ICG&#xD;
      test with the finger-clip device will be repeated postoperatively at bedside to determine a&#xD;
      reference value for postoperative liver function. This will be performed on day 1&#xD;
      post-surgery if feasible. A PHLF score will be determined according the International Study&#xD;
      Group of Liver Surgery (ISGLS) definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who underwent surgery will attend the hospital for a routine post-operative&#xD;
      clinic appointment after 90 days. Data from this appointment will be collected by the&#xD;
      clinical research fellow, including complications, readmissions and mortality. At the end of&#xD;
      the study patients who have requested to do so will be sent a summary of the study's findings&#xD;
      and implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVE/ALPPS ARM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients requiring portal vein embolisation (PVE) or Associating Liver Partition and Portal&#xD;
      vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) will be recruited in the same way as&#xD;
      participants in the resection arm. They will attend the same baseline visit and the routine&#xD;
      clinic visit. Patients may decline the PVE/ALPPS at this point, or the clinician may decide&#xD;
      it is inappropriate at the clinic appointment. If this occurs and the patient proceeds to&#xD;
      surgery, they will remain in the study. If they do not proceed to surgery their data will be&#xD;
      used to address the secondary objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient who does proceed to PVE/ALPPS will attend the hospital for a routine computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) scan after the first stage, and a second research visit will be scheduled at&#xD;
      that point. This visit will proceed in the same manner as the baseline visit. They will be&#xD;
      re-discussed in the MDT and come for a preoperative clinic appointment. Patients may be&#xD;
      deemed ineligible for surgery, or make the decision not to proceed with surgery, in which&#xD;
      case their data already collected can feed into the secondary objectives. If they do proceed&#xD;
      to surgery, the same intra-operative and post-operative data will be taken as for the&#xD;
      resection arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to recruit 134 participants into the study, which will include an estimated 122 in&#xD;
      the primary surgery arm and 12 in the PVE arm. Of the 134 recruited participants an estimated&#xD;
      112 will feed into the primary objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation assessed the impact of study size by simulating a hypothetical&#xD;
      population of 1 million patients and evaluating model robustness to estimate the model beta&#xD;
      coefficient of FLR-GC in relation to ICG clearance. Modelling was informed by pilot data in&#xD;
      29 cases. 10k samples of 122 patients are drawn with replacement, generating empirical&#xD;
      distributions of the parameters. Results demonstrated that even at the poorest precision&#xD;
      simulated, the fixed sample of 122 is sufficient to obtain reliable beta coefficients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis shall be performed by Professor Gilthorpe at the University of Leeds&#xD;
      using the anonymized data sheet and the RStudio software package (RStudio, Boston, USA). A&#xD;
      univariable analysis will be performed comparing FLR-GC against post-operative ICG-R15&#xD;
      (primary objective) and WL-GC against preoperative ICG-R15 (secondary objective). Second the&#xD;
      correlations will be investigated in a multivariable analysis to determine if the MRI adds&#xD;
      value to existing preoperative biomarkers, which MRI biomarkers are most predictive, and to&#xD;
      derive a model for predicting PHLF. It will then be tested whether this combined score is&#xD;
      significantly worse when DGE-MRI is removed from the prediction. In the PVE/ALPPS group,&#xD;
      changes in volume will be correlated to changes in function of the FLR between pre&#xD;
      PVE/pre-ALPPS and post-PVE/post-ALPPS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA MANAGEMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifiable data will not be accessed by researchers outside of the clinical care team and&#xD;
      are only retained for quality control, backup, and to follow-up on any incidental findings.&#xD;
      Anonymised research data will be recorded using the participant's study ID. Paper forms used&#xD;
      for data capture will be stored in a secure location in St James University Hospital.&#xD;
      Electronic research data will be stored in a participant study record in a secure database in&#xD;
      St James University Hospital, and in password protected network drives set up and maintained&#xD;
      by University IT. Additional databases will be set up to retain the source data for further&#xD;
      processing, including MRI in DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) format,&#xD;
      raw ICG data, and digitized histopathology slides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI data will be recorded using the patient ID in the secure Picture Archiving and&#xD;
      Communication System (PACS) of the radiology department. Routine radiology reports will be&#xD;
      retrieved and included in the participant's anonymous study file. The MRI images will be&#xD;
      transferred anonymously from the scanner to the university's DICOM database, where they will&#xD;
      be analyzed by a research fellow to extract the relevant imaging biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All excel sheets with anonymised study data will be transferred to a long-term data&#xD;
      repository where they will be maintained for a minimum of 25 years. Source data for MRI and&#xD;
      ICG will be retained indefinitely in a dedicated imaging data management system hosted by the&#xD;
      University to enable secondary research, educational use, and data sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCIDENTAL FINDINGS AND BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data collected for the study, except calculated MRI biomarkers and ICG measurements, are&#xD;
      acquired as part of the routine workup and will therefore be available to the clinical care&#xD;
      team through the patient's medical records. All ICG liver function measurements from finger&#xD;
      clip device will be reviewed separately by the hepatology consultant. Any unusual findings&#xD;
      will be flagged up to the clinical care team as incidental findings, and dealt with according&#xD;
      to usual practices. For those patients that have an extra MRI scan as part of their&#xD;
      participation in the study, these MRI's will be reviewed by a radiologist. Any unusual&#xD;
      findings will be flagged up to the clinical care team as incidental findings, and dealt with&#xD;
      according to usual practices. Unvalidated MRI biomarkers will not be reviewed for incidental&#xD;
      findings or otherwise communicated to the clinical care team. The non-clinical research&#xD;
      fellows working on analysis of MRI and ICG data will be blinded to the clinical history of&#xD;
      the patient and other function tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL OF PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient decides to withdraw their consent to inclusion in the study at any point then no&#xD;
      further data regarding their care will be collected. Should the patient wish, data collected&#xD;
      up until withdrawal of consent will be destroyed using the hospital's confidential waste&#xD;
      bins. Patients who lose their capacity to consent after initial inclusion in the study for&#xD;
      reasons that are not related to their surgery will be treated in the same manner as if they&#xD;
      had withdrawn consent. Previously collected data will not be destroyed. If a patient is&#xD;
      unable to complete their MRI study for any reason they will automatically be withdrawn from&#xD;
      the study. Data collected until the point of withdrawal will be retained.&#xD;
