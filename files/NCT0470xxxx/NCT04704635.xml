  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is thought to cause disability immediately after stroke followed by a 3-to-6-month&#xD;
      recovery period, after which disability levels are supposed to stabilize unless recurrent&#xD;
      events occur. However, studies showed that post-stroke recovery is heterogeneous. While some&#xD;
      stroke survivors quickly recover, others may show an accelerated accumulation of disability&#xD;
      over time. The current prospective observational study will investigate trajectories of&#xD;
      multidimensional functioning and self-rated health in the year after stroke. Particularly,&#xD;
      the study aims to explore the relationship between trajectories of disability and self-rated&#xD;
      health. Moreover, the study will focus on potential predictors of changes in disability and&#xD;
      self-rated health, i.e., views on aging and psychological resilience. Patients will be&#xD;
      recruited during their stay at the stroke unit and participate in a face-to-face interview&#xD;
      and four follow-up telephone interviews in the post-stroke year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic strokes have shown to have long-term impact on functional health apart from their&#xD;
      acute effects on neurological functioning. Stroke survivors may experience long-term physical&#xD;
      disability, psychopathological symptoms and cognitive decline. Even though these potential&#xD;
      consequences are well studied, knowledge on post-stroke trajectories of multidimensional&#xD;
      functional health according to the Word Health Organization's (WHO) International&#xD;
      Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) and their predictors is rare.&#xD;
      Particularly, there is a lack of studies investigating the trajectories of self-rated health&#xD;
      and different indicators of functional health in the year post-stroke. Therefore, the current&#xD;
      study aims to explore trajectories of disability and self-rated health in the year&#xD;
      post-stroke, and is the first to analyze the relationship between these trajectories.&#xD;
      Thereby, the study addresses the research question whether changes in disability can be&#xD;
      predicted by prior self-rated health or changes of self-rated health, and vice versa.&#xD;
      Moreover, the study examines the correspondence between changes of disability and self-rated&#xD;
      health in the year post-stroke. Additionally, views on aging and psychological resilience,&#xD;
      which are relevant to coping processes, are studied as predictors of changes in disability&#xD;
      and self-rated health. Patients recruited during their stay at the stroke unit will&#xD;
      participate in one face-to-face interview in hospital and four telephone follow-up interviews&#xD;
      at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-stroke. Moreover, physical functioning will&#xD;
      be externally assessed during their hospital stay and 12 months post-stroke. To increase the&#xD;
      knowledge on post-stroke trajectories of multidimensional health is of major importance to&#xD;
      identify patients at risk for accelerated accumulation of disability. Findings from the&#xD;
      current study may contribute to the improvement of post-stroke rehabilitation and secondary&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;

        mimic. The number of TIA patients is limited to 20% of the sample to avoid a bias towards&#xD;
