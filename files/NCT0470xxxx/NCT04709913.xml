  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 14-day multiple ascending dose trial in high BMI volunteers in up to 4 cohorts of&#xD;
      10 high BMI volunteers each consisting of 8 receiving HU6 and 2 receiving placebo. Upon&#xD;
      review of the safety and PK data, it may be decided to expand the current cohort size and/or&#xD;
      dose escalate to the next cohort. In addition, the sponsor may elect not to enroll all 4&#xD;
      cohorts based on safety and/or PK and/or PD data, or enlist an additional cohort at a higher&#xD;
      dose if deemed safe.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Double-blind dosing will occur in cohorts 1 through 4. In these cohorts, 8 subjects will&#xD;
      receive HU6 and 2 will receive matching placebo. Doses will escalate and may be modified&#xD;
      based on results of safety and pharmacokinetic evaluation conducted after each cohort.&#xD;
