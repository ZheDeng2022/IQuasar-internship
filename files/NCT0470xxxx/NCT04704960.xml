  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will detect circulating tumor DNA in blood of patients with lung metastases&#xD;
      from colorectal cancer using NGS technology and intend to use it for predicting the outcome&#xD;
      of local treatment (surgery or radiation) and recurrence of lung metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators produce customized gene target panel by selecting genes that are commonly&#xD;
      found in colorectal cancer and metastasis from existing literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients diagnosed with lung metastases from colorectal cancer, 20mL of whole blood is&#xD;
      collected before and after local treatment (surgery or radiation) and cell-free DNA (cfDNA)&#xD;
      is extracted from the collected blood. Thereafter, 20 mL of whole blood is additionally&#xD;
      collected once after 3 months (±2 months) and once after 6 months (±2 months) during&#xD;
      follow-up and cfDNA is extracted. The investigators perform sequencing from the extracted&#xD;
      cfDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators compare the mutations detected in cfDNA before and after local treatment&#xD;
      and identify the trend of reducing mutations in cfDNA after local treatment. So The&#xD;
      investigators discover biomarkers for the outcome of local treatment. The investigators also&#xD;
      search for mutations for target drugs from mutation profiling of cfDNA.&#xD;
