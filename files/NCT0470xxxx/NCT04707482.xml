      This study focused on the key nodes, molecular events and regulatory mechanisms of intestinal&#xD;
      microecological disorders that affect the malignant transformation of intestinal epithelial&#xD;
      cells into tumors during the occurrence and development of colorectal cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase Ⅰ is a cross-sectional study to record selected information and biospecimen of more&#xD;
      than 250 sporadic colorectal adenoma cases (200 cases with convetional adenomas, 25 cases&#xD;
      with hyperplasticpolyps and 25 cases with TSA/SSAs), 50 cases of sporadic colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (early cancer), 50 cases with familial inherited colorectal cancer (FAP and LS) or healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ⅱ is a nested case-control study. A total of 250 patients with sporadic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (early stage cancer) or sporadic colorectal adenoma will be included in Phase Ⅱ and&#xD;
      regular follow-up to observe the recurrence and progress after resection of the lesions of&#xD;
      colorectal adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The end point of the study is the recurrence of bowel adenoma or carcinoma and follow-up time&#xD;
      is five years. After the observation, each case with the study outcome was matched with&#xD;
      corresponding controls in a 1:1 ratio for further analysis according to the conditions such&#xD;
      as age and gender.(Due to the particularity of single-cell sequencing, all specimens that&#xD;
      meet the test requirements were sent for examination, and a nest-type case-control design was&#xD;
      not adopted.)&#xD;
