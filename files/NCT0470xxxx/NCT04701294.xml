      Objective: Determine which of the two sealants has better retention during the periods of 6,&#xD;
      9 and 12 months, one based on flowable resin with sprg or the other only based on flowable&#xD;
      resin and we have the following hypothesis: the retention of the sealant based on a flowable&#xD;
      resin with sprg is greater than a sealant based on a flowable resin in permanent first molars&#xD;
      at different periods &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: 60 children from the school in the district of Pichanaki, Peru and&#xD;
      aged 6 to 8 years were included in this study. The Split mouth design will be adopted, and&#xD;
      120 permanent first molars are designated.It will be applied on the upper / lower first&#xD;
      molars with sealant material being the order assigned according to the previous&#xD;
      randomization, for the intervention group they will be sealed based on flowable resin with&#xD;
      sprg (giomer F03 beautifil-Shofu) in association with a bottle of adhesive (single bond) and&#xD;
      on the contralateral side the upper / lower first molars will be sealed, the control group&#xD;
      will be sealed with a flowable resin-based resin compound (Tetric N-Flow ivoclar vivadent) in&#xD;
      association with a bottle of adhesive (Single Bond). Placement of materials on the right /&#xD;
      left side of the mouth will be randomly assigned following block randomization procedures&#xD;
      with a 1:1 allocation using the random block sizes of 4 and 8 (35).A computerized random&#xD;
      number generator will be used. A total of 120 upper / lower molar teeth will be sealed with&#xD;
      both materials (60 teeth for each material). The materials will be placed by the same&#xD;
      operator according to the protocol of UNMSM for the sealing of pits and deep fissures; then,&#xD;
      the interventional group will be compared after a 12-month follow-up with controls at 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months. The statistical analysis will be with SPSS software 20.0. Since all the data&#xD;
      in this study will be categorical, nonparametric statistics will be used. Expected result:&#xD;
      After the evaluation period it is expected to find significant differences in the retention&#xD;
      of the sealant to flowable resin base with sprg (giomer F03 beautifil -Shofu) and sealant&#xD;
      based on flowable resin (Tetric N- Flow ivoclar vivadent) using an adhesive system .&#xD;
      Conclusion: Identify and quantify the retention of a sealant based on flowable resin with&#xD;
      sprg (giomer F03 Beautifil -Shofu) and a sealant based on flowable resin (Tetric N-Flow&#xD;
      ivoclar vivadent) using an adhesive system on 12 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Data collection techniques: Phase 1. Coordination with the Ethics and Parental&#xD;
           Authorization Committee The Research Ethics Committee of the Institute of Tropical&#xD;
           Medicine Daniel Alcides Carri√≥n UNMSM will give us the first pass. Letters of invitation&#xD;
           will be made and they will be distributed in class through the teachers, and each&#xD;
           student will take it home to deliver to their parents or guardians; Each letter&#xD;
           (envelope) will have the informed consent (Annex 1), the informed consent (Annex 2),&#xD;
           data record sheet (Annex 3) and an informative bulletin (Annex 4) where it explains all&#xD;
           the procedure that will be carried out for each participant, there will also be an&#xD;
           informative talk at the school for parents and teachers, where they will be informed&#xD;
           about the study and will collect the envelopes. Research will not force any child to&#xD;
           participate; each will have the option of choosing to participate in the study by verbal&#xD;
           assent. A report will be delivered to the parent or guardian of the child after the&#xD;
           intervention. Informed consent process Researcher 1 will give an informative talk about&#xD;
           the study and will collect the envelopes containing the informed consent, informed&#xD;
           consent and data record sheet). Students and parents who accept participation will&#xD;
           receive a summons for subsequent dental visits (Annex 5). It will collect the consents&#xD;
           signed by both parents / guardians and in the event that the signature of one of the&#xD;
           parents cannot be obtained either due to impossibility (death, difficulty in obtaining&#xD;
           the signature, absence and reasons of personal strength)(39)Only the signature of one&#xD;
           will be accepted to give consent; and informed assent if the child reports that he&#xD;
           understands and is mature enough to understand(39). Diagnostic Process Assistant 1 will&#xD;
           be in charge of bringing the students for their dental check-up and will also provide&#xD;
           the materials to operator 1 who will do the oral hygiene and prophylaxis index&#xD;
           procedure. Afterwards, operator 2, who has 10 years of experience, will be previously&#xD;
           calibrated according to the ICDAS II criteria, using the visual method, he will detect&#xD;
           and classify the lesions according to the International System criteria. Detection and&#xD;
           Evaluation of Caries (ICDAS-II) (26) and the teeth that will represent scores 0 and 1&#xD;
           will be selected. The inclusion and exclusion criteria mentioned above will be taken&#xD;
           into account; and patients who have at least one pair of homologous permanent first&#xD;
           molars that meet the same requirements will be considered. The assistant 2 will be in&#xD;
           charge of filling in the data sheets of the participants. Operator 1 will evaluate the&#xD;
           Simplified Oral Hygiene Index until you reach an OHS score of 1 over a period of one&#xD;
           month. Researcher 1 will select the participants taking into account the inclusion and&#xD;
           exclusion criteria and will deliver the list of those participants to the programmer for&#xD;
           randomization. Treatment randomization process The name of each participant will be&#xD;
           coded by letters, this will be done by the programmer; the materials are going to be&#xD;
           coded by number and the cards are going to be worked with these codings for their&#xD;
           subsequent data analysis. And regarding patient data, it will only be handled by the&#xD;
           programmer who will be in charge of coding, randomizing the first permanent molars,&#xD;
           randomizing the materials to be used so that it is placed in the first permanent molars&#xD;
           and this information will be given to the coordinator so that the put in sealed&#xD;
           envelopes and then these sealed envelopes will be given to a housekeeper so that said&#xD;
           data is not disclosed or published. In case this section of data confidentiality is in&#xD;
           the informed consent it could be mentioned. The programmer will give the randomized list&#xD;
           to the coordinator and the coordinator will give the external assistant who is not&#xD;
           participating in the clinical trial in sealed envelopes labeled by each participant.&#xD;
           This external assistant will bring the randomized patient for treatment. Allocation&#xD;
           concealment mechanism process and implementation The programmer without participation in&#xD;
           the clinical trial will do the randomization sequence generating the list of numbers&#xD;
           randomly assigned to participants and will be created with Stata 16 statistical software&#xD;
           (Stata Corp. College Station, TX). The investigators will give this list to the&#xD;
           coordinator and this external assistant will receive the envelopes and will take care of&#xD;
           taking the patient to receive treatment. Blinding process Blinding will be strictly&#xD;
           maintained; by emphasizing it on the operators, assistants, evaluators, workers of the&#xD;
           educational institution and the parents / guardians and participants. While the&#xD;
           participants, operators, evaluators, assistants assigned to carry out the diagnosis,&#xD;
           procedure and placement of the material, will not know the brand of the pit and fissure&#xD;
           sealant, due to which will be covered with kraft paper, labeled and numbered .Outcome&#xD;
           assessors and data analysts will be blinded to allocation. &quot;The investigators who&#xD;
           performed the intervention procedure will not take any result measures. Procedures&#xD;
           process Assistant 3 will be in charge of labeling with kraft paper and listing the&#xD;
           intervention material A and B (giomer F03 beautifil-Shofu and Tetric N-Flow ivoclar&#xD;
           vivadent) in prior coordination with the research coordinator. Operator 3 and assistant&#xD;
           4 will be previously trained and calibrated; they will do the procedure, without knowing&#xD;
           the names of the sealants.A split-mouth study design will be used and will be used as&#xD;
           follows; It will be applied on the upper / lower first molars with sealing material,&#xD;
           being the order assigned according to the previous randomization, for the intervention&#xD;
           group they will be sealed based on fluid resin s-prg (giomer F03 beautifil-Shofu) in&#xD;
           association with a bottle of adhesive (single bond) and on the contralateral side, the&#xD;
           upper / lower first molars will be sealed, the control group will be sealed with a fluid&#xD;
           resin compound based on flowable resin (TetricN-Flow ivoclar vivadent) in association&#xD;
           with a bottle of adhesive (Single Bond). Placement of materials on the right / left side&#xD;
           of the mouth will be randomly assigned following block randomization procedures with a&#xD;
           1:1 allocation using the random block sizes of 4 and 8(35). A computerized random number&#xD;
           generator will be used. A total of 120 upper / lower molar teeth will be sealed with&#xD;
           both materials (60 teeth for each material). The materials will be placed by the same&#xD;
           operator according to the protocol UNMSM for the sealing of pits and deep fissures.&#xD;
           Steps for the application of the sealant, the teeth will be isolated with cotton rolls&#xD;
           carefully and the assistants 4 will hold a plastic saliva ejector to avoid contamination&#xD;
           of the saliva and facilitate the operative procedures of the occlusal surfaces of the&#xD;
           upper molars and / or lower for each operator: The occlusal surfaces will be cleaned&#xD;
           using water, brush and low hand piece; wash and dry of the occlusal surface; then&#xD;
           deproteinization will be done with sodium hypochlorite (5.25%) for 60 seconds, wash with&#xD;
           a water / air spray for 30 seconds; and dry. The tooth will then be etched using a 37%&#xD;
           orthophosphoric acid gel for 15 seconds, rinsed with a water / air spray for 30 seconds,&#xD;
           and dried with cotton balls. For the intervention, the sealants will be covered and&#xD;
           listed on Kraft paper, it will be sealed for the intervention fluid resin with sprg&#xD;
           (giomer F03 beautifil-Shofu) and for the control group it will be sealed with fluid&#xD;
           resin (Tetric N- Flow). Subsequently, a uniform layer of fluid composite resin will be&#xD;
           applied and it will be light-cured for 11 seconds using an LED curing unit with an&#xD;
           output of 1500 mW / cm2 (Gnatus). The cotton rolls and plastic saliva ejector will be&#xD;
           removed, and the occlusion will be checked with articulating paper. The operator will&#xD;
           not know the brand of sealant to be used, because it will be covered with Kraft paper&#xD;
           and will be delivered by another person(assistant) previously trained for this activity&#xD;
           and both materials have a similar color. The child will also not be informed about the&#xD;
           brand of the material used. The assistant 5 will collect the data on the card. An&#xD;
           average attendance will be 6 participants per day with time intervals to prepare the&#xD;
           work environment between each procedure. Evaluation and monitoring process: Assistant 6&#xD;
           will bring and take the participants to operator 4 who will do the prophylaxis and help&#xD;
           fill out the cards. Operator 5 with at least ten years of experience it will be&#xD;
           previously trained, evaluated and calibrated; in accordance with ICDAS-S II criteria and&#xD;
           retention of sealants. The calibration will be given by the Kappa measure (Œ∫ &gt;0.7).&#xD;
           Operator 5 will not have performed the pit and fissure sealants procedure, he will&#xD;
           record the retention of the sealant in a period of 6, 9 and 12 months. Follow-up of&#xD;
           sealed teeth will be observed in good lighting, after tooth prophylaxis. Evaluation will&#xD;
           be performed with an oral mirror and periodontal probe. Each sealant is classified as&#xD;
           follows: Total retention of the sealant in all pits and fissures (RT). Partial retention&#xD;
           of sealant in some pits and fissures (PP). Total loss of sealant in all pits and&#xD;
           fissures (TP): no trace of materials is detected on the surface. The coordinator will be&#xD;
           in all the evaluation follow-ups. Statistical process The Statesman informs the&#xD;
           coordinator of the tooth coding and materials. Phase 2. Calibration The researcher who&#xD;
           will diagnose and apply the pit and fissure sealants will be trained by a principal&#xD;
           teacher the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, calibrated in ICDAS II and in&#xD;
           Minimal Intervention Dentistry. Phase 3. Pilot Study The pilot phase had the purpose of&#xD;
           planning and organizing the study, measuring work time, the four-hand technique,&#xD;
           preparing the materials for treatment (covering the sealants with a Kraft paper),&#xD;
           recording the information and the evaluation in controls. This pilot will take place in&#xD;
           the Juan Pablo Vizcardo y Guzm√°n School.&#xD;

      ADVERSE EVENTS A. THE PROCEDURES FOR OBTAINING, RECORDING AND MONITORING ADVERSE EVENTS BY&#xD;
      THE INVESTIGATOR AND THEIR NOTIFICATION TO THE SPONSOR The investigators have a registration&#xD;
      form that is in annex 11 and that will be monitored at 6, 9 and 12 months, the investigators&#xD;
      will be in constant communication with the school and parents and / or guardians will be able&#xD;
      to communicate and this information is in the Appendix 1.It is important to remember that the&#xD;
      rights, welfare and safety of research participants will always prevail over the interests of&#xD;
      science and society. Therefore, study participants should be supervised and any suspected&#xD;
      adverse event (AE) will be addressed by the study dentist. There is a record of adverse&#xD;
      events (Annex 11), where you can record any reaction such as: dental caries, premature&#xD;
      contact points and allergy. In case of an adverse event (AE); the first contact will be with&#xD;
      the dentist of the responsible study who is in the province of Pichanaki. Immediate&#xD;
      tele-dentistry will be done to see the problem. It will be referred within 48 hours in the&#xD;
      pertinent time. in dentistry, adverse problems are considered emergencies and not&#xD;
      emergencies. The sponsor, school principal, parents, ethics committee, and study&#xD;
      investigators will be informed.The progress of the clinical trial will be monitored every 3&#xD;
