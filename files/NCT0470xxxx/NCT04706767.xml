  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Some studies have revealed that intravenous (IV) lidocaine or dexmedetomidine&#xD;
      might improve the quality of recovery undergoing laparoscopic surgery. The investigators&#xD;
      investigated whether co-administration lidocaine and dexmedetomidine could better improve the&#xD;
      the quality of recovery after laparoscopic total hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: One hundred and forty-four women with elective laparoscopic total hysterectomy were&#xD;
      randomly divided into four groups: Patients in group L received a bolus infusion of lidocaine&#xD;
      (2%; 1.5 mg/kg over 10 min before the induction of anesthesia), and then lidocaine was&#xD;
      infused at a rate of 1.5 mg/kg/h until close the pneumoperitoneum. Patients in group D&#xD;
      received a bolus infusion of dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg over 10 min before the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia), and then dexmedetomidine was infused at a rate of 0.4 μg/kg/h until close the&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum. Patients in group LD received a bolus infusion of lidocaine (2%; 1.5 mg/kg)&#xD;
      and dexmedetomidine (0.5 µg/kg) over 10 min before the induction of anesthesia, and then&#xD;
      lidocaine and dexmedetomidine were infused at a rate of 1.5 mg/kg/h and 0.4 µg/kg/h until&#xD;
      close the pneumoperitoneum, respectively. Patients in group C received the same volume of&#xD;
      normal saline 10 min before the induction of anesthesia, and then normal saline (0.9%) was&#xD;
      continuously infused in an equal volume until close the pneumoperitoneum. Primary outcome was&#xD;
      the quality of recovery (QoR-40) at 1 day prior to sugery, 1 day after sugery, and 2 days&#xD;
      after sugery. The secondary outcomes included perioperative remifentanil consumption,&#xD;
      postoperative VAS scores, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, postoperative&#xD;
      rescue analgesics and anti-emetics, recovery time, extubation time, and Ramsay sedation scale&#xD;
      at 5 min, 10min, 30 min, 60 min after extubation.&#xD;
