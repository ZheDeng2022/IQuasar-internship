  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous Lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic autoimmune connective tissue disease with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 14.6 - 73.2/100,000, predominantly in women in mid adulthood. Cutaneous lesions&#xD;
      occur in about 75-80% of patients with systemic lupus erythematodes.These lesions&#xD;
      unfortunately and invariably lead to significant scarring and postinflammatory hypo- and&#xD;
      hyperpigmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have reported that laser treatments in patients with CLE have a positive&#xD;
      effect and safety. However, only few case reports exist about the effect of ablative lasers&#xD;
      such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2) and Erbium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (Er:YAG) lasers in CLE&#xD;
      scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although no study shows a flare-up of CLE after laser treatment of the scars, many physicians&#xD;
      are afraid of treating these often stigmatizing scars. Considering the huge psychological&#xD;
      impact of facial scaring on quality of life, it is essential to explore and assess the value&#xD;
      of already well-established treatment options for the management of scars also in patients&#xD;
      with cutaneous lupus erythematodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hereby the study seeks the subjective and objective improvement of the CLE-scars after&#xD;
      treatment with fractional Er:YAG laser compared to control (untreated) areas.&#xD;
