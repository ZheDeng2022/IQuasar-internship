  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Anxiety and depression often&#xD;
      accompany the treatment phase of oncology patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since both anxiety and depression are associated with increased inflammatory activity, these&#xD;
      preoperative symptoms may predispose patients to the development of postoperative&#xD;
      neurocognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to reveal the correlation of preoperative anxiety with early&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction in patients with breast cancer who will undergo surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the treatment of oncological disease, %13-19 of these patients show symptoms of&#xD;
      anxiety and depression.Although many factors affect the development of postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction, there are several well-known risk factors and are thought to be due to&#xD;
      increased inflammatory activity.Inflammation and immune dysfunction are common in oncological&#xD;
      patients. It has also been reported that the presence of increased central nervous system&#xD;
      inflammatory reactivity affects cognitive function.Since both anxiety and depression are&#xD;
      associated with increased inflammatory activity, these preoperative symptoms may predispose&#xD;
      patients to the development of postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction is an unwanted postoperative condition and is thought to&#xD;
      be particularly relevant to elderly patients. Most studies in the literature have focused on&#xD;
      the elderly. However, younger patients tend to experience more anxiety and depression during&#xD;
      cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies indicate that age is inversely correlated with emotional distress and younger&#xD;
      patients tend to experience higher levels of anxiety during diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, younger patients have more limited life experiences to help them cope with such&#xD;
      traumatic situations. The preoperative anxiety rate was found twice as high in female&#xD;
      patients compared to male patients. Younger patients with bone cancer, breast cancer, and&#xD;
      prostate cancer were three times more likely to report anxiety among the tumor groups than&#xD;
      older patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the definition, degree and duration of postoperative cognitive dysfunction have been&#xD;
      well researched, the effect of preoperative anxiety on the development of postoperative&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction has not been studied in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are scheduled for elective breast surgery will be included in the study, who are&#xD;
      informed and agree to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the beginning of the study, consecutive patients will be included in the&#xD;
      study.Preoperative Moca test and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Test (STAI FORM TX - I State&#xD;
      Anxiety Inventory) questionnaire form will be filled in with the patient through one-on-one&#xD;
      interview and in the early postoperative period. After the test ASA scores, age,&#xD;
      comorbidities, demographic data, education levels, duration of anesthesia and surgery, and&#xD;
      vital parameters will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1st week) MoCA test will be applied and its relationship with POKD will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with preoperative MoCA score (M0) 21/30 points and above; It will be re-evaluated on&#xD;
      the 7th postoperative day (M1) and a 4 unit decrease in M1 score from M0 score will be&#xD;
      considered as POKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correlation between preoperative anxiety level and early postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction (POCD) will be investigated.&#xD;

    <description>The researcher will perform the neurocognitive level with a face-to-face interview with the moca test before surgery. In the postoperative period, the test will be repeated on the 7th day.&#xD;
If the moca test is above 21, it will be considered normal. and the patient will be enrolled.&#xD;
A decrease of 4 units in the moca test on the 7th postoperative day will be considered as postoperative cognitive dysfunction.</description>
