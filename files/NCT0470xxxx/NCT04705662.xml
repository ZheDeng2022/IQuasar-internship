  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over recent years there has been a lot of research looking at how the bacteria in our gut&#xD;
      affects our health. Some medications are known to cause changes in gut bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients that are prescribed iron report gastrointestinal side effects. This research&#xD;
      project aims to see if the cause of the gastrointestinal side effects is due to iron causing&#xD;
      changes in the gut bacteria. This can be detected via measuring the levels of hydrogen and&#xD;
      methane and other compounds in the breath and stool.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common health issue worldwide, with approximately &gt;1.2&#xD;
      billion people affected. In the UK, iron deficiency anaemia most commonly affects pre-school&#xD;
      aged children and women aged 15-49 years. In 2011, an estimated 14% of non-pregnant, and 23%&#xD;
      of pregnant women in the UK had iron deficiency anaemia, and 2-5% of male and post-menopausal&#xD;
      women were also affected. Whilst compared to other areas of the world IDA has a mild public&#xD;
      health significance to the UK, it can be the reason for up-to 13% of referrals to&#xD;
      gastroenterologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treating IDA with oral supplements or IV infusions are both effective at restoring bodily&#xD;
      iron stores. However, success is often greater in those receiving their iron intravenously,&#xD;
      due to frequent non-adherence to oral tablets as a result of their side effects.&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal complaints, most commonly constipation, are reported by up to 60% of people&#xD;
      that take oral iron supplements. These GI complaints causes up to 50% of patient to not&#xD;
      follow their treatment plan, meaning their iron deficiency anaemia persists. However,&#xD;
      patients that receive intravenous iron infusions instead do not report these symptoms. This&#xD;
      suggests that oral iron has an impact on the GI tract as intravenous iron will bypass the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal lumen but the mechanism of this remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the side effects of oral iron supplements and research a potential mechanism&#xD;
      for the cause of iron supplement side effects, this study will require healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      take ferrous sulphate for 4 weeks. Pre and post intervention participants will be required to&#xD;
      provide a stool sample, complete a breath test and answer questionnaires.&#xD;
