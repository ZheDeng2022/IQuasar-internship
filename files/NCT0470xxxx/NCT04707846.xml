    <textblock>
      This Personalized Trial will test the feasibility and effectiveness of employing technology&#xD;
      to facilitate remote N-of-1 interventions to research participants with self-identified&#xD;
      fatigue. Participant's initial levels of fatigue and other outcomes will be assessed in a&#xD;
      baseline period 2 weeks in length. Participants will spend 12 weeks alternating between&#xD;
      bright light therapy, dim light therapy, and usual care methods to treat their fatigue, while&#xD;
      answering daily questions and wearing an activity tracker. After 14 weeks, participants will&#xD;
      have the ability to share their opinions about the Personalized Trials platform. The&#xD;
      investigators believe a Personalized Trials platform will be satisfactory to participants and&#xD;
      feasible to scale to large randomized controlled trials, and eventually to clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      : This Personalized Trial will test the feasibility of employing technology to facilitate&#xD;
      remote N-of-1 interventions to research participants with self-identified fatigue. Symptoms&#xD;
      of fatigue will be defined using the PROMIS Fatigue measures. Following a 2 week baseline&#xD;
      assessment period, participants will be randomized in a multiple crossover design to receive&#xD;
      bright blue light therapy, dim blue light therapy, and usual care in 6 treatment periods 2&#xD;
      weeks in length (12 weeks total). Participants will be randomly assigned to 2 groups&#xD;
      receiving treatments in different order. Group 1 will receive treatments in the following&#xD;
      order: bright light, dim light, usual care, usual care, dim light, bright light. Group 2 will&#xD;
      receive treatments in the following order: usual care, dim light, bright light, bright light,&#xD;
      dim light, usual care. Light therapy will be delivered using commercial available devices&#xD;
      manufactured by AYO. The total duration of the study will be 14 weeks. During the baseline&#xD;
      assessments and all treatment periods, participants will be assessed using daily survey&#xD;
      measures, weekly survey measures, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures delivered&#xD;
      via text message 3 times daily, and information collected via a Fitbit device. Survey&#xD;
      measures will assess participant self-reported fatigue. EMA measures will ask participants to&#xD;
      rate their fatigue, pain, concentration, confidence, mood, and stress in the moment.&#xD;
      Participant daily steps and nightly sleep duration will be assessed using the Fitbit Charge&#xD;
      3™ device. After at the end of the study, participants will receive a personalized report&#xD;
      summarizing their data from the baseline assessment and from each treatment period.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to evaluate their experience with the Personalized N-of-1 Trial&#xD;
      overall and each element of the trial using the System Usability Scale (SUS) as well as a&#xD;
      satisfaction survey measure. Participant adherence to study intervention devices (e.g. AYO&#xD;
      bright blue light and AYO dim blue light machines), survey measures, EMA measures, and Fitbit&#xD;
      device usage will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Assessed once after the results report has been sent to the participant, within 8 weeks of intervention completion.]</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS is a validated 10-item questionnaire that asks users to score each item on a Likert scale from Strongly Disagree (rating of 1) to Strongly Agree (rating of 5). The SUS will be presented to the participant as addressing the ease of use, complexity, consistency of the Personalized Trials system as a whole, from recruitment to receipt of the report. Individual results are calculated to arrive at a composite measure out of 100. Participant SUS scores will be averaged together and an overall mean will be reported with standard deviation. Higher scored values correlate to a more usable system, and therefore a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Within-Subject Difference in Self-reported Daily Fatigue assessed using the PROMIS Item Bank v1.0 Fatigue 7b Daily</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily fatigue will be assessed daily via survey during the baseline assessment period (2 weeks) and during each of the 6 treatment periods (2 weeks each).</time_frame>
    <description>All Daily Fatigue items are rated on a scale of 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating higher levels of fatigue.

    <ipd_description>All collected individual participant data (IPD) will be de-identified and pooled before sharing on the Open Science Framework, along with a data dictionary. Pooling N-of-1 trials together is a more efficient approach to deriving population-level estimates than conventional randomized controlled trials.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>The study protocol, including the statistical analysis plan, will be made available in addition to the informed consent form before the first participants randomized into the study. De-identified, pooled individual participant data will be made available within a year of final participant data collection. We anticipate this data to be available on the Open Science Framework platform indefinitely.</ipd_time_frame>
