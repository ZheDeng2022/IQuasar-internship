  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune encephalitis and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases caused by&#xD;
      an abnormal immune response toward the nervous system. This can lead to life-threatening&#xD;
      symptoms, but is in many cases treatable if a swift and correct diagnosis is made. Antibodies&#xD;
      targeting neuronal proteins (i.e. &quot;neuronal antibodies&quot;) can be detected in serum or&#xD;
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in about half of the patients suffering from these conditions.&#xD;
      Although an important part of the diagnostical process of these conditions, diagnosis cannot&#xD;
      be made only based on a positive antibody test, but the clinical findings have to be&#xD;
      compatible as well. As these conditions are so rare, clinicians might struggle to interpret&#xD;
      antibody test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this retrospective study the investigators aim to estimate the cumulative incidence of&#xD;
      autoimmune encephalitides and paraneoplastic neurological syndromes in the Uppsala-Örebro&#xD;
      health care region in Sweden between the years 2015 and 2019. Medical records from patients&#xD;
      belonging to the Uppsala-Örebro health care region (a region in the middle of Sweden with a&#xD;
      population of approximately 2.1 million), that tested positive for any neuronal antibody in&#xD;
      serum or CSF will be studied to obtain clinical, laboratory and radiological data. This data&#xD;
      will be used to ascertain if diagnostic criteria are fulfilled as well as to describe&#xD;
      clinical characteristics and identifying possible comorbidities.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of extended cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The extended cohort consists of all patients in Sweden tested for any neuronal antibody&#xD;
           in serum or CSF between 2015 and 2019. Patients will be identified by the only five&#xD;
           laboratories that perform tests for neuronal antibodies in Sweden. The following&#xD;
           neuronal antibodies will be included: AMPA 1 (Anti-Glutamate Receptor 1), AMPA 2&#xD;
           (Anti-Glutamate Receptor 2), Amphiphysin, CARP VIII (Carbonic Anhydrase-Related Protein&#xD;
           VIII), CASPR2 (Contactin-associated protein-like 2), CV2/CRMP5 (collapsin response&#xD;
           mediator protein 5), DPPX (dipeptidyl-peptidase-like protein 6), GABA B (γ-Aminobutyric&#xD;
           acid-B receptor), GAD65 (glutamic acid decarboxylase) (&gt;2000 IU/ml by ELISA in serum, or&#xD;
           detected in CSF), glycine receptor, Homer 3, Hu (antineuronal nuclear antibody-type 1,&#xD;
           ANNA-1), IgLON5 (immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecule 5 ), ITPR1 (inositol&#xD;
           1,4,5-trisphophate receptor type 1), LGI-1 (Leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1), Ma2/Ta,&#xD;
           NMDAR (anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor), PCA-2 (Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibody&#xD;
           type 2), Tr (Trotter), Ri, SOX1(SRY-Box Transcription Factor 1), VGCC (Voltage-gated&#xD;
           calcium channels), Yo, Zic4 (Zinc finger protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of geographical region:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients testing positive for any neuronal antibody in serum or CSF will be stratified&#xD;
           according to which Swedish health care region that requested the test. Patients whose&#xD;
           tests where requested by health care providers in the Uppsala-Örebro health care region&#xD;
           (consisting of 7 smaller health care regions with a total population of approximately&#xD;
           2.1 million) will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Core cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients with a positive test result that belong to the Uppsala-Örebro health care&#xD;
           region will be contacted and asked to participate in the study. Written informed consent&#xD;
           must be signed to be included in the core cohort. If the patient is deceased, consent&#xD;
           will be presumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Case ascertainment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records from patients included in the core cohort will be reviewed to obtain&#xD;
      clinical, laboratory and radiological data. Ascertainment of a case is defined as the patient&#xD;
      either fulfilling criteria of: 1) &quot;definite PNS&quot; according to Graus et. al 2021 or 2)&#xD;
      &quot;definite autoimmune limbic encephalitis&quot; according to Graus et al. 2016 or 3) &quot;definite&#xD;
      anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis&quot; according to Graus et al. 2016.&#xD;
