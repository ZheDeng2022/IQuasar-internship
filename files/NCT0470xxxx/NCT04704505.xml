    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter open label, international, phase II study of Bipolar&#xD;
      Androgen Therapy (BAT) plus Radium-223 (RAD) in men with metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). Men with mCRPC with progressive disease (radiographically and/or&#xD;
      biochemically) who have been treated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-analogue&#xD;
      (LHRH agonists/antagonists) continuously or bilateral orchidectomy will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study. Previous antiandrogen therapies are permitted, but no more than one (such as&#xD;
      abiraterone, enzalutamide, apalutamide, darolutamide). All patients will receive treatment&#xD;
      with Radium-223 at a dose of 55 Kilobecquerel (kBq) per kilogram of body weight IV every 28&#xD;
      days, for 6 cycles, plus Testosterone Cypionate 400mg Intramuscular (IM) every 28 days, until&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Evidence of disease in sites or extent that, in the opinion of the investigator, would&#xD;
             put the patient at risk from therapy with testosterone (e.g. femoral metastases with&#xD;
             concern over fracture risk, severe and extensive spinal metastases with concern over&#xD;
             spinal cord compression, etc). Patients with low volume visceral metastasis are&#xD;
