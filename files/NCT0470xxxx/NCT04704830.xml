      A Phase III randomized controlled multi-centre trial to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      R21/Matrix-M vaccine in African children against clinical malaria&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, individually randomised trial, with 2:1 randomisation with the&#xD;
      R21/Matrix-M malaria vaccine or a control rabies vaccine (Abhayrab). The study groups are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard vaccination regime, 5-36 months olds R21/Matrix-M x 3, n = 1600 Rabies vaccine x 3,&#xD;
      n = 800&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seasonal vaccination regime, 5-36 month olds R21/Matrix-M x 3, n = 1600 Rabies vaccine x 3, n&#xD;
      = 800&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each group, a booster (4th) dose of the same vaccine will be administered 12 months after&#xD;
      the third dose. Initial follow-up will be for two years after dose three, with a primary&#xD;
      analysis at 12 months after dose 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension of the trial will be considered to allow for longer follow-up as indicated by the&#xD;
      12-month safety and efficacy data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2400 participants will be enrolled for the standard vaccination regime in: Dande, Burkina&#xD;
      Faso; Kilifi, Kenya; and Bagamoyo, Tanzania.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a further 2400 participants will be enrolled for the seasonal vaccination regime&#xD;
      in Nanoro, Burkina Faso and Bougouni, Mali.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard vaccination regime:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-36 month old children living permanently in the study area who are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seasonal vaccination regime:&#xD;
&#xD;
      5-36 month old children living permanently in the study area who are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the protective efficacy of R21/Matrix-M against clinical malaria caused by&#xD;
           Plasmodium falciparum, in 5-36 month old children living in a malaria endemic area, 12&#xD;
           months after completion of the primary course (standard vaccination regime).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the protective efficacy of R21/Matrix-M against clinical malaria caused by&#xD;
           Plasmodium falciparum, in 5-36 month old children living in a malaria endemic area, 12&#xD;
           months after completion of the primary course (seasonal vaccination regime).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the safety and reactogenicity of R21/Matrix-M, in both vaccination regimes, of&#xD;
      children living in a malaria endemic area, in the month following each vaccination, and 12&#xD;
      months after completion of the primary course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy against clinical malaria after a booster vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy against asymptomatic P. falciparum infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy against severe malaria disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy according to different transmission settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy against incident severe anaemia, blood transfusion requirement and malaria&#xD;
           hospitalisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and reactogenicity (including Serious adverse events (SAEs) and any deaths)&#xD;
           following the booster vaccination and for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of humoral immunogenicity by anti-CSP antibody concentrations measured 12&#xD;
           months after completion of the primary series of 3 vaccinations and 12 months after&#xD;
           booster vaccination&#xD;
