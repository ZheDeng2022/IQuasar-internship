      The primary objective of this observational study is to investigate the correlation between&#xD;
      changes from baseline at 52 weeks in forced vital capacity (FVC) and changes from baseline at&#xD;
      52 weeks in dyspnea score points or cough score points as measured with the pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis questionnaire (L-PF) questionnaire over 52 weeks of nintedanib treatment in patients&#xD;
      suffering from chronic fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a progressive phenotype&#xD;
      (excluding idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)).&#xD;

        In this NIS, data on the effect of nintedanib in chronic fibrosing ILD with progressive&#xD;
        phenotype in about 100 patients will be collected in routine clinical practice by ca. 20&#xD;
        specialists, experienced in treating ILD patients, (e. g. pulmonologists and&#xD;
        rheumatologists) throughout Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients to be recruited within this study have to have a physician diagnosed chronic&#xD;
        fibrosing interstitial lung disease (ILD) with a progressive phenotype (except idiopathic&#xD;
        pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)), for which nintedanib is an indicated treatment.&#xD;
