  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In spite of multimodal analgesic strategies, which consist of opioids, dexamethasone,&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and local anesthetics applied into the surgical wound,&#xD;
      postoperative pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) are still common complaints&#xD;
      reported after laparoscopic gynecological surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, it is hypothesized that the infusion consisting of lidocaine, dexmedetomidine and&#xD;
      ketamine, as an opioid substitute was a feasible technique for laparoscopic gynecological&#xD;
      surgery and would be associated with less incidence of PONV and lower opioid requirements in&#xD;
      the early postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of opioid sparing technique via infusion of&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine, Ketamine and Lidocaine on post-operative nausea and vomiting in laparoscopic&#xD;
      gynecological surgery.&#xD;
