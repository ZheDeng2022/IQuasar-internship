  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renuva is allograft adipose matrix commonly used as a filler in cosmetic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are studying this material as an injectable in the vocal fold to treat&#xD;
      glottic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, many products can be used as an injectable in the vocal fold to correct glottic&#xD;
      insufficiency such as carbomethycellulose, hyaluronic acid, collagen derivatives and calcium&#xD;
      hydroxyapatite amongst others. An ideal injectable would not impair the fibroelastic property&#xD;
      of the vocal fold tissues and would integrate within the tissue of the vocal fold. Since&#xD;
      Renuva has the property of stimulating adipogenesis by using growth factor and collagen, the&#xD;
      investigators believe it could represent a good option in terms of safety and efficacy for&#xD;
      vocal fold augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of Renuva as a vocal fold injectable to treat&#xD;
      glottic insufficiency.&#xD;

      Background/Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vocal cord injection augmentation is commonly used to treat glottal insufficiency. Various&#xD;
      materials are used for injection augmentation including autologous fat, hyaluronic acid,&#xD;
      collagen, carboxymethylcellulose, and calcium hydroxyapatite. However, all of the current&#xD;
      injection choices have individual limitations such as temporary effect, unpredictability due&#xD;
      to variable resorption by the body, unfavorable mechanical properties, and challenging&#xD;
      handling attributes. Hence, there is a need for a more ideal injection augmentation substance&#xD;
      that is biocompatible, nonimmunogenic, able to traverse small gauge needles, easy to use, and&#xD;
      facilitates long term or permanent effect when desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unilateral injection augmentation with allograft adipose matrix injectable. Renuva ®, is&#xD;
      commonly used as in injectable material in plastic surgery for treatment of small cosmetic&#xD;
      irregularities. The injectable stimulates adipogenesis using key matrix proteins including&#xD;
      collagen IV, collagen VI, FGF-2, and VEGF. The injectable does not contain any lipids,&#xD;
      cellular fragments, or DNA content. In vitro and in vivo demonstrate that the injectable can&#xD;
      stimulate adipose tissue generation. Given this important quality, allograft adipose matrix&#xD;
      may provide vocal fold bulk for a longer period of time with favorable viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties which would make it a desirable agent for vocal fold augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assess the safety profile and efficacy of allograft adipose matrix for use in injection&#xD;
      augmentation Study Design: Single arm prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 patients with glottal insufficiency will be enrolled to receive vocal fold augmentation&#xD;
      injection using an Allograft adipose matrix, commercially available as Renuva ® over a 24&#xD;
      months recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study endpoint will be the completion of 12 months of follow up post injection with&#xD;
      safety monitoring. Secondary endpoints will include patient reported outcome measures (VHI,&#xD;
      VFI, DI and EAT-10), blinded Cape-V voice assessment by experts and laryngeal&#xD;
      videostroboscopy blinded assessment with the mVali tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study cohort will be analyzed via descriptive statistics of the primary outcome (safety)&#xD;
      via incidence of both minor and major adverse events. Non-parametric statistics (Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test) will be used for comparisons of patient reported outcome measures and&#xD;
      blinded evaluations of voice and videostroboscopy endpoints from post-intervention time&#xD;
      points to pre-intervention baseline.&#xD;
