      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-[18F]fluoro-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-DOPA) is a large neutral amino acid that resembles&#xD;
      natural L-3.4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) biochemically. L-DOPA is a precursor for&#xD;
      dopamine, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine (noradrenaline), collectively known as&#xD;
      catecholamines. 18F-DOPA enters the biochemical pathway of L-DOPA both in the brain and&#xD;
      peripherally, and can be imaged with a positron emission tomography / computed tomography&#xD;
      (PET/CT) scanner. 18F-DOPA can therefore allow imaging of the L-DOPA metabolic pathway with a&#xD;
      high target-to-background ratio providing valuable information for a number of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While 18F-DOPA is an established diagnostic tracer at a number of different institutions&#xD;
      globally, given the short half-life of 18F (110 minutes) this tracer cannot be imported for&#xD;
      local use. The Edmonton PET Centre has recently developed a production method for this tracer&#xD;
      allowing local access. An initial study at the University of Alberta (Pro00055342) has&#xD;
      demonstrated this tracer to have an acceptable safety profile, an expected biodistribution&#xD;
      (both physiologic and disease-related), and has established clinical efficacy of the tracer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In March, 2020 the University of Alberta Hospital (UAH) installed a new PET/CT scanner (GE&#xD;
      Discovery MI) with a digital detector system and new iterative image reconstruction&#xD;
      algorithms that represent a substantial technological improvement compared to the previously&#xD;
      installed scanner. It is expected that this new system will reduce artifact and will increase&#xD;
      the sensitivity for the detection of smaller lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our initial study demonstrated rapid urinary excretion with intense collection of activity&#xD;
      within the urinary bladder. While this physiology was expected, it did result in diminished&#xD;
      image quality in the evaluation of the pelvis in some patients. Improved image reconstruction&#xD;
      algorithms available on the new GE Discovery MI PET/CT system may improve imaged quality&#xD;
      related to this problem. Based on our experience with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT&#xD;
      scans, the administration of intravenous furosemide prior to imaging can also substantially&#xD;
      improve the image quality in the pelvis. These potential improvements have not yet been&#xD;
      established with 18F-DOPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second observation from our initial study was that many participants demonstrated intense&#xD;
      early activity at the gallbladder fundus. While biliary and gallbladder activity are&#xD;
      described in the normal biodistribution of 18F-DOPA, the observed distribution suggests that&#xD;
      the gallbladder fundus activity reflects primary uptake rather than reflux of activity within&#xD;
      bile into the gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for this study is to explore the efficacy of these optimization parameters (new&#xD;
      digital PET/CT camera system and use of intravenous furosemide) in the context of 18F-DOPA&#xD;
      PET/CT imaging for patients with clinical indications for the scan. Imaging data from this&#xD;
      study will be compared with data from the prior study (Pro00055342) to determine if the new&#xD;
      digital detector PET/CT technology and preparatory furosemide administration improves image&#xD;
      quality for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup will also be scanned dynamically at the abdomen to better assess the pattern of&#xD;
      gallbladder activity over time. This will include a mixture of clinical indications listed&#xD;
      within the inclusion criteria. All patients will be screened for a history of previous&#xD;
      gallbladder disease at the time of the scan by questionnaire. The intention of this sub-study&#xD;
      is to better determine 18F-DOPA activity patterns associated with the gallbladder and to&#xD;
      explore if there is a correlation between dopaminergic degeneration in the brain and the&#xD;
      gallbladder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE AND STUDY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Type: Phase III non-randomized, non-blinded prospective cohort clinical trial of&#xD;
      patients with a clinical indication for 18F-DOPA PET/CT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess optimization parameters for 18F-DOPA PET CT&#xD;
      imaging at UAH including the impact of new digital detector PET/CT technology as well as the&#xD;
      impact of preparatory intravenous furosemide administration on image quality within the&#xD;
      pelvis. A secondary purpose of this study is to better delineate the pattern of 18F-DOPA&#xD;
      activity associated with the gallbladder and to explore if there is a relationship between&#xD;
      dopaminergic denervation in the gallbladder and the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only patient populations for which there are established clinical indications for the use of&#xD;
      18F-DOPA will be included in this study. Participation in this study will allow access to&#xD;
      this tracer for patients in Alberta as there is no Health Canada approved similar tracer&#xD;
      currently available. 18F-DOPA is an established clinical tracer at multiple institutions&#xD;
      globally and has been approved for clinical use at multiple European centres for many (10+)&#xD;
      years. Established clinical indications in the literature include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pediatric patients (less than 18 years old) with congenital hyperinsulinism. The&#xD;
           18F-DOPA scan is used to plan required surgical intervention for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pediatric patients (less than 18 years old) with neuroblastoma. The 18F-DOPA scan is&#xD;
           indicated for pre-operative assessment of a mass suspected to be a neuroblastoma,&#xD;
           staging, re-staging, and assessment of recurrence in this patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pediatric (less than 18 years old) or Adult patients (18 or older) with known or&#xD;
           clinically suspected neuroendocrine tumor. These include patients with carcinoid tumor,&#xD;
           pheochromocytoma, paraganglioma, and medullary thyroid cancer. 18F-DOPA is indicated for&#xD;
           metabolic assessment of a mass suspected to represent one of these tumor-types, for&#xD;
           staging of a known tumor, for re-staging, and for assessment of recurrence in this&#xD;
           patient group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adult patients (18 or older) with a clinical suspicion of Parkinson's disease or Lewy&#xD;
           body dementia. 18F-DOPA is indicated to differentiate benign essential tremor from&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease in this patient group [22-26]. 18F-DOPA may also be used to&#xD;
           differentiate Lewy body dementia from other dementia types.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pediatric (less than 18 years old) or Adult patients (18 or older) with brain tumors&#xD;
           (primary or metastatic). 18F-DOPA is indicated for biopsy planning, radiation therapy&#xD;
           planning, and post-therapy assessment to differentiate residual viable tumor from&#xD;
           post-therapy necrosis in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When requested for patients falling into one of these diagnostic groups, an 18F-DOPA PET/CT&#xD;
      scan will be performed and interpreted clinically with the results conveyed to the referring&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Image optimization (the primary study objective) will be evaluated based on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients with abnormal activity, the smallest 3 lesions will be recorded in terms of&#xD;
           size (mm) and activity (SUVmax). For PET-avid lesions, the size measurement will be&#xD;
           based on measuring the maximum dimension of the corresponding lesion on the CT scan&#xD;
           component if possible. If not possible, a size measurement based on the PET images will&#xD;
           be used. The minimum lesion size and average (3 smallest lesions) will be compared with&#xD;
           a cohort of scans acquired on the previous non-digital PET/CT scanner (retrospective&#xD;
           cohort of 50 positive patients, Pro00055342).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The SUVmax, SUVmean, and SUV standard deviation of urinary bladder activity will be&#xD;
           measured and compared to a retrospective cohort of 50 patients from a previous study&#xD;
           (Pro00055342)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A subjective score will be applied to the pelvis with respect to image artifact related&#xD;
           to bladder activity (0 = no artifact, 1 = mild artifact, 2 = severe artifact). This will&#xD;
           be compared to scoring of the previous study (retrospective cohort of 50 patients,&#xD;
           Pro00055342) retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gallbladder activity pattern (the secondary objective) will be evaluated based on the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUVmax measurements of the gallbladder fundus, gallbladder neck, common bile duct, right&#xD;
           and left main intrahepatic ducts, and liver parenchyma (right and left lobes, 3 cm&#xD;
           diameter VOI) will be measured at 5 minute increments. These will be analyzed in total,&#xD;
           and subgroups will be compared (32 PD vs. 32 non-PD participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened by questionnaire at the time of the scan as to whether&#xD;
           there is a history of previous gallbladder disease. The positive response rate will be&#xD;
           compared between three groups: non-PD patients, PD patients with objective evidence of&#xD;
           dopaminergic denervation (positive FDOPA scan), PD patients without objective evidence&#xD;
           of dopaminergic denervation (negative FDOPA scan).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 800 patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be identified based on referrals&#xD;
      from physicians who deem the imaging studies potentially useful for clinical care. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that complete enrollment will take 5 years (approximately 160 scans per year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on the following. There will typically be 5 participants&#xD;
      total scanned per day. Dynamic imaging will be restricted to one patient per scanning day due&#xD;
      to time constraints related to the scanner, as this requires the participant to lie quietly&#xD;
      in the PET/CT scanner for up to one hour. Allowing for this restriction, it is estimated that&#xD;
      the overall participation rate for dynamic scanning will be 10%. Based on a minimum total&#xD;
      sample size of 64 participants for the secondary objective analysis, a total minimum study&#xD;
      population of 640 is required. Allowing for some potential buffer for recruitment, a total of&#xD;
      800 participants is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The minimum sample size of 64 participants is based on the following estimations: gallbladder&#xD;
      fundus SUVmax mean 10.9, SUVmax DS 4.6 (measured from cohort of 10 patients from the previous&#xD;
      study), α = 0.05, and power = 0.80. Two groups of 32 participants (64 total) should allow for&#xD;
      detection of a minimum 30% difference in SUVmax involving the gallbladder fundus between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
