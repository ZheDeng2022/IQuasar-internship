  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) has a huge impact on the quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      in women and its treatment is challenging. Intraurethral laser may be an additional treatment&#xD;
      option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim: The aim is to study the effectiveness of intraurethral laser therapy in women with&#xD;
      SUI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: randomized double blinded sham - controlled clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: women which have been diagnosed with SUI I-IIÂ°, aged between 18-80 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups: Participants will be randomized (1:1), without stratification. The Intervention&#xD;
      group will receive 2 treatments of intraurethral laser therapy and the Control group will&#xD;
      receive 2 treatments of intraurethral SHAM laser therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: A sample size of 20 women, 8 per group including a 20% Drop Out Rate, was&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: impact of SUI on the VAS scale 3 months after laser therapy versus sham&#xD;
      laser therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study outcomes were defined as subjective SUI, objective SUI, QoL, treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, intraurethral microbiome, 3 months after laser therapy versus sham laser&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Eligible patients will receive written and oral information about the study. After informed consent patients will be randomized into the intraurethral laser treatment group or sham laser group using the internet based program &quot;randomizer&quot;, at a 1.1 ratio without stratification. Patients and the person performing the laser treatment will not aware of the treatment given. The laser devices can be used as a placebo laser blocking the laser beam with a plug.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective symptoms of SUI</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A visual analogue scale (VAS) is used for assessment for the subjective symptoms and improvement of SUI. Patients are asked to indicate the degree of their symptoms on a scle ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 10 (worst possible symptoms).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Degree of pain during laser therapy on a visual analogue scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients are asked to indicate the degree of pain during laser therapy on a visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst possible pain).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective SUI</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Subjective SUI as determined by the question &quot;do you leak urine when coughing, sneezing or laughing&quot; with the answer possibilities of &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot;.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective SUI</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Objective SUI as determined by the cough stress test at 300ml bladder filling, which will either be positive or negative.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Improvement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-I scales are robust and valid instruments to assess disease severity, bother and improvement after treatment in women and will be used to determine the Patient Global Impression of Improvement. The PGI-I consists of a 7-likert-scale with 7 being the worst bother.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Global Impression of Severity</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) is a global index that may be used to rate the severity of a specific condition (in a single-state scale). The PGI-I scales are robust and valid instruments to assess disease severity, bother and improvement after treatment in women and will be used to determine the Patient Global Impression of Severity. The PGI scales are robust and valid instruments to assess disease severity, bother and improvement after treatment. The patient can choose from 4 answers including none, mild, moderate and severe.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life using the Kings Health Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Kings Health Questionnaire was validated in women with stress urinary incontinence and assesses the impact of incontinence on quality of life. The eight subscales (&quot;domains&quot;) scored between 0 (best) and 100 (worst). The Symptom Severity scale is scored from 0 (best) to 30 (worst); lower scores indicate better QoL. Success in terms of the study is defined as 10 points improvement on the total Kings Health Questionnaire score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pelvic floor symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>A validated self-administered pelvic floor questionnaire (Baessler) will be used to assess urogentinal symptoms. Questions regarding bladder (15), bowel (12), and sexual function (10), and pelvic organ prolapse symptoms (five) are grouped according to the physiological functions of the pelvic floor: bladder function, bowel function, prolapse symptoms, and sexual function domains. Quality of life measures and bothersomeness ratings were integrated into the four domains. Frequency, severity, and bothersomeness of pelvic floor symptoms are assessed using a four-point scoring system for most items in the questionnaire, apart from defecation frequency, bowel consistency, sufficient lubrication, and the reason for sexual abstinence. The lower the score the less pelvic floor symptoms the patients have.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pad Weight</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>In regards to the one-hour stress pad weight test women are asked to drink 500 ml of sodium-free liquid in &lt;15 min, then sit, walk for 30 min including climbing one flight of stairs. Afterwards the total amount of urine leaked is determined by weighing the pad. Lower weight means less urine loss.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction with treatment/inpatient management</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction will be evaluated with the &quot;Fragebogen zur Patientenzufriedenheit - ZUF-8&quot;. The German version of the original &quot;Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-CSQ8&quot;, is a validated tool for measuring global patient satisfaction at the end of inpatient treatment. The ZUF-8 is an 8-items questionnaire to assess satisfaction in patients undergoing inpatient treatment. At 3 months treatment satisfaction will be assessed using an adopted version of the questionnaire. The lower the score, the higher is the patient satisfaction.</description>

    <description>Before treatment the vulva will be carefully inspected to rule out signs of infection or recent trauma. A local anesthetic fluid (Cathejell Â®) will be applied to the urethral meatus. Before laser therapy, an intraurethral swab will be taken before treatment in order to determine the intraurethral microbiome.&#xD;
Vulvovaginal laser therapies will be performed with the non-ablative 2940 nm Er:YAG laser (Smooth XS, Fotona, Slovenia) in the Incontinence mode according to the manufacturer's guidelines and recommendations. The spot size (diameter of the laser beam) is 7 mm, with a pulse at a frequency of 1.6 Hz, and a fluence (laser energy delivered per unit area) of 5.0 to 10.0 J/cm2.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Intraurethral SHAM laser therapy</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Placebo Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Clinical examination and preparations will be identical to the intervention group. Sham laser treatments will be performed with the same laser and the same device. However, a specially designed placebo probe, which blocks the emission of radiation, will be used. Women will therefore receive no therapeutic laser treatment. Before treatment, a study assistant, who is aware of the study allocation, will prepare the laser with the placebo probe, which looks identically to the &quot;normal&quot; probe. The treating physician will not be aware of the study allocation and the type of probe in use.</description>
