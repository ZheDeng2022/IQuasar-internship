      Introduction: Hypertriglyceridemia is one of the etiologies of acute pancreatitis. It may&#xD;
      cause severe multi-system disease resulting in high morbidity and mortality. There is&#xD;
      controversy regarding the best method to treat it, which includes, among other therapies,&#xD;
      high-dose insulin and performing plasma exchange (apheresis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Primary outcome - Comparison of 28- day mortality between hypertriglyceridemia-induced&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis patients who received conservative therapy versus those who received&#xD;
      apheresis therapy. Secondary outcomes: Comparison of morbidity parameters and rate of blood&#xD;
      triglycerides level decrease between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: A retrospective study based on observational data collection, which&#xD;
      will include all patients aged 18--99 who were admitted to the intensive care unit in&#xD;
      2010-2020 in the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis secondary to high blood lipids. Data will be&#xD;
      collected from hospital files and computerized systems. Data will include demographics,&#xD;
      admission times, ventilation days, pressor support, 28- day mortality,daily triglyceride&#xD;
      level, medical history, APACHE-2 score, lactate level, need for dialysis, need for&#xD;
      antibiotics and surgical intervention. The study will include 29 patients. All demographic&#xD;
      and patient parameters will be statistically examined by a qualified statistician depending&#xD;
      on the type of data.&#xD;

      Background: Hypertriglyceridemia causes 1-7% of all acute pancreatitis cases. The mechanism&#xD;
      by which excess lipids in the blood cause pancreatitis is not entirely clear. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is, that the enzyme lipase, which originates in the pancreas, causes increased breakdown of&#xD;
      triglycerides into free fatty acids, which are toxic to endothelial cells and pancreatic&#xD;
      acinary cells. In addition, excess fat in the blood increases blood viscosity and impairs&#xD;
      blood flow to the pancreas, thus causing necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is controversy regarding the best way to treat pancreatitis secondary to&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridmia. In addition to fasting, intravenous fluids and analgesia, a number of&#xD;
      methods have been used to lower blood lipids, such as heparin and insulin or plasma exchange.&#xD;
      Performing plasma exchange causes rapid removal of lipids from the plasma, but it is not yet&#xD;
      accepted as the treatment of choice, as there are so far no random prospective studies that&#xD;
      have shown an advantage for this treatment method over conservative methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Society of apheresis defines plasma exchange as a Category 3 indication for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute pancreatitis secondary to hyperlipidemia, i.e. as a treatment method whose&#xD;
      effectiveness has not been unequivocally proven, and its use is at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last ten years, the intensive care unit at our institution has treated 29 patients who&#xD;
      were admitted due to hypertriglyceridemia induced acute pancreatitis. Some patients were&#xD;
      treated conservatively, and some were treated by plasma exchange. We would like to&#xD;
      investigate whether there was a difference in mortality rates and morbidity parameters&#xD;
      between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The primary outcome of this study was to compare 28-days mortality rates among patients&#xD;
      who received apheresis versus those who did not. Secondary outcomes were comparison of&#xD;
      morbidity parameters between the groups: APACHE score, ICU and hospital length of stay,&#xD;
      ventilation days, pressor support, need for renal replacement therapy, need for antibiotics,&#xD;
      need for surgical of minimally invasive intervention, and rate of blood triglycerides&#xD;
      decrease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: A retrospective study among patients who were admitted to the ICU&#xD;
      between years 2010-2020 due to hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis, a total of 29&#xD;
      cases. Data will be collected from hospital files and computer systems (Chameleon system and&#xD;
      iMDsoft software).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All patients aged 18-99 who were admitted to the intensive care unit in&#xD;
      Meir medical hospital between years 2010-2020, whose cause of admission was&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia-induced acute pancreatitis, defined as abdominal pain, elevated levels&#xD;
      of amylase and lipase and blood triglyceride level above 1000 mg/dl, without any other&#xD;
      apparent etiology of pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data: Patient demographics and medical history including chronic pharmacologic&#xD;
      therapy, hospital admission times, ventilation days, inotropic therapy, hemodialysis, daily&#xD;
      blood triglyceride level, 28-day mortality, APACHE 2 score, lactate level, antibiotic therapy&#xD;
      and need for surgical intervention. All data will be statistically analyzed according to type&#xD;
      of data&#xD;
