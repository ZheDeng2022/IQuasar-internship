      Ketones, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB), have shown to have beneficial hemodynamics effect in&#xD;
      patients with hearth failure with reduced ejection fraction. The mechanisms behind these&#xD;
      marked hemodynamic effects are currently unknown, but could involve prostaglandin-release.&#xD;
      3-OHB is the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor hydroxy-carboxylic acid 2&#xD;
      (HCA2) receptor. This receptor has proven downstream effects on cAMP and systemic effects via&#xD;
      release of prostaglandins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this present study we will investigate the cardiovascular effects of HCA2-receptor&#xD;
      stimulation in heart failure patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart Failure (HF) is a major public health issue because the disease affects 1-2% of the&#xD;
      Western population and the lifetime risk of HF is 20%. HF is responsible for 1-2% of all&#xD;
      healthcare expenditures and 5% of all hospital admissions. The cornerstone in the medical&#xD;
      treatment of chronic HF is a combination of ACE-inhibitors/ATII-receptor antagonists,&#xD;
      beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Despite major improvements in the&#xD;
      management and care of patients with HF, the 1-year mortality in patients with HF is 13 % 4&#xD;
      and &gt;50% of HF-patients are admitted within a 2.5 year period 5. Furthermore, patients with&#xD;
      HF have markedly decreased physical capacity and quality of life. Thus, there is a need for&#xD;
      new treatment modalities in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ketone bodies are produced in the liver and are crucial for energy generation during fasting&#xD;
      in the heart and brain during, exercise and severe illnesses. However, ketosis can be safely&#xD;
      obtained using dietary supplements and can increase exercise capacity in athletes. The most&#xD;
      important ketone bodies are 3-hydroxybutyrate (3-OHB) and acetoacetate. Recently, it was&#xD;
      demonstrated that patients with severe HF have increased myocardial utilization of the ketone&#xD;
      body 3-OHB. It has been hypothesized that ketone bodies may act as a &quot;superfuel&quot; for the&#xD;
      failing heart. In support of this, the glucose-lowering SGLT-2 inhibitor empagliflozin&#xD;
      reduces the risk of hospitalizations and cardiovascular death in diabetic patients with HF&#xD;
      and also increases circulating levels of 3-OHB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By Positron Emission Tomography (PET) we have shown that ketone body infusion reduces&#xD;
      myocardial glucose uptake and increases myocardial blood flow in healthy subjects. Data from&#xD;
      another study conducted by our group show a 40% increase in cardiac output during infusion of&#xD;
      3-OHB. The mechanisms behind these marked hemodynamic effects are currently unknown, but&#xD;
      could involve prostaglandin-release. 3-OHB is the endogenous ligand for the G protein-coupled&#xD;
      receptor hydroxy-carboxylic acid 2 (HCA2) receptor. This receptor has proven downstream&#xD;
      effects on cAMP and systemic effects via release of prostaglandins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-OHB have affinity to the HCA2 receptor and possibly a downstream effect resulting in the&#xD;
      release of prostaglandins. The prostaglandin synthesis is dependent of cyclooxygenase (COX)&#xD;
      enzyme, which can be inhibited by aspirin (ASA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Niacin, vitamin B3, has been used as a treatment for dyslipidemia. Niacin is also a ligand&#xD;
      for HCA2 receptor and the downstream release of prostaglandin cause side effects such as&#xD;
      cutaneous flushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will investigate the cardiovascular effects of HCA2-receptor stimulation in&#xD;
      heart failure patients. This will be done by comparing infusion of 3-OHB (preceded with ASA)&#xD;
      and niacin.&#xD;
