  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, and confirmed clinical trial in&#xD;
      patients taking antidepressants during the 6-week stimulation period , sham stimulation&#xD;
      group, low real stimulation group (1mA), high real stimulation group (2mA) and treatment&#xD;
      every day for 6 weeks (a total of 42 times). As a primary outcome, the investigator analyze&#xD;
      the improvement effect of working memory ability, and confirm whether the effects of anxiety&#xD;
      and depression are improved by the secondary outcome, together with the quality of life&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the clinical trial period, a total of 4 to 5 outpatient visits are made, and changes&#xD;
      are evaluated through neuropsychological examination by visiting at 2, 4 and 6 weeks based on&#xD;
      the baseline time point. In addition, in the case of patients who agree after 6 weeks of&#xD;
      participation, an additional 6 weeks of high real stimulation is used to conduct an open&#xD;
      extension study.&#xD;

    <description>N-back tasks are continuous-recognition measures that present stimulus sequences, such as letters or pictures; for each item in the sequence, people judge whether it matches the one presented n items ago. As the number of correct answers increases, it means improvement in cognitive function.</description>

    <measure>Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale evaluation at 2,4,6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) is a psychological questionnaire used by clinicians to rate the severity of a patient's anxiety. Upon the completion of the evaluation, the clinician compiles a total, composite score based upon the summation of each of the 14 individually rated items. This calculation will yield a comprehensive score in the range of 0 to 56. It has been predetermined that the results of the evaluation can be interpreted as follows. A score of 17 or less indicates mild anxiety severity. A score from 18 to 24 indicates mild to moderate anxiety severity. Lastly, a score of 25 to 30 indicates a moderate to severe anxiety severity.The lower the total score, the better the symptoms.</description>
