    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to evaluate the clinical outcome of varying doses of Micropulse&#xD;
      TransScleral CycloPhotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) laser in patients with glaucoma. The study will&#xD;
      assess documented complication rates, changes in visual acuity after the procedure, changes&#xD;
      in intraocular pressures and medication drop usage, and need for subsequent treatments&#xD;
      (including further laser or surgery).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma is a condition where an increase in the accumulation of aqueous humor inside the&#xD;
      anterior chamber of the eye results in raised intraocular pressure (IOP), visual field&#xD;
      defects and cupping of optic disc. Typically, patients who have glaucoma are treated with&#xD;
      topical medications or incisional surgery to lower the IOP. Micropulse transscleral&#xD;
      cyclophotocoagulation (MP-TSCPC) is a non-incisional laser surgery used in the treatment of&#xD;
      glaucoma. MP-TSCPC powered by the Cyclo G6 (Iridex Corporation, Mountain View, CA, USA)&#xD;
      causes mild thermal damage to the ciliary body (gland that produces aqueous fluid in the&#xD;
      eye), which, in turn, causes a decrease in intraocular pressure. MP-TSCPC is a variation of a&#xD;
      longstanding older treatment for glaucoma, traditional diode TSCPC, which caused a&#xD;
      significant amount of tissue damage and therefore was reserved for the treatment of end stage&#xD;
      glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The micropulse laser application includes an on-off cycle. In an on cycle, the micropulse&#xD;
      probe administers a short pulse of laser energy followed by an off cycle which is a rest&#xD;
      period for the tissue to cool off before the next on-off cycle begins. This corresponds to&#xD;
      0.5 ms duration of &quot;on-time&quot; and 1.1 ms interval of &quot;off-time&quot; during the laser application.&#xD;
      This on-off cycle allows for the laser to treat the affected area without evidence of tissue&#xD;
      damage, as opposed to the traditional diode TSCPC. Because only 31.3% of the total laser&#xD;
      energy is applied to the ciliary body, there is a less tissue damage, less post-operative&#xD;
      inflammation, and decreased complication rates. Therefore, MP-TSCPC is currently being&#xD;
      utilized for milder cases of glaucoma, and in patients with viable vision. The laser probe is&#xD;
      usually applied perpendicular to the limbus in a continuous sweeping motion, for an average&#xD;
      of 10 seconds of sweeping time per hemifield, referred to as &quot;dwell time&quot;. Therefore, the&#xD;
      three parameters that can be varied in the treatment with MP-TSCPC are total laser duration&#xD;
      (seconds), laser power (mW) and dwell time (seconds/hemifield).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the studies used a laser power of 2000 - 2500 mW. The laser duration also has varied&#xD;
      between studies. A duration time of 50 to 180 sec per hemisphere was used in different&#xD;
      studies. Most studies have utilized a dwell time of 10 seconds per hemifield, and one cited&#xD;
      an application of a &quot;stop and go&quot; method, applying the laser in discrete spots at 10 seconds&#xD;
      each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all of the prior studies, despite the variable applications of power, dwell time, and&#xD;
      duration, there have been similar rates of complications such as vision loss, macular edema,&#xD;
      and hypotony. Generally, the laser duration is tailor-made and is adjusted based on the iris&#xD;
      color and severity of glaucoma. However, there is a gap in knowledge on systematic comparison&#xD;
      of different doses of MP-TSCPC for a safe and effective treatment of glaucoma. This study&#xD;
      will systematically evaluate the clinical outcome of glaucoma surgery based on a logical&#xD;
      variation of MP-TSCPC laser dosing parameters.&#xD;
