  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, open label, controlled non-inferiority phase III multicentre trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As primary objective, the study aims to demonstrate that a regimen free of additional oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids but with obinutuzumab (and MMF) is non-inferior to a regimen based on oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids and MMF in achieving the primary outcome of complete renal response at week&#xD;
      52 without receiving corticosteroids above a prespecified dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives, the study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the efficacy of the treatments in both arms in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  partial plus complete renal response at week 52;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  proteinuria &lt; 0.8g/g at week 52;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  extrarenal flares;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  response as defined by a &gt;4 points reduction in SELENA-SLEDAI score at week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the safety of the treatments in both arms in terms of occurrence of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  toxicity of corticosteroids;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  serious Adverse Events;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  serious Infectious Episodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  new damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the number of patients with non-adherence to treatment in both arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the efficiency of obinutuzumab in this indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ancillary studies will allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement a biobank (serum, plasma, DNA, cells and urine) and a bank of renal&#xD;
           biopsies for studies that will be part of separate research funding bids (patients will&#xD;
           be informed that their samples and data may be used for subsequent studies and offered&#xD;
           to consent or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify which target therapeutic levels of MMF best predicts response with least&#xD;
           toxicity (ancillary study).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To have long term data on renal function and damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary data show that the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody may effectively replace oral&#xD;
      corticosteroids in the induction treatment of lupus glomerulonephritis. The concept of&#xD;
      avoiding significant use of corticosteroids would mark a step change in the approach to the&#xD;
      treatment of lupus nephritis but the efficacy of such a strategy first needs to be confirmed&#xD;
      in a randomised controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to demonstrate that patients with lupus nephritis could be&#xD;
      treated successfully without using damaging doses of oral corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomised with 1:1 ratio, between interventional group&#xD;
      (obinutuzumab, IV methylprednisolone, no or low dose corticosteroids and MMF) and control&#xD;
      group (oral prednisone, IV methylprednisolone and MMF), after signed informed consent&#xD;
      obtaining. Randomization will be blocked and stratified by level of proteinuria (&lt;1 g/g&#xD;
      versus ≥ 1 g/g). Previous 52 centers will participate to the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments will occur on a standard of care basis at 15 days, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months&#xD;
      (and at any flare or according to the wishes of the investigator). Study assessment will&#xD;
      include assessment of disease activity, disease- and treatment-related damage, quality of&#xD;
      life, and blood and urine tests as standard of care. In addition, a biobank will be sampled&#xD;
      at inclusion. Long-term data on damage and renal function will be collected during standard&#xD;
      of care (18 months, 2, 5 and 10 years) in patients who consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population involved: Children (14 years and above) and adults with lupus nephritis ISN/RPS&#xD;
      class III or IV (A or A/C) ± V with active lesions in at least 10% of the viable glomeruli,&#xD;
      AND urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (uPCR) ≥ 0.5 g/g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the primary outcome is complete renal response (CR), initial analysis will be&#xD;
      descriptive, using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Formally CR will be&#xD;
      analysed using Intention-To-Treat (ITT) analysis via logistic regression. Following the ITT&#xD;
      principle, missing data will be imputed. The model will include the treatment effect, and the&#xD;
      factors used for stratification in the randomisation as covariates. Odd ratios and 95% CIs&#xD;
      derived from the logistic regression will be provided. The results (comparison between the&#xD;
      groups) will be presented as an Odds Ratio (OR) (and a two-sided 95% CI) and the trial will&#xD;
      be deemed to have met its objective of non-inferiority if the lower bound of the CI&#xD;
      (equivalent to a one-sided 97.5% CI) is above a critical value of 0.45 as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be analysed using analogous models with logistic regression for&#xD;
      binary endpoints, Cox regression for time-to-event endpoints and multiple linear regression&#xD;
      for continuous endpoints. Where appropriate, repeated measures analyses will also be used.&#xD;
      The tests will however be two-sided at 5%.&#xD;
