  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic cough is a frequent cause of Pneumology consultations. CANVAS syndrome (Cerebellar&#xD;
      Ataxia with Neuropathy and bilateral Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome) is a progressive and&#xD;
      disabling neurological disease that very frequently occurs with chronic cough. This cough&#xD;
      invariably appears as a prodromal symptom that precedes neurological symptoms. The biallelic&#xD;
      expansion of AAGGG in RFC1, a causal mutation in CANVAS syndrome, appears with high frequency&#xD;
      in the general population. Objectives: Main: To determine the presence of biallelic expansion&#xD;
      of AAGGG in RFC1 in patients with chronic cough, regardless of the presence of neurological&#xD;
      symptoms. Secondary: Describe the phenotypic, functional and inflammatory characteristics of&#xD;
      these patients. and Know the relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and chronic cough&#xD;
      in patients with CANVAS. Method: A descriptive cross-sectional pilot study including 50&#xD;
      non-smoking patients between the ages of 30 and 99 years with chronic and / or refractory&#xD;
      cough as the only manifestation or associated with gastroesophageal reflux. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo the pertinent studies for the diagnosis of chronic cough, those who meet criteria for&#xD;
      suspicion of gastroesophageal reflux will be requested an esophageal phmetry and esophageal&#xD;
      manometry. Peripheral venous blood sample will be obtained for subsequent genetic analysis.&#xD;
      Vibration sensitivity will be studied in all patients regardless of the presence of mutation.&#xD;
      Those with alterations in vibratory sensitivity or mutations in RFC1 will be referred to the&#xD;
      Neurology Service for a complementary neurological evaluation. For the molecular study of the&#xD;
      DNA sample of the patients, two techniques will be used: standard Polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
      amplification with primers flanking the intron 2 fragment of the RFC1 gene and amplification&#xD;
      using Repeated Primed Polymerase chain reaction in 3 independent reactions.&#xD;
