  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a series of double-blinded randomized cross-over acute studies, the investigators want to&#xD;
      study the effects of naturally produced high-amylose barley (HIAMBA速) on the postprandial&#xD;
      glucose-metabolism in subjects with and without type 2 diabetes (T2D).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of T2D is increasing worldwide, primarily due to obesity, lack of physical&#xD;
      activity and unhealthy diet. Therefore, it is of great important to evolve dietary products&#xD;
      that counteracts this development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Barley has shown some beneficial effects on postprandial blood glucose compared with wheat. A&#xD;
      lowering of the postprandial glucose level reduces the risk of developing T2D and helps in&#xD;
      the regulation of a pre-existing diabetes. However, barley is traditionally not used in&#xD;
      bread-making in Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elevation of postprandial glucose also depends on how fast the dietary products are&#xD;
      degraded in the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starch in barley consist of both fastly degraded amylopectin and slowly degraded amylose.&#xD;
      Slow degradation is expected to lower postprandial glucose. By natural breeding techniques it&#xD;
      has been possible for the investigators collaborative partners at the Universities of Aarhus&#xD;
      and Copenhagen and PlantCarb ApS to make an natural organic high-amylose barley (HIAMBA速).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a series of acute studies the investigators want to study the effects on the glycemic&#xD;
      response to bread made with different compositions of wheat and HIAMBA速 in subjects with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that HIAMBA速 positively affect the postprandial glucose-metabolism&#xD;
      more than wheat and hereby acutely improves the glycemic regulation for both subjects with&#xD;
      and without T2D.&#xD;
