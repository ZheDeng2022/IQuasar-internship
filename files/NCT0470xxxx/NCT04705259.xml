      The antimicrobial stewardship ENGAGEMENT study aims to deliver a bundle of interventions,&#xD;
      including education of GPs and nursing staff, guideline implementation and telehealth support&#xD;
      for 18 residential aged care facilities (RACFs) in Queensland Australia to help optimise&#xD;
      antibiotic prescribing and reduce inappropriate use. The trial will involve 18 licenced RACFs&#xD;
      with 50 or more residents and is set to commence in June 2021.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Inappropriate antibiotic use can cause harm and promote antimicrobial&#xD;
      resistance, which has been declared a major health challenge by the World Health&#xD;
      Organisation. In Australian Residential Aged Care Facilities (RACFs), the most common&#xD;
      indications for antibiotic prescribing are for suspected infections of the urinary tract,&#xD;
      respiratory tract, and skin and soft tissue. Studies indicate that a high proportion of these&#xD;
      prescriptions are noncompliant with best prescribing guidelines. To date a variety of&#xD;
      interventions have been reported to address inappropriate prescribing and overuse of&#xD;
      antibiotics but with mixed outcomes. The present study aims to identify the impact of a set&#xD;
      of sustainable, multi-modal interventions in residential aged care targeting three common&#xD;
      infection types, using a robust methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS AND ANALYSIS This study will be conducted using a stepped-wedge cluster randomised&#xD;
      trial that will recruit 18 RACFs (each RACF will be considered as one cluster), over a 20&#xD;
      month observation period. Initially an antimicrobial stewardship needs assessment toolkit&#xD;
      will be piloted in seven RACFs from different service providers. This will enable the&#xD;
      refinement and targeted implementation of the intervention bundle, based on existing&#xD;
      requirement of facilities. A multimodal multi-disciplinary set of interventions, the&#xD;
      'ENGAGEMENT bundle', will be tailored to the needs of facilities. This bundle will be&#xD;
      implemented as part of the stepped wedge randomised control trial. The key elements of the&#xD;
      intervention bundle include education for nurses and general practitioners, telehealth&#xD;
      support and formation of an antimicrobial stewardship team. Prior to the sequential&#xD;
      introduction of the intervention, each site will act as its own control, in relation to usual&#xD;
      care processes for antibiotic use and stewardship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome for this study will be antibiotic consumption measured using defined&#xD;
      daily doses (DDDs). Cluster-level rates will be calculated using total occupied bed numbers&#xD;
      within each RACF during the post-randomisation observation period as the denominator. Results&#xD;
      will be expressed as rates per 1000 occupied bed days. An economic analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      to compare the costs associated with the intervention to that of usual care.&#xD;

    <description>Given that a single intervention is unlikely to be effective in stewardship programs, nor in care improvement processes at RACFs [7], this trial will deliver a set of multimodal, multidisciplinary interventions to optimise antibiotic use in RACFs. This RACF AMS ENGAGEMENT bundle will comprise the following key interventions:&#xD;
Education and engagement of prescribers, nurses, pharmacists and residents and family members&#xD;
Nursing initiatives to improve UTI diagnosis and reduce inappropriate urine testing&#xD;
Guideline development specific to antibiotic use in RACF residents&#xD;
Antimicrobial stewardship team creation in RACF with GP involvement&#xD;
EMergency department liaison and use of clinical pathways to ensure consistency of practice across the care continuum&#xD;
ElectroNic decision support to guide RACF urine testing and GP antibiotic prescribing&#xD;
Telehealth support for key intervention components</description>
