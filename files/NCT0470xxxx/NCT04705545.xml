  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bimaxillary protrusion are common in Malaysia due to the prevalence in the two biggest races&#xD;
      (Malay and Chinese). However, evidence for treatment methods and outcomes for bimaxillary&#xD;
      protrusion patients are scarce. The need for high anchorage in bimaxillary protrusion cases&#xD;
      also makes them perfect candidates for a study on the effectiveness of different anchorage&#xD;
      methods commonly used in treatment of bimaxillary protrusion cases. The soft tissue outcomes&#xD;
      from the use of these different methods are also our area of interest. Hence, the&#xD;
      investigators aim is to prove that molar block anchorage similarly effective and has the same&#xD;
      outcome as using other conventional auxiliary anchorage such as TPA and Nance button in&#xD;
      treating patients with bimaxillary protrusion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bimaxillary proclination is common in Malaysia especially among Malay, Chinese and possibly&#xD;
      the Malaysian Aborigines. Treatment commonly constitutes extraction of upper and lower first&#xD;
      permanent premolars with maximum anchorage requirement. Various anchorage device exists, but&#xD;
      conventional devices such as Nance button, transpalatal arch and molar blocks are still&#xD;
      commonly used to good effect in treatment of bimaxillary proclination. A comparison of these&#xD;
      commonly used conventional anchorage devices (molar block, transpalatal arch, Nance button),&#xD;
      especially in treating bimaxillary proclination cases, surprisingly has not been done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soft tissue changes also occur in bimaxillary proclination. However, changes in the soft&#xD;
      tissue profile using these conventional anchorage devices do not exist, as evidence shows&#xD;
      that anchorage devices can affect soft tissue outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the investigators aim to investigate compare the effectiveness and soft tissue changes&#xD;
      of using just molar blocks, molar blocks with transpalatal arch and molar blocks with Nance&#xD;
      button.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done as a 3-arm parallel randomised controlled trial. The allocation&#xD;
      ration is set at 1:1:1. This study will adhere to the PICO and CONSORT guidelines, and will&#xD;
      be registered with the clinical.org website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was conducted using G Power 3.9.1.4. The standard deviation of the&#xD;
      movement of maxillary permanent first molar was estimated at 2.2 mm. The mean difference of&#xD;
      1.00 mm was considered the smallest important difference to be detected, which was also used&#xD;
      as the effect size. In order to detect the difference of 1.00 mm with a power of 0.80 (80%)&#xD;
      and an alpha of 0.05, accounting for a 20% dropout, the total sample size required is 15,&#xD;
      which will be randomised into 3 groups (5 Nance group, 5 TPA group and 5 molar block group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be randomised by the following protocol. A simple stratified randomisation&#xD;
      method is done with gender as the stratification factor, using Sealed Envelope Ltd. 2019.&#xD;
      Each allocation is written on a paper, which will be folded twice (to reduce bias), placed in&#xD;
      separate opaque envelopes and sealed. The envelopes will be coded by gender using stickers&#xD;
      and numbered in sequence. Each gender will have their own sequence of numbers (male: 1-16,&#xD;
      female: 1-17). The envelopes will be stored in a locked drawer in the Orthodontic Dental&#xD;
      Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients are then screened from the orthodontic waiting list by three operator&#xD;
      clinicians according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria set. Patients identified will be&#xD;
      given an explanation on the trial and will be invited to take part. Upon receiving informed&#xD;
      consent from patients, the envelope will be allocated to patients according to the number&#xD;
      sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full orthodontic examination, records taking (pre-treatment radiograph (cephalometric&#xD;
      radiographs, panoramic radiographs, and other necessary additional periapical radiographs),&#xD;
      photographs and study models) and treatment planning will be done. The pre-treatment study&#xD;
      model will be labelled as T0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following treatment protocol is then followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: No additional anchorage reinforcements besides the banding first and second molar&#xD;
      with and tying them together at the buccal tubes (also known as molar block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Bands are selected and an alginate impression taken over the bands. The impression&#xD;
      will be sent to the lab for the construction of a transpalatal archwire on a 1.0 mm stainless&#xD;
      steel wire connecting the upper permanent first molar, with a U loop pointing posteriorly,&#xD;
      soldered to the palatal side of the molar bands. The appliance will be fitted a week later.&#xD;
      Molar bands will be fitted to the permanent second molar on the same appointment, with a&#xD;
      ligature wire tying the first molar band together at the buccal tubes. The resulting&#xD;
      anchorage reinforcement is a molar block with a transpalatal archwire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group C: Bands are selected and an alginate impression taken over the bands. Bands are&#xD;
      replaced on the tooth and an alginate impression taken over the bands. The impression will be&#xD;
      sent to the lab for the construction of a transpalatal archwire on a 1.0 mm stainless steel&#xD;
      wire connecting the upper permanent first molar, with a Nance button incorporated in the&#xD;
      middle of the wire, soldered to the palatal side of the molar bands. The appliance will be&#xD;
      fitted a week later. Molar bands will be fitted to the permanent second molar on the same&#xD;
      appointment, with a ligature wire tying the first molar band together at the buccal tubes.&#xD;
      The resulting anchorage reinforcement is a molar block with a Nance button&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, patients will undergo planned extraction of upper and lower permanent first premolars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is started with alignment and levelling using preadjusted Edgewise fixed appliances&#xD;
      (Gemini McLaughlin, Bennett, Trevisi (MBT) Twin Bracket 5x5 [3M Unitek, Monrovia, CA, USA]&#xD;
      prescription; 0.022-in slot size) following a straight wire concept on the upper and lower&#xD;
      arches. The wire sequence used were as follows i. 0.016-in heat activated Nickel Titanium [3M&#xD;
      Unitek], ii. 0.018 x 0.025-in heat activated Nickel Titanium [3M Unitek], iii. 0.019 x&#xD;
      0.025-in stainless steel [3M Unitek]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point, a snap impression is taken (T1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before impression taking, a marking is done on the upper first molar buccal cusps with&#xD;
      indelible ink to mark the position of the molar band. The molar bands (with or without the&#xD;
      Nance button or TPA) will be removed. A satisfactory upper arch snap impression is taken. The&#xD;
      molar bands (with or without the anchorage reinforcement device) are recemented on the teeth&#xD;
      using the mark on the buccal cusp to improve accuracy and reduce bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, space closure is done using intramaxillary traction mechanics using primarily Nickel&#xD;
      Titanium alloy closed coil springs, due to their consistent and efficient force delivery&#xD;
      compared to elastomeric chains. The completion of space closure will be assumed when all&#xD;
      spaces are closed. At this point, the auxiliary anchorage reinforcements are removed (Nance&#xD;
      button or TPA), leaving just the molar blocks (molar band on first and second permanent&#xD;
      molars). A snap impression will be taken at completion of space closure (T2). A cephalometric&#xD;
      radiograph is also taken. Treatment is continued and completed as planned for every patient&#xD;
      involved in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The models (T0, T1 and T2) will be sent to the 3D Gens Lab to be scanned, to obtain digital&#xD;
      3-dimensional models in STL format. Superimposition will be done by Mimics software which&#xD;
      allows 3D superimposition and measurements to be done. We will use a designated stable area&#xD;
      on the palate, which allows measurements in all three planes. In our study, we will be using&#xD;
      the 'mushroom area' of the palate, which is a stable structure commonly used for&#xD;
      superimposition, even in growing patients. It is also an area which is easier to designate&#xD;
      due to the area covered. The area of the palate covered includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anteriorly: the medial 2/3 of the third rugae anteriorly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  laterally: two lines parallel to the midpalatal suture laterally&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  posteriorly: 5 mm from the third rugae posteriorly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  extending to the level of an imaginary line connecting the lingual grooves of the 1st&#xD;
           permanent molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment and impressions will be done by 2 operators. The following superimposition &amp;&#xD;
      measurement of the 3-dimensional dental casts will be done by a single researcher in all 3&#xD;
      planes. Finally, before the digital model superimposition and measurements are done, 10&#xD;
      random models will be superimposed and measured first. The process will be repeated in 2&#xD;
      weeks for an inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) to assess intra-rater reliability of&#xD;
      the superimposition and measurement procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of this study, no blinding will be done on the patient or the treating&#xD;
      operator as it would not be possible. Blinding will be done during the data collection and&#xD;
      analysis stage by coding every patient before sending the models to the lab for data&#xD;
      processing and collection. A single researcher will be handling all the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis for this study will be done using SPSS statistics version 23 [IBM,&#xD;
      Illinois, USA]. The raw data will first be tested for normal distribution, followed by&#xD;
      descriptive statistics using a demographic characteristics chart. Next, an analysis of&#xD;
      covariance (ANCOVA), with gender as a stratifying factor will be done, where probabilities&#xD;
      less than 5% (P &lt; 0.05) will be considered significant. Data will also be analysed on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat basis, to take into account any unsuccessful or dropout cases. An ICC will&#xD;
      also be done to assess the intra-rater reliability in superimposing and measurements.&#xD;
