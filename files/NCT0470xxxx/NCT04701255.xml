  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advancement of cataract eye surgery and wavefront sensors, the previously&#xD;
      unquantifiable refractive measurements have been identified and the high order aberrations&#xD;
      have shown their effect on high resolution imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the human phakic eye, the shape of the normal cornea induces average positive spherical&#xD;
      aberration and remains unchanged over time, whereas the crystalline lens has a negative&#xD;
      spherical aberration. As a result, overall spherical aberration in the young eye is low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the compensation slowly decreases with the aging lens and is fully lost after&#xD;
      cataract extraction and implantation of a standard intraocular lens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optical studies showed that conventional biconvex spherical intraocular lenses add their&#xD;
      intrinsic positive spherical aberration to the positive spherical aberration of the cornea&#xD;
      resulting in image imperfection and blur. As a useful side effect, this also increases the&#xD;
      depth of focus -often referred to as pseudo-accommodation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New Aspheric intraocular lenses designs currently in use impart negative spherical&#xD;
      aberration, about 0.17 to 0.20 microns of negative spherical aberration. This added negative&#xD;
      spherical aberration partially corrects the average amount of corneal positive spherical&#xD;
      aberration &amp; compensate for its effect. Our study will include (FocusForce foldable aspheric&#xD;
      intraocular lens, Bausch &amp; Lomb, New Jersey, USA) as an example of this type of negative&#xD;
      spherical aberration intraocular lenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve retinal image quality without compromising depth of field, or introducing&#xD;
      other aberrations, aberration-free aspheric intraocular lenses were developed with no&#xD;
      inherent spherical aberration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other intraocular lens targeted in our study (Akreos AO Microincision lens, Bausch &amp;&#xD;
      Lomb, New Jersey, USA) is an example of this type of IOLs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A customized correction for the individual eye seems to be the most promising solution for&#xD;
      tailored correction of spherical aberration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, Wave front analysis of the ocular optical system has increased our&#xD;
      knowledge of the aberrations in the eye. The importance of measuring optical aberrations lies&#xD;
      not only in the presence of natural aberrations in the human eye, but also in its usefulness&#xD;
      for evaluating individual surgical outcomes. By using Zernike polynomials, the aberrations of&#xD;
      the ocular system can be characterized. Zernike coefficients of the higher-order aberrations&#xD;
      can be derived from corneal topographic data. And for those generated by the whole optical&#xD;
      system of the eye can be derived from aberrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With current small-incision cataract surgery, it has been reported that the average&#xD;
      postoperative corneal topography does not differ significantly from average preoperative&#xD;
      corneal topography, so in our study we will focus on the ocular &amp; internal wave front&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the high resolution pyramid wavefront sensor incorporated in (SCHWIND PERAMIS®,&#xD;
      topography and Aberrometry, Kleinostheim, Germany) we will evaluate and compare the total&#xD;
      ocular wave front and the corneal wave front in our study to identify and estimate the&#xD;
      internal aberrations . This new sensor uses an extended source instead of a point-like source&#xD;
      avoiding in this manner the oscillation of the pyramid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCHWIND PERAMIS evaluates the ocular wave front aberrations with 45,000 measuring points -&#xD;
      without any overlap and with clear assignment of each point &amp; records 33 images per second&#xD;
      and automatically selects the image with the best measurement. Together with real-time&#xD;
      measurement, this ensures a new level of detail resolution and precision. SCHWIND PERAMIS can&#xD;
      also be used to compare a patient's corneal and ocular wave front data. The direct comparison&#xD;
      provides information about whether a visual defect is located on the surface of the cornea or&#xD;
      within the eye itself, thus allowing us to identify and evaluate internal aberrations.&#xD;
