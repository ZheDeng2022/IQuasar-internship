  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Long-term tolerance of ketone promoting food ingredient #1</measure>
    <time_frame>Day From baseline to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between experimental arm (ketone promoting food ingredient #1) vs placebo in composite score of tolerance, assessed by twice daily tolerance questionnaires completed at home.&#xD;
Subjects complete a tolerance questionnaire twice daily, to assess the presence of 10 symptoms before and 4-6h after consuming the study beverage. Questionnaire ranks severity (None, mild, moderate, severe) and incidence (usually, somewhat more than usual, much more than usual). Answers are assigned a numerical value, where higher score is a greater severity and incidence of symptoms. The difference is calculated between the pre- and post- beverage questionnaire for a daily score. Daily scores for the duration of the study are added together to give a single composite score for the whole study period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acute tolerance of ketone promoting food ingredient #1</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 0, 7 and 14</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between experimental arm (ketone promoting food ingredient #1) vs placebo in composite scores of tolerability, assessed by a tolerance questionnaire at 1h after beverage consumption at clinic visits.&#xD;
Subjects complete a tolerance questionnaire twice, to assess the presence of 10 symptoms before and 1h after consuming the study beverage. Questionnaire ranks severity (None, mild, moderate, severe) and incidence (usually, somewhat more than usual, much more than usual). Answers are assigned a numerical value, where higher score is a greater severity and incidence of symptoms. The difference is calculated between the pre- and post- beverage questionnaire for a score representing acute tolerance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Subjective Arousal after ketone promoting food ingredient #1</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>Difference between experimental arm (ketone promoting food ingredient #1) vs placebo in the composite scores of the stimulatory and sedative subscale using the Brief Biphasic Alcohol Effect Scale (B-BAES); completed twice daily at home.&#xD;
B-BAES presents 6 items in alphabetical order, and subjects rank them on an 11 point scale, from 0 = not at all to 10 = extremely.&#xD;
The difference is calculated between the pre- and post- beverage questionnaire for a daily score. Daily scores for the duration of the study are added together to give a single composite score for the whole study period.&#xD;
