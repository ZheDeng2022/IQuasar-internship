  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The obesity epidemic, predisposing to cardio-metabolic diseases, has increased two-folds over&#xD;
      the last decade with a global alarming cost of obesity-associated illnesses, thus&#xD;
      representing a grave peril for the survival of public health care systems. It is need of the&#xD;
      time to develop evidence-based, time-efficient and cost-effective strategies to prevent and&#xD;
      manage obesity. This study would compare the effects of 2 types of exercise regimes providing&#xD;
      data on their beneficial effects on body composition and myocardial function along with&#xD;
      reducing the central adiposity. This study may also be used as a novel intervention strategy&#xD;
      for primary prevention of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases by modification of a major&#xD;
      risk factor i.e. obesity in Pakistani population, consequently reducing the burden of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality from cardiometabolic diseases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is one of the major public health issues of this century. Over the last decade, the&#xD;
      prevalence of obesity has increased globally, making it an emerging epidemic and threatening&#xD;
      the survival of health care systems. Obesity has long been recognized as the major factor&#xD;
      predisposing to cardio-metabolic diseases.The positive role of structured exercise for&#xD;
      reducing the mortality and morbidity rates of obese and sedentary adults is well established.&#xD;
      But exercise engagement is seen to be quite low in obese adults mainly due to lack of time&#xD;
      and non-adherence to exercise training programs. Current trends are now focusing towards&#xD;
      another type of exercise regime known as high intensity interval training (HIIT), which is&#xD;
      composed of repetitive short to long (&lt; 45 sec to 4 min) bouts of high intensity exercise&#xD;
      alternating with rest or recovery periods. Resistance training can also stimulate changes in&#xD;
      body composition indices as well as maintain the reduced fat mass after training. Thus&#xD;
      resistance exercises are recommended as an adjunct for obesity management by reduction in&#xD;
      risk factors. Hence, this study is designed to determine the effects of high intensity&#xD;
      interval training in combination with resistance exercises verses moderate intensity&#xD;
      continuous training on multiple outcome variables including body composition parameters,&#xD;
      visceral adiposity, lipid profile and myocardial function in overweight and obese adult&#xD;
      population of Pakistan. Afte r obtaining written informed consent from paricipants, they will&#xD;
      be screened using 2020 PAR-Q plus and randomly allocated to one of the 2 groups. A&#xD;
      self-structured demographic sheet would be employed for recording demographics and required&#xD;
      data including the findings of lab investigations. Then participants will be required to&#xD;
      undergo all the physical assessment measures such as anthropometric data, 6 minute walk test,&#xD;
      lipid profile, body composition analysis and echocardiography. Physical activity levels and&#xD;
      QOL would be assessed by filling IPAQ and SF 36 respectively. Exercise training plans would&#xD;
      be performed thrice a week on alternate days for a total duration of 10 weeks. All&#xD;
      measurements (anthropometric, cardiac, blood and body composition analyses) would be&#xD;
      performed at baseline and later after the 10 weeks intervention period. Exercise intensity&#xD;
      will be determined by individualized target heart rate zones using Karvonen formula. Strength&#xD;
      training intensity will be determined based on 1-RM. Necessary adjustments to speed/grade and&#xD;
      resistance will be made over the course of the intervention to ensure that target heart rate&#xD;
      zones are achieved at all times. Apart from the exercise programs, a general similar dietary&#xD;
      guidance by a nutritionist would also be provided to both of the groups to avoid unhealthy&#xD;
      dietary habits.&#xD;
