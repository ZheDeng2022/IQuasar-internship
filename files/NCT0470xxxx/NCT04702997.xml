  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial will study the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of bardoxolone methyl in qualified patients with CKD due&#xD;
      to multiple etiologies at risk of rapid disease progression. Approximately 70 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled and randomized 1:1 to either bardoxolone methyl or placebo. Patients with CKD&#xD;
      secondary to varying etiologies will be enrolled from age 18-70 years with eGFR ≥ 20 to &lt; 60&#xD;
      mL/min/1.73 m2, and other risk factors for rapid progression of kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum target dose will be determined by baseline proteinuria status. Patients with&#xD;
      baseline urine albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) ≤ 300 mg/g will be titrated to a maximum&#xD;
      dose of 20 mg, and patients with baseline UACR &gt; 300 mg/g will be titrated to a maximum dose&#xD;
      of 30 mg. Qualified patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either bardoxolone methyl or&#xD;
      placebo once daily (preferably in the morning) throughout a 12-week dosing period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study will follow the same visit and assessment schedule. Patients will be&#xD;
      assessed during treatment at Day 1, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 and by telephone contact on&#xD;
      Days 3, 10, 21, 31, 35, and 45. Date of last dose and the end-of-treatment assessments mark&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period. Patients will not receive study drug during a 5-week&#xD;
      off-treatment period between Weeks 12 and 17. The off-treatment (OT) period includes 5 visits&#xD;
      requiring various assessments to characterize eGFR from the time of study drug&#xD;
      discontinuation through Day 35 off-treatment.&#xD;
