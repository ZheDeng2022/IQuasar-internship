      This prospective double-blind placebo-controlled trial aims to investigate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of oral dispersible tablet of vitamin B12 for 1 year, in 90 patients with diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus type 2 and neuropathy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 90 patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      on metformin treatment for at least four years, and both peripheral and autonomic diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathy were randomized to an active treatment group (n=44) receiving B12, and a control&#xD;
      group (n=46) receiving placebo. All patients had B12 levels less than 400 pmol/L. Subjects&#xD;
      underwent measurement of sural nerve conduction velocity and amplitude, vibration perception&#xD;
      threshold, and performed cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CARTs: Mean Circular&#xD;
      Resultant, Valsalva test, postural index and orthostatic hypotension]). Sudomotor function&#xD;
      was assessed with the SUDOSCAN that measures electrochemical skin conductance in hands and&#xD;
      feet. The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument Questionnaire and Examination and&#xD;
      questionnaires to evaluate quality of life and level of pain were also used.&#xD;

Question 4 was considered to be a measure of impaired circulation and question 10 a measure of general asthenia and were not included in the published scoring algorithm. A score of ≥ 7 was considered abnormal.</description>

    <measure>Change in level of pain with painDETECT questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>painDETECT questionnaire consists of seven questions that address the quality of neuropathic pain symptoms; it is completed by the patient and no physical examination is required. The first five questions ask about the gradation of pain, scored from 0 to 5 (never = 0, hardly noticed = 1, slightly = 2; moderately = 3, strongly = 4, very strongly = 5). Question 6 asks about the pain course pattern, scored from -1 to 2, depending on which pain course pattern diagram is selected. The final score between -1 and 38, indicates the likelihood of a neuropathic pain component. A score of ≤ 12 indicates that pain is unlikely to have a neuropathic component (&lt; 15%), while a score of ≥ 19 suggests that pain is likely to have a neuropathic component (&gt; 90%). A score between these values indicates that the result is uncertain and a more detailed examination is required.</description>
