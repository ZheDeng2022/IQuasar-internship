    <textblock>
      This study aimed to evaluate the incidence of histopathologic changes in dental follicles&#xD;
      associated with radiographically normal impacted lower third molar and to determine the&#xD;
      relationship between cystic changes in follicle tissues and age, gender, and the angular&#xD;
      position of the impacted tooth.&#xD;

      Patients One hundred one healthy patients whose ILTM were extracted for various reasons in&#xD;
      Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Oral and Maxillofacial&#xD;
      Surgery were included in the study. All participants included in the study signed an informed&#xD;
      consent form. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and the&#xD;
      protocol was approved by Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      for the study (Project number: 19-KAEK-081).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' panoramic radiographs were examined, and the impacted teeth were divided into&#xD;
      four groups as vertical, horizontal, mesioangular, and distoangular according to their&#xD;
      angular positions. The radiographically found that patients with a follicular width of less&#xD;
      than 2.5 mm were included in the study. The follicular tissues were also excised after tooth&#xD;
      extraction. Soft tissue samples taken during surgical removal of ILTM were evaluated in the&#xD;
      department of pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histopathological evaluation The excision materials obtained for the study were subjected to&#xD;
      routine tissue follow-up procedures in Tokat Gaziosmanpaşa University, Faculty of Medicine,&#xD;
      Pathology Department. The samples were fixed in 10% formalin solution for 24 hours for light&#xD;
      microscope examination and blocked using the routine paraffin blocking method. The&#xD;
      preparations were prepared by obtaining sections with microtome from the blocks. These&#xD;
      preparations were stained with Hematoxylin Eosin and evaluated under a light microscope. In&#xD;
      the histopathological examination, squamous epithelium, keratinization, odontogenic&#xD;
      epithelial residue, and fibrosis were evaluated as either present or absent, and inflammation&#xD;
      was scored as 0-absent, 1-mild, 2-moderate, or 3-severe. During the microscopic evaluation of&#xD;
      follicular tissues, soft tissue samples with stratified squamous epithelium were identified&#xD;
      as cystic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between histopathological changes observed in the radiographically normal&#xD;
      dental follicles and gender and the teeth' angular positions was statistically evaluated.&#xD;
