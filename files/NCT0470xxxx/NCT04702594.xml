  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the 1990s, neuroscience, with functional MRI, has made it possible to understand the&#xD;
      beneficial neurophysiological effect of music on man and his brain. They have shown that&#xD;
      music stimulates brain plasticity and contributes to the reorganization of the affected&#xD;
      neural circuits. The concept of cerebral plasticity and cerebral symphony have thus been&#xD;
      developed. In March 2008, the HAS (High Authority for Health) proposed in its recommendations&#xD;
      good practices concerning the management of neurodegenerative diseases that &quot;Music therapy,&#xD;
      aromatherapy, multisensory stimulation ... could improve certain of behavior's aspects &quot;.&#xD;
      Music has shown that memory capacity can remain present in people with Alzheimer's disease&#xD;
      even in the advanced stages. Music also improves the well-being of patients with Alzheimer's&#xD;
      or mixed dementia living in institutions and reduces the suffering of caregivers. It improves&#xD;
      communication with others, including those who have lost the usual codes of communication and&#xD;
      improves the quality of sleep of elderly people living in institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, although musical interventions have recently gained popularity as a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment for dementia, the scientific evidence warrants further&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
