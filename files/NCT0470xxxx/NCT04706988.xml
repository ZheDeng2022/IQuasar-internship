  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing evidence supports that the respiratory microbiota, including viral and bacterial&#xD;
      microorganisms, play important roles in respiratory health and disease. Microbial patterns in&#xD;
      airways may induce distinctive endotypes of asthma. Previous studies suggest host-microbiota&#xD;
      interactions in children may account for the heterogeneity of endotypes and clinical&#xD;
      presentations. However, information on such relationship is limited in adults. Furthermore,&#xD;
      how the upper airway microbiome is related to asthma endotype and phenotype is not well&#xD;
      understood. Knowledge of microbiota in the airway allows exploration of therapeutic&#xD;
      manipulation of the microbiome and targeting the development of asthma prevention strategies&#xD;
      and the optimization of asthma treatment.&#xD;

      This study plans to assess microbes in nasopharyngeal flock swab of asthma subjects. The&#xD;
      swabs will be subjected to sequence analysis of 16S rRNA. Endotypes (e.g. TH1 vs TH2&#xD;
      inflammation) and phenotypes of the subjects (e.g. severity, exacerbation, lung function,&#xD;
      etc.) will be assessed. The planned sample size is 140 adult asthma subjects. Patients will&#xD;
      have nasopharyngeal swabs taken at baseline, 3 months (after optimization of asthma treatment&#xD;
      at baseline) and at 1 year. They will undergo assessments, including clinical course, lung&#xD;
      function, exhaled nitric oxide, skin test, and blood test (including eosinophils and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin E levels). All subjects will be followed up for 2 years to assess subsequent&#xD;
      exacerbations and levels of asthma control. The 16S data retrieved from the official website&#xD;
      of HMP (http://www.hmpdacc.org/) will be used as the geographic reference for this study.&#xD;
      Sequences assigned to different taxonomic levels, from phylum to genus using the RDP&#xD;
      (ribosomal database project) database, will be clustered into operating taxonomic units&#xD;
      (OTUs). Bioinformatic tools will be used to assess the relations of microbiota, asthma&#xD;
      endotypes and phenotypes and change of microbiota pattern upon optimization of asthma drug&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
