  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is evaluating the impact of a 12-week prolonged nightly fasting (POF) and&#xD;
      exercise intervention on metabolic markers and patient reported outcomes in women with&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC) initiating endocrine therapy in combination with palbociclib&#xD;
      or alpelisib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is single-arm feasibility pilot study exploring whether a combined prolonged nightly&#xD;
      fasting (POF) and exercise program could impact hyperglycemia and other adverse metabolic&#xD;
      consequences of PI3 kinase inhibitors in women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who exercise regularly and who have lower levels of blood sugar and metabolic hormones&#xD;
      like insulin have a lower risk of developing breast cancer. Some evidence also suggests that&#xD;
      exercise and metabolism are related to cancer recurrence in women who are diagnosed with&#xD;
      breast cancers that can be removed with surgery, but less is known about how exercise and&#xD;
      metabolic factors are related to cancer progression in women whose cancer has advanced beyond&#xD;
      the breast and underarm lymph nodes. This study is designed to look at the effects of&#xD;
      exercise combined with prolonged nightly fasting (having a longer time between dinner and&#xD;
      breakfast the next day), on blood sugar and hormones that control metabolism. This study&#xD;
      looks to provide important information about whether making these kinds of changes is&#xD;
      possible for women living with advanced breast cancer and will explore how making these&#xD;
      changes effects blood sugar and hormone levels in women taking different kinds of treatments&#xD;
      for advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, a baseline visit to collect&#xD;
      information about diet and exercise habits, a baseline blood draw, participation in a 12-week&#xD;
      diet and exercise program, and a follow up visit and blood collection at the end of the diet&#xD;
      and exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for up to 14-weeks, including the baseline and&#xD;
      end of study visits to collect study measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life will be evaluated for participants at baseline and at the end of the intervention using the EORTC QLQ C-30, sleep quality will be assessed via the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Additional patient reported outcomes include the PRO-CTCAE, the 7-Day Physical Activity Recall and the 24-Hour Dietary Recall. We will assess changes in these measures between baseline and week 12 for study participants.</description>

    <description>Participants will be grouped into two cohorts determined by whether they receive palbociclib or alpelisib as part of their breast cancer treatment and then receive a 12 week prolonged nightly fasting plus exercise program consisting of:&#xD;
Prolonged overnight fasting: Not consume any calorie-containing food/drinks after 8pm, waiting a minimum of 13 hours after their last meal of the day before eating the next day, target goal of fasting at least 6 days a week, daily record of first and last meals&#xD;
Exercise Program: Coach provided at-home, personalized exercise regimen with target goal of 120 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity each week as well as two 30-45-minute virtual strength training classes per week, receive fitbit for exercise and heart rate monitoring, weekly telephone-based support sessions with coach.</description>
