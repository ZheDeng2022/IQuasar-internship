      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Androgen effects in humans are usually (but not always) mediated by the androgen receptor&#xD;
      which is coded for by the androgen receptor gene (AR gene). Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome&#xD;
      (AIS) is a rare condition in which the body cannot sense the male hormones in the blood or&#xD;
      tissue. Both women and men can be affected by AIS. Researchers want to learn more about the&#xD;
      health of people with AIS over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a natural history study in individuals with AIS, data and tests may provide information&#xD;
      regarding health risks (including the risks and benefits of gonadectomy and best ways to&#xD;
      monitor for tumor) and optimal management of individuals with AIS as well as elucidate the&#xD;
      role of the androgen receptor in human health. This study does not involve any interventions&#xD;
      and we can provide clinical care while collecting data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this natural history study is to describe and define a comprehensive&#xD;
      phenotype (characteristic) of patients with AIS based on confirmed androgen receptor (AR)&#xD;
      gene difference. We will evaluate hormones, bone density and markers, cardiovascular and&#xD;
      metabolic parameters, as well as quality of life and tumor formation risk and evaluation. The&#xD;
      purpose is to obtain a better understanding of the overall health issues that people with AIS&#xD;
      may have through the study procedures listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 0-99 with AIS and their adult relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will go through a series of study procedures for data and specimen collection.&#xD;
      This will be done to understand how AIS affects individuals since the androgen receptor is&#xD;
      found in many tissues in the body including skin, bone, muscle, and the neurologic, immune&#xD;
      and metabolic systems. All tests will be performed by skilled and trained study&#xD;
      professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical record review&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lab tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical exams. Their body measurements will be taken. They will have&#xD;
      blood and urine tests. They will have electrocardiograms to check heart health. They may&#xD;
      complete questionnaires. They may have an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have x-rays taken of the hand, wrist, and other bones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have body scans to measure bone thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or sonogram of the pelvis. For MRI,&#xD;
      they may get a contrast agent via intravenous (IV) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult participants may have the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR elastography. It uses MRI and low-frequency vibrations to map stiffness of body tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MR spectroscopy. It uses MRI to take pictures of chemicals in the liver and body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac computed tomography scan. It uses x-rays to make pictures of the heart. Participants&#xD;
      may get a contrast agent via IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional genital exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits every 1-2 years. Participation lasts indefinitely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult relatives will also be invited to participate but will have only 1 visit. It will&#xD;
      include some of the above tests.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Androgen effects in humans are usually (but not always) mediated by the androgen receptor&#xD;
      which is coded for by the androgen receptor gene (AR gene). Individuals with abnormalities of&#xD;
      this receptor gene can present with androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS). There are a&#xD;
      variety of phenotypes including complete female phenotype (complete androgen insensitivity or&#xD;
      CAIS), ambiguous genitalia in cases of partial androgen insensitivity (PAIS) and male&#xD;
      phenotype associated with infertility of hypospadias in mild cases of AIS. Complete androgen&#xD;
      insensitivity is a rare condition with an estimated incidence of 1:20,000-64,000, while PAIS&#xD;
      is rarer still and mild AIS has likely not been studied enough to ascertain it s prevalence.&#xD;
      Individuals with complete and partial AIS present some management conundrums as traditionally&#xD;
      they have undergone gonadectomy in order to avoid gonadal tumors as well as pubertal&#xD;
      virilization in girls with PAIS. Because this is a rare condition, little is known regarding&#xD;
      the risks and benefits of gonadectomy, optimal hormone replacement after gonadectomy as well&#xD;
      as general health in individuals with these conditions. Furthermore, the androgen receptor is&#xD;
      found in many tissues in the body including skin, bone, muscle, and the neurologic, immune&#xD;
      and metabolic systems. Finally, some testosterone effects may be through mechanisms other&#xD;
      than AR receptor and these are not well understood. A natural history study in individuals&#xD;
      with AIS may provide information regarding health risks and optimal management of individuals&#xD;
      with AIS as well as elucidate the role of the androgen receptor in human health.&#xD;
