  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), a subtype of neovascular age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration (NV AMD), is an important cause of central visual loss, especially among Asian&#xD;
      and African descendants. PCV is characterized by the presence of hyperfluorescent polypoidal&#xD;
      lesions, with or without branching vascular network, identified on indocyanine green&#xD;
      angiography (ICGA), currently the gold standard for PCV diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to visual improvement from baseline, polypoidal regression or complete&#xD;
      disappearance of polypoidal lesions on ICGA has been considered an important treatment&#xD;
      outcome in large PCV trials including the PLANET1 and EVEREST II2 studies. Rate of polypoidal&#xD;
      regression following intravitreous aflibercept monotherapy was 33% in the PLANET study1 year&#xD;
      2 and ranged between 55% to 78% in other Asian cohorts.3-4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, our previous investigation5 on the timing of polypoidal regression following a&#xD;
      fixed-dosing aflibercept monotherapy (3 initial monthly injections, then q 8 weeks until 1&#xD;
      year) in 40 Thai PCV eyes suggested that, among 22 eyes (55%) with polypoidal regression at 1&#xD;
      year, a majority of them showed complete polypoidal regression before 6 months (median&#xD;
      duration of complete regression: 3 months (IQR, 2 months to 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, due to the fixed-dosing regimen used in previous study, there are limited data on&#xD;
      how often polypoidal lesions remain regressed on ICGA when the treatment is deferred in eyes&#xD;
      with polypoidal regression, nor what changes might be seen subsequently on OCT when treatment&#xD;
      is deferred in this situation. Therefore, this study aims to determine the changes seen on&#xD;
      OCT subsequent to complete regression of polypoidal lesions on ICGA in PCV eyes following&#xD;
      intravitreous aflibercept treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study may provide some insights on longer-term PCV management&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine how long there is CNV inactivity on OCT (absence of intraretinal thickening,&#xD;
      intraretinal cystoid abnormalities, subretinal fluid, or enlarging pigment epithelial&#xD;
      detachments) in eyes with complete polypoidal regression on ICGA after receiving&#xD;
      intravitreous aflibercept injections over 2 years for PCV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the rate of polypoidal regression compared with baseline at 3, 6, 12, and&#xD;
           24 months following intravitreous aflibercept &quot;treat and extend&quot; regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the visual acuity change from baseline to 1 and 2 years following&#xD;
           intravitreous aflibercept &quot;modified treat and extend&quot; regimen and its correlation with&#xD;
           OCT or ICGA activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the correlation of changes at week 12 with changes at 12 months and 24&#xD;
           months&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the incidence of newly developed or recurrent polypoidal lesions in eyes&#xD;
           with complete polypoidal regression after aflibercept treatment &quot;treat and extend&quot;&#xD;
           regimen over 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center prospective case series. The overall study duration will be 3 years; 1 year for&#xD;
      recruitment and 2-year follow-up for each participant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall study duration for each participant will be 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will receive 3 initial monthly intravitreous 2-mg aflibercept&#xD;
           injections (week 0, 4, 8), then management will be based on ICGA findings at week 12 as&#xD;
           follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete polypoidal regression on ICGA: defer intravitreous aflibercept injection, and&#xD;
           follow-up monthly with OCT monitoring thereafter until 1 year, and bimonthly in year 2.&#xD;
           If subretinal or intraretinal fluid is seen on OCT during the follow-up period, an&#xD;
           interval of disease inactivity is determined. Such study eye with re-activation is&#xD;
           considered met primary end point and will receive intravitreous anti-VEGF treatment&#xD;
           according to &quot;treat and extend&quot; regimen as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incomplete or worsening polypoidal regression on ICGA: continue additional 3&#xD;
           intravitreous aflibercept injection, and repeat ICGA at week 24&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At week 24, if there is a presence of complete polypoidal regression on ICGA, defer&#xD;
                intravitreous aflibercept injection, and follow-up monthly with OCT monitoring&#xD;
                thereafter until 1 year, and bimonthly in year 2. If subretinal or intraretinal&#xD;
                fluid is seen on OCT during the follow-up period, an interval of disease inactivity&#xD;
                (primary outcome) is determined. Such study eye with re-activation is considered&#xD;
                met primary end point and will receive intravitreous anti-VEGF treatment according&#xD;
                to &quot;treat and extend&quot; regimen as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At week 24, if there is partial or no regression of polypoidal lesion, continue&#xD;
                intravitreous aflibercept injection with &quot;treat and extend&quot; regimen, which the&#xD;
                follow-up interval can be extended by 4 weeks up to 16 weeks if no disease activity&#xD;
                identified on color fundus photography or OCT. If disease activity recurs, shorten&#xD;
                follow-up interval by 4 weeks, remain injections at that interval until fluid&#xD;
                resolved, and re-extend by 2 weeks. Treatment interval will not be less frequent&#xD;
                than every 4 weeks (according to an approved label of intravitreous aflibercept in&#xD;
                Thailand). During follow-up, if an investigator suspect the presence of complete&#xD;
                polypoidal regression based on OCT findings, ICGA can be performed at any visit. If&#xD;
                complete polypoidal regression is present, defer the treatment and follow-up&#xD;
                monthly with OCT monitoring in year 1, and bimonthly in year 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Photodynamic therapy can be applied at 1 year, if persistent fluid on OCT is&#xD;
                identified despite continuous intravitreous aflibercept injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual acuity measurement, color fundus photography (CFP), and SD-OCT will be performed&#xD;
           at each visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus fluorescein angiography (FA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) will be&#xD;
           performed at week 0 (baseline), 3, 6, 12, and 24 months, and at any time point showing a&#xD;
           recurrence of disease activity in eye that previously shown complete polypoidal&#xD;
           regression on ICGA, or at any time point an investigator suspect the presence of&#xD;
           complete polypoidal regression based on OCT findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions:&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Persistent or worsening polypoidal regression is defined as a persistent or enlargement&#xD;
           in size and number of hyperfluorescent lesions in an area previously identified as a&#xD;
