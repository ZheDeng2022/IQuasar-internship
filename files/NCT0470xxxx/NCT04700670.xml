  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The measurement of anti-Xa activity is classically used for the dose adjustement of&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin (UFH) treatment and to monitor reversal of UFH by protamine during&#xD;
      cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Three categories of reagents are currently&#xD;
      available in France for the measurement of anti-Xa activity: antithrombin-containing reagents&#xD;
      (very little used), antithrombin-free reagents and antithrombin-free reagents with dextran&#xD;
      sulphate. Significant differences in anti-Xa results based on the reagents used were&#xD;
      described, particularly after protamine neutralization in CPB. Indeed, dextran sulphate,&#xD;
      contained in some reagents, could dissociate the heparin/protamine complex contributing to&#xD;
      the higher levels of anti-Xa with these reagents. The differences observed in these patients&#xD;
      are likely related to the presence of platelet factor 4 (PF4) in the samples from either PF4&#xD;
      present in vivo in patients or released in vitro after blood collection. These differences&#xD;
      may lead to different therapeutic attitudes, including the re-administration of protamine to&#xD;
      neutralize heparin at the end of CBP&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Any hospitalized patient receiving UFH in the intensive, cardiac surgery and medicine&#xD;
      departments of the participating centres will be offered the study by investigator. It will&#xD;
      be included in the study after validation of the selection criteria and after collecting its&#xD;
      non-opposition. This participation will not change the medical care of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: patients with cardiac surgery with CBP. Blood samples in the operating room, 5&#xD;
           to 10 minutes after neutralization of heparin by protamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: patients who had cardiac surgery with CBP, between day 1 and day 5 after&#xD;
           surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3: hospitalized patients in intensive care unit, including patients on&#xD;
           extracorporeal life support (ECLS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4: patients hospitalized in a medical non-intensive care ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The response to heparin treatment varies considerably depending on the clinical situation.&#xD;
      The results found in one indication are not transposable to another indication. The 4 patient&#xD;
      groups will provide a comprehensive response to situations in which heparin is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, during the usual follow-up of anti-Xa activity, and only once per patient,&#xD;
      3 to 4 additional blood tubes - 1 citrate tube (0.109 M) of 5 mL or 2 citrate tubes of 3 mL&#xD;
      and 2 tubes CTAD (Citrate-Theophylline, Adenosine, Dipyrioledam) of 3 mL - will be taken&#xD;
      during a blood test carried out in common practice. Thus, no additional invasive gestures are&#xD;
      added by this search. CTAD contains, in addition to citrate, a platelet activation inhibitor&#xD;
      and thus limits the in-vitro activation of platelets and thus the release of PF4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be handle according to the usual procedures of each centre. All plasma&#xD;
      will be aliquoted and stored at -80oC, until the end of inclusions in the hematology&#xD;
      laboratories of each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the inclusion period, the aliquotes will be sent to the hematology laboratories&#xD;
      of the Necker University Hospital and the University Hospital of Rennes for centralized&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurement of anti-Xa activities will be carried out on frozen-defrosted citrate and&#xD;
      CTAD plasma with with 4 reagents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  STA-Liquid anti-Xa (STAGO) (not containing dextran)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biophen Heparin LRT (Hyphen) (containing dextran)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Berichrom (Siemens) with dextran&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Berichrom (Siemens) without dextran&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage of platelet factor 4 and beta-TG will be performed on frozen-defrosted plasma with&#xD;
      CTAD with asserachrom PF4 and Asserachrom beta-TG (Diagnostica Stago) kits.&#xD;
