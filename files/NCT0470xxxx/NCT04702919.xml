    <textblock>
      The oddball paradigm is one of the most widely used methods of brain exploration for the&#xD;
      study of attentional processes. It allows the measurement, by means of an&#xD;
      Electro-Enchephalogram (EEG), of evoked potentials reflecting the electrophysiological&#xD;
      reactivity to the detection of novel stimuli within a stream of standard stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have recently suggested that, in addition to neuronal activation, certain other&#xD;
      physiological processes related to cerebrovascular reactivity, such as the Brain Tissue&#xD;
      Pulsatility (BTP), could also be sensitive to various cognitive processes and in particular&#xD;
      to attentional processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one of the latest studies published in collaboration with our group, it was shown that the&#xD;
      amplitude of the electrophysiological response classically associated with attentional&#xD;
      activity (P300 wave) was significantly correlated with the amplitude of BTP, suggesting the&#xD;
      involvement of cerebrovascular processes in attentional functions. Nevertheless, in this&#xD;
      study, the two methods of EEG and Tissue Pulsatility Imaging (TPI) were not synchronized,&#xD;
      since TPI was performed at rest and not during the oddball task itself, and to date no study&#xD;
      has sought to couple the methods of EEG and ultrasound TPI in an oddball paradigm, for a&#xD;
      simultaneous characterization of neuronal and cerebrovascular responsiveness during&#xD;
      attentional processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective of this study will be to evaluate changes in BTP during the detection&#xD;
      of novel stimuli in an oddball task in healthy volunteers, in which the two methods of TPI&#xD;
      and EEG will be coupled and synchronized.&#xD;

      The oddball paradigm is one of the most widely used methods of brain exploration for the&#xD;
      study of attentional processes. It allows the measurement, by means of an&#xD;
      Electro-Enchephalogram (EEG), of evoked potentials reflecting the electrophysiological&#xD;
      reactivity to the detection of novel stimuli within a stream of standard stimuli. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have thus used the oddball paradigm to identify the neuronal reactivity involved in&#xD;
      attentional orientation towards target stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other studies have recently suggested that, in addition to neuronal activation, certain other&#xD;
      physiological processes related to cerebrovascular reactivity, such as the Brain Tissue&#xD;
      Pulsatility (BTP), could also be sensitive to various cognitive processes and in particular&#xD;
      to attentional processes. Ultrasound measurement of BTP is made possible by recent advances&#xD;
      in both the development of ultrasound equipment and ultrasound signal processing. Our team&#xD;
      and others have validated the measurement of BTP by ultrasound (Tissue Pulsatility Imaging -&#xD;
      TPI) in healthy volunteers and clinical populations, and our results suggest that the&#xD;
      mechanisms of BTP are significantly influenced by cerebrovascular physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one of the latest studies published in collaboration with our group, it was shown that the&#xD;
      amplitude of the electrophysiological response classically associated with attentional&#xD;
      activity (P300 wave) was significantly correlated with the amplitude of BTP, suggesting the&#xD;
      involvement of cerebrovascular processes in attentional functions. Nevertheless, in this&#xD;
      study, the two methods of EEG and TPI were not synchronized, since TPI was performed at rest&#xD;
      and not during the oddball task itself, and to date no study has sought to couple the methods&#xD;
      of EEG and ultrasound TPI in an oddball paradigm, for a simultaneous characterization of&#xD;
      neuronal and cerebrovascular responsiveness during attentional processes.&#xD;
