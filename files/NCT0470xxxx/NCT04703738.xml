  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This double blind, randomized, parallel study evaluates the non-inferiority of Geistlich&#xD;
      Fibro-Gide® in comparison to connective tissue graft for soft tissue volume augmentation&#xD;
      around dental implants&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total sample size of 60 subjects (n=60) will be evaluated at 5 centers, by 6 Investigators&#xD;
      with approximately 10-subjects per Investigator. Power analysis based on 80% power, past&#xD;
      Thoma, Zeltner and González-Martin studies 1,2,3 and a one-sided confidence interval of&#xD;
      0.025, indicates that with a volume change standard deviation between 0.5 and 0.7 mm, 17-31&#xD;
      subjects are required per group (test and control), so 50-60 subjects are an acceptable&#xD;
      estimate, with a preference for 60, given potential loss to long-term follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment site is accessed using a full thickness flap extending at least 1 full tooth mesial and distal, vertical releasing incisions may be used to obtain flap release for full coverage of the treatment site and graft without compression. The harvest graft donor area will be the palate in the bicuspid region on the same side as the control soft tissue augmentation therapy. The CTG will be harvested using full thickness incisions that include the periosteum and will be closed using suture and coating the incision line with a tissue adhesive. No covering stents or packs should be employed. The CTG will be sling sutured in place and the flap secured using a double sling suturing technique.</description>
