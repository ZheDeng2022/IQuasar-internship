  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous melanomas represent 4 to 11% of cutaneous cancers, but is responsible for 75% of&#xD;
      the deaths reported for these pathologies. The incidence rate double every 10 years. Fourteen&#xD;
      thousand cases and 1700 deaths were reported in France in 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The local staging of the cancer is represented by the Breslow index, which is measured on&#xD;
      histological analysis, corresponding to the maximum depth of the cancer. Breslow index is a&#xD;
      good pronostic value, and is used to choose for the best treatment for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having access to the Breslow index before the first resection of the tumor would allow&#xD;
      dermatologists to make a complete resection with the best treatment, and the analysis of the&#xD;
      sentinel lymph node, all during the same surgical time. Currently, patients need 2 surgeries&#xD;
      : one before the Breslow index, and a second one after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depth of cutaneous melanoma was already evaluated with High-Frequency Ultrasound (HF-US),&#xD;
      but gave disappointing results, with Breslow index not being accurately measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only 50% of tumors less than 2mm depth were efficiently measured. Results were even worst for&#xD;
      bigger tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a new approach, depending on the use of ultra high&#xD;
      frequency and large-band transducer. Nice's CHU acquired the only ultrasound device capable&#xD;
      of applying such ultra high frequency ultrasound (UHF-US) to human tissues. The device is a&#xD;
      VEVO MD (Vevo MD, Toronto, Canada) and equip the Ultrasound Department since June 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images investigators can assess with this device have an axial resolution of 30µm, for a&#xD;
      maximum emission frequency of 70MHz, which was not attainable until this day in human care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, when compared to some of the mono-frequency devices investigators experimented&#xD;
      before, this device allow investigators to attain a maximum depth of analysis up to 8mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consequence, this device seems to be able to realize an extremely precise analysis of the&#xD;
      skin, and of the cutaneous melanomas, for a structural analysis, as well as a precise depth&#xD;
      measurement, and should be evaluated in the measurement of the Breslow Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to analyze the interest of ultrasound biomicroscopy in the&#xD;
      pre-therapeutic evaluation of the Breslow index of cutaneous melanoma, compared to&#xD;
      histological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 60 patients with cutaneous melanomas, recently diagnosed in the&#xD;
      Dermatology Department of the Nice University Hospital (Pr Bahadoran, Pr Passeron, Pr&#xD;
      Lacour). Each patient will beneficiate from complete Ultrasound biomicroscopy analysis of the&#xD;
      tumor The examination will be made blindly by 2 operator, both with experience in Ultra High&#xD;
      frequency Ultrasound examinations (Dr Azulay, Dr Raffaelli).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum depth of the melanoma (Breslow index) will be recorded in µm. After surgical&#xD;
      resection, the histologic analysis (Dr Long, Pr Hofman, Clinical and Experimental&#xD;
      AnatomoPathologic laboratory, Nice's University Hospital) will measure the gold-standard&#xD;
      Breslow Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison will analyze the capacity of Ultrasound biomicroscopy for a precise&#xD;
      measurement of the Breslow Index, as well as the inter and intra-operator concordance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results of this study are positives and suggest a modification of the therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy, a larger multicentric study would be launched in the near future.&#xD;
