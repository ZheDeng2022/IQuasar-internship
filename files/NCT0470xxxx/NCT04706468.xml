    <textblock>
      This study is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-ranging study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of different doses of TG-1000 compared with placebo in adult patients&#xD;
      with acute uncomplicated influenza virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 200 patients will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatments groups in a ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1:1:1 to receive study treatment orally: &quot;40 mg TG-1000&quot;, &quot;80 mg TG-1000&quot;, &quot;40mg+40mg&#xD;
      TG-1000&quot; or &quot;placebo&quot;.&#xD;
