  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapses in bipolar disorders are associated with a significant proportional functional&#xD;
      impact, as well as worsening of the course of bipolar disorder, with impairment of the&#xD;
      quality of functional remission, as well as the development of addictive, anxiety and&#xD;
      suicidal comorbidities.The functional deficit and the instability of the mood disorder&#xD;
      increase with thymic relapses. Currently, these relapses (transition from the state of&#xD;
      remission, to a depressive or hyperthymic state) are difficult to predict and to treat&#xD;
      because of the absence of correlation between the degree of severity of the stressful event&#xD;
      (intensity associated stress) and the occurrence of relapse, taking into account the&#xD;
      mediation of this relationship by the stress compensation / adaptation capacities, which are&#xD;
      very individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project proposes to develop tools based on artificial intelligence technologies to&#xD;
      monitor the level of stress and adaptation to life events as well as identifying relapse&#xD;
      predictive factors of a patient by using portable and connected devices recording different&#xD;
      physiological signals in order to alert him/her when there is a risk of relapse, thus&#xD;
      anticipating therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
