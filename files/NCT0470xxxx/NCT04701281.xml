  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment proposed in this trial is to administer intra-arterial chemotherapy to liver&#xD;
      metastases from colorectal cancer when the blood flow to and from the liver has been isolated&#xD;
      via balloon catheters through a vascular access system called the AVAS. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the tumour response of repeated and isolated intra-arterial liver&#xD;
      isolation oxaliplatin compared with the standard systemic chemotherapy (intravenous 5-FU +&#xD;
      leucovorin + oxaliplatin [FOLFOX] or oral capecitabine with IV oxaliplatin [XELOX]).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment proposed in this study is based on the hypothesis that direct arterial infusion&#xD;
      of chemotherapy to metastatic tumours of the liver whilst the blood flow to the organ is&#xD;
      isolated could potentially yield benefits that cannot be achieved with existing treatment&#xD;
      regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three treatment stages; implantation of a vascular access device (known as the&#xD;
      AVAS), intra-arterial liver isolation oxaliplatin (LIOX) infusions and explantation of the&#xD;
      AVAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implantation: the participant is admitted to hospital and the AVAS is surgically implanted&#xD;
      under general anaesthetic. The AVAS is an implantable large bore cannula with one end that&#xD;
      can be anastomosed directly onto a peripheral vessel and the opposite end exiting the&#xD;
      patient's skin. The device can be opened to access the patient's vasculature when required&#xD;
      and closed when the device is not in use. In accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      Instructions-For-Use (IFU), the AVAS will be implanted in the axillary artery (i.e. the upper&#xD;
      pectoral area) or in the common femoral artery (upper thigh) by a surgeon experienced in&#xD;
      vascular disease. The implantation procedure takes around 2 hours. After implantation, the&#xD;
      participant is monitored overnight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-arterial LIOX infusions: the participant is admitted to the angiography suite and under&#xD;
      general anaesthetic or conscious sedation, intra-arterial hepatic isolation chemotherapy&#xD;
      infusion is administered by an interventional radiologist. The first infusion can be&#xD;
      administered 2 days after device implantation and infusions are spread out over an 8-week&#xD;
      period at a maximum such that the patient receives 5 to 7 infusions in total, has at least 2&#xD;
      full calendar days between each infusion, and there are no more than 2 infusions over any 7&#xD;
      consecutive days. Each infusion can take between 2-3 hours during the first few infusions but&#xD;
      should only take 1-2 hours for the remaining infusions as the radiologist becomes&#xD;
      familiarised with the patient's vascular anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Phase Ib stage, the starting dose of the oxaliplatin infused will be 50mg/m^2 and&#xD;
      this dose will be escalated by 10mg/m^2 with each patient until an optimal dose is&#xD;
      established. The optimal dose will be used for all patients enrolled during the Phase II&#xD;
      stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Explantation: the final infusion session is followed by the device explantation immediately,&#xD;
      or at a later time depending on the availability of operating rooms and the condition of the&#xD;
      participant. The surgical removal of the device takes approximately 1-2 hours, the&#xD;
      participant is monitored overnight and discharged the next day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, capecitabine will be administered orally as per standard care (1000 mg/m^2 twice&#xD;
      daily in 2 week cycles) throughout the study treatment period (from enrolment to 4 weeks&#xD;
      after the AVAS explantation) as a form of systemic disease management. The oncologist may&#xD;
      modify the capecitabine dose/frequency based on the patient's response to the medication.&#xD;
