  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted over a 6 months period. For the first three months, the child&#xD;
      will be accompagned with a connected companion. After this period, the companion will be&#xD;
      removed for three months in oder to prove this companion could improve treatment adherence&#xD;
      for children suffering from cytolisis fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at the University Hospital Center of Rennes and Hospital Center&#xD;
      of Saint-Brieuc.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In developed countries, chronic diseases with long-term therapy adherence is about 50%,&#xD;
      according to the WHO report, and the adherence rate for regular intake of preventive&#xD;
      therapies decreases to 28%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For cystic fibrosis, rates are not much higher. Optimistic articles report an average&#xD;
      compliance rate of 60%. Other articles report a rate of 50% which varies according to the age&#xD;
      of the patient, the intake treatment complexity and burdensome drug treatment (physiotherapy&#xD;
      achieves the lowest adherence with 38%), the disease understanding and the interest of&#xD;
      treatment persuasion. Low adherence can also be the result of incorrect use of administration&#xD;
      devices, for example for inhaled treatments. Technical errors are very frequent and affect&#xD;
      around 30% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families with children suffering from cystic fibrosis need daily support. Health&#xD;
      professionals need to relay their recommendations at home. This is why new and funny tools&#xD;
      dedicated to children with chronic illnesses are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will study the impact of connected companion named LEO® created by Ludocare&#xD;
      company.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study will be conducted as :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V0 : Companion given to the child&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1 : Companion removed after 3 months of use&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V2 : Follow-up done between 1 and 3 months after the period without companion&#xD;

    <description>The main evaluation criterion will be the overall compliance of the cohort in percentage terms. These data from connected companion will be refined for each type of treatment: pancreatic extracts, inhaled treatments, CFTR modulator, antibiotics, vitamins, laxative treatment, antacids, bile acids, food supplements, physiotherapy. For each treatment, the data &quot;take&quot; or &quot;not take&quot; will be treated by device and provide for statistical analysis in percentage. Each percentage will be grouped in global percentage will be therapeutic adherence all over study.</description>
