  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      intravenous sulopenem and oral sulopenem etzadroxil/probenecid in adolescent patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will be screened for eligibility. Hospitalized patients who are 12-18 years&#xD;
      of age and who are receiving background antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract&#xD;
      infection, complicated urinary tract infection, acute pyelonephritis, or complicated&#xD;
      intraabdominal infection, and who meet eligibility requirements will receive a single 1000 mg&#xD;
      IV dose of sulopenem on Day 1. The following day, patients will receive a single dose of 500&#xD;
      mg of sulopenem etzadroxil and 500 mg of probenecid given orally as a bilayer tablet. During&#xD;
      treatment, pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and patients will be monitored for&#xD;
      safety and tolerability.&#xD;
