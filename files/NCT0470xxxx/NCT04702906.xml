      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential adjuvant therapeutic effect of&#xD;
      trimetazidine in treatment of acute AlP poisoning-induced cardiotoxicity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aluminium phosphide (AlP) is an inorganic phosphide. It is used as a fumigant to protect&#xD;
      stored grains from insects, rodents and other pests.It is a solid fumigant widely used in&#xD;
      Egypt as a grain preservative. Its tablets are commonly used due to their low cost, high&#xD;
      efficacy, and availability .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxic effects of AlP are related to phosphine gas release when AlP comes in contact with&#xD;
      moisture or gastric acidity. Phosphine gas is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract and lungs inhibiting cytochrome-c oxidase and oxidative phosphorylation which results&#xD;
      in adenosine triphosphate depletion and resulting cellualr death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The direct toxic effects of phosphine on cardiac myocytes, fluid loss and adrenal gland can&#xD;
      induce profound circulatory collapse. Phosphides and phosphine can exert a direct corrosive&#xD;
      effect on body tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxic manifestations usually appear rapidly upon phosphide exposure. Impaired myocardial&#xD;
      contractility, fluid loss, pulmonary edema, metabolic acidosis and acute renal failure are&#xD;
      the most frequent manifestations. Disseminated intravascular coagulation and hepatic necrosis&#xD;
      may also occur. Patients generally die due to multi-organ failure .However, myocardial&#xD;
      damage- induced cardiovascular collapse is reported to be the primary cause of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity of manifestations depends on different factors such as dose, exposure route, and&#xD;
      time delay before treatment initiation. Diagnosis is based on history of exposure, garlic&#xD;
      odor of the breath, suggestive clinical manifestations and detection of phosphine gas in&#xD;
      gastric aspirate or breath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of acute AlP toxicity is mainly supportive as there is no specific antidote since&#xD;
      the exact mechanism of toxicity is still unknown. The most important factor is resuscitation&#xD;
      of shock. Many researches are directed towards finding a specific treatment for this fatal&#xD;
      poison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimetadizine is described as the first cytoprotective anti-ischemic agent developed. It has&#xD;
      a protective of the myocardium due to its preservation of oxidative metabolism. It improves&#xD;
      myocardial glucose utilization through inhibition of long-chain 3-ketoacyl CoA thiolase&#xD;
      activity, which results in a reduction in fatty acid oxidation and a stimulation of glucose&#xD;
      oxidation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trimetadizine reduces the tissue accumulation of malonyldialdehyde, the lipid peroxidation&#xD;
      index, and the sodium influx related to activation of the Na+ -K + pump. Moreover, it lack of&#xD;
      haemodynamic effects. These effects result in a decrease in the cellular accumulation of&#xD;
      calcium and improved intracellular ATP levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral administration of the anti-ischaemic drug trimetazidine, was tried in a case report of&#xD;
      occupational inhalation exposure to phosphine gas from AlP. It was temporally associated with&#xD;
      clinical improvement.&#xD;
