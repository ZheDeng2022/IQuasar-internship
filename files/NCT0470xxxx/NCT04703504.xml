  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of heart failure (HF) is constantly increasing in France due to the aging of&#xD;
      the population, better management of etiological factors and improved treatments (drug /&#xD;
      interventional). On the other hand, re-hospitalizations for heart failure continue to&#xD;
      increase, exceeding reception capacities and constitute a real challenge for current public&#xD;
      health systems. The PRADO system provides administrative support (through a health insurance&#xD;
      advisor) in the management of patient appointments with their doctors as well as home visits&#xD;
      by a nurse trained in heart failure. Other interventional medical and educational&#xD;
      interventions performed during an out-of-hospital consultation guided by a computer platform&#xD;
      would help to optimize the care and continuity of care.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the value of a multiple intervention program in&#xD;
      reducing early readmissions for heat failure in patients hospitalized for cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will create an interventional assistance program to structure the exit consultation&#xD;
      in order to optimize treatment, educate patients, ensure the continuity of hospital-city care&#xD;
      and improve compliance (reminders) to reduce re-hospitalizations. This program will be&#xD;
      carried out by using a computer platform allowing the systematization of output documents and&#xD;
      the sending of messages (e-mail / SMS) for making appointments (medical consultations,&#xD;
      biologicals sampling) and perfect therapeutic education.&#xD;
