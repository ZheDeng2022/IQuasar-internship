      The primary objective of this study is to assess the percentage of time patients were in&#xD;
      normal glucose control.&#xD;

      Retrospective Dexcom G6 iCGM data stored in the Clarity cloud from eligible patients will be&#xD;
      accessed and downloaded, stripped of patient-identifying information and provided to the&#xD;
      contract research organization (CRO) to review prior to sending to the Sponsor for analysis&#xD;
      of glycemic control. The CRO will ensure data shared with the Sponsor is de-identified and&#xD;
      transferred over a secure file transfer platform. Further, Remote Site Specialists (RSSs)&#xD;
      from the CRO will work with the healthcare providers (HCPs) from participating sites to&#xD;
      obtain additional patient data including medical history, prescribed diet,&#xD;
      cornstarch/Glycosade use and demographic data directly, if available, from the medical charts&#xD;
      and will enter this information into an electronic data capture (EDC) system.&#xD;
