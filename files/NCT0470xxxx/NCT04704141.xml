  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although much is known about the microenvironment of the gut and the vagina, very little has&#xD;
      been published on the microenvironment of the seminal plasma. The seminal plasma is the&#xD;
      support fluid for sperm, providing nutrients, facilitating sperm transit to the uterus, and&#xD;
      promoting fertilization. It is a rich area of research for markers of fertility and treatment&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that (1) there are significant populations of seminal&#xD;
      microorganisms associated with seminal leukocyte counts well below the WHO's cutoff for&#xD;
      pyospermia (1 million/mL) that were not previously detected by traditional culturing methods,&#xD;
      and (2) there are pathologic populations of bacteria within the gut and semen microbiome&#xD;
      which negatively impact overall fertility, by directly or indirectly impairing hormone&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Male Fertility practice at the University of&#xD;
      Illinois-Chicago (UIC). All participants will have infertility, diagnosed as an inability to&#xD;
      conceive pregnancy after 12 months of unprotected intercourse. The normal evaluation of these&#xD;
      participants is to obtain at least one semen analysis and bloodwork investigating their&#xD;
      endocrine profile: total testosterone, estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG),&#xD;
      luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and albumin. Semen volume is&#xD;
      typically &gt;1 mL, and &lt;0.2 mL is typically used for the semen analysis. If over 1 million/mL&#xD;
      round cells are identified, then a Papanicolaou stain would be performed to identify&#xD;
      leukocytes. In this study, any semen demonstrated to have round cells would undergo&#xD;
      Papanicolaou staining. A portion of the remaining semen, which would typically be discarded,&#xD;
      will be sent for microbiome analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, as part of routine care, fertility patients may be started on medications to&#xD;
      increase endogenous testosterone (i.e.: clomiphene citrate, anastrozole, etc). Participants&#xD;
      started on medications will also be asked to submit a rectal swab for gut microbiome&#xD;
      analysis. Routine care is to monitor the hormonal and testicular response with periodic&#xD;
      endocrine blood panels and semen analyses; rectal swabs will be requested at these follow-up&#xD;
      intervals also. The control group for both hypotheses will be men with clinical infertility&#xD;
      with normal semen analyses and hormone profiles.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characterize the microbiota of the genitourinary tract and testicular microenvironment&#xD;
           in infertile men with leukocytes in the semen by using 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze&#xD;
           the microbiome of de-identified semen samples, and compare the results of semen with&#xD;
           normal parameters to the results of semen with leukocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the influence of the gut microbiome on hormone replacement therapy in&#xD;
           hypogonadal, infertile men who are being treated with hormone replacement therapy, by&#xD;
           analyzing multiple de-identified blood samples and rectal swabs collected both before&#xD;
           and over the course of standard hypogonadism treatment. The investigators will use 16S&#xD;
           rRNA sequencing on the rectal swabs and hormone level analysis of the blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification and Enrollment: Participants who meet inclusion criteria will be identified in&#xD;
      UIC Urology fertility clinics by attending physician co-investigators during routine chart&#xD;
      review for standard patient care. The participant will then be approached regarding the study&#xD;
      and discuss the following: informed consent and information within it, basic information&#xD;
      about the human microenvironments and significance in layman's terms, and reinforce that&#xD;
      participation in the study will have no impact on the participant's care. Consent to&#xD;
      participate will be obtained if the participant elects to proceed. The participant will&#xD;
      receive oral and written information about the study. The written information includes&#xD;
      understandable information about the study with extensive information on the study and&#xD;
      include a copy of the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These participants' medical records will be reviewed for basic data listed below, and if&#xD;
      hypogonadal also periodically after routine blood draws (see Venipuncture below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant information management: Participants' names, MRN, and DOB will be stored in a UIC&#xD;
      REDCap database. Each participant will also be assigned a study identification number&#xD;
      generated by a random number generator. This ID number will be used to label the respective&#xD;
      participant's biospecimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semen collection and storage: As part of standard infertility workup of men, a semen sample&#xD;
      will be requested after the diagnosis of infertility is made. Semen will be prospectively&#xD;
      collected by the UIC Andrology Laboratory (820 S Wood St, Room 132, Chicago, IL 60612).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed on the following for sample collection (adapted from Hou et&#xD;
      al.):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Present for sample provision after 3-7 days of abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wash hands 2-3 times with soap and water prior to masturbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Wash penis with a focus on glans and coronal sulcus with soap and water followed by 75%&#xD;
           alcohol, 2-3 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Avoid contact of specimen with inside side wall of sample container.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 0.1 mL or less of freshly collected semen will be used for standard semen analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If semen is identified to have any number of round cells, then a leukocyte count will be&#xD;
           determined by Papanicolaou staining.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The remainder of semen will be transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, with up to 1 mL&#xD;
           each tube, and stored in a -80C freezer within 2 hours of collection. The -80C freezer&#xD;
           is in a locked room of the UIC Andrology Laboratory accessible to authorized personnel&#xD;
           only.[7]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venipuncture: Participants will have their blood drawn during standard initial evaluation of&#xD;
      infertility. This will be performed either by UIC phlebotomy services (1801 W Taylor St Room&#xD;
      4B, Chicago, IL 60612) or any other phlebotomy site and laboratory based on participant&#xD;
      preference. The endocrine profile will be determined by testing total testosterone,&#xD;
      estradiol, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), luteinizing hormone (LH),&#xD;
      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and albumin levels. A total of 4.9 mL venous blood is&#xD;
      required for these tests and thus a total of 3 gold-topped vials would be drawn from a vein.&#xD;
      Men determined to be hypogonadal (total testosterone &lt;300 ng/dL or bioavailable testosterone&#xD;
      &lt;150 ng/dL) will be requested to provide a rectal swab as well (see below). As part of&#xD;
      standard treatment of their condition, these participants will be started on medications to&#xD;
      increase endogenous testosterone (ie: clomiphene citrate, anastrozole, human chorionic&#xD;
      gonadotropin, etc). Additionally, as part of standard care, these participants will be&#xD;
      requested to return for regular assessment of medication side effects and efficacy with&#xD;
      laboratory monitoring of their endocrine profile. This is carried out in intervals of 3-4&#xD;
      months at the attending physician's discretion. The laboratory data of participants meeting&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be recorded in a de-identified REDCap database, identified by the&#xD;
      study ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectal swab collection: After review of laboratory results with the participant at the first&#xD;
      follow-up appointment, if the participant is diagnosed with infertility secondary to&#xD;
      hypogonadism with no other identifiable causes, he will be requested to provide rectal swabs&#xD;
      for analysis of the gut microbiome. A rectal swab kit will be provided to the participant.&#xD;
      After a bowel movement, the participant will be asked to use the swab to collect sample from&#xD;
      the anus and return the sample in the provided sterile plastic bag. This will be stored in a&#xD;
      secure, locked cabinet. A rectal swab will then be requested at the same time intervals as&#xD;
      follow-up bloodwork, collected and stored in the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiota profile characterization: Microbiota analysis will be performed by the Igenomix&#xD;
      laboratory in Valencia, Spain (Ronda Narciso Monturiol, 11 B, Parque Tecnológico Paterna,&#xD;
      46980 - Paterna -, Valencia, Spain). Once the investigators have prospectively collected&#xD;
      participant samples, semen and/or rectal swabs, the investigators will periodically send&#xD;
      samples to Igenomix for processing, as logistically feasible. The investigators will send 1&#xD;
      sample of each type of specimen per participant as applicable (i.e. if a participant gave&#xD;
      enough semen for 3 additional vials in our storage freezer, then 1 vial would be sent to&#xD;
      Igenomix; if the participant is also hypogonadal then a rectal swab is sent if it is&#xD;
      indicated and collected as described above). Each of these samples will be identified only by&#xD;
      study ID number and will have no PHI. Only the study ID number associated with each vial and&#xD;
      no other identifying information will be sent with the samples, ensuring that no PHI will&#xD;
      ever be shared with Igenomix. Igenomix laboratory will perform microbiota profiling using 16S&#xD;
      rRNA gene sequencing in each specimen. There will be no stored samples after the analysis, as&#xD;
      all the material will be used for DNA extraction and subsequent sequencing. All acquired data&#xD;
      will be uploaded into a separate UIC REDCap database, with each sample's dataset identified&#xD;
      again only by study ID number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Data analysis will be performed by Dr. Pagani and UIC co-investigators to&#xD;
      analyze the data using de-identified data sets from participant chart review and those&#xD;
      provided by the Igenomix laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cursory analysis of microbiota data sets will determine the exact statistical analyses&#xD;
      applicable to address our study objectives and hypotheses. The investigators will assess&#xD;
      bacterial microbiome composition and abundance using statistics computational programs such&#xD;
      as the R package (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The investigators&#xD;
      will further characterize the bacterial communities by creating hierarchical clustering based&#xD;
      on published methods such as described by Hou et al. (PMID: 23993888). Based on the resulting&#xD;
      data, the investigators will choose the appropriate statistical procedure to test our 2&#xD;
      hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study completion: Participants will be followed for 12 months, allowing for 4 follow-up&#xD;
      appointments and sample collections. At the conclusion of our study, the investigators will&#xD;
      destroy any remaining biospecimen. All identifiable data will be purged from the REDCap&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
