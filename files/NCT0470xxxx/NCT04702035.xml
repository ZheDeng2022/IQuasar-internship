  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      20 patients who are diagnosed with NPH receive a set of 5 wearable gyroscopes (IMUs,&#xD;
      ZurichMove sensors) for a period of 3 days for measurement and characterization of their&#xD;
      walking in an ambulatory setting. At a follow-up 2 weeks to 6 months after CSF diversion&#xD;
      surgery, the examination is repeated and improvement is measured. The data will be compared&#xD;
      with a healthy group of 20 age- and gender-matched individuals as well a a group of 20 young&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporary attachment of IMUs to wrists and ankles of the patients and probands for a period&#xD;
      of three days and recording of movement during a 10 meter-walking test, 180° turnaround and&#xD;
      during normal movement at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (patients):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a completed diagnostic concerning iNPH, who are planned to receive a VP-shunt&#xD;
      by their responsible neurosurgeon (independently from the study), will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the shunt implantation, the patients will be examined at the USZ using wearable&#xD;
      gyroscopes (like wristwatches) at both wrists and ankles as well as one around the body&#xD;
      center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short examination will comprise a patient history (MoCa test, Kiefer-score, Stein- and&#xD;
      Langfitt-Score), a short examination (4 minute walking test, 180° turnaround) in hospital.&#xD;
      Afterwards, the patient goes home, where the gyroscopes examine walking patterns for a period&#xD;
      of three days. After this period, the patient brings the devices back to the hospital. The&#xD;
      surgery will take place afterwards, independently from the study, as well as adjustments of&#xD;
      the shunt's flow-resistance for achievement of optimal response to the therapy. After this&#xD;
      optimal result is achieved, but latest after 6 months, the examination will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 2 and 3 (controls):&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well 20 subjects matched for sex and age with the patient's group as 20 healthy young&#xD;
      subjects will be examined just like the patients preoperatively. Walking patterns shall be&#xD;
      compared to identify changes between pre- and postoperatively as well as differences between&#xD;
      patients and controls.&#xD;
