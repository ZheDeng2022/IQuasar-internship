  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical study is intended to evaluate oral P5P for the treatment of patients&#xD;
      confirmed to have Pyridox(am)ine 5'-Phosphate Oxidase (PNPO) deficiency via genetic analysis.&#xD;
      There is an unmet clinical need for pharmaceutical grade P5P, as to date none has been made&#xD;
      commercially available. Patients will receive pharmaceutical grade P5P according to their&#xD;
      normal oral P5P dosing regimen, as previously established by their physicians.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with confirmed PNPO deficiency via genetic analysis, whose seizures are&#xD;
             typically controlled on P5P (oral) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             a. Typically controlled is defined as receiving multiple doses of P5P daily to control&#xD;
             seizures. Receiving P5P for a minimum of 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and/or female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with previous failed treatment on pyridoxine are eligible for the study&#xD;
             (patient should be off pyridoxine for at least 24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Written informed consent (by parent or guardian if under the age of 18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The patient has any condition or abnormality which may, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, compromise the safety of the patient, or influence their ability to&#xD;
             comply with study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known or suspected allergy to the trial drug or the relevant drugs given in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Involvement in a clinical research study within 4 weeks prior to screening and/or&#xD;
             prior enrollment in the study. Participation in observational registry studies is&#xD;
             permitted.&#xD;
