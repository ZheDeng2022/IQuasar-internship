  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a disorder of unknown origin&#xD;
      characterized by orthostatic intolerance and increased heart rate (HR) of ≥ 30 beats/minute&#xD;
      during orthostasis in the absence of orthostatic hypotension. In addition to the orthostatic&#xD;
      intolerance and tachycardia, patients with POTS experience several debilitating symptoms&#xD;
      including light-headedness, nausea, blurred vision, fatigue, mental confusion (&quot;brain-fog&quot;),&#xD;
      chest pain and gastrointestinal problems. Several potential underlying mechanisms have been&#xD;
      suggested for POTS including autonomic denervation, hypovolemia, hyperadrenergic stimulation&#xD;
      and autoantibodies against adrenergic receptors. However, none of these proposed mechanisms&#xD;
      has yet led to an effective treatment. Physical activity is recommended as a complimentary&#xD;
      treatment in POTS in international guidelines. However, less is known regarding how physical&#xD;
      activity could successfully be implemented in clinical practice in patients with POTS. Thus,&#xD;
      in the current study, we aim to assess the effect of a 16-week specialized physical activity&#xD;
      program in POTS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 patients diagnosed with POTS are asked to participate in the study. Prior to&#xD;
      start of the training program a special POTS questionnaire (based on the symptoms reported in&#xD;
      The BIG POTS Survey), the orthostatic hypotension questionnaire and SF-36 (general health&#xD;
      questionnaire) will be completed by the participants. Orthostatic tests are performed during&#xD;
      10 minutes, measuring heart rate and blood pressure after 0, 1, 3, and, if possible, 10&#xD;
      minutes of standing. On a separate occasion, patients will perform a submaximal biking&#xD;
      exercise test, while noting symptoms, degree of exertion, achieved effect, pulse and blood&#xD;
      pressure reaction. Following this initial evaluation, the training program will be performed&#xD;
      during a total time of 16 weeks, which may be non-consecutive but within 6 months in total.&#xD;
      The training program consists of 2-3 visits per week, and 60 minutes per visit. The training&#xD;
      may be performed on specialized exercise bicycles in supine position or upright position&#xD;
      depending on the severity of POTS symptoms. These exercises will be done under the&#xD;
      supervision of physiotherapists with special interest in POTS. After the final training&#xD;
      session the POTS questionnaire, the orthostatic hypotension questionnaire and SF-36 will be&#xD;
      completed once again. In addition, orthostatic tests and submaximal biking exercise test will&#xD;
      be performed on a separate occasion soon after the last training session. The present study&#xD;
      will be using longitudinal comparisons, meaning that the 100 POTS patients are their own&#xD;
      controls. The POTS questionnaire, the orthostatic hypotension questionnaire, SF-36,&#xD;
      hemodynamics and exercise capacity will be compared before and after the 16-weeks training&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
