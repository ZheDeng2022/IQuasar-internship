    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The HOME-Rx is a performance-based tool designed to identify functional barriers to medication management for community-dwelling older adults. Its purpose is to identify common and specific barriers to independence in medication management for older adults living independently in the community. We will use the I-HOPE measure the severity of barriers impacting medication management before and after the intervention. We will also measure the performance and satisfication of the older adult to perform their medication management tasks independently before and after the intervention.</description>

    <description>This research study involved an initial 1.5 hour visit and 2-3 follow up home visits (each lasting 60 minutes). Participants received 2-3 home visits during which they received recommendations on strategies which will improve medication management. Level II occupational therapy fieldwork students made the recommendations, after approval from their supervising licensed OT. The OT fieldwork students provided assistance to the individual in implementing strategies, obtaining adaptive equipment at little or no cost to the individual.</description>
