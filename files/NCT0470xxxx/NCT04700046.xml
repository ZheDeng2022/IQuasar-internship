      A Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Multi-center Study to Investigate the&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      intended to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mexiletine in patients with myotonic&#xD;
      dystrophy type 1 and type 2 (DM1 and DM2). The study will consist of a 4-week screening&#xD;
      period and a 26-week treatment phase with patient visits as screening, baseline, weeks 1, 2,&#xD;
      6, 14, 18, and 26. Eligible patients will be randomized to mexiletine or placebo in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Approximately 158 DM1 patients (79 active: 79 placebo) are planned to be enrolled&#xD;
      across 10-15 experienced investigational centers in Europe. In addition, up to 16 DM2&#xD;
      patients are planned to be enrolled (sub-group - 8 active: 8 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drug (mexiletine 167 mg or placebo) will be started as a once a day (QD) treatment&#xD;
      regimen. The dose will be titrated up at the Week 1 and Week 2 visits to a maximum of 1&#xD;
      capsule three times a day. Depending on tolerability, the dose can also be either maintained&#xD;
      or - if required - reduced by one dose step at any time during the study to a minimum dose of&#xD;
      167 mg QD.&#xD;

    <measure>Assess the efficacy and safety of mexiletine for the symptomatic treatment of myotonia</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the efficacy and safety of mexiletine for the symptomatic treatment of myotonia in adult patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 and type 2 (DM1 and DM2) by handgrip relaxation time in DM1 patients: Mean change from baseline (i.e., Day 1, pre-dose) in relaxation time of handgrip after 3 seconds of MVIC of the dominant hand using a handgrip dynamometer at Week 26. Mean relaxation time at each timepoint will be calculated from the first contraction in each of the 3 trials (each trial consists of 6 maximal voluntary contractions). Relaxation time for the assessment of myotonia will be calculated as the time required for the force to decline from 90% of maximum voluntary contraction force to 5%.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on patient-reported outcomes by way of standardized instrument for measuring generic health status, EuroQol- 5 Dimension (EQ-5D).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 14, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D is a multi-attribute utility instrument for measuring health-related quality of life. EQ-5D: EuroQol - 5 dimensions (Health-related quality of life measure developed by EuroQol group). The index score is calculated by software hence minimum/maximum or better/worse not applicable. The EQ-5D assessments will be collected on Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 14, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on patient-reported outcomes by Timed &quot;Up &amp; Go&quot; (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The TUG Test (Podsiadlo, 1991; Trip 2009a) measures, in seconds, the time taken by an individual to stand up from a standard arm chair (approximate seat height of 46 cm, arm height 65 cm), walk a distance of 3 meters (approximately 10 feet), turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on patient-reported outcomes by Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL) overall</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 14, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>INQoL- Individualized neuromuscular quality of life questionnaire. Higher score represents worsening and lower score represents better. Minimum/maximum- not applicable. The INQoL overall questionnaire will be completed on Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 14, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on functional capacity outcome measures by Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL) locking domain.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on functional capacity outcome measures by Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life Questionnaire (INQoL) locking domain.INQoL- Individualized neuromuscular quality of life questionnaire. Higher score represents worsening and lower score represents better. Minimum/maximum- not applicable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on functional capacity outcome measures by Myotonia Behavior Scale (MBS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 2, Week 6, Week 14, Week 18, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>MBS was originally developed by Budzynski, Stoyva, Adler and Mullaney as a pain measurement instrument (Budzynski, 1973). The patient chooses one out of six framed sentences, which most closely describe the impact of the stiffness on everyday life. MBS: myotonia behavior scale, score ranges 0 - 5. Lower score is better and higher score is worsening. The MBS assessments will be completed on Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 2, Week 6, Week 14, Week 18, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on functional capacity outcome measures by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for myotonia.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The construction of VAS in this study is an absolute measure, with a straight, horizontal, 10 cm line having the endpoints &quot;No stiffness at all&quot; and &quot;Stiffness as worst possible&quot;. The patient responds with a score on the line to the nearest millimeter on a 100-point scale. The VAS will be completed on Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 2, Week 6, Week 14, Week 18, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on functional capacity outcome measures by 10 meter Walk Test (10mWT).</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>the 10mWT is a performance-based test assessing walking in two different conditions, own preferred speed and maximum speed, over a short distance. The time taken to walk 10 meters at usual comfortable and maximum speed is recorded with a stopwatch.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the efficacy of mexiletine on functional capacity outcome measures by DM1-Active-c.</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 14, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</time_frame>
    <description>DM1-Activ-c scale is a disease-specific, Rasch-built scale, developed as a patient-reported outcome measure of capacity for activity and social participation with a 0-100 interval range (a higher score indicates higher capacity) (Hermans, 2015).VAS- Visual analogue scale. Score ranges 0-100. Lower is better and higher is worsening. The DM1-Activ-c scale score will be collected on Day 1 (pre-dose), Week 14, and Week 26 (or early discontinuation)</description>
