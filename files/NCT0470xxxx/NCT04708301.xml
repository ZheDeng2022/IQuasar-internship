      Fabry disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder characterised by a genetic deficiency in&#xD;
      the α-galactosidase enzyme. This deficiency leads to a progressive accumulation of a fatty&#xD;
      substance, called glycosphingolipids within a specific part of our cells called the lysosome.&#xD;
      This lysosomal accumulation can have devastating effects on patients with Fabry disease,&#xD;
      affecting multiple organs. Heart involvement is particularly feared because it is the leading&#xD;
      cause of death in Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) is a relatively new heart imaging&#xD;
      technique. A cardiac MRI technique called T1 mapping can measure the magnetic relaxation&#xD;
      properties of heart tissue. T1 mapping is important in Fabry disease because&#xD;
      glycosphingolipids have distinct magnetic relaxation properties. The abnormal build up of&#xD;
      glycosphingolipid within the heart may be detectable using T1 mapping. This accumulation of&#xD;
      glycosphingolipid could identify an earlier form of Fabry disease. Moreover, it is postulated&#xD;
      that T1 mapping may inform prognosis and response to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst promising, further investigation and development of this innovative technique in Fabry&#xD;
      disease is required. This study aims to find out more about T1 mapping in Fabry disease.&#xD;
      Patients referred for clinical cardiac MRI scanning will also undergo T1 mapping. T1 mapping&#xD;
      results will be correlated with other markers of disease severity. This will allow heart&#xD;
      muscle T1 to be determined in a larger population of Fabry patients than currently exists in&#xD;
      the literature and T1 to be characterised across a wider range of Fabry disease severity than&#xD;
      currently exists in the literature.&#xD;

      Anderson-Fabry disease (Fabry disease) is a genetic lysosomal storage disorder. Lysosomes are&#xD;
      structures found within cells that contain enzymes which break down waste products and&#xD;
      foreign material. In Fabry disease there is an inborn deficiency of an enzyme called&#xD;
      α-galactosidase A. This leads to progressive accumulation of a fatty substance, called&#xD;
      glycosphingolipid, in the lysosomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulation of glycosphingolipid in cells can affect the function of many organs, but in&#xD;
      particular it affects the heart, the brain and nerves and the kidneys. It manifests as severe&#xD;
      and chronic limb pain, progressive kidney dysfunction, transient ischaemic attacks and&#xD;
      strokes, coronary artery disease and heart failure. Heart involvement is particularly&#xD;
      important because it is responsible for the majority of deaths in patients with Fabry&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fabry disease affects between 1:17,000 to 1:117,000 people, although the prevalence is likely&#xD;
      to be underestimated due to difficulties in diagnosis. It is seen across all ethnic and&#xD;
      racial groups. It is a chronic disease with significantly reduced survival (median age of&#xD;
      death 50). The culprit gene is carried on the X chromosome, therefore males are generally&#xD;
      more severely affected than females, with symptoms beginning in childhood or adolescence.&#xD;
      Manifestations are more variable in females, from no apparent disease to full expression, but&#xD;
      up to 90% have symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no cure for Fabry disease, however enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which consists&#xD;
      of providing affected patients with the deficient enzyme, is available. ERT has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to reverse or slow disease progression before irreversible end-organ damage has&#xD;
      occurred. However, there are no uniform guidelines as to which patients should receive ERT,&#xD;
      when to start it, how to monitor response and when to stop it. As such, patient care is far&#xD;
      from optimal, with patients who would benefit from ERT often getting it too late or&#xD;
      potentially not getting it at all. Furthermore, ERT is being started in patients in whom the&#xD;
      disease is irreversible, or continued in patients in whom it is no longer of benefit. As well&#xD;
      as the implications for patient care, this has significant implications for healthcare&#xD;
      provision, given that ERT costs in excess of £100,000 per patient per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason why there are no good guidelines for ERT is that there is no good test to&#xD;
      determine organ involvement or organ response to therapy. As explained above, heart&#xD;
      involvement is particularly important but the current technique to assess heart involvement&#xD;
      (ultrasound scanning of the heart (echocardiography)) is insensitive to accumulation of&#xD;
      glycosphingolipid. Echocardiography allows assessment for heart muscle thickening and&#xD;
      impairment of gross pumping function, but such changes occur late and are insensitive for&#xD;
      assessing response to ERT. Heart muscle biopsy can determine glycosphingolipid accumulation,&#xD;
      however this is very invasive, expensive and not an acceptable technique for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-invasive technique to detect early heart involvement in Fabry disease, that would guide&#xD;
      initiation of ERT, monitor response to ERT and determine which patients will not benefit from&#xD;
      ERT, is urgently required, both in terms of improving and individualizing patient care and in&#xD;
      terms of optimizing healthcare provision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (cardiac MRI) is a relatively new clinical heart&#xD;
      imaging technique. It provides detailed and often unique information about heart structure&#xD;
      and function. Cardiac MRI images are acquired using magnetic fields. It is free from ionizing&#xD;
      radiation; indeed it is considered to be &quot;one of the safest medical procedures currently&#xD;
      available&quot; (www.nhs.uk), and thus is an ideal technique for disease surveillance and&#xD;
      treatment monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the unique attributes of cardiac MRI is its ability to non-invasively characterise the&#xD;
      make-up of heart muscle tissue. Just like all tissues have mass, all tissues have magnetic&#xD;
      properties. A cardiac MRI technique called T1 mapping can measure the magnetic relaxation&#xD;
      properties of tissues. T1 mapping techniques have been used to assess other organs for many&#xD;
      years, but have only relatively recently been applied to the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat has different magnetic properties to heart muscle; specifically it has faster magnetic&#xD;
      relaxation than heart muscle. This difference can be measured using T1 mapping - fat has a&#xD;
      shorter (or lower value) T1 relaxation time than heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described above, in Fabry disease, there is accumulation of glycosphingolipid in the&#xD;
      heart. Also as described, glycosphingolipid is a fatty substance. Therefore, accumulation of&#xD;
      this fat in the heart could theoretically be detected using the T1 mapping technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two small studies have demonstrated low T1 mapping values in Fabry disease patients in&#xD;
      comparison to healthy volunteers and in comparison to patients with other heart conditions&#xD;
      that cause heart muscle thickening (Sado et al Circ Cardiovasc Imaging. 2013;6:392-398 and&#xD;
      Thompson et al Circ Cardiovasc Imaging. 2013;6:637-645). Interestingly, low T1 mapping values&#xD;
      were seen in the absence of any other detectable changes in heart structure and function,&#xD;
      suggesting that this technique could allow early detection of heart involvement in Fabry&#xD;
      disease. T1 mapping and other allied cardiac MRI techniques (late gadolinium enhancement and&#xD;
      extracellular volume quantification) have also been used to demonstrate heart muscle scarring&#xD;
      in Fabry disease, which is irreversible and thus unlikely to be amenable to ERT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially therefore, cardiac MRI T1 mapping could allow early detection of heart&#xD;
      involvement in Fabry disease and thus better guide initiation of ERT, allow monitoring of&#xD;
      heart response to ERT and, together with the allied cardiac MRI techniques described,&#xD;
      determine when advanced disease is present and thus when ERT should be stopped or is not&#xD;
      appropriate to initiate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst promising, further investigation and development of this innovative technique in Fabry&#xD;
      disease is required. This study aims to find out more about T1 mapping in Fabry disease.&#xD;
      Patients referred for clinical cardiac MRI scanning will also undergo T1 mapping. T1 mapping&#xD;
      results will be correlated with other markers of disease severity. This will allow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Heart muscle T1 to be determined in a larger population of Fabry patients than currently&#xD;
           exists in the literature&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. T1 to be characterised across a wider range of Fabry disease severity than currently&#xD;
           exists in the literature.&#xD;
