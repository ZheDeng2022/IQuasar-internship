  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar fasciitis, often described as overloading of the plantar fascia, is the most common&#xD;
      cause of heel pain in adults. It is characterized by a sharp pain along the medial aspect of&#xD;
      the heel, which is worse with the first step taken in the morning or at the beginning of an&#xD;
      activity and decreases as the person warms up. The etiology of plantar fasciitis is&#xD;
      multifactorial and not well understood. Poor biomechanics and changes in the structure of the&#xD;
      foot can lead to repeated micro-trauma at the beginning of the plantar fascia, causing&#xD;
      inflammation and degeneration. Plantar fasciitis is more common in sedentary individuals and&#xD;
      athletes and those participating in running sports. Other risk factors associated with&#xD;
      plantar fasciitis include reduced ankle dorsiflexion, increased body mass index (BMI), and&#xD;
      work-related weight loss activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for plantar fasciitis, such as plantar fascia stretching exercises,&#xD;
      strapping, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
      arch braces, and heel pads are mainly aimed at reducing inflammation. Corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections are usually reserved for refractory plantar fasciitis after conservative&#xD;
      noninvasive attempts have failed. It has been shown to effectively reduce heel pain in&#xD;
      patients with plantar fasciitis. The strong anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroids can&#xD;
      speed up the process of pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we aimed to compare the effectiveness of USG and palpation guidance blind&#xD;
      steroid injection in patients diagnosed with plantar fasciitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is planned to enroll 60 (sixty) patients in the study. Patients diagnosed with plantar&#xD;
      fasciitis, between the ages of 18-75, who have failed conservative treatment (stretching&#xD;
      exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and heel pads) for at least 3 months, and&#xD;
      those with a Visual Anolog Scale value of 5 and above will be included in the study. Any&#xD;
      local injection therapy and physical therapy for heel pain in the last 4 months, any surgery&#xD;
      history for heel pain, history of tarsal tunnel syndrome, ankle effusion showing&#xD;
      intra-articular disease, healed calcaneal fracture, Achilles tendinopathy, foot including pes&#xD;
      and any deformity of the ankle, planus or pes cavus deformity; Patients with systemic&#xD;
      disorders such as diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, hematological disease or gout,&#xD;
      pregnancy, history of aspirin or aspirin-like medication, and mental insufficiency will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the patients will be filled in Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Foot Function&#xD;
      Indez (FFI) questionnaires. Patients will be randomized into 2 groups according to the Random&#xD;
      Number Generation. The first group will be the USG-guided steroid injection group, and the&#xD;
      second group will be the palpation-guided steroid injection group. In the USG-guided group,&#xD;
      steroid injection will be made to the area where the fascia is thickened under the guidance&#xD;
      of USG. In the palpation-guided group, the most painful point will be found by palpation on&#xD;
      the calcaneus bone and steroid injection will be made to that part. The content of the&#xD;
      steroid solution will be 1 ml of 1% Lidocaine + 1 ml (40 mg) methylprednisolone. There will&#xD;
      be pre-injection, 1st month and 3rd month controls after injection.&#xD;

        <description>Foot Function Index(FFI) is a self-report questionnaire concerning foot function and pain. The FFI consists of 23 questions with scores 0-10 in three domains concerning foot pain, function and disability resulting in a total score range from 0 to 230. The score is validated for patients with plantar fasciitis with a minimal clinical important difference being 7 points. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>

        <title>Foot Function Index</title>
        <description>Foot Function Index(FFI) is a self-report questionnaire concerning foot function and pain. The FFI consists of 23 questions with scores 0-10 in three domains concerning foot pain, function and disability resulting in a total score range from 0 to 230. The score is validated for patients with plantar fasciitis with a minimal clinical important difference being 7 points. Higher values represent a worse outcome.</description>
