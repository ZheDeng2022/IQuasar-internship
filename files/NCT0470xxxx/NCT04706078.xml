      Objective: To evaluate a cross-shaped incision technique to thick-gingiva and thin-gingiva&#xD;
      patients treated with implant-supported fixed prosthesis. Methods and Materials: 55 patients&#xD;
      received cross-shaped incision were assigned into thick-gingiva group (29 cases) and&#xD;
      thin-gingiva group (26 cases). Follow-up examination was carried out 3 and 12 months after&#xD;
      final restoration. Clinical and radiographic evaluation including gingival papilla height,&#xD;
      modified plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, periodontal depth, and crestal&#xD;
      marginal bone level were utilized.&#xD;

    <measure>Gingival margin level</measure>
    <time_frame>Between June 2018 and June 2020.</time_frame>
    <description>Gingival margin level was assessed by calculating the vertical distance between the most apical point of gingival margin at the buccal aspect of the crown and line connecting the peak of the adjacent mesial and distal natural teeth</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>first bone-implant contact (fBIC) and implant shoulder (IS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Between June 2018 and June 2020.</time_frame>
    <description>the landmarks of first bone-implant contact (fBIC) and implant shoulder (IS) were used for measurements. fBIC-IS was defined as the vertical distance the first bone-implant contact to implant shoulder, and the distance was assessed at the mesial and distal aspect of implant, respectively. When the marginal crestal bone was located coronal to the IS, a positive (+) value was given, where a negative (-) value when located apically to the IS, the value was deemed as zero when IS and fBIC coincided.</description>
