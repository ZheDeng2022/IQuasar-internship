  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study, which was designed as a prospective observational study, was planned to enroll 75&#xD;
      female patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis who had been using bisphosphonates for more&#xD;
      than two years and did not respond to treatment. 2 doses of denosumab were administered to&#xD;
      the patients every 6 months. Bone mineral density of patients were measured with DEXA at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the study. A total of 66 patients completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study, there was a significant improvement in the femur and lumbar total&#xD;
      bone mineral density of the patients compared to the baseline. However, no statistically&#xD;
      significant difference was found in terms of the frequency of new fractures.&#xD;

    <description>Denosumab, another antiresorptive agent, is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody that binds to the receptor activator of the nuclear factor-kB ligand (RANKL) with high specificity and affinity. Denosumab inhibits bone resorption by affecting the development, activation, and survival of osteoclasts.&#xD;
Denosumab 60 mg subcutaneously was administered to the patients whose consent forms were obtained, once every 6 months.</description>
