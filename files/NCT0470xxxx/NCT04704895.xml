    <textblock>
      To prove that early enteral nutrition after pancreaticoduodenal operation is of great&#xD;
      significance to improve the immune response, reduce the incidence of postoperative infection&#xD;
      and other related complications, and shorten the length of hospital stay&#xD;

      Arm A: Total parenteral nutrition. TPN also started from POD 1 and was delivered through a&#xD;
      central venous catheter. Target energy of 1.5 amino acids/kg/day reached 30 kcal/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: NJEEN was defined as providing at least 50% of the nutritional requirements through&#xD;
      the nasojejunal tube prior to the 5th day after surgery (POD) and having no parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition for 72 h or more.&#xD;
