  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a combination of&#xD;
      nivolumab, ipilimumab, cabazitaxel and carboplatin in men with neuroendocrine prostate cancer&#xD;
      (NEPC) or other aggressive variants of prostate cancer (AVPC). This study will also&#xD;
      investigate biomarkers to gain a better understanding of how the drug combination of&#xD;
      nivolumab, ipilimumab, cabazitaxel and carboplatin affects these types of prostate cancer and&#xD;
      the immune system. Eligible subjects will receive up to 10 cycles of nivolumab, ipilimumab,&#xD;
      carboplatin and cabazitaxel followed by maintenance nivolumab and ipilimumab. Subjects may&#xD;
      continue receiving study drugs until cancer progression, severe toxicity, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent, 3 years from the initial dose of study drugs or study termination, whichever occurs&#xD;
      earlier. Subjects will be followed for 3 years from the initial dose of study drugs.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer, based on histology OR based on clinical&#xD;
             presentation as defined by meeting one of the two below criteria. All subjects must&#xD;
             submit their primary tumor or metastatic biopsy pathology specimens to the Duke Cancer&#xD;
             Institute where they will be centrally reviewed by Duke Pathology. Central Duke&#xD;
             pathologic review is not required for screening but rather for confirmation of&#xD;
             histologic subtype. Local pathologic review is sufficient for eligibility&#xD;
             determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Criterion 1: Presence of 1 of 3 histologically proven diagnoses: 1) Primary small&#xD;
                  cell carcinoma of the prostate, defined by classic histologic features such as&#xD;
                  small tumor cells with scanty cytoplasm, darkly stained nuclei with homogeneous&#xD;
                  chromatin pattern. The tumor cells do not form glandular structure but grow as&#xD;
                  solid sheets with frequent mitotic figures and necrosis; 2) Intermediate atypical&#xD;
                  carcinoma of the prostate, which has histologic features distinct from small cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. The tumor grows as solid sheets or vague glandular&#xD;
                  structures. The tumor cells have moderate amounts of cytoplasm and centrally&#xD;
                  located, round and regular nuclei with fine, granular and homogeneous chromatin.&#xD;
                  Mitosis and necrosis are absent; 3) mixed histology tumors of the prostate,&#xD;
                  containing both adenocarcinoma and neuroendocrine or small cell components.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Criterion 2: Presence of histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate&#xD;
                  without any sign of neuroendocrine or small cell histology that is&#xD;
                  radiographically progressing despite castrate levels of testosterone (&lt;50 ng/mL)&#xD;
                  with the following poor risk features:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Prior progression despite therapy with either abiraterone acetate and/or&#xD;
             enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ii. At least one of the following: 1) Visceral metastases; 3) Bulky lymphadenopathy or&#xD;
             pelvic mass (&gt;5 cm); 4) Low PSA (&lt;10 ng/mL) with high volume (&gt;20) bone metastases; 5)&#xD;
             Short interval (&lt;6mo) to CRPC following initiation of hormonal therapy 6) Pathogenic&#xD;
             alterations in two of the three following genes: TP53, RB1, and PTEN as determined by&#xD;
             tissue or plasma tumor DNA commercial or academic assays. 7) Predominantly lytic bone&#xD;
             metastases on imaging, 8) Presence of neuroendocrine markers on histology (positive&#xD;
             staining of chromogranin A or synaptophysin) or in serum (abnormal high serum levels&#xD;
             for chromogranin A or GRP) at initial diagnosis or at progression. Plus any of the&#xD;
             following in the absence of other causes: A. elevated serum LDH (&gt;= IULN); B.&#xD;
             malignant hypercalcemia; C. elevated serum CEA (&gt;2x IULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Available archival tumor tissue for pathologic review and correlative studies. Tumor&#xD;
             tissue (localized or metastatic) does not need to be received but rather identified&#xD;
             and available (slides and/or blocks) to be sent to Duke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Documented progressive metastatic CRPC as determined by the provider based on at least&#xD;
             one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. PSA progression defined as 25% increase over baseline value with an increase in&#xD;
                  the absolute value of at least 2.0 ng/mL that is confirmed by another PSA level&#xD;
                  with a minimum of a 1 week interval and a minimum PSA of 2.0 ng/mL. Note: If&#xD;
                  confirmed rise is the only indication of progression, a minimal starting value of&#xD;
                  1.0 ng/mL is acceptable, unless pure small-cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Soft-tissue progression based on new lesions or growth of existing soft tissue&#xD;
                  metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Progression of bone metastasis with one or more new bone lesion(s) by imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Castrate levels of serum total testosterone (&lt;50 ng/dl) OR ongoing documented ADT&#xD;
             unless pure small cell prostate cancer is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Karnofsky performance status of 70 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Acceptable initial laboratory values within 14 days of Cycle 1 Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Age &gt;18&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with a partner who is a woman of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             one form of highly effective contraception as detailed in Section 8.3 of this protocol&#xD;
             during the treatment period with cabazitaxel and for 3 months after the last dose of&#xD;
             cabazitaxel and during the treatment period with nivolumab and for 7 months after the&#xD;
             last dose of nivolumab, whichever is later. Subjects receiving cabazitaxel or&#xD;
             nivolumab must also refrain from donating sperm during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Willing and able to provide written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for the&#xD;
             release of personal health information.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Life expectancy of over 3 months as determined by treating physician.&#xD;
