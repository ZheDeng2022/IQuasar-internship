  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, dose selection study of safety and effect of different doses of TENDU&#xD;
      vaccine, a therapeutic peptide conjugate vaccine, in patients with relapse after primary&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a open label dose selection study to investigate the safety, tolerability, immune&#xD;
      response and preliminary clinical effect of different doses of the TENDU vaccine. TENDU is a&#xD;
      synthetic therapeutic peptide conjugate vaccine intended for treatment of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled in this study is adults with documented progressive disease after&#xD;
      radical prostatectomy and who are eligible for salvage radiotherapy and short-term (6 months)&#xD;
      androgen deprivation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients taking part at the study must be vaccinated with a Boostrix vaccine (including&#xD;
      tetanus antigen) one week prior to the first TENDU vaccine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three different doses, 40, 400 and 960 μg of the TENDU vaccine are to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine is administrated by subcutaneous injections with one injection per drug substance&#xD;
      (four separate injections) consecutively. The TENDU vaccine will be given four times during a&#xD;
      treatment period lasting for 6 weeks and followed up for 6 months after the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total between 12 to 18 patients will be enrolled with a 3+3 design in each dose cohort.&#xD;
      The first patient will receive the lowest dose of the TENDU vaccine, and after the treatment&#xD;
      is completed, a safety evaluation will be done to evaluate enrolment of the next patients in&#xD;
      this cohort. If one patient develops a dose limiting toxicity at a specific dose, an&#xD;
      additional three patients are to be enrolled into that same dose cohort, and on the&#xD;
      recommended dose an addition of 3 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
