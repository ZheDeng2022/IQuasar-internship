  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction of immuno-chemotherapy in the treatment options of CLL and SLL changed the&#xD;
      treatment paradigm of these diseases. Presently, first-line therapies for CLL/SLL include&#xD;
      targeted therapies (e.g. ibrutinib, acalabrutinib) or combined immuno-chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      (e.g., fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab for patients aged &lt;65 years without&#xD;
      del17p/TP53 mutations or bendamustine and rituximab for patients ≥65 years who have&#xD;
      additional comorbidities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the gradual introduction of targeted therapies, new treatment strategies efficacious&#xD;
      for patients ineligible for/unresponsive to these therapies are still required. These new&#xD;
      strategies should ideally overcome disease relapse and circumvent compound-specific safety&#xD;
      challenges. Emerging treatment options include new compounds aimed for both untreated and&#xD;
      relapsed/refractory CLL, and combination therapies of existing compounds that extend&#xD;
      single-agent efficacy in specific high-risk patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAP-100 is expected to prevent the migration of leukemia cells to and their survival in&#xD;
      lymphoid niches as well as to eliminate CCR7-positive leukemia cells via ADCC, resulting in&#xD;
      measurable clinical responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial is the first-in-human trial of CAP-100 and is divided into two phases. The&#xD;
      aim of the Phase Ia (dose escalation) is to define the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) versus&#xD;
      the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of CAP-100 in subjects with CLL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib of the trial (expansion phase) will evaluate the safety and preliminary clinical&#xD;
      benefit of CAP-100 monotherapy at RP2D (response rate, lymph node size reduction, assessment&#xD;
      of minimal residual disease [MRD]) to support the design of future trials investigating&#xD;
      CAP-100 either as monotherapy or in a combination setting with approved treatments for CLL.&#xD;
