  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop a peer-based care coordination intervention&#xD;
      for individuals with HCV who were recently released from correctional settings to promote&#xD;
      linkage to and retention in HCV care. The investigators will assess the existing barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators of HCV treatment initiation, HCV treatment completion, and sustained virologic&#xD;
      response among individuals recently released from the New York City (NYC) jails or New York&#xD;
      State (NYS) prisons in a randomized control trial. This study will assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      process measures of a peer-enhanced HCV care coordination intervention among recently&#xD;
      incarcerated individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed 2-year study will be a block, stratified, randomized controlled trial. Once&#xD;
      consented and enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned to either the peer-enhanced&#xD;
      intervention or referred to standard clinical care. The investigators will enroll 80 former&#xD;
      inmates with chronic HCV who have been released from incarceration within the past 6 months.&#xD;
      Those eligible will also be over the age of 18 and fluent in English or Spanish. If they have&#xD;
      a life expectancy of less than one year they will be deemed ineligible. During the first year&#xD;
      the investigators will recruit and enroll 80 former inmates of the NYC jails or NYS prisons&#xD;
      with chronic HCV into the HCV-ACCELERATE intervention. It is expected that enrollment will be&#xD;
      completed by the fourth quarter of the first year. This will allow sufficient time for HCV&#xD;
      treatment uptake, completion, determination of SVR, and assessment of reinfection. Individual&#xD;
      participant follow-up will be 3 months on average for treatment, 3 months for SVR, and 3&#xD;
      months to assess for reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome, linkage to care, will be defined as a visit with an HCV treatment&#xD;
      provider. Secondary outcomes will include time to HCV treatment initiation (# of days&#xD;
      following release from the correctional setting), treatment completion, sustained virologic&#xD;
      response (SVR), HCV risk behaviors/substance use as determined by ACASI (Audio Computer&#xD;
      Assisted Self Interview) interviews, re-incarceration (as determined by Department of&#xD;
      Corrections, DOC, inmate lookup system), ED utilization, and hospitalizations. Elucidating&#xD;
      the barriers and facilitators in the re-entry care cascade (as well as how they may be&#xD;
      overcome) will be critical in designing sustainable models of care for HCV-infected former&#xD;
      inmates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that a peer-enhanced strategy will be more effective than&#xD;
      standard referral in improving linkage to, and retention in, HCV care among individuals&#xD;
      recently released from correctional settings.&#xD;
