  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate patient satisfaction between three methods&#xD;
      of obtaining informed consent for anaesthesia. Patients are asked to partake in a short&#xD;
      survey after being informed about the anaesthetic procedure either conventionally in the&#xD;
      anesthesia department, telephonically or digitally.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient satisfaction plays an important role to improve the process of medical procedures as&#xD;
      well as patient outcome. Evaluating the subjectively experienced satisfaction is challenging.&#xD;
      The investigators will use a questionnaire and assess waiting times in the process to&#xD;
      determine patient satisfaction between digital, telephonic and conventional obtaining of&#xD;
      informed consent for anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this questionnaire study, patients are asked to partake in a survey after the process of&#xD;
      obtaining consent for anaesthesia is completed. The questionnaire covers aspects of patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with the process, such as subjective assessment of comprehensibility, waiting&#xD;
      time and privacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are divided into three groups. In one group, consent is obtained conventionally, in&#xD;
      form of a visit to our anaesthesia department. In the other two groups, consent is obtained&#xD;
      telephonically and digitally, respectively. Patients are not randomised into these groups,&#xD;
      but included into the study after the process of obtaining consent by one of the three&#xD;
      methods mentioned above is completed.&#xD;
