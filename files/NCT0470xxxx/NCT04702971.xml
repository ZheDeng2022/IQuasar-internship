  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a highly prevalent and disabling neurological disease, which has a tremendous&#xD;
      impact on sufferers, healthcare systems, and the economy. According to the 2016 WHO report,&#xD;
      migraine is the second leading cause of years lived with disability, greater than all other&#xD;
      neurological diseases combined. Yet, the treatment in migraine is far from optimum; the&#xD;
      sufferers often abuse painkillers and complicated with medication overuse headache. Migraine&#xD;
      is characterized by the hypersensitivity of the sensory system, potentially attributed to&#xD;
      dysfunctional pain modulatory networks located in the deep brain structures, particularly the&#xD;
      brainstem. However, the current understanding of these deeply seated, dysregulated pain&#xD;
      modulatory circuits in migraine is limited due to technological constraints. Besides, studies&#xD;
      with an in-depth analysis of the clinical manifestations (i.e., deep phenotyping) are&#xD;
      lacking, and there is no corresponding animal model readily available for translational&#xD;
      research. In this project, the investigators propose a multimodal approach to address these&#xD;
      issues by applying the technologies and platforms developed by our team to explore the&#xD;
      correlation between pain sensitivity and dysregulated connectivities from brainstem to other&#xD;
      brain regions. In this four-year project, the investigators will recruit 400 migraine&#xD;
      patients and 200 healthy subjects. The investigators aim at decomposing the key brainstem&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying dysmodulated pain sensitivity in migraine from 5 comprehensive&#xD;
      perspectives: (1) clinical deep phenotyping, (2) high-resolution brainstem structural MRI and&#xD;
      functional connectivity analysis, (3) innovative brainstem EEG signal detecting technique,&#xD;
      (4) multimodal data fusion platform with neural network analysis, and (5)&#xD;
      ultrahigh-resolution brainstem-based connectomes, intravital manipulations and recording, and&#xD;
      connectome-sequencing in animal models. Moreover, the investigators will collaborate with&#xD;
      Taiwan Semiconductor Research Institute to develop a wearable high-density EEG equipment,&#xD;
      integrated with a System-on-Chip capable of edge-computing the signal using algorithms&#xD;
      derived from our brainstem decoding platform. The ultimate goal is to build a real-time&#xD;
      brainstem decoding system for clinical application.&#xD;

      Migraine causes a tremendous disease burden around the world. Migraine is one of the most&#xD;
      prevalent neurological disorders and is reported by the WHO as the second leading cause of&#xD;
      disease-related disabilities globally (No. 1 in the population under the 50s). There has been&#xD;
      no much change in the ranking of disability for migraine for the past two decades, reflecting&#xD;
      an unmet need for better treatment options. Even with the recently available calcitonin-gene&#xD;
      related peptide (CGRP)-based treatment, the treatment response versus placebo is still&#xD;
      disappointing (6.4-17.6% in acute treatment, 10.2-23.7% in preventive treatment). There is an&#xD;
      urgent need to push further the current understanding of the pathophysiology of migraine,&#xD;
      based on which novel treatment strategies can be developed. The lack of appropriate research&#xD;
      tools hinders the acceleration of migraine research. As a neurological disorder, many&#xD;
      neuroimaging studies have been focused on brain alterations; however, the majority focused on&#xD;
      the cerebrum. Limited by the currently available neuroimaging and electrophysiological&#xD;
      technologies, the deep brain structures especially the brainstem involved in the sensory and&#xD;
      nociceptive neurotransmission in migraine, such as the trigeminal nucleus, could only be&#xD;
      investigated to a limited extent. Obviously, there is an unmet need for novel technologies&#xD;
      that can be used to delineate structural or functional alterations in the brainstem.&#xD;
      Elucidation of the role of these deep brain structures may fill the gap in the current&#xD;
      understanding of migraine pathophysiology, and pave the way to precise and efficient&#xD;
      treatment. Studies restricted to single methodologies are insufficient for the complexity of&#xD;
      migraine. Migraine is a complex and dynamic disorder. However, most prior studies were&#xD;
      limited to single methodologies and provided limited insights into such a multifaceted&#xD;
      disorder. Studies with an integrated approach are lacking. An exhaustive examination of the&#xD;
      discrete components of a phenotype, i.e., 'deep phenotyping', can help understand different&#xD;
      aspects of its clinical manifestations, and facilitate patient classification. Coupled with&#xD;
      neuroimaging and electrophysiological research methodologies, a multi-modal decoding approach&#xD;
      would help identify a constellation of migraine-specific biosignatures, rather than just one.&#xD;
      This can not only provide clues to decipher migraine pathophysiology in various dimensions&#xD;
      but also serve as the basis of the development of a prediction algorithm that can be applied&#xD;
      in clinical practice. To pursue the overall goal, the present project schemes as a&#xD;
      composition of the following 5 aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Deep phenotyping for sensory processing in patients with migraine Aim 2:&#xD;
      Brainstem-based functional and structural connectomics in migraine Aim 3: Capturing brainstem&#xD;
      electro-neurosignature in migraine Aim 4: Constructing a data fusion platform and developing&#xD;
      an EEG cap with a built-in analytic chip Aim 5: Exploring brainstem-based connectome&#xD;
      sequencing in migraine animal model&#xD;
