      Pain is one of the non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease still poorly known and&#xD;
      misdiagnosed and its management is complex. This encourage to explore new non-drug&#xD;
      therapeutic paths, such as foot reflexology (FR). the present study proposed a comparison of&#xD;
      the evolution of different parameters, quantitative and qualitative, to identify biomarkers&#xD;
      and highlight the specific effect of FR on pain, compared to sham massage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the destruction of&#xD;
      specific neurons population involved in movement control. Pain is one of the non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms still poorly known and misdiagnosed. In addition to this fact, its management is&#xD;
      complex. At present, the medical community has no effective solution to reduce pain to an&#xD;
      acceptable level in terms of intensity or frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is a personal, subjective experience with an affective and cognitive dimension. The&#xD;
      context and its psychological impact can amplify as well as alleviate the pain. Thus,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment (NPT) that influence the psychological state (mood, level of&#xD;
      stress, ...) can also modulate the pain experience through the brain matrix of pain. Among&#xD;
      them, foot reflexology, which by stimulating reflex zones located on the feet, makes it&#xD;
      possible to modify the perception of the pain and to modify the subjective / emotional&#xD;
      valence of the pain. In this study, we propose to evaluate this technique, by postulating&#xD;
      that it should reduce the chronic pain of patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is innovative and original in two dimensions : On the one hand, the pain of&#xD;
      patients in PD is still often underestimated, there is in the mere fact of devoting a study a&#xD;
      real dynamic of change in the consideration of the patients concerned and in the management&#xD;
      of this non-motor symptom. On the other hand, the increasing use of NPT requires that&#xD;
      clinical studies be conducted. To date, it is clear that very few or no reliable studies have&#xD;
      been conducted on the subject. We wish to develop complementary non-pharmacological&#xD;
      management to provide concrete help to Parkinson's patients and thus initiate the scientific&#xD;
      validation of NPT as recommended by the High Authority of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesize that through a comparison of the evolution of different parameters,&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative, this study will allow to identify biomarkers and highlight the&#xD;
      specific effect of FR on pain, compared to sham massage.&#xD;
