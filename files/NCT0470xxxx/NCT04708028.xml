  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross-sectional prospective randomized study measuring physiologic biometrics and&#xD;
      perceptions of stress during an orthodontic procedure with or without a therapy dog present.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be consented, enrolled, and randomly assigned to a control group (no dog) or to&#xD;
      an experimental group (dog). The patient assigned to the experimental group will be exposed&#xD;
      to the therapy animal prior to the dental appointment. Pre-dental procedure and post- dental&#xD;
      procedure surveys will be given to all the subjects asking the same questions. Biometric data&#xD;
      will be collected by measuring heart rates of the patient/subject during the dental&#xD;
      appointment with a Fitbit.&#xD;
