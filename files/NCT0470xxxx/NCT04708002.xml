  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The national context of the end of life of elderly people living in Nursing Home (NH) is&#xD;
      concerning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quarter of NH residents die each year representing a quarter of annual deaths in France of&#xD;
      all ages. The number of resident deaths arises (148,300 deaths in 2015 versus 124,500 in&#xD;
      2011). In fact, the age of residents welcomed in NH increase, 82% of residents are 80 years&#xD;
      old and over, suffering from several chronic pathologies, some of which are serious and&#xD;
      incurable. These are the main cause of death for residents. The advancing age of NH residents&#xD;
      and the interweaving of multiple chronic conditions and disabling pathologies generate&#xD;
      complex care needs, the complexity of which undermines the current system of care&#xD;
      organization. In 2016, 59% of NH residents were severely dependent in their activities of&#xD;
      daily living (ADL) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) according to the French&#xD;
      scale Autonomie, Gérontologie Groupe Iso Ressources, (1 the most dependant to 6 the less&#xD;
      dependent); the majority of these most dependent NH residents (80% of Groupe Iso-Ressource&#xD;
      1-2 in 2011) had at least one unstable chronic pathology and 73% of deceased residents (in&#xD;
      2015) come from this group whose level of dependence is very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palliative care (PC), which is care focused on maintaining quality of life in a context of&#xD;
      incurable and complex pathology, therefore appears to be indicated in the context of NH.&#xD;
      However, residents' access to PC remains limited, uneven and late. The number of residents&#xD;
      requiring this support is estimated at more than 100,000 residents per year. The consequences&#xD;
      of such situation are serious, first with regard to the quality of life of NH residents and&#xD;
      their family caregivers, but also the inappropriate use of health services (as shown by the&#xD;
      excessive use of emergency department and unscheduled hospitalizations) and work life for&#xD;
      care providers in NH is affected (care providers suffer from a lack of support when faced&#xD;
      with the difficulties of caring for NH residents at the end of their life). However, these&#xD;
      consequences are potentially avoidable by means of adapted organizational solutions. The&#xD;
      implementation of an integrated and early palliative approach (IEPA) in care pathway of&#xD;
      patient is one of the solutions recommended by the World Health Organization and the French&#xD;
      National Authority for Health. Several studies have shown the benefit of such approach in the&#xD;
      management of cancer patients. However, the transferability and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      approach in other organizational and population contexts are poorly documented, particularly&#xD;
      in NH settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate, through a pragmatic controlled trial the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an Early Integrated Palliative Care Approach in usual NH context (EIPCA-NH) on the quality of&#xD;
      care in NH for elderly in need of PC. The secondary objectives concern:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the implementation process of the EIPCA-NH: i) measure the degree of implementation of&#xD;
           the EIPCA-NH in each site, ii) identify and understand the factors (individual and&#xD;
           organizational) facilitating or limiting the success of the implementation process of an&#xD;
           IEPA according to NH contexts (inter-site comparison).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the effects of the EIPCA-NH in the NH : i) on the quality of life of residents requiring&#xD;
           PC and ii) that of their family caregivers, iii) on the quality work life of&#xD;
           professional caregivers and iv) on the care pathway of NH residents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mixed methods research, with qualitative and quantitative approach, will be carried out in&#xD;
      at least 20 NH in three different health territories. These NH will benefit from a EIPCA-NH&#xD;
      intervention which consists of 1) implementing a mechanism for sharing and co-producing&#xD;
      knowledge, 2) integrating this approach as early as possible in the care of residents. This&#xD;
      study is based on a multicenter, randomized crossover cluster-type stepped-wedge study,&#xD;
      running on 4 years in order to measure the sustainability of EIPCA-NH; the quantitative&#xD;
      analysis of the effectiveness of EIPCA-NH will focus on an open cohort of 3,500 residents&#xD;
      receiving the intervention. The qualitative component will consist of a multiple case study&#xD;
      to analyse the process of implementation and production of the EIPCA-NH. The integrative&#xD;
      analysis of qualitative and quantitative data will allow a better understanding of the causal&#xD;
      mechanisms of the observed phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will provide evidence on the value of EIPCA and the conditions for its&#xD;
      implementation and transferability. The proposed intervention will help improve care&#xD;
      practices for all NH residents (600,000 people). The approach by co-construction between&#xD;
      actors of the thousands of care structures (NH, cities, hospitals) and researchers should&#xD;
      promote a better representation of PC, promote the culture of anticipation, evaluation and&#xD;
      collaboration between actors of in- and out- NH, contributing to a better synergy of&#xD;
      intersectoral and territorial actions of the supply of health services.&#xD;
