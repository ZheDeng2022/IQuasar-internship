  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are currently conducting a research study, called PRESTO, in the&#xD;
      pre-hospital environment where the investigators are asking paramedics to talk to patients&#xD;
      about participating in the research study, interpret a heart tracing (or ECG), take a blood&#xD;
      sample and record some study specific information. Apart from ECG interpretation, these are&#xD;
      activities that the paramedics would not normally do and so the investigators had to provide&#xD;
      training in order to ensure that these activities were carried out to the same standard&#xD;
      across the four ambulance services that were involved, all of who have different working&#xD;
      practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to do this, the investigators provided a training package based around four subject&#xD;
      areas - blood sample collection, heart tracing interpretation, background to the study and&#xD;
      the importance of conducting the study activities to a high standard (called Research&#xD;
      Fundamentals). These were presented to the paramedics either as online training or in a&#xD;
      face-to-face session. There has been a mixed response to both the uptake in training across&#xD;
      the four ambulance services and the engagement from paramedics in following PRESTO with a&#xD;
      potential participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As more research is being done in the pre-hospital environment the investigators feel that it&#xD;
      would be beneficial to try to find out why paramedics may or may not have taken part in the&#xD;
      PRESTO training. To do this the investigators will be sending out a survey to each of the&#xD;
      four ambulance services which will contain questions around whether the paramedics thought&#xD;
      the training package for PRESTO was suitable, whether the paramedics felt confident following&#xD;
      PRESTO with a potential participant after the training and what the paramedics think the main&#xD;
      barriers are to participating in research. Up to 30 paramedics will also be approached to&#xD;
      participate in an interview, which will explore these ideas further.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This should allow the investigators to identify potential barriers that prevent paramedics&#xD;
      from taking part in training for research studies. It should also allow the investigators to&#xD;
      offer insight to future researchers about the type of training that should be provided for&#xD;
      paramedics for a research study and how it should be delivered.&#xD;
