    <textblock>
      This pilot study will assess the acceptability, feasibility and efficacy of a family-based&#xD;
      intervention to improve maternal and child mental health by increasing maternal sensitivity&#xD;
      and decreasing offspring abuse among adolescent mothers in Perú, a middle-income country with&#xD;
      high rates of childhood physical and sexual abuse, IPV, and adolescent pregnancy.&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited from the prenatal clinics at INMP and San Bartolomé. Due to&#xD;
      COVID-19, the prenatal clinics are currently conducting only telehealth visits. The&#xD;
      interviews will be conducted using structured questionnaires that cover questions about&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle characteristics, symptoms of depression or PTSD,&#xD;
      history of trauma, and medical, obstetric and psychiatric history. Participants will be able&#xD;
      to enter their responses online, with a research team member available to answer questions by&#xD;
      phone, or they can give their answers by phone while a team member enters them. See attached&#xD;
      Initial Questionnaire for details.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, each participant will be asked to provide the name of someone whom she&#xD;
      anticipates will be helping her to care for the child. We expect that in most cases this will&#xD;
      be a female relative of the participant, typically her mother or grandmother, but it may also&#xD;
      be a friend or the baby's father. The participant will be given information about the study&#xD;
      to provide to the other caregiver, and the interviewer will contact the other caregiver&#xD;
      within a week of enrolling the participant and arrange for a convenient time for the&#xD;
      caregiver to learn about the study and go through the informed consent procedures. If more&#xD;
      than one person is providing significant support to the mother, she may identify up to two&#xD;
      other caregivers. She can also identify a second caregiver at a later point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participating family will be randomized to either the intervention arm or the usual care&#xD;
      arm. Usual care consists of routine prenatal care and pediatric follow up at 2 weeks, 2&#xD;
      months, 4 months and 6 months. If enrolled prior to 20 weeks gestation, participants in both&#xD;
      groups will receive a short phone call to check in every 4 weeks, until they reach 24 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, to minimize the gap before the first visit at 28 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After delivery, obstetric records will be reviewed for information about gestational age,&#xD;
      birth weight, and any complications. See attached Birth Data form for planned data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to COVID-19, the intervention will begin with virtual visits conducting via&#xD;
      videoconferencing. If, during the study period, it becomes safe to do home visits, we may&#xD;
      switch to in-person home visits, or we may conduct the entire study with virtual visits. The&#xD;
      intervention consists of 2 prenatal and 8 postpartum visits, with visit frequency gradually&#xD;
      decreasing as mothers gain experience and confidence. Visits will last for up to 90 minutes&#xD;
      to allow time for multiple caregivers to participate. Other caregivers will be encouraged to&#xD;
      participate for the first 10 minutes and the last 20 minutes of the intervention sessions. As&#xD;
      much as possible, visits will accommodate the family schedule, occurring at a time when all&#xD;
      or most of the caregivers are at home. The perspectives of all caregivers will be elicited by&#xD;
      the home visitor in order to facilitate a conversation among them about their preferences,&#xD;
      concerns, and goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of either the intervention or the control condition, the adolescent mothers&#xD;
      will repeat the questionnaires about demographics, as well as anxiety, depression, PTSD and&#xD;
      trauma history. If COVID-19 precautions are still necessary during this phase of the study,&#xD;
      the post-intervention questionnaires will be completed in the same manner as the initial&#xD;
      questionnaires, with data entered online with the support of the research team by phone. See&#xD;
      attached Post-intervention Questionnaire for details. Interactions between the mother and&#xD;
      infant, other caregiver and infant, and all three together will be video recorded and coded&#xD;
      to assess caregiver sensitivity. If COVID-19 precautions are still necessary, these&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted using video conferencing, and the video calls will be recorded&#xD;
      and coded in the manner described. These recordings will be assessed and coded across five&#xD;
      dimensions: &quot;physical involvement,&quot; &quot;verbal involvement,&quot; &quot;responsiveness,&quot; &quot;positive&#xD;
      statements,&quot; and &quot;control over child's activities,&quot; each rated 0-5 for the &quot;quality&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;appropriateness&quot; of caregiver behavior (Cooper et al., 2009; Farran, Kasari, Comfort, &amp; Jay,&#xD;
      1986). Finally, the Still Face Paradigm will be conducted in which the mother-infant dyads&#xD;
      will perform a video recorded 3-minute face-to-face interaction consisting of 1 minute&#xD;
      normal, 1 minute still-face, and 1 minute reunion after still-face. Maternal behavior will be&#xD;
      scored for sensitivity during normal and reunion phases (scored 0-5) (Murray, Fiori-Cowley,&#xD;
      Hooper, &amp; Cooper, 1996); infants will be scored for regulatory behavior (Braungart-Rieker,&#xD;
      Garwood, Powers, &amp; Wang, 2001; Murray &amp; Trevarthen, 1985; Tronick &amp; Weinberg, 1994) and&#xD;
      dysregulated behavior, including gaze aversion, facial expression, crying, and agitated&#xD;
      movement during each 1-second interval (Gunning, Halligan, &amp; Murray, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will record only what is necessary for the research record and take all steps necessary to&#xD;
      blur/obscure the images of those who have not consented to the research and/or to being&#xD;
      recorded or photographed. All interview guides and other study materials not currently&#xD;
      available will be submitted to the IRB for approval prior to use.&#xD;
