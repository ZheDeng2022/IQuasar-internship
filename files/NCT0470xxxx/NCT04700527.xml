  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess and compare GI toxicity from RT between subjects who&#xD;
      receive therapeutic SCFA and those who receive placebo, in hopes of identifying a safe,&#xD;
      low-cost therapeutic to reduce GI toxicity from therapeutic or environmental radiation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy is a critical modality for treatment of urologic, gynecologic and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal malignancies among others. Though advances in treatment techniques have&#xD;
      reduced treatment-associated morbidity and mortality, normal tissue toxicity still limits&#xD;
      dose escalation and treatment tolerance. Over 50% of patients receiving abdominal or pelvic&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) develop clinically meaningful toxicity. Pharmacologic strategies to&#xD;
      reduce normal tissue damage represent a tremendous unmet need in RT. Investigators propose a&#xD;
      novel application of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) as a therapeutic to reduce incidence and&#xD;
      severity of gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity from RT. Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are fatty&#xD;
      acids with fewer than six carbon atoms ingested or formed during bacterial fermentation of&#xD;
      partially- and non-digestible polysaccharides carbohydrates. Patients who are enrolled will&#xD;
      be randomized to receive SCFA supplements or a placebo, and will start taking it everyday one&#xD;
      week prior to starting RT through 1 week after completing RT. Patients will keep a log of&#xD;
      daily administration during the entire time while taking the study drug, and will complete&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (PROs) involving toxicities starting at baseline through 3 months&#xD;
      post RT. The patient's treating physician will also complete an assessment of the patients&#xD;
      toxicities starting at the baseline through follow up visits up to 5 years post RT, which&#xD;
      will be used to compare to the PROs.&#xD;
