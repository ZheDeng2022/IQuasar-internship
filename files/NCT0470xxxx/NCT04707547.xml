      Clearing potential intrahepatic metastasis to prevent early recurrence after liver cancer&#xD;
      treatment, there are no effective interventions so far. For secondary metastatic cancer, only&#xD;
      the lesions visible under ultrasound can be used, one by one for local ablation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, but people may develop new tumor lesions. Therefore, the treatment of potential&#xD;
      tumors and recurrent tumors after ablation is a very important clinical issue.&#xD;

      this study will include primary liver cancer, as well as secondary metastatic malignant liver&#xD;
      cancer, such as colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers with a high&#xD;
      incidence in Chinese patients, and detection of immune cells by surgery, and through various&#xD;
      biomarkers to explore its mechanism and efficacy.&#xD;

    <measure>Analysis of the number of CD8+ T</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Analysis of the number of CD8+ T Using PBMC to analyze the number of CD8+ T that is NK, NKT, DC, and Monocyte. Four-time blood draws - 15 ml/each. Week 0- the data of CD8+T before RFA. Week 1- the data of CD8+T after RFA. Week 3- the data of CD8+T after participators received the vaccine which is Nivolumab 200mg in Week 2.&#xD;
Week 6- the data of CD8+T&#xD;
Compare with Week 0 and Week 1 data for analysis the difference of the ability of the immune system.&#xD;
Compare with Week 1 and Week 3 data, if week 3 data is higher than week 1, it means that immunotherapy with Nivolumab has effects to strengthen the immune system.&#xD;
Compare with Week 3 and Week 6 for analysis the effects of immunotherapy with Nivolumab have continued or not.&#xD;
Moreover, analyzed the difference in the immune system between participators who received the vaccine and no received vaccine from week 3 to week 6.</description>

    <intervention_name>Radiofrequency Ablation</intervention_name>
    <description>The most commonly used local ablation is radiofrequency ablation. In this operation, a radio frequency probe is used to insert the liver cancer under ultrasound or computer tomography guidance, and then the radio frequency waves generated by the current oscillations locally heat the high temperature, causing the liver cancer cells to die.</description>
