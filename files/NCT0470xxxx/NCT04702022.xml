      The renal biopsy (RB) represents the gold-standard for the diagnosis of acute renal&#xD;
      transplant rejection (AR), and allows early verification of a so-called &quot;subclinical&quot;&#xD;
      rejection, ie without any clinical or biological abnormality detectable in a stable kidney&#xD;
      transplant patient. The RB also makes it possible to certify a strictly normal renal&#xD;
      histology and thus to motivate the withdrawal of corticosteroid therapy. It is this 3-month&#xD;
      post-transplant protocol RB protocol that has been effective since 2007 at the CHU Liège.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, RB is an invasive procedure, contraindicated in patients taking anticoagulants, and&#xD;
      carrying a significant risk of complications. The potential complications associated with RB&#xD;
      motivate the identification and validation of other diagnostic means. In the present project,&#xD;
      the investigators propose to study the relevance of positron emission tomography (PET),&#xD;
      coupled with conventional tomography (CT), after intravenous injection of&#xD;
      18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (18FDG) in the overall protocol of the renal transplant patient at 3&#xD;
      months post-transplant to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) allow protocol renal biopsy only in patients with suspicion of an acute rejection (ii) be&#xD;
      a decision maker for withdrawal from corticosteroids in the absence of rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In practice, the investigators suggest performing 18FDG PET / CT imaging on the day of the&#xD;
      surveillance biopsy, which is systematically performed in all kidney transplant patients at&#xD;
      University Hospital of Liège 3 months after transplant. The investigators are considering 3&#xD;
      scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scenario 1. The renal biopsy shows signs of humoral rejection: the patient is excluded&#xD;
           from the study and is treated &quot;as usual&quot; on the basis of the histological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scenario 2. The renal biopsy does not show signs of humoral rejection but the 18FDG PET&#xD;
           / CT shows a high metabolic activity of the graft (&gt; 2.4): the patient is treated &quot;as&#xD;
           usual&quot; on the basis of histological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scenario 3. The renal biopsy does not show signs of humoral rejection and the 18FDG PET&#xD;
           / CT shows a weak metabolic activity of the graft (&lt;2.4): the immunosuppressive&#xD;
           treatment is gradually weaned off corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical research project is interested in a major health problem in the follow-up of&#xD;
      renal transplant patients, and could make it possible to improve the management of a&#xD;
      subclinical rejection of the renal transplant and to increase the withdrawal of&#xD;
      corticosteroids including side effects are well known.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subclinical rejection (SCR) has been defined as &quot;the documentation by light histology of&#xD;
      unexpected evidence of acute rejection (AR) in a stable patient&quot;. The diagnosis of SCR is&#xD;
      important given that the treatment of subclinical T-cell-mediated AR results in similar&#xD;
      long-term graft survival to that in patients without rejection. Surveillance transplant&#xD;
      biopsies are, by definition, required for the diagnosis of SCR. Still, only 17% of transplant&#xD;
      centers in the United States perform surveillance biopsies in all patients, whereas 62% do&#xD;
      not perform surveillance biopsies at all because the incidence of SCR is low3. Non-invasive&#xD;
      biomarkers may thus be developed as &quot;rule out&quot; tests, with the highest negative predictive&#xD;
      value, in order to reduce the indiscriminate use of allograft biopsies in stable kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipients (KTR). Beside urine-derived and blood-based biomarkers of SCR, the&#xD;
      investigators have recently reported in a monocentric prospective pilot study that&#xD;
      18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography coupled with Computed Tomography (18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT) non-invasively rules out SCR at ~3 months post kidney transplantation (KTx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous 92-patient cohort published by the investigators, the ratio between the mean&#xD;
      standardized 18F-FDG uptake values (SUVs) of the renal allograft and the psoas muscle (used&#xD;
      as reference tissue) was significantly higher in the group with biopsy-proven SCR versus the&#xD;
      group with strictly normal histology. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) reached 0.79, with a&#xD;
      negative predictive value of 98% using an mSUVR threshold of 2.4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult KTR who undergo surveillance transplant biopsy at ~3 months post KTx are eligible&#xD;
      for the present study, except pregnant women and patients PCR-proven BK nephropathy. Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained. KTx will be performed in accordance with the Declaration&#xD;
      of Istanbul. Surveillance biopsies will be locally (in each participating centers) and&#xD;
      centrally (at ULiège CHU) assessed by pathologists blinded to the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
      Banff 2017 classification will be conventionally used. Total inflammation (ti) will take into&#xD;
      account interstitial inflammation in both non-sclerotic and sclerotic areas. C4d staining&#xD;
      will be performed in all cases. PET/CT will be performed with late acquisitions (~180&#xD;
      minutes) after 18F-FDG intravenous injection (~3 Mbq/kg) within a 48-hour period around the&#xD;
      biopsy, before any modification of immunosuppressive regimens. The mean standardized uptake&#xD;
      value (mSUV) of kidney cortex will be measured and averaged from 4 volumes of interest (VOI)&#xD;
      distributed in the upper (n=2) and lower (n=2) poles, both locally (in each participating&#xD;
      centers) and centrally (at ULiège CHU)10. The mSUV of kidney will be normalized to the mSUV&#xD;
      of psoas muscle (VOI of 20 ml) or the liver (VOI of 20 ml), considered as reference tissues&#xD;
      in order to obtain the corresponding mean SUV Ratios (mSUVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be afterwards in one of these three categories :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The renal biopsy shows signs of humoral rejection: the patient is excluded from the&#xD;
           study and is treated &quot;as usual&quot; on the basis of the histological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The renal biopsy does not show signs of humoral rejection but the 18FDG PET / CT shows a&#xD;
           high metabolic activity of the graft (&gt; 2.4): the patient is treated &quot;as usual&quot; on the&#xD;
           basis of histological findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The renal biopsy does not show signs of humoral rejection and the 18FDG PET / CT shows a&#xD;
           weak metabolic activity of the graft (&lt;2.4): the immunosuppressive treatment is&#xD;
           gradually weaned off corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) to use the measurement of renal accumulation of the 18FDG marker at the level of the&#xD;
      renal graft as a non-invasive indicator of the absence of a subclinical cellular rejection&#xD;
      and to use the information from the renal biopsy only if the metabolic activity of the graft&#xD;
      is increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) to use the measurement of renal accumulation of the 18FDG marker in the renal graft as a&#xD;
      non-invasive indicator of the absence of cell rejection and to initiate the withdrawal of&#xD;
      corticosteroids if the metabolic activity of the graft is normal.&#xD;

    <description>The PET/CT procedure was performed using cross-calibrated Philips Gemini TF Big Bore or TF 16 PET/CT systems (Philips Medical Systems, Cleveland, OH) at 201 18 minutes following intravenous injection of a mean dose of 3.2 0.2 MBq/kg of body weight of 18 F-FDG. A low-dose helical CT (5-mm slice thickness, 120-kV tube voltage, and 40-mAs tube current-time product) centered to the renal transplant was performed, followed by PET scanning with two bed positions, each lasting 240 seconds. Images were reconstructed using iterative list mode time-of-flight algorithms. Corrections for attenuation, dead time and random and scatter events will be applied.</description>
