  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will define the prevalence of brain health (i.e., normal cognitive, neuromotor,&#xD;
      behavioral function) in living professional football retirees and group-matched controls&#xD;
      through a comprehensive assessment of clinical, neuroimaging, and biomarker measures.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Rates of Brain Health versus Cognitive Impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>The diagnosis of cognitive impairment is based on the ADRC National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) criteria for mild cognitive impairment. This criteria is adjudicated following a comprehensive neuropsychological exam, and includes: (1) Self- or informant-reported cognitive complaint, (2) Objective cognitive impairment, (3) Preserved independence in functional abilities, and (4) No dementia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Syndromes of Neurodegeneration</measure>
    <time_frame>1-week</time_frame>
    <description>The determination of trauma-related neurodegeneration will be based on: 1) presence of cognitive deficits, and/or neuromotor manifestations, and/or behavioral/mood-related symptoms; 2) PET scans demonstrating abnormal amyloid and/or tau deposition; 3) quantitative MR evidence of cortical volume loss and/or white matter injury; and 4) elevated CSF tau/Aβ42 ratio.&#xD;
These multiple measures will be combined to arrive at a single overall outcome measure. This will be adjudicated at a blinded Diagnostic Consensus Conference comprised of experts from each field.</description>

        1. Professional Football Players:&#xD;
&#xD;
             There will be 2 cohorts of former professional football players in this group: (a)&#xD;
             random sample, and (b) non-random sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Random-Sample participants&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Recruitment of random-sample former professional football players will be&#xD;
                  conducted via collaboration with the Football Players Health Study (FPHS) at&#xD;
                  Harvard University. Subjects for the Brain Health Initiative (BHI) will include a&#xD;
                  random sample of enrollees in the FPHS who meet basic eligibility for BHI.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Non-Random participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
             We will also enroll a non-random cohort of former professional football players that&#xD;
             will be comprised of volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be 3 cohorts of unexposed controls in this group: (a) friends of former players,&#xD;
        (b) brothers or former players, and (c) general population. Football players will be&#xD;
        invited to refer friend(s) and/or brother(s), but it is not required for participation.&#xD;
