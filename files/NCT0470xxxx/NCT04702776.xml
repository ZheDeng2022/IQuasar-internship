    <measure>Change in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (± 2) (eligibility visit), 17 - 19 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 - 33 (± 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>It is a 12-item questionnaire used to evaluate symptoms associated with dry eye disease, as well as classify their severity. According the obtained score, categories are as follows: normal (0-12 points), mild (13-22 points), moderate (23-32 points), or severe (33-100 points).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Noninvasive keratograph break-up time (NIKBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 - 2 (baseline visit),17 - 19 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 - 33 (± 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>This evaluation will be performed through an Oculus Keratograph 5M, and the parameter &quot;first break-up time&quot; will be recorded as NIKBUT. This study can take place within a time frame of 0 - 2 days between eligibility and baseline visits, and ± 2 of fist follow-up and final visits.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in conjunctival and corneal staining with lissamine green</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (eligibility visit), 17 - 19 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 - 33 (± 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation will take place after applying the lissamine green stain on the ocular surface and evaluating the resulting staining pattern. This will be measured through the Oxford scale which includes 6 grades: Absent (0), Minimal (I), Mild (II), Moderate (III), Marked (IV), Severe (V).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in conjunctival and corneal staining with fluorescein</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of related non expected adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (eligibility visit), 0 - 2 (baseline visit),17 - 19 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), 31 - 33 (± 1) (final visit), and 38 - 40 (± 1) (safety call).</time_frame>
    <description>Presence/absence of related non expected adverse events.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (eligibility visit), 17 - 19 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 - 33 (± 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>With the patient's best possible refractive correction, visual acuity will be evaluated through the Snellen chart. Its notation (fraction or decimal) is described as the distance from the chart at which the test is performed, divided by the distance at which a letter equals vertically 5 minutes of arc.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in incidence of chemosis</measure>
    <time_frame>Days: 0 (eligibility visit), 17 - 19 (± 1) (first follow-up visit), and 31 - 33 (± 1) (final visit).</time_frame>
    <description>Chemosis will be evaluated as present (if conjunctiva separates from the sclera in ≥ 1/3 of the palpebral opening area or if it exceeds the eyelid's gray line) or absent.</description>
