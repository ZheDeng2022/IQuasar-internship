  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In liver cyst hydatid surgery, presence of cysto-biliary communication (CBC) is important for&#xD;
      the prevention of postoperative morbidity. If cysto-biliary connections are not obvious,&#xD;
      diagnosis is not easy. Intraoperative bile leakage test has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative biliary complications by revealing occult CBCs. However, bile leakage testing&#xD;
      in emergency conditions such as hydatid cyst perforation has not been experienced so far.&#xD;

      In liver cyst hydatid surgery, presence of cysto-biliary communication (CBC) is important for&#xD;
      the prevention of postoperative morbidity. If cysto-biliary connections are not obvious,&#xD;
      diagnosis is not easy. Intraoperative bile leakage test has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      postoperative biliary complications by revealing occult CBCs. However, bile leakage testing&#xD;
      in emergency conditions such as hydatid cyst perforation has not been experienced so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, a bile leakage test performed in a 23-year-old male patient undergoing emergency&#xD;
      surgery due to the perforation of the hydatid liver cyst was presented. Following the&#xD;
      treatment of perforated hydatid liver cyst and biliary peritonitis, a bile leakage test was&#xD;
      performed. The common bile duct was cannulated with a 22 Gauge catheter, normal saline and&#xD;
      parenteral lipid solution were given to demonstrate the CBCs, and leakage areas were suture&#xD;
      ligated. The patient was discharged postoperatively without any problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recommend detection and treatment of the CBCs even in emergency hydatid&#xD;
      liver cyst surgery for prevention of postoperative biliary complications.&#xD;
