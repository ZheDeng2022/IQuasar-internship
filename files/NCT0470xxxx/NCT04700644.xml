      Introduction: The prevalence and clinical significance of central adrenal insufficiency (CAI)&#xD;
      in adult patients with Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS) remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To assess the prevalence of CAI in adults with PWS and to analyse the effects of&#xD;
      replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (HCT) in patients with suspected CAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods: Twenty one adult patients with PWS were evaluated. Based on peak&#xD;
      cortisol at the 30 minute of the high dose short Synacthen test (HDSST), patients were&#xD;
      divided into three groups: CAI (central adrenal insufficiency) - peak cortisol &lt;500nmol/L,&#xD;
      intermediate (partial AI) - peak cortisol ≥500 nmol/L and &lt;600 nmol/L and AS (adrenal&#xD;
      sufficiency) - peak cortisol ≥ 600 nmol/L. In patients with diagnosed CAI HCT replacement&#xD;
      treatment was initiated. Body weight, body fat percentage, signs, and symptoms of CAI were&#xD;
      evaluated after 6 and 12 months of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The diagnosis of CAI was based on the high-dose short Synacthen test (HDSST). The following cut-off points were used:&#xD;
CAI group (suspected CAI):&#xD;
• cortisol &lt; 500 nmol/L at the 30th minute&#xD;
AS group (adrenal sufficiency - CAI excluded):&#xD;
• cortisol ≥ 600 nmol/L at the 30th minute&#xD;
Intermediate group • cortisol ≥500 nmol/L and &lt;600 nmol/L at the 30th minute</description>
