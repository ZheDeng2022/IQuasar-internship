    <textblock>
      Hong Kong and Taiwan HM3 PMS is a prospective, single arm, post market surveillance is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate clinical and functional outcomes with the HM3 LVAS as a treatment for&#xD;
      advanced heart failure. The PMS will enroll approximately 30 patients, that meet the HM3&#xD;
      commercially approved labelling indications, from approximately 4 sites in Hong Kong and&#xD;
      Taiwan. PMS participants will be followed until the 24 months follow-up visit or until they&#xD;
      experience an outcome, whichever comes first.&#xD;

    <measure>Primary Efficacy Endpoint: Number of participants with overall survival to transplant, myocardial recovery or on device support free of debilitating stroke (Modified Rankin Score &gt;3) or reoperation for pump replacement</measure>
    <time_frame>Throughout the study (approximately 24 months post implant)</time_frame>
    <description>Overall survival to transplant, myocardial recovery or on device support free of debilitating stroke (Modified Rankin Score &gt;3) or reoperation for pump replacement will be assessed using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method along with a competing outcomes graph. Subjects who are urgently transplanted due to a HeartMate 3 malfunction will be considered to have experienced a primary endpoint event, as will subjects who expire, suffer a debilitating stroke or have their HeartMate 3 exchanged due to a device failure. Subjects who are transplanted (except as described above), explanted for recovery, withdraw from the trial or are lost to follow-up will be censored at that time in the analysis.</description>
