  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will induce disuse atrophy through unilateral immobilization of the thigh and&#xD;
      lower leg in healthy male volunteers to evaluate the PD of a single subcutaneous dose of&#xD;
      GYM329 prior to or after unilateral thigh and lower leg immobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy male volunteers will receive either GYM329 or placebo by subcutaneous injection at&#xD;
      two time points, before and after 2 weeks of unilateral thigh and lower leg immobilization,&#xD;
      in an investigator- and subject-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group&#xD;
      design. At enrollment, all subjects will be randomized in a 1:2 ratio to either the&#xD;
      pre-immobilization active drug group receiving a single subcutaneous dose of GYM329 before&#xD;
      unilateral thigh and lower leg immobilization (Group A) or the pre-immobilization placebo&#xD;
      group receiving a single subcutaneous dose of placebo before unilateral thigh and lower leg&#xD;
      immobilization (Group B). On Day 15, subjects assigned to Group B and who completed the&#xD;
      muscle strength assessment at Day15 will be further randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the&#xD;
      post-immobilization active drug group (Group B-1) or the post-immobilization placebo group&#xD;
      (Group B-2). Group A will receive GYM329 on Day 1 and placebo on Day 15. Group B will receive&#xD;
      placebo on Day 1. Subsequently, Group B-1 will receive GYM329 on Day 15 and Group B-2 will&#xD;
      receive placebo on Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength will be measured at pre-immobilization of unilateral thigh and lower leg,&#xD;
      post-immobilization of unilateral thigh and lower leg (Day 15), Day 29, and Day 43. Subjects&#xD;
      will be observed for 252 days after the second study treatment administration (266 days after&#xD;
      the first study treatment administration).&#xD;
