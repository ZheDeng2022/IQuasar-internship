      This is a multicenter, multicountry, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II&#xD;
      clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CBP-307 in subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe ulcerative colitis (UC). CBP-307 capsules are administered orally. This study includes&#xD;
      stage 1 and stage 2. After screening, subjects will enter the randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled induction therapy for 12 weeks, i.e., the study stage 1. All subjects who&#xD;
      complete 12 weeks of induction therapy (with CBP-307 or placebo) in the study stage 1 and&#xD;
      complete all examinations (including colonoscopy) at the week 12 visit can choose to enter&#xD;
      the study stage 2 of a total of 40 weeks, including 36 weeks of continuous administration and&#xD;
      4 weeks of safety follow-up after the last dose.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Pulmonary function test (including examinations of lung ventilation function and&#xD;
             pulmonary gas exchange) of subjects at the study visit of week 12 during the study&#xD;
             stage 1 shows 1 of the following abnormalities: forced expiratory volume in 1 second&#xD;
             (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt; 50% of normal predicted value.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects' laboratory measurements at week 12 visit during the study stage 1 meet any&#xD;
