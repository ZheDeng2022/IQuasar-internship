      In this study, İt was aimed to determination of the effect of counseling given in accordance&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in the Infertility clinic of a medical school hospital. The study&#xD;
      included women receiving IVF treatment. In the pre-initial evaluation, &quot;Introductory&#xD;
      Information Form, Screening on distress in fertility treatment (SCREENIVF), Infertility&#xD;
      Stress, Life Quality Scale for Persons with Fertility Problems(FertiQol), Subjective Units of&#xD;
      Distress Scale-SUD application is planned. A &quot;Consultancy Program&quot; will be applied to the&#xD;
      experimental group in the form of two modules in addition to drug applications, egg pick up&#xD;
      and embryo transfer before, during and after clinical routine health care. The first module&#xD;
      of the counseling program is the definition of infertility, the treatment process, its&#xD;
      effects on the life process and coping methods. The second module includes the application of&#xD;
      breath awareness and Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) within the scope of coping methods&#xD;
      with infertility stress. Emotional Freedom Technique-EFT is an energy psychotherapy based on&#xD;
      the principle that each limiting thought, disturbing emotion and memory of an individual&#xD;
      disrupts the energy flow in the body and creates congestion. This technique, the stimulation&#xD;
      on the meridian system by focusing on the thought, disturbing emotion or memory that prevents&#xD;
      the individual (often by touching) regulates the energy flow and provides the individual to&#xD;
      relax. With breath awareness, beneficial results can be obtained, such as physical, sensory&#xD;
      and mental control, life-facilitating techniques, individual and social awareness,&#xD;
      re-existence and raising the level of consciousness. Within the scope of the counseling&#xD;
      program, a total of seven follow-ups will be made, five-to-one, via two phone calls. On the&#xD;
      day of follicle development (2nd Follow-up), Egg Pick up Procedure (4th Follow-up) and Embryo&#xD;
      transfer (5th Follow-up), the patient will be given breathing exercises and EFT and&#xD;
      Subjective Units of Distress Scale will be scored. The control group will continue clinical&#xD;
      routine health care and will be followed up on the first day of IVF treatment (1st follow-up)&#xD;
      and on the seventh day of embryo transfer (2nd follow-up). For ethical reasons, a consultancy&#xD;
      program will be applied to the control group after the second follow-up. Data collection&#xD;
      tools will be applied again to both groups in the final evaluation.&#xD;
