  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combination of ketamine and aspirin for the treatment of acute MSK pain in the ED would&#xD;
      confer multimodal analgesia, with the contributions of aspirin and ketamine to an opioid&#xD;
      sparing effect. Research on this multimodal approach is sparse, but the minimal empirical&#xD;
      evidence supports a clinical benefit to patients in a post orthopedic surgery setting, both&#xD;
      in short term and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitalis Pharmaceuticals (New York, NY) has developed a proprietary formulation of aspirin,&#xD;
      VTS-Aspirin, that may deliver faster and stronger pain reduction than traditional aspirin.&#xD;
      Preliminary research indicates that combinations of VTS-Aspirin with analgesics may confer&#xD;
      greater benefit in pain management than some current standards of care (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An oral combination drug of VTS-Aspirin and ketamine (VTS-K) would facilitate the shift from&#xD;
      IV opioids to a non-IV therapy for patients presenting to the ED with acute MSK pain. This&#xD;
      formulation has a potential to provide effective analgesia in the ED with reduced side&#xD;
      effects. VTS-K's proprietary oral formulation of established, safe, and well-understood APIs,&#xD;
      makes it uniquely appropriate for use in the ED. VTS-K is administered orally, which is&#xD;
      suitable for resource-poor environments in which the healthcare setting may be inadequate as&#xD;
      well as suitable to improve the throughput of ED Patients by reducing their length of stay.&#xD;
      This is especially pertinent given the alternative of IV opioids for pain management of acute&#xD;
      MSK pain, which requires both clinical monitoring and equipment, whereas VTS-K promotes&#xD;
      weaning off opioids, alleviating the resource consumption.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate analgesic efficacy of orally administered VTS-K (liquid oral ketamine taken&#xD;
      simultaneously with VTS-Aspirin and oral ketamine (in a liquid form)) for pain management of&#xD;
      adult ED patients presenting to the ED with acute musculoskeletal pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our pilot study we hypothesize that the VTS-K combination will result in analgesia with a&#xD;
      change in pain score at least of 1.3 points on NRS. The primary outcome of this trial is the&#xD;
      reduction in participant's pain scores at 60 minutes post medication administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Patients 18 years of age and older presenting to the ED with acute musculoskeletal&#xD;
      painful conditions (traumatic and non-traumatic) with a an initial pain score of 5 or more on&#xD;
      a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale and requiring oral analgesia as&#xD;
      determined by the treating attending physician. Patients' screening and enrollment will be&#xD;
      performed by study investigators and research assistants. All patients will be enrolled at&#xD;
      various times of the day when study investigators will be available for patient enrollment&#xD;
      and an ED pharmacist will be available for medication preparation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria: Patients 18 years of age and older presenting to the ED with acute&#xD;
      musculoskeletal painful conditions (traumatic and non-traumatic) with an initial pain score&#xD;
      of 5 on a standard 11- point (0 to 10) numeric rating scale. Patients will have to be awake,&#xD;
      alert, and oriented to person, place, and time, and will be able to demonstrate understanding&#xD;
      of the informed consent process and content. Patients also will have to demonstrate ability&#xD;
      to verbalize the nature of any adverse effects they might experience as well as to express&#xD;
      their pain severity by using the NRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Patients with altered mental status, allergy to aspirin and ketamine,&#xD;
      pregnant patients, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 or&gt;180 mm Hg, pulse rate&#xD;
      &lt;50 or &gt;150 beats/min, and respiration rate &lt;10 or &gt;30 breaths/min), inability to provide&#xD;
      consent, consumption of Aspirin or NSAID's within 6 hours of arrival to the ED, active PUD,&#xD;
      history of GI Hemorrhage, history of renal and hepatic insufficiency, past medical history of&#xD;
      alcohol or drug abuse, or schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a prospective observational pilot trail evaluating analgesic efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of VTS-K in adult patients presenting to the ED of Maimonides Medical Center with&#xD;
      acute musculoskeletal painful conditions. Upon meeting the eligibility criteria, patients&#xD;
      will be offered to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures: Each patient will be approached by a study investigator for&#xD;
      acquisition of written informed consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability&#xD;
      Act authorization after being evaluated by the treating emergency physician and determined to&#xD;
      meet study eligibility criteria. When English will not be the participant's primary language,&#xD;
      a language- appropriate consent form will be used and non-investigator, hospital-employed,&#xD;
      trained interpreters or licensed telephone interpreter will assist in acquisition of informed&#xD;
      consent. Baseline pain score will be determined with an 11-point numeric rating scale (0 to&#xD;
      10), described to the patient as &quot;no pain&quot; being 0 and &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot; being 10.&#xD;
      A study investigator will record the patient's body weight and baseline vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The on-duty ED pharmacist will prepare an oral dose of ketamine by using a formulary for&#xD;
      parenteral use. The oral dosing regimen of ketamine is 0.5 mg/kg that will be placed in the&#xD;
      syringe or a medication cup. The research associate will deliver both medications&#xD;
      (VTS-Aspirin and Oral Ketamine) to the patient. Study investigators will record pain scores&#xD;
      and adverse effects at 15, 30, 60, and 90 minutes. If patients reported a pain numeric rating&#xD;
      scale score of 5 or greater and requested additional pain relief, an oral immediate release&#xD;
      morphine tablet of 7.5 mg will be given&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded on data collection sheets, including patients' sex, demographics,&#xD;
      medical history, and vital signs, and entered into SPSS (version 24.0; IBM Corp) by the&#xD;
      research manager. Confirmation of written consent acquisition for all participants, and&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be conducted by the statistician, who will work independently of&#xD;
      any data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be closely monitored for adverse effects during the entire study period (up to&#xD;
      90 minutes) by study investigators. Common adverse effects that are associated with oral&#xD;
      ketamine are felling of unreality, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, and sedation. Common adverse&#xD;
      effects are associated with VTS-Aspirin are nausea, dyspepsia, epigastric discomfort.&#xD;
