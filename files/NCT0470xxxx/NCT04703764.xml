      1. Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this phase 1 clinical trial is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of HSG4112 after multiple oral&#xD;
           administration in healthy female subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The previous phase 1 clinical trials investigating HSG4112 only included healthy male&#xD;
           subjects, and food effect was observed in theses studies - the plasma exposure to&#xD;
           HSG4112 following administration under fed conditions was approximately 2.5 times higher&#xD;
           compared to the exposure following administration under fasted conditions. This study is&#xD;
           designed to evaluate the safety of HSG4112 in healthy female subjects following the&#xD;
           administration of HSG4112 under fed conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design and Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a dose block-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dosing,&#xD;
      phase 1 clinical study. A unique randomization number will be assigned to each subject deemed&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study based on the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Each subject&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the two dose groups. In each dose group, 8 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive HSG4112 and 2 subjects will be randomized to receive placebo. The&#xD;
      subjects will be studied in a double-blind manner will receive the investigational product&#xD;
      (i.e., HSG4112 or placebo) via once-daily oral administration for 14 consecutive days. After&#xD;
      the post-study visit of the last volunteer in the 480 mg dose group, the Investigator will&#xD;
      review all the available safety data in a blinded manner to ensure if it is safe to proceed&#xD;
      with the 720 mg dose group. In order to evaluate safety and tolerability, assessments, such&#xD;
      as vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram, laboratory test, pregnancy test, physical&#xD;
      examination, and adverse event monitoring will be performed. Blood samples will be collected&#xD;
      to evaluate the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics of HSG4112.&#xD;

                       cap, condom) used with chemical sterilization (e.g., spermicide), or&#xD;
                       surgical sterilization of the subject or the subject's male partner (e.g.,&#xD;
                       vasectomy, hysterectomy, tubal ligation, salpingectomy).&#xD;

               -  Intend to use hormonal contraceptive methods during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential who have tested positive for pregnancy,&#xD;
