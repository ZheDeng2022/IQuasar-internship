  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Incisional hernia is a common condition after abdominal surgery. Because linea alba has less&#xD;
      vascularity, incisional hernia more common in midline incisions. It is seen in the general&#xD;
      population between 11-20%. In some high-risk situations, this rate increases up to 40-69%&#xD;
      (abdominal aortic aneurysm, morbid obesity, colorectal surgery).It is known that incisional&#xD;
      hernia that occurs in the postoperative period can lead to emergency surgical causes such as&#xD;
      incarceration-strangulation, has a significant share in health expenses and seriously impairs&#xD;
      the quality of life in patients.One of the methods tried to reduce incisional hernia is the&#xD;
      use of mesh. But this abdominal closure technique is not used routinely in our country and&#xD;
      the other countries. This study will be important of the studies in Turkey and world for&#xD;
      patient selection in prophylactic mesh use, techniques to be applied and early / late&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the classical abdominal closure technique with use of mesh&#xD;
      in order to minimize the incisional hernia and associated complications after midline&#xD;
      laparotomy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are patient and surgical procedure-related risk factors that increase the risk of&#xD;
      postoperative incisional hernia. Patient-related risk factors: male gender, previous&#xD;
      laparotomy, over 50 years of age, malignant disease, COPD, hypoalbuminemia, sepsis, obesity&#xD;
      (BMI&gt; 30 kg / m2), anemia, DM, used to steroid, smoking, chemoterapi, cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      RT to the abdominal wall and to be postoperative abdominal wall defects. In studies conducted&#xD;
      in many centers around the world, it has been shown that the use of prophylactic mesh reduces&#xD;
      the incidence of incisional hernia, especially in high-risk patients. When the literature was&#xD;
      reviewed, reviews and meta-analyzes about the use of prophylactic mesh showed a significant&#xD;
      decrease in incisional hernia incidence. However, routine practice has not yet been&#xD;
      recommended, as long-term follow-up results and secondary results (complications, cost&#xD;
      analysis, quality of life) are not clearly explained. However, it has been reported that&#xD;
      higher quality studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This abdominal closure technique is not used routinely in our country. This study will be one&#xD;
      of the first studies in Turkey for patient selection in prophylactic mesh use, techniques to&#xD;
      be applied and early / late results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the classical abdominal closure technique with use of mesh&#xD;
      in order to minimize the incisional hernia and associated complications after midline&#xD;
      laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 18 years and over who were scheduled to undergo emergency abdominal surgery&#xD;
      with midline laparotomy will be randomly assigned (1: 1) to primary abdominal closure or mesh&#xD;
      group via a computer-generated randomization sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information was given to all patients before they were included in the study, and&#xD;
      their informed consent forms were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method in the primary suture group: The linea alba will be closed to a ratio of 5mm /&#xD;
      5mm. Only the fascia will be sutured ; fat or muscle tissue will be avoided. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      tissue will be closed with polyglactin 3/0 suture. The skin will be closed with a stapler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method in the mesh group: After the fascia was closed with the same method, 5 cm of&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue will be dissected around the incision. The mesh will be placed in the&#xD;
      supra-aponeurotic area (onlay) to a distance of laterally and cranial-caudally 5 cm from the&#xD;
      fascia margins. The mesh used will be partially absorbable, light and large porous. After&#xD;
      this procedure, the borders of the mesh will be fixed circumferentially on the abdominal wall&#xD;
      using polypropylene suture to prevent the intestines from herniating on the mesh. Two&#xD;
      subcutaneous drainage catheters will be placed in all patients with mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antithrombotic prophylaxis with low molecular weight heparin, antibiotic prophylaxis with&#xD;
      cefazolin and metronidazole will be applied to all patients according to the hospital&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis; To provide sufficient statistical power, sample size calculation was made.&#xD;
      Incisional hernia rates were estimated between 5% and 25% between the two groups. It was&#xD;
      calculated that 49 patients per group with 80% test power in the 95% confidence interval&#xD;
      would be needed. In the follow-up period, it was planned to include 52 patients in each&#xD;
      group, with the prediction that 5% of the patients would be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry and Statistical Analysis; Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk normality tests will&#xD;
      be carried out before starting the statistical analysis. If normality cannot be achieved even&#xD;
      in one of the groups, non-parametric test methods will be selected. Next, the Mann-Whitney U&#xD;
      test will be used to compare the variables obtained by the measurement between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chi-square and Fisher Final tests will be used to analyze the relationships or differences&#xD;
      between groups in terms of categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Univariate logistic regression analysis will be performed to determine the factors thought to&#xD;
      cause an incisional hernia. Then, multivariate logistic regression analysis will be done for&#xD;
      variables with&#xD;
