  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate whether an internet-based compassion course of five modules&#xD;
      contributes to reducing stress of conscience and work-related stress, increase the experience&#xD;
      of professional quality of life and self-compassion in healthcare professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Reactions to severe stress is one of the most common causes of sick leave in Sweden. Previous&#xD;
      research has shown that compassion interventions for staff can affect work-related stress by&#xD;
      increased self-care, better self-awareness and an increased healthy attitude, however,&#xD;
      Swedish studies on the subject are scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassion is a motivation to reduce suffering in oneself and others characterized by a warm,&#xD;
      understanding, and respectful attitude. In addition to beneficial effects for the staff, a&#xD;
      compassion-oriented approach, has shown to improve the relationship between patient and&#xD;
      staff, increase patient satisfaction with care and reduce patient anxiety and stress. As a&#xD;
      result of the covid-19 pandemic, healthcare professionals have been exposed to difficult&#xD;
      physical and mental work conditions that cause feelings of stress and inadequacy. In the long&#xD;
      run, increased stress can cause fatigue and increased number of sick leaves. This can in turn&#xD;
      contribute to increased stress for the staff who remain working and difficulties to recruit&#xD;
      new staff, which make the situation worse. There is a lack of interventions for staff aimed&#xD;
      at preventing stress-related health issues, enabling recovery and reduce mental suffering&#xD;
      linked to a stressful work situations. The aim of this study is to find a method that help&#xD;
      healthcare providers cope with stress of conscience in relation to stressful work situations,&#xD;
      particularly during the current covid-19 pandemic. A five week internet-based compassion&#xD;
      course of five modules will be conducted and evaluated with the aim of exploring whether the&#xD;
      course contributes to reduce stress of conscience and work-related stress, and increases the&#xD;
      levels of professional quality of life and self-compassion among healthcare professionals.&#xD;
      The internet-based compassion course will be compared with: one group that is on a waiting&#xD;
      list for ten weeks and then receives an internet-based general stress management course and&#xD;
      one group that participate in the general stress management course.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The sample size was determined based on an expected between group effect size (between ICOP and ICB) of Cohen's d = 0.4 for the primary outcome at the five-week follow-up for the primary analysis for participants with SCQ scores of 45 and higher. To reach 80% power, the study need 100 participants in each active arm. Expecting 20% attrition, the investigators will include 120 participants. Thirty participants are required in the waitlist group with an expected between-group effect between the ICOP group and the waitlist of d = 0.8. Including the expected attrition, 36 participants will be required. Given the 200 participants and a power of 80%, the non-inferiority analysis will provide a minimal clinically important difference of roughly d = 0.35.&#xD;
Participants with SCQ scores below 45 will be included for secondary analyses, thus expect to include 480 participants (ICOP and ICB), with an additional 72 participants in the waitlist group, for a total of 552.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>This study is a single-blind randomized trial where eligible participants will informed about that they will be assigned to either of two different stress-management courses or to waitlist, but they are unaware of which particular conditions. The waitlist group (ten weeks waitlist and thereafter either compassion- or cognitive behavioural courses) will receive thorough information about the two different courses and thereafter rate how attractive they find each course. Then they get to choose which course they want to attend to.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change (from baseline) in Stress of conscience</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 5, 10 and 15 weeks and 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Stress of Conscience Questionnaire (SCQ). The purpose of the SCQ is to estimate stress related to a troubled conscience. The questionnaire consists of nine items describing different healthcare situations, each made up of two parts, an A question and a B question. The A question concerns how frequently the subject estimates that the situation discussed arises in the workplace. This is assessed on a 6-point Likert scale, where 0 is 'Never' and 5 stands for 'Every day'. For each A question, there is a B question following it, in which the degree to which the conscience is troubled in the given situation is estimated on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. The visual analogue scale ranges from 0 = 'No, it gives me no troubled conscience at all' to 5 = 'Yes, it gives me a very troubled conscience'.</description>

    <measure>Change (from baseline) in Professional quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>0, 5, 10 and 15 weeks and 6 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Professional quality of life scale (PROQOL) Professional quality of life is the quality one feels in relation to their work as a helper. Both the positive and negative aspects of doing one's job influence ones professional quality of life. Professional quality of life incorporates two aspects, the positive (Compassion Satisfaction) and the negative (Compassion Fatigue). Compassion fatigue breaks into two parts. The first part concerns things such like exhaustion, frustration, anger and depression typical of burnout. Secondary Traumatic Stress is a negative feeling driven by fear and work-related trauma. Some trauma at work can be direct (primary) trauma. In other cases, work-related trauma be a combination of both primary and secondary trauma. The PROQOL consists of 30 questions assessed on a 5-point Likert scale, where 0 is 'Never' and 5 stands for 'Very often'.</description>
