    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) from all tobacco products will be assessed over the course of the study. Participants reporting no vaping in the past 7 days will be coded as abstinent. Those reporting 7-day abstinence and not using nicotine replacement therapy will be mailed saliva cotinine test kit and saliva tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) test kit for biochemical verification of abstinence.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in response on Stages of Change Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participants readiness to quit will be measured using the Stages of Change questionnaire - single item, which asks &quot;Are you seriously thinking of quitting smoking?&quot; Answers range from 'Yes, within the next 30 days', 'Yes, within the next 6 months', and 'No, not thinking of quitting'.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the score on the Thoughts About Abstinence (TAA) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The adapted Thoughts About Abstinence Questionnaire (Hall et al., 1991) is a 3 item self-report questionnaire that measures: 1) desire to quit smoking, 2) expected success at quitting, 3) expected difficulty of quitting on 10-point Likert scales (e.g., 1=no desire to quit/lowest expectation/lowest level of difficulty to 10 = extreme desire to quit/highest expectation of success/highest expected difficulty)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the scores on the Ways of Quitting questionnaire (WOQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The WOQ is a 28-item self-report instrument assessing adolescent smoking cessation strategies. For each WOQ item, respondents indicate whether they have used a given strategy (yes/no) and, if used, how helpful it was perceived to be on a five-point Likert-type scale (1= &quot;Not helpful&quot; to 5=&quot;Extremely helpful&quot;) with regard to several categories: Social support, Seeking assistance, Avoidance, Reduction, Substitution, Medication, Distraction, and Quit all at once (single item).</description>

    <description>The vaping intervention will be implemented on Instagram. Participants in the treatment condition will be assigned to groups on Instagram, where they will receive up to 3 posts per day for 30 days. Groups are facilitated by a trained Guide, working with the Principal Investigator, Co-Investigators and a Pediatrician on demand if additional expertise or clinical advice is needed. Participants will be educated about signs of nicotine dependence and if they express interest in pharmacotherapy will be encouraged to access this through their personal healthcare providers. The Instagram groups will provide educational and social support, troubleshooting and advice about nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or other forms of treatment.</description>
