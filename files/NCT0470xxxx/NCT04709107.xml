  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred patients evaluated to undergo revascularization (elective/emergent,&#xD;
      surgical/interventional) for lower limb PAD at the cantonal hospital of Aarau, Switzerland,&#xD;
      will, after consenting to participate in the study, be asked to fill up both SF-36 and&#xD;
      VascuQol-6 questionnaires while sitting in a waiting room before the procedure and during the&#xD;
      30 days and 1-year routine follow up. An electronic version of the questionnaires will be&#xD;
      administered on a tablet. The primary goal is to validate the clinical use of the German&#xD;
      electronic version of the VascuQol-6 questionnaire to assess patient-related outcomes of the&#xD;
      performed treatment by patients with PAD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower extremity peripheral artery disease is a chronic illness that has a significant effect&#xD;
      on the quality of life of the patients in short- as well as long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generic Instruments, such as widely used Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 questionnaire&#xD;
      (SF-36) might be too insensitive to specific problems and associated comorbidities of&#xD;
      vascular surgery patients as well as too complicated for routine use in a busy clinical&#xD;
      setting. Therefore, the Vascular Quality of life questionnaire (VascuQoL-25) has been&#xD;
      developed for use in the UK in 2001 at the Vascular Surgical Unit of King's College Hospital&#xD;
      in London. To further simplify the use of the questionnaire, a lighter Version, that reduced&#xD;
      the amount of asked questions from 25 to 6 (VascQuol-6) has been presented and found to be&#xD;
      both valid and relevant. VascuQoL- 6 is a disease-specific questionnaire, developed to assess&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with peripheral artery disease. It has&#xD;
      been translated to 8 languages including German, and successfully validated for the use to&#xD;
      assess in patients with peripheral artery disease in Sweden, Netherlands, Norway, Brazil and&#xD;
      Poland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In opinion of the investigators, a unified means to obtain relevant data concerning&#xD;
      patient-related outcomes following treatment (endovascular or surgical) for PAD as part of&#xD;
      existing aftercare schemes currently lacks in Switzerland. A simple tool such as VascuQoL-6&#xD;
      would allow collecting and objectively assessing, as well as comparing this kind of&#xD;
      information after such procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the project is to validate the electronic version of the VascuQoL-6 for&#xD;
      assessment of patient-related outcomes after a revascularization procedure (either surgical&#xD;
      or interventional) for peripheral artery disease in the German-speaking part of Switzerland&#xD;
      preoperatively, during the routine 30 days and a one-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, upon the successful validation of the electronic VascuQoL-6, the investigators&#xD;
      seek to implement the use of this easy to use, straight-forward tool in the follow-up scheme&#xD;
      of the Swiss Vascular Registry (SwissVasc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is of Risk A (minimum risk) according to art. 7 (HRO), because the&#xD;
      patient-related quality of life will be evaluated after vascular surgery or intervention and&#xD;
      will not have an influence on treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and primary objective Assessment of quality regarding invasive treatment&#xD;
      (endovascular or surgical), outcomes and patients satisfaction becomes a more and more&#xD;
      powerful instrument to influence and guide decisions in the Swiss healthcare system. However,&#xD;
      no unified means are currently being applied as part of the existing follow-up schema after&#xD;
      revascularization for PAD in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Therefore, the&#xD;
      possibility to provide, assess, compare and use the information about short- mid- and&#xD;
      long-term patient-related outcomes and improved/decreased disease- related quality of life in&#xD;
      the decision-making process is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of a comprehensible and easy-to-use electronic Version of the VascuQoL-6 will&#xD;
      allow obtaining such information in patients that underwent vascular/ endovascular surgery in&#xD;
      the German-speaking part of Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SwissVasc (i.e. Adjumed.net) is a nation-wide database to register vascular interventions and&#xD;
      associated outcomes. Registration of individual data in SwissVasc (i.e. 30-day mortality,&#xD;
      complication rate) is mandatory in Kanton Zurich and will become mandatory in Kanton Basel-&#xD;
      Stadt and Basel-Landschaft in 2020. Moreover, this register will soon be part of the statutes&#xD;
      of the Swiss Society of Vascular Surgery to evaluate the quality of training in each&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Evaluation of VascuQoL-6 is part of this ambitious project. The goal is to implement the&#xD;
      use of this questionnaire into the SwissVasc registry follow-up schema, to provide a&#xD;
      uniformly used tool to collect and investigate the above-said information.&#xD;
