  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project seeks to test whether people maintain essentialistic beliefs about food (foods&#xD;
      as having immutable underlying 'essences' that contribute to the food's attributes and&#xD;
      properties). Currently, there are studies on essentialistic beliefs on topics such as: race,&#xD;
      genes, and natural objects. However, there is limited research applying the concept of&#xD;
      essentialism to food. In addition, in food studies, participants' perception and&#xD;
      acceptability of foods were being explored but what remains unknown is whether they have any&#xD;
      degree of essentialistic beliefs towards food which influences their perception and&#xD;
      acceptability of food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to gain in-depth knowledge and understanding on whether&#xD;
      people maintain essentialistic beliefs about food, and determine whether these beliefs may be&#xD;
      associated with attitudes and expectations of foods that vary in their levels of processing.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To gain in-depth knowledge and understanding on whether people maintain essentialistic&#xD;
           beliefs about food (foods as having immutable underlying 'essences' that contribute to&#xD;
           the food's attributes and properties).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether these beliefs may be associated with attitudes and expectations of&#xD;
           foods that vary in their levels of processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the perceptions of essentialistic transference: The belief that the essence&#xD;
           of a food is transferred to a person who consumes the food, which manifests the&#xD;
           properties of the food in the consumer (E.g., the belief that people who have a diet of&#xD;
           eating fast-running animals are also fast runners).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves 2 parts: Study 1A &amp; Study 1B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 participants in Singapore, aged between 21-65 years old will be recruited to do an online&#xD;
      survey on Qualtrics. Participants would first rate their baseline appetite before proceeding&#xD;
      to the survey. For this study, the food categories will be: Milk, Rice, Carrot and Chicken.&#xD;
      There will be a total of 7 different kinds of foods varying in the levels of processing per&#xD;
      category and the images of these foods will be presented in a randomized order. Participants&#xD;
      will rate their perceptions of the properties of foods (e.g. nutritiousness, naturalness,&#xD;
      familiarity, liking, taste, stereotypical trait, and processing) on a scale that ranges from&#xD;
      &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Very much&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After rating their perceptions of the properties of foods, participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires measuring: Essentialistic beliefs about food (EFS: 6-point scale from&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;), perceptions of essentialistic transference (ETS:&#xD;
      6-point scale with 2 opposite traits as anchors e.g. &quot;Very Irritable&quot; to &quot;Very&#xD;
      good-natured&quot;), nutrition knowledge (NKS: 6-point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly&#xD;
      Agree&quot;), importance of food naturalness (FNS: 6-point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;) and consumers' fears towards food technology (FTNS: 7-point scale from&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 participants in Singapore, aged between 21-65 years old will be recruited to do an online&#xD;
      survey on Qualtrics. Participants would first rate their baseline appetite before proceeding&#xD;
      to the survey. For this study, the food categories will be: Fish, Orange, Napa Cabbage,&#xD;
      Peanut and Beef. There will be a total of 7 different kinds of foods varying in the levels of&#xD;
      processing per category and 2 foods-in-name (e.g. Vuna and Impossible burger), and the images&#xD;
      of these foods will be presented in a randomize order. Participants will rate their&#xD;
      perceptions of the properties of foods (e.g. nutritiousness, naturalness, familiarity,&#xD;
      liking, taste, stereotypical trait, and processing) on a scale that ranges from &quot;Not at all&quot;&#xD;
      to &quot;Very much&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After rating their perceptions of the properties of foods, participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires measuring: Essentialistic beliefs about food (EFS: 6-point scale from&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;), perceptions of essentialistic transference (ETS:&#xD;
      6-point scale with 2 opposite traits as anchors e.g. &quot;Very Irritable&quot; to &quot;Very&#xD;
      good-natured&quot;), nutrition knowledge (NKS: 6-point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly&#xD;
      Agree&quot;), importance of food naturalness (FNS: 6-point scale from &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;) and consumers' fears towards food technology (FTNS: 7-point scale from&#xD;
      &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;).&#xD;
