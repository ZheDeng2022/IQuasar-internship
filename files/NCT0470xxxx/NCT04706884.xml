      Objective: The objective of the study was to investigate a reverse correlation between blood&#xD;
      lactate levels and rSO2, and distinguish between hypoxic and non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia seen&#xD;
      in the early postoperative period.&#xD;

      The objective of the prospective study was to investigate a reverse correlation between blood&#xD;
      lactate levels and rSO2, and distinguish between hypoxic and non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia seen&#xD;
      in the early postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II-III patients were included in this&#xD;
      study. Perioperative data, including age, weight, body surface area, gender, body&#xD;
      temperature, preoperative co-morbidities, intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp&#xD;
      duration, flow rate, urine output, and blood product and inotropic agent usage, were&#xD;
      recorded. Postoperative plasma lactate levels were measured simultaneously with cerebral&#xD;
      tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) in both cerebral hemispheres at 10 different time points.&#xD;
