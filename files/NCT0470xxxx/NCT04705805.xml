  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sense of smell disorders are common and are said to affect up to 20% of the general&#xD;
      population. They are often disabling and have a real impact on the quality of life. Smell&#xD;
      disorders are most often assessed using a visual analogue scale and more rarely with&#xD;
      objective tests (Sniffing Stick Test). Many ENT units do not have these objective tests&#xD;
      because they are time-consuming and are not covered by health insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some teams, such as that of Dr Thomas Hummel of the Carl Gustav Carus University Clinic in&#xD;
      Dresden Germany, have developed self-assessment questionnaires for the sense of smell in&#xD;
      order to improve the overall care of patients with olfactory disorders. Two of these&#xD;
      self-questionnaires seem to us to be particularly relevant for use in everyday practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, these questionnaires have already been validated in different languages (English,&#xD;
      Chinese, Korean...), but have never been translated and validated in French. Translating and&#xD;
      validating these questionnaires into French would make it possible to improve the management&#xD;
      and follow-up of French patients with olfactory disorders and to assess the impact of loss of&#xD;
      smell on their quality of life.&#xD;
