  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there has been a change of criteria&#xD;
      for tooth extraction at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) from 2005 to 2018.&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the change of mean of radiographic interproximal bone loss of&#xD;
      extracted teeth. The secondary outcomes are changes of other parameters (periodontal,&#xD;
      endodontic and restorative) of extracted teeth and reasons for extraction.&#xD;

      The purpose of the present study is to quantitatively evaluate the change in tooth extraction&#xD;
      at school setting over the past 14 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aim of the present study is to investigate whether there has been a change of&#xD;
      criteria for tooth extraction at Tufts University School of Dental Medicine (TUSDM) from 2005&#xD;
      to 2018. The primary outcome is the change of mean of radiographic interproximal bone loss of&#xD;
      extracted teeth. The secondary outcomes are changes of other parameters (periodontal,&#xD;
      endodontic and restorative) of extracted teeth and reasons for extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Criteria for extraction of first molar teeth has changed between 2005 and 2018&#xD;
      toward early extraction of teeth with less severe periodontal and other conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance Currently, there is not study presenting the quantified data for criteria change&#xD;
      for tooth extraction. Also, determining whether to extract a tooth or not actually requires&#xD;
      taking several clinical parameters into consideration. The present study will give clinicians&#xD;
      a broad review of the change in clinical decision making for tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Retrospective chart review among patients in TUSDM Pre-doctoral and&#xD;
      Post-doctoral Group Practices The study setting is among patients who received dental&#xD;
      treatments at TUSDM. The database will be retrospectively reviewed by patients' electronic&#xD;
      records in TUSDM Postgraduate (PG) and Undergraduate (UG) clinics from 01/01/2005 till&#xD;
      12/31/2018.&#xD;

    <measure>Part 1: Change in mean of radiographic interproximal bone loss of extracted teeth</measure>
    <time_frame>2005-2018</time_frame>
    <description>All the measurements are based on the following reference points projected onto the theoretical tooth long axis&#xD;
Cemento-enamel junction (CEJ); if there is dental restoration or prosthesis on tooth making CEJ undetectable on the radiographs, the apical margin of dental restoration or prosthesis will be used as CEJ&#xD;
The most apical points of mesial and distal interproximal bone height&#xD;
The apex of root&#xD;
The radiographic mesial and distal bone loss will be determined by the proportion of the distance between bone height to apex and the distance between CEJ to apex, projected on the tooth axis&#xD;
The greater bone loss of the mesial and distal sides on radiographs will be used for further analysis</description>

    <time_frame>2007-2018</time_frame>
    <description>The aim for sub-project 2 represent an extension of the Aim for Subproject 1 outlined above. This sub-project will investigate whether there has been a change of criteria for tooth extraction at TUSDM from 2007 to 2018 specifically for and limited to molar teeth that were extracted and subsequently replaced with dental implants.&#xD;
Criteria for extraction of first molar teeth has changed between 2007 and 2018 toward early extraction of teeth with less severe periodontal and other conditions.</description>

             if the prognosis is compromised.&#xD;
