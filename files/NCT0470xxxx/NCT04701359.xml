  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current prospective, randomized study, two different materials of the same total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty (TKA) system - cobalt-chromium (CoCr) and titanium-nitride (TiN) - are going to&#xD;
      be compared with regards to postoperative outcome. Two-hundred patients are planned to be&#xD;
      included in the study over a 4-year period, randomly assigned to either the CoCr- or&#xD;
      TiN-implant-group. In order to ensure double-blinding, patients will not be informed about&#xD;
      the group they had been assigned to. Moreover, no identifying information of the implant used&#xD;
      will be written on documents later accessible to nurses and/or physicians at follow-up&#xD;
      appointments. Consequently, surgeons of the respective patients will be excluded from&#xD;
      study-specific examination of patients. Despite range of motion (ROM), questionnaires (visual&#xD;
      analogue scale - VAS; Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index - WOMAC,&#xD;
      Forgotten Joint Score - FJS; Knee Society Scoe - KSS) will be used to assess the&#xD;
      postoperative outcome. Furthermore, metal ion levels (cobalt, chrom, molybdenum, titanium) in&#xD;
      the blood stream of patients will be measured at scheduled follow-up appointments. It is&#xD;
      expected that there will not be a measureable difference between the two coating-groups with&#xD;
      regards to ROM, functionality, and metal-ion levels over time.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present double-blinded study was planned in order to assess whether differences in&#xD;
      materials - using one otherwise similar TKA system - would have an effect on postoperative&#xD;
      patient outcome. Moreover, metal ion levels will be measured in the blood stream&#xD;
      preoperatively (as reference) and upon follow-up, based on previous observations that metal&#xD;
      ion levels are increased in serum following TKA, without any relevant influence on outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present prospective study is to assess whether differences in tribological&#xD;
      pairings - i.e. TiN-coating in comparison to CoCr-alloy using a frequently implanted total&#xD;
      knee endoprosthesis (ACSÂ® System, Implantcast GmbH, Buxtehude, Germany) - have an effect on&#xD;
      postoperative range of motion (ROM) and patient satisfaction, reflected by Western Ontario&#xD;
      and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Knee&#xD;
      Society Score (KSS), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Moreover, metal ion levels will be tested&#xD;
      in both groups to monitor their concentration in the blood stream, usually reflecting&#xD;
      physiological abrasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the current study is the functional outcome of patients with TKA on a&#xD;
      CoCrMo- basis in comparison to a TiN-coated implant. The secondary endpoint is the&#xD;
      measurement of metal ion levels in the blood stream and their potential dynamics over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hundred patients will be prospectively included in the study over a 4-year period, with&#xD;
      100 being randomly assigned to group A (TiN-coating) and 100 to group B (CoCr-alloy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Random assignment will be carried out via an automatic randomisation system run by a local&#xD;
      study nurse. Pre- and postoperatively, range of motion (ROM), visual analogue scale (VAS)&#xD;
      score and specific questionnaires - i.e. Western Ontario and McMaster Universities&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), Forgotten Joint Score (FJS), Knee Society Score (KSS) - will be&#xD;
      ascertained (Table 1) in order to allow comparison of potential differences between group A&#xD;
      and B during follow-up. Furthermore, preoperatively, at 6 months, 12 months, 24 months and 60&#xD;
      months, metal ion levels (cobalt, chromium, molybdenum, titanium) in the blood stream will be&#xD;
      measured in each patient (6ml tubes). Measurements of metal ion levels will be performed at&#xD;
      an external institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase of active recruiting is planned for 4 years, with 50 patients being included per&#xD;
      year on average. With the last patients anticipated to being included at the end of the 4th&#xD;
      year, their follow-up will be finished 9 years after study initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed prior to potential study participation whether or not to they&#xD;
      would like to participate, clarifying that refusal will not have any negative impact on&#xD;
      further treatment. In case patients agree to participate, they will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either group A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double-blinding will be made possible by not informing patients whether they had been&#xD;
      allocated to group A or B and by not directly revealing information about the implant type&#xD;
      used on medical records that will later be accessible to the study nurse and/or physicians&#xD;
      during clinical examinations at follow- up. Therefore, it will be necessary to exclude those&#xD;
      surgeons participating in the surgeries of the respective patients from examining them during&#xD;
      follow-up, in order to maintain blinding. Prior to follow-up appointments, surgeons who had&#xD;
      not participated in surgeries of the respective patients will thus be informed by the study&#xD;
      nurse in order to perform clinical examination, radiological follow-up and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      As patients receive the identical orthopaedic implant during an identical surgical procedure&#xD;
      for comparable indications, it is expected that the differences in alloy (i.e. TiN vs. CoCr)&#xD;
      will not have a measurable effect on postoperative patient outcome. Neither there is expected&#xD;
      to be a difference in metal ion levels in the blood stream over time between groups.&#xD;
