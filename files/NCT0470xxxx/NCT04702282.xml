  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacokinetics of free and total ropivacaine&#xD;
      after unilateral and bilateral TKA. A population model was successfully built and peak free&#xD;
      ropivacaine concentration stayed below previously proposed toxic thresholds in patients&#xD;
      undergoing unilateral as well as bilateral TKA receiving LIA with high dose ropivacaine.&#xD;

      Thirteen unilateral TKA and fifteen bilateral TKA patients were included in the study. All&#xD;
      patients were operated in a well-described fast-track setup without use of drains or&#xD;
      tourniquet.21 A standard midline skin incision with a medial para-patellar capsulotomy was&#xD;
      used. All patients were operated with cemented CR components. In bilateral TKA cases, both&#xD;
      knees were operated in one setting with the left knee always being operated first, and the&#xD;
      second knee being operated sequentially in the same setting immediately following closure of&#xD;
      the first knee. Patients undergoing unilateral TKA received spinal anesthesia with 2 mL 0.5%&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine, whereas patients scheduled for bilateral TKA received spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia with 3 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. Local infiltration anesthesia was&#xD;
      performed as previously described with 200 mL 0.2% ropivacaine (400 mg) mixed with 1 mL 1&#xD;
      mg/mL epinephrine injected periarticularly in each knee. The first 50 mL were injected into&#xD;
      the posterior capsule, 100 mL were injected into medial, anterior and lateral structures of&#xD;
      the knee and capsule and the final 50 mL were injected in the subcutaneous tissue. All&#xD;
      patients were mobilized on the day of surgery and thromboembolic prophylaxis started 6-8&#xD;
      hours postoperatively with rivaroxaban tablets (10 mg) given once daily until discharge. No&#xD;
      extended thromboembolic prophylaxis was given to any patient. All patient received 1 g&#xD;
      intravenous tranexamic acid preoperatively and 1 g 3 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative blood samples were taken within a week of surgery including electrolytes,&#xD;
      hemoglobin and serum creatinine levels. Baseline blood sample was taken just before incision&#xD;
      of the first knee, and additional blood samples were drawn at 1, 5, 30 and 60 minutes as well&#xD;
      as 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours after incision following unilateral TKA and at 1, 5, 30 minutes after&#xD;
      the incision of the first knee and 0, 5 and 15 minutes after incision of the second knee as&#xD;
      well as after 1,2, 4 8 and 24 hours (total 9 and 12 timepoints within 24 hours for unilateral&#xD;
      and bilateral TKA, respectively). Patient demographics were recorded and included age,&#xD;
      gender, height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ropivacaine measurement Ropivacaine concentrations were determined in plasma samples using&#xD;
      liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry following a fully validated method&#xD;
