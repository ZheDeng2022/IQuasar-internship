  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of Zanubrutinib combined with&#xD;
      Tislelizumab in the treatment of relapsed/refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma and Epstein-Barr Virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      R-CHOP regimen is the first-line therapy in DLBCL which greatly improved the efficacy of&#xD;
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and achieved good long-term survival. However, among&#xD;
      DLBCL patients treated with R-CHOP, EBV+ had a lower 5-year OS than EBV- patients (65% vs&#xD;
      82%). For primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), although the initial treatment&#xD;
      has a better prognosis than DLBCL, there are still 10% to 30% of PMBCL patients with primary&#xD;
      refractory or relapsed disease, and the prognosis is poor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zanubrutinib combined with Tislelizumab has been proved efficient in relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      NHLs, with ORR rate 37%, CR rate of 16.7%. This phase II, prospective, open-label, single-arm&#xD;
      study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zanubrutinib combined with Tislelizumab in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed/refractory primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma and Epstein-Barr&#xD;
      Virus-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events</description>
