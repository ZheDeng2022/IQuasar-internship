  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ambulatory mobility and function are important aspects in the quality of life of people with&#xD;
      lower limb amputations and prostheses. Regaining mobility is often challenging, especially&#xD;
      for patients with transfemoral, or above-knee, amputations. In the past decades, new types of&#xD;
      knee prosthetics have entered the market. The standard care in Europe and the US at this&#xD;
      moment is the mechanical, or non-microprocessor controlled, knee (NMPK). While the production&#xD;
      costs of these NMPK's are lower than those of the MPK's (microprocessor controlled knee),&#xD;
      consumer prices still reach up to $5000. Recently, the ReMotion Knee ($80) was developed as a&#xD;
      new and affordable alternative to the currently available mechanical knees. The ReMotion Knee&#xD;
      is mostly used in low-income countries, but has now been approved according to the ISO 10328&#xD;
      standards and has received the CE Mark. This knee could be a more affordable alternative for&#xD;
      the prosthetic knees used in high-income countries, thereby decreasing health related costs&#xD;
      within the amputation population. However, research on patient's functional abilities and&#xD;
      personal experiences with the knee is very limited and has not been investigated within more&#xD;
      developed countries. Therefore, the objective of this study is to compare the ReMotion Knee&#xD;
      and the current prosthetic knee of patients with a transfemoral amputation or&#xD;
      knee-exarticulation in terms of functional mobility, balance, and experienced walking&#xD;
      comfort, balance trust, fatigue and performance of the knee. it is expected that the ReMotion&#xD;
      Knee will perform slightly worse than the participants' current prosthetic knees.&#xD;

      The primary aim of healthcare organizations is to optimize the quality of life of their&#xD;
      patients while keeping a good balance between quality and costs. More advanced medical&#xD;
      technologies are constantly being developed to improve quality of life. However, these&#xD;
      technologies also lead to rising healthcare costs in high-income countries. Cost pressures&#xD;
      from medical innovations, along with the ageing population form a substantial threat to the&#xD;
      long-term sustainability of healthcare systems in high-income countries. Reverse innovations&#xD;
      (products or ideas originally designed for use in low-income countries that are 'upgraded'&#xD;
      and implemented in high-income countries) provide an opportunity to restrain the rising&#xD;
      healthcare costs in high-income countries. These products are often low-priced, easy to use,&#xD;
      and designed to function and survive in extreme and unpredictable conditions. However,&#xD;
      low-income country of origin products are still generally perceived as less reliable and safe&#xD;
      and they are rarely researched as an alternative to the current standard of care within the&#xD;
      medical sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The field of lower limb prosthetics is a typical example of a medical field with unceasing&#xD;
      technological developments, accompanied by rising expenses. With the rising incidence of&#xD;
      lower-limb amputations and the rising prosthetic prices, the costs of prosthetics care will&#xD;
      keep increasing. Reverse innovation could play an essential role in controlling the costs of&#xD;
      prosthetic care in the upcoming decades. However, research on new, lower-priced alternative&#xD;
      prostheses for use in high-income countries is very scarce and deserves more attention. An&#xD;
      example of a potential reverse innovation for the prosthetics market is the ReMotion knee: an&#xD;
      $80 mechanical knee recently designed by D-Rev (San Francisco, CA, USA) for use in low-income&#xD;
      countries. The ReMotion Knee has a polycentric design and a lifespan of about 3-5 years,&#xD;
      comparable to other mechanical knees, but does not include a pneumatic or hydraulic system.&#xD;
      It is easy to use, provides patients with a basic functional mobility, and is low priced,&#xD;
      especially compared to the standard care mechanical knees ranging between $1000 and $4000 in&#xD;
      the Netherlands. The ReMotion Knee could in this new way propose an opportunity to greatly&#xD;
      reduce healthcare costs among amputees in high-income countries. So far there is no research&#xD;
      available on health outcomes with the ReMotion Knee other than overall user satisfaction, and&#xD;
      it has never been evaluated as an alternative prosthetic knee for use in high-income&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the ReMotion Knee as a potential reverse innovation and provide&#xD;
      insight in the value of reverse innovation. To this end, the ReMotion Knee was compared with&#xD;
      currently used and comparable mechanical prosthetics knees in high-income countries. The&#xD;
      knees were evaluated based on the most important health outcomes for people with a lower-limb&#xD;
      amputation: functional mobility, walking comfort, balance and trust in balance. Furthermore,&#xD;
      experienced fatigue and performance with the knees were examined. As the ReMotion Knee has&#xD;
      less features advanced features than most polycentric prosthetic knees currently used, it was&#xD;
      expected that all would be slightly lower with the ReMotion Knee.&#xD;
