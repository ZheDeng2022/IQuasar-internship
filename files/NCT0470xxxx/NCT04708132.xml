  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to compare the prosthetic maintenance requirements between&#xD;
      implant-retained ball overdentures versus fixed screw- retained implant prosthesis. Clinical&#xD;
      and radiographic changes in peri-implant tissue with using PGE2 as a PICF biomarker were also&#xD;
      evaluated. Selected patients had been divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group (I): twenty seven patients had received implant-Supported ball over dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group (II): twenty-seven patients had received screw retained restorations Interventions&#xD;
           and study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical and prosthetic procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures A radiopaque radiographic stent was formed and was positioned in the&#xD;
      patient's mouth during cone beam scanning. Four implants were planned with two virtual&#xD;
      replicas, in the place of the lateral incisor and the second premolar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stent was fabricated. After the healing period of four months finished, the patients were&#xD;
      recalled and the super structure was fabricated according to the type of restoration&#xD;
      Follow-up During the 12 months follow-up period, prosthodontic complications were recorded&#xD;
      and calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care Along with a conventional oral hygiene assessment and functional checkup,&#xD;
      follow up visits were scheduled every 6 months and up to 12 months total follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical soft tissue measurements which include plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and&#xD;
      PPD were measured at the mid-facial, mid-lingual, mid-mesial, and mid-distal aspects of each&#xD;
      fixture using a graduated plastic probe to the nearest 0.5 mm. These clinical measurements&#xD;
      were recorded after prosthesis delivery, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. The peri-implant&#xD;
      marginal bone loss (MBL) was assessed radiographically after prosthesis delivery, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Collection of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) samples: PICF was collected.&#xD;
