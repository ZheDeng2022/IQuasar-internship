  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the ability of High Velocity Nasal Insufflation [HVNI] to effect&#xD;
      ventilation and related physiologic responses in hypercapnic patients when compared to&#xD;
      noninvasive positive pressure ventilation [NIPPV].&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this randomized study is to evaluate the efficacy of HVNI, in&#xD;
      comparison to NIPPV, to clinically stabilize and provide respiratory therapy to patients who&#xD;
      have COPD with moderate-to-severe hypercapnic respiratory distress upon presentation. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that HVNI is comparable to NIPPV in the stabilization and relief of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe hypercapnic respiratory distress upon presentation, by relieving the&#xD;
      patient's dyspnea (breathlessness) within 4 hours to a comparable degree to NIPPV.&#xD;
