      The objective is to compare the neuromuscular electrical activity and muscle fatigue of the&#xD;
      masseter muscles in three groups of patients with different treatments for TMD (GA =&#xD;
      Transcutaneous electrostimulation and splint, GB = percutaneous electrostimulation and&#xD;
      splint, and GC = Occlusal splint) by means of 6 electromyographic recordings scheduled&#xD;
      weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be patients with TMD who will enter the Physiology Laboratory of&#xD;
      the Division of Postgraduate Studies and Research (DEPeI) UNAM, admitted during the period&#xD;
      from March to December 2021 The selection of the sample will be carried out by convenience&#xD;
      sampling which will be carried out based on the clinical evaluation (considering the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria). The recruitment period will take place during the period&#xD;
      from March to December 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selected sample will be divided into three groups (GA = transcutaneous electrostimulation&#xD;
      and splint, GB = percutaneous electrostimulation and splint, GC = splint); the allocation by&#xD;
      group will be made by means of a randomization in balanced blocks. The total sample size&#xD;
      calculated for this study was 84 patients, 28 for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnostic process of Temporomandibular Dysfunction (TMD) will be carried out by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator using the Diagnostic Criteria and Investigation of Temporomandibular&#xD;
      Disorders (CDI / TMD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Temporomandibular dysfunction or disorder (TMD) is a functional disorder of the&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ), and is the cause of non-dental pain in the orofacial region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMD presents diagnostic difficulties, the literature suggests objective assessment of&#xD;
      neuromuscular activity. Electromyography (EMG) is a reliable tool to determine the degree of&#xD;
      functional muscle alteration, the EMG signal can be estimated and characterized by&#xD;
      multifractal analysis, for example, the Hurts Index. This method is used successfully in the&#xD;
      study of physiological signals with high biological variability (signals: cardiac,&#xD;
      cardiovascular, ophthalmological, neuronal, metabolic, etc.), it is considered suitable for&#xD;
      the comprehensive analysis of neuromuscular behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to compare the neuromuscular electrical activity (RMS) and muscle fatigue&#xD;
      (Hurst index) of the masseter muscles in three groups of patients with different treatments&#xD;
      for TMD (GA = Transcutaneous electrostimulation and splint, GB = percutaneous&#xD;
      electrostimulation and splint, and GC = Occlusal splint) by means of 6 electromyographic&#xD;
      recordings scheduled weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical examination will be performed in the order of the hands of the clock, beginning&#xD;
      with the upper right quadrant. The first review will correspond to the presence of mixed&#xD;
      dentition, use of prostheses, number of teeth, muscle pain (with a pressure algometer&#xD;
      applying 1.5 kg / cm2 in masseter muscles, and 2.4 kg / cm2 in temporal muscles), joint pain&#xD;
      (with algometer pressure applying 1.5 kg / cm2), presence of noises, limitation to mouth&#xD;
      opening (with Terabite) and heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess pain by means of muscle and joint palpation with an algometer, the patient will be&#xD;
      seated in a relaxed position, the evaluator will place the fine circular surface of the&#xD;
      algometer perpendicular to the skin and an increasing pressure of 0.5 kg / cm2 will be&#xD;
      applied increasing gradually over one minute until reaching 1.5 kg / cm2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be instructed to verbalize the moment when pressure was exerted if a painful&#xD;
      sensation was caused by muscle and in the joint area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment for TMD will be carried out using conventional treatment with an occlusal splint&#xD;
      and as an auxiliary method, transcutaneous and percutaneous electrostimulation therapies will&#xD;
      be applied by the same operator. The clinical control appointments for signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      TMD, splint fitting, electromyographic records and application of electrostimulation therapy&#xD;
      as an adjunct to the use of splint, will be scheduled once a week in the Physiology&#xD;
      Laboratory during the hours of 9:00 a.m. 1:00 pm and 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm for six consecutive&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The electromyographic recording technique was standardized (Cohen's Kappa 0.7). The recording&#xD;
      system (hardware and software) that will be used for the electromyographic evaluation is the&#xD;
      Electromyograph 1.2 UNAM-CINVESTAV, which consists of a two-channel system for the analysis&#xD;
      of the electromyographic signal that offers greater precision and facilitates muscle&#xD;
      assessment through the estimation made by the software of the RMS for its acronym in English&#xD;
      (Root Mean Square) and Hurts Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RMS and Hurts Index will be recorded using three electrodes: one placed at the muscular&#xD;
      origin, another at the insertion, and finally one in the behind-the-ear area as a ground or&#xD;
      neutral electrode. The RMS recording is performed at maximum intercuspation for 30 seconds;&#xD;
      the action potential that is expressed in electrical energy will be recorded in microvolts&#xD;
      per second (μV / s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 electromyographic recordings will be performed on each patient (one record each week)&#xD;
      during the time of splint use. Electromyographic recordings will be scheduled as well as&#xD;
      follow-up control appointments, to make adjustments to the physiological occlusal splint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transcutaneous electrostimulation therapy will be carried out by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, who will be trained in the ISSSTE Clínica de Especialidades Oriente Leonardo&#xD;
      Bravo Complex in the acupuncture service under the guidance of Dr. Roberto Sánchez Ahedo.&#xD;
      (Surgeon, Specialist in Family Medicine. Training in acupuncture in different institutions.&#xD;
      Master in Medical Education, Doctorate in Education, Professor of various courses in&#xD;
      acupuncture from a medical perspective. Academic of the Faculty of Medicine of UNAM.) It will&#xD;
      be completed the training process for the application of electrostimulation therapies based&#xD;
      on the WHO Guidelines established in the Official Mexican NOM-172-SSA1-1998, which specifies&#xD;
      the operating criteria for the practice of human acupuncture and related methods&#xD;
      (electrostimulation therapies). The Standard governs that the training of a Physician or&#xD;
      Health Personnel to fully exercise these therapies requires training of at least 350 academic&#xD;
      hours. For this reason, the principal investigator will complete during this stage the&#xD;
      theoretical, practical and clinical preparation course taught by the UNAM Faculty of Medicine&#xD;
      &quot;Diploma in Complementary Medicine and Acupuncture&quot; with a total of 450 academic hours&#xD;
      lasting one year (August 2019-February 2021), to comply with the training guidelines and&#xD;
      basic training for the application of electrostimulation therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For transcutaneous electrostimulation therapy, Kendall® MediTrace 100 conductive adhesive ECG&#xD;
      electrodes (pediatric) with a diameter of 2.4 cm, and portable electro-stimulator equipment&#xD;
      KWD-808 (professional equipment for electroacupuncture and rehabilitation) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be positioned in the dental chair, the superficial area of the skin of the&#xD;
      masseter muscle will be cleaned with alcohol and cotton. Two Kendall® MediTrace 100&#xD;
      electrodes will be placed in each masseter muscle (right and left), considering the same&#xD;
      references that were used for the electrodes placed for the electromyographic recording; the&#xD;
      first electrode is placed at the origin of the masseter muscle or superficial area of the&#xD;
      mandibular condyle and the second at the insertion of the masseter muscle at the angle of the&#xD;
      mandible. After placing the electrodes, the KWD-808 electroacupuncture device will be&#xD;
      connected to the patient by means of two double alligator cables; the alligators will be&#xD;
      pressed to the metal head of each electrode: the positive pole (red color) will be connected&#xD;
      at the origin of the masseter muscle and the negative pole (black color) at the insertion of&#xD;
      the masseter muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before nerve stimulation, all patients will be informed of the perceived sensation, which in&#xD;
      some patients will range from imperceptible to barely noticeable or not very noticeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameters to be used will be: pulse duration until sensory activation and high&#xD;
      intensities, but with an established limit to prevent muscle contraction and that allows&#xD;
      maximum comfort for 20 minutes. Current will be transmitted with square or rectangular&#xD;
      waveform, the stimulation frequency: two frequency bands (low: 210Hz and high 10140Hz.); wave&#xD;
      amplitude: 3050 volts, pulse duration: 40100 msec; and the output intensity: 0.70 (for&#xD;
      100Hz). The treatment time will be 20 minutes; the equipment has the quality of timing itself&#xD;
      and after time it will stop transmitting a signal to the patient. The treatment will consist&#xD;
      of the application of six consecutive therapies programs weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transcutaneous electrostimulation therapy will be carried out by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator, who will be trained in the ISSSTE Clínica de Especialidades Oriente Leonardo&#xD;
      Bravo Complex in the acupuncture service under the guidance of Dr. Roberto Sánchez Ahedo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterile steel acupuncture needles of 0.25x13mm, disposable AcuBEST brand (FDA 510K), and&#xD;
      portable electrostimulator equipment KWD-808 (professional equipment for electroacupuncture&#xD;
      and rehabilitation) will be used for percutaneous electrostimulation therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the placement of therapy, the superficial area of the skin of the masseter muscle&#xD;
      will be cleaned with alcohol and cotton. The puncture technique will be carried out by taking&#xD;
      the needle through the body (not by the handle), the lower part is held between the thumb and&#xD;
      index finger of the right hand, allowing the tip of the needle to pass. Directing the needle&#xD;
      to the acupuncture point to insert it quickly (penetrating 5 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two needles will be placed in the right masseter muscle and two in the left masseter muscle,&#xD;
      each one at the reference trigger points (local TMD points), following the &quot;Practical&#xD;
      recommendations for the treatment of Temporomandibular Disorders&quot;; the area to be punctured&#xD;
      is the origin of the masseter muscle or superficial area of the mandibular condyle anterior&#xD;
      to the atrial tragus approximately 1cm away (proximal acupuncture points: Gb3, Si 19, Gb 2,&#xD;
      St 7), insertion of the masseter muscle at the angle of the mandible (Proximal acupuncture&#xD;
      points: St6, St5). For this study, distal stitches will not be placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placing the needles, the KWD-808 electroacupuncture device will be connected to the&#xD;
      patient; The two double alligator cables will be connected to each patient by means of the&#xD;
      alligators that will directly press the head of the needles. The positive pole (red color)&#xD;
      will be connected at the origin of the masseter muscle and the negative pole (black color)&#xD;
      will be placed at the insertion of the masseter muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before nerve stimulation, all patients will be informed of the perceived sensation, which in&#xD;
      some patients will range from imperceptible to barely noticeable or not very noticeable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be carried out every week with a total of six continuous therapies or if&#xD;
      the patient deserves it until the remission of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment phase of the sample will be carried out by evaluating the patients, the TMD&#xD;
      diagnostic process and the evaluation of inclusion criteria that attend the Physiology&#xD;
      Laboratory of DEPeI UNAM during the period from August to December 2020. The randomization&#xD;
      will be carried out of patients recruited during this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical methodology for the application of the therapies Transcutaneous electrical nerve&#xD;
      stimulation and Percutaneous Neuromodulation Therapy will be carried out based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OFFICIAL MEXICAN STANDARD NOM-017-SSA3-2012. Regulation of health services for the&#xD;
           practice of human acupuncture and related methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Official Mexican STANDARD NOM-197-SSA1-2000. That establishes the minimum infrastructure&#xD;
           and equipment requirements for hospitals and specialized medical care offices.&#xD;
