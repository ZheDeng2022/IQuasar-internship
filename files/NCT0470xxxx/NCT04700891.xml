  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this research project is to evaluate whether olfactory identification impairment&#xD;
      is a reliable predictor of preoperative frailty and of postoperative complications and&#xD;
      mortality in a population of older patients scheduled for elective surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will measure preoperative olfactory identification function and&#xD;
           evaluate whether olfactory impairment predicts frailty, using the Edmonton Frail Scale&#xD;
           and handgrip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will analyze whether preoperative olfactory impairment predicts&#xD;
           postoperative complications and mortality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Olfactory impairment increases with age, affecting more than 50% of the population aged&#xD;
      between 65 and 80 years old. Recently, many studies have demonstrated a strong association&#xD;
      between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk. At the moment, the underlying&#xD;
      physiopathology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative&#xD;
      mechanisms are suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among them, accelerated physiological brain aging seems to be involved, making olfactory&#xD;
      decline a possible marker of frailty. To date, only a few studies (mostly using subjective&#xD;
      olfactory assessment) investigated the potential relationship between olfactory impairment&#xD;
      and frailty. Surgery, and more broadly the perioperative period, remains a major source of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Meanwhile, the average age of the surgical population continues to&#xD;
      rise, making preoperative risk assessment an essential step in order to detect the most&#xD;
      vulnerable patients. Yet, it is well-known that frailty is associated with worse&#xD;
      perioperative outcome. The first objective of this research project is thus to evaluate&#xD;
      olfactory identification function of preoperative older surgical patients in light of an&#xD;
      assessment of their frailty status. Frailty will be tested with the Edmonton Frail Scale and&#xD;
      handgrip strength, which are both validated tools. The second objective is to correlate&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity and mortality with preoperative olfactory function. Hopefully, this&#xD;
      research project will address the misunderstood link between olfactory impairment and&#xD;
      mortality, focusing on frailty assessment and using surgery as a heavy stressor for the older&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

    <description>Burghart Sniffin' Sticks &quot;Screening 12 Test&quot; Olfactory function will be evaluated through the Sniffin' Sticks test which is a validated psychophysical testing method. Sniffin' Sticks test is based on pen-like odor dispensing devices that will be presented to the patients. The short version of this test will be used and will consist solely of a test of odor identification function.</description>

    <description>The Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) involves nine domains of frailty : functional performance, cognitive function, general health, functional independence, social support, used medications, nutrition, mood and continence. It has been validated with respect to comprehensive geriatric assessment and to other screening tools related to frail state. EFS test is considered most appropriate for use in routine preoperative screening and only requires 5 minutes.</description>

    <description>Handgrip strength is a simple and reliable measurement technique for the assessment of maximal voluntary hand force. Handgrip strength is used as a reflect of nutritional status and muscle mass, physical function and health status. Measurement will be realized using a digital handgrip dynamometer. Patients will be asked to grip the dynamometer with the second finger node at 90° angle to the handle and to grab the handle as strongly as they can. Maximal grip strength will be checked with the forearm away from the body in standing position.</description>
