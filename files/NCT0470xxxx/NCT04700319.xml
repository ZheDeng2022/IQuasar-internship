  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical study of CD19 / CD20 CAR-T cell infusion in the treatment of relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory hematological malignancies in CD19 / CD20 positive B cell lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of autologous chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor T cell infusion targeting CD19/CD20 in the treatment of relapsed or refractory CD19&#xD;
      / CD20 positive B cell line hematological malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD19 and CD20 are two proteins expressed in normal B cells and various B cell-derived&#xD;
      hematological malignancies, including non Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), acute lymphoblastic&#xD;
      leukemia (all) and chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL). CD19 and CD20 are restricted to the&#xD;
      surface of B cells. They are not expressed in hematopoietic stem cells, nor in other tissue&#xD;
      cells. They exist in all stages of B cell development and differentiation. They are not lost&#xD;
      from the cell surface until B cells differentiate into plasma cells. Clinical studies have&#xD;
      found that CD19 and CD20 are excellent targets for immunotherapy of B-cell malignancies.The&#xD;
      purpose of this study was to observe the efficacy and safety of treatment for patients with&#xD;
      relapsed or refractory CD19 / CD20 positive B cell line hematological malignancies.&#xD;
