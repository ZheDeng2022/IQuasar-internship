      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of progesterone levels on pregnancy&#xD;
      occurrence on the 3rd and 5th days after insemination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins is a frequently used method in patients with&#xD;
      unexplained infertility undergoing intrauterine insemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy and live birth rates after ovarian stimulation; The number of follicles in&#xD;
      ovulatory size and responsive to ovarian stimulation is affected by many factors such as the&#xD;
      age of the woman and the duration of infertility. Progesterone production in the luteal phase&#xD;
      is necessary to achieve successful treatment results by increasing the receptivity of the&#xD;
      endometrium in the secretory phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In assisted reproductive techniques, exogenous progesterone support in the luteal phase is a&#xD;
      routinely used method due to higher pregnancy rates, but there is no consensus with the use&#xD;
      of progesterone in IUI applications. In a recent meta-analysis, a positive relationship was&#xD;
      found between gonadotropins and progesterone support when ovulation induction and&#xD;
      intrauterine insemination were performed, while this relationship was not found with&#xD;
      clomiphene citrate, and although letrozole and gonadotropin were used together, no&#xD;
      significant statistics were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between luteal phase hormone dynamics and pregnancy outcomes in IUI is not&#xD;
      fully understood. Although luteal phase failure is mentioned, there is no accepted definition&#xD;
      of luteal phase failure worldwide. In one study, progesterone concentrations in the midluteal&#xD;
      phase and pregnancy outcomes were investigated in 188 IUI cycles, predicting that low levels&#xD;
      could predict treatment failure. In another study, a positive relationship was found between&#xD;
      luteal phase progesterone levels and clinical pregnancy outcomes.However, the relationship&#xD;
      between blood progesterone levels and pregnancy rates in a small number of IUI cycles has&#xD;
      been investigated in the literature. Considering all these studies, there is no Level 1&#xD;
      evidence regarding the benefit of providing progesterone support in groups where the&#xD;
      progesterone level is below a certain threshold value. In this study, we aimed to investigate&#xD;
      the relationship between gestational outcomes by looking at progesterone values on the 3rd&#xD;
      and 5th days after IUI in patients who were decided to be treated with IUI. By looking at&#xD;
      these progesterone levels, we aimed to determine a threshold value for the ideal level of&#xD;
      progesterone in the luteal phase and to be a guide in terms of possible results and methods&#xD;
      of shaping the treatment.&#xD;
