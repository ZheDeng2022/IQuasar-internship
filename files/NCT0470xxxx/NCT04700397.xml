  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyperemia with adenosine was an elemental process in FFR examination. Adenosine injection&#xD;
      will induce some discomfort, and increase cost expenditure. Nitroglycerine will induce an&#xD;
      acute drop of Pd/Pa, and this lowest Pd/Pa was determined as NTG-Pd/Pa. NTG-Pd/Pa has a&#xD;
      linear relationship with FFR value and has a good diagnostic accuracy to predict FFR≤0.80 in&#xD;
      our recent study. There is only one prospective study report on the relationship between&#xD;
      NTG-Pd/Pa and FFR. In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety of NTG-Pd/Pa, the&#xD;
      repeatability and dose-response of this novel index. Furthermore, we will investigate the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of NTG-Pd/Pa, with FFR≤0.8 and Resting full-cycle ratio≤0.89 as ischemic&#xD;
      threshold respectively.&#xD;

      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is defined as the ratio of mean distal pressure (distal to the&#xD;
      target lesion, Pd）to mean proximal pressure (aortic pressure, Pa) in the coronary&#xD;
      artery(Pd/Pa) while the maximal hyperemic flow is achieved. Nowadays, FFR-guided PCI is&#xD;
      highly recommended for the assessment of physiologic ischemia in intermediate coronary&#xD;
      lesions. However, hyperemia with adenosine was an elemental process in FFR examination.&#xD;
      Adenosine injection will induce some discomfort, and increase cost expenditure. Based on the&#xD;
      clinical and physiologic outcome study, a lot of non-hyperemic indexes had been proposed, and&#xD;
      adenosine injection could be waived. Whereas, these novel physiologic indexes are limited to&#xD;
      the proprietary software of each vendor, curtailing clinical application. Intracoronary&#xD;
      nitroglycerin injection was needed before each FFR assessment. Nitroglycerine will induce an&#xD;
      acute drop of Pd/Pa, and this lowest Pd/Pa was determined as NTG-Pd/Pa. NTG-Pd/Pa has a&#xD;
      linear relationship with FFR value and has a good diagnostic accuracy to predict FFR≤0.80 in&#xD;
      our recent study. There is only one prospective study report on the relationship between&#xD;
      NTG-Pd/Pa and FFR. In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety of NTG-Pd/Pa, the&#xD;
      repeatability and dose-response of this novel index. Furthermore, we will investigate the&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy of NTG-Pd/Pa, with FFR≤0.8 and Resting full-cycle ratio≤0.89 as ischemic&#xD;
      threshold respectively.&#xD;
