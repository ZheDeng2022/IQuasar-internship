    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with the overarching aim of testing the&#xD;
      influence of reducing electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) use or nicotine on addiction&#xD;
      and combustible cigarette (CC) smoking among dual users. Specifically, the investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a 4-week pilot RCT in which dual users who are not motivated to quit either product&#xD;
      in the near future are randomized to A) abruptly switch to low nicotine ENDS pods, B)&#xD;
      abruptly reduce number of usual nicotine ENDS pods, or C) use ENDS as usual (control). The&#xD;
      investigators adapted a protocol used in a prior study to assign participants to switch to&#xD;
      ENDS pods with less nicotine or reduce number of ENDS pods in this trial. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will provide all participants with ENDS pods during the study period and&#xD;
      instruct them to only use ENDS provided by the study. Participants in reduced nicotine&#xD;
      condition will switch from usual nicotine (5% JUUL) to low nicotine ENDS (3% nicotine JUUL)&#xD;
      pods. Participants in the reduced use condition will continue to use usual nicotine ENDS (5%&#xD;
      nicotine JUUL) pods but reduce use to 60% of their baseline number of pods per week.&#xD;
      Participants in the control condition will use usual nicotine ENDS (5% nicotine JUUL) pods as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Use of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS) has increased substantially in&#xD;
      the past decade, and nearly 70% of ENDS users also smoke cigarettes (i.e., dual users). There&#xD;
      is evidence that ENDS can be used as an effective smoking cessation aid. However, most dual&#xD;
      users use ENDS intermittently, which does not appear to promote smoking cessation. ENDS use&#xD;
      appears to be associated with increased overall nicotine addiction in some dual users and&#xD;
      could perpetuate or increase combustible cigarette (CC) smoking. These concerns have&#xD;
      contributed to policy changes to restrict ENDS use. For example the FDA's Center for Tobacco&#xD;
      Products finalized a rule to regulate ENDS and could reduce the amount of nicotine in ENDS.&#xD;
      Further, some states have begun to restrict access to ENDS. Market restrictions, FDA warning&#xD;
      labels, and public education messaging have the potential to reduce ENDS consumption. Little&#xD;
      is known, however, regarding the mechanisms of change in ENDS use that could affect nicotine&#xD;
      addiction and CC smoking in dual users. Thus, the investigators are conducting a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test how change in ENDS nicotine (i.e. pharmacology) and&#xD;
      change in frequency of ENDS use (i.e., behavior) affects nicotine addiction and CC smoking&#xD;
      among dual users. Findings will inform understanding of how change in ENDS use contributes to&#xD;
      nicotine addiction and how regulation that results in reduced nicotine consumption from ENDS&#xD;
      could affect tobacco use among dual users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both pharmacological and behavioral factors contribute to nicotine dependence and thus could&#xD;
      be mechanisms by which change in ENDS affects addiction among dual users. Prior research&#xD;
      identified that switching to low nicotine CCs (i.e., change in pharmacology) and reduction in&#xD;
      number of CCs (i.e., change in behavior) independently reduced nicotine dependence and demand&#xD;
      for cigarettes within-participants over time. Similarly, observational data indicate that&#xD;
      self-selected use of lower nicotine content ENDS (i.e., pharmacology) and less frequent&#xD;
      vaping (i.e., behavior) appear to be associated with lower overall nicotine dependence among&#xD;
      dual users. However, there is a lack of experimental research on whether change in ENDS&#xD;
      nicotine content or frequency of use affects overall nicotine dependence among dual users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: To assess the feasibility of abruptly switching to low nicotine ENDS pods or&#xD;
      abruptly reducing number of ENDS pods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To assess the influence of switching to reduced nicotine ENDS compared to ENDS use as&#xD;
      usual on CC smoking and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess the influence of reducing number of usual nicotine ENDS pods compared to&#xD;
      ENDS use as usual on CC smoking and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 4: To assess the influence of switching to reduced nicotine ENDS pods compared&#xD;
      to reducing number of usual nicotine ENDS pods on CC smoking and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology The procedures are based on a methodology demonstrated to be feasible in a prior&#xD;
      research. Potential participants who screen eligible will complete a videoconference call&#xD;
      with study personnel to 1) display their photo ID to confirm their identity, 2) display their&#xD;
      Juul device to confirm that they use Juul products, and 3) review the consent form.&#xD;
      Participants will provide written consent using the REDCap e-consent procedure. Consenting&#xD;
      participants will answer brief nightly questionnaires about the amount they smoke CCs and use&#xD;
      JUUL during a baseline week (week 0). During the baseline week (week 0) research personnel&#xD;
      will mail participants a personal iCO Smokerlyzer (https://www.covita.net/ico-overview/) for&#xD;
      remote breath carbon monoxide (CO) measurement. Research personnel will also mail a pregnancy&#xD;
      test to all female participants of reproductive potential (see Inclusion/Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      section below). At the end of the baseline week (week 0), participants will be emailed a link&#xD;
      to a REDCap survey to answer demographic and tobacco-related baseline questionnaires, to&#xD;
      report their breath CO level using their personal iCO Smokerlyzer, and, for women of&#xD;
      reproductive potential, to report the results of their pregnancy test. Women who are pregnant&#xD;
      or plan to become pregnant will not be eligible to participate in this study and will be&#xD;
      removed from this study if they become pregnant. At the end of the baseline (week 0) REDCap&#xD;
      survey, participants will be randomly assigned to A) abruptly switch to low nicotine ENDS&#xD;
      pods, B) abruptly reduce number of usual nicotine ENDS pods per week, or C) use ENDS as&#xD;
      usual. After completing the baseline REDCap survey, participants will be mailed their study&#xD;
      JUUL pods according to their condition. All participants will continue to complete brief&#xD;
      nightly questionnaires throughout the remaining 4-week study period. In addition,&#xD;
      participants will provide breath CO samples remotely using a personal iCO Smokerlyzer&#xD;
      provided by the study and complete tobacco related questionnaires remotely via REDCap at the&#xD;
      end of each week throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use their own JUUL products during baseline (week 0) and will be instructed&#xD;
      to only use JUUL products provided by the study throughout weeks 1 through 4. In order to&#xD;
      increase the validity of participants' self-reported adherence to study ENDS products (i.e.,&#xD;
      feasibility), the investigators will inform participants that self-reported noncompliance&#xD;
      will not influence their payment or future participation. At the end of week 0, the&#xD;
      investigators will provide participants with 4-week supplies of JUUL pods based on their&#xD;
      assigned condition and the number of pods they used during baseline (i.e. week 0) via mail.&#xD;
      The investigators will provide participants who are randomized to switch to low nicotine ENDS&#xD;
      with 100% of the number of JUUL pods/week used during the baseline week, but all JUUL pods&#xD;
      provided will have a nicotine content reduced to 60% of baseline (i.e., 3% nicotine JUUL&#xD;
      pods). The investigators will provide participants who are randomized to reduce number of&#xD;
      ENDS with approximately 60% of the number of JUUL pods/week used during the baseline week,&#xD;
      and all JUUL pods provided will have the regular nicotine content (i.e., 5% nicotine JUUL&#xD;
      pods). The investigators chose to reduce participants' number of JUUL pods to approximately&#xD;
      60% of baseline to match the 60% reduction in nicotine in the group assigned to switch from&#xD;
      usual (5%) to low (3%) nicotine JUUL pods. In addition, a similar magnitude of cigarette&#xD;
      reduction was feasible in a prior trial. Finally, participants randomized to use ENDS as&#xD;
      usual (control condition) will be provided with 100% of their baseline number of JUUL&#xD;
      pods/week containing regular nicotine content (5%). Participants in all conditions will have&#xD;
      the option to choose their preferred flavor of JUUL pods among the flavors sold legally in&#xD;
      Vermont when they are participating. The investigators will clearly and explicitly state that&#xD;
      they are not requiring participants to change CC smoking. Given the potential for&#xD;
      compensatory CC smoking during the study period, the study will have a data and safety&#xD;
      monitoring board (DSMB) review the study procedures and monitor participants' safety as&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of week 4 the investigators will provide all participants with advice to quit all&#xD;
      tobacco products. They will also provide all participants a referral to the national quitline&#xD;
      for information on the benefits of quitting tobacco. In addition they will offer to mail a&#xD;
      one-month supply of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) to participants who confirm they have&#xD;
      no contraindications for NRT to help them quit. Thus participants interested in NRT will&#xD;
      complete a brief screener via REDCap at the end of week 4. Participants who endorse a) Recent&#xD;
      heart attack (in last month), b) Heart disease that is untreated, c) Arrhythmia or irregular&#xD;
      heartbeat, d) High blood pressure not controlled by medications, e) An allergy to adhesive&#xD;
      tape, f) Skin problems that require treatment, or g) Stomach ulcer or diabetes will receive a&#xD;
      referral to the quitline but will not be eligible for NRT. The investigators will not provide&#xD;
      any participants with ENDS products after week 4 of the study period. Finally, all&#xD;
      participants will complete a web-based follow-up survey and provide a breath CO sample 4&#xD;
      weeks after study completion (i.e., 8 weeks after randomization) to assess tobacco use, ENDS&#xD;
      use, quit attempts, and behavioral economic measures.&#xD;
