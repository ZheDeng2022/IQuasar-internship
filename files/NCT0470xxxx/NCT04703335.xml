  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A sufficient number of subjects will be entered into testing to complete 42 subjects per each&#xD;
      of the 2 test and 2 control configurations. A total of 84 subjects, testing bi-laterally (168&#xD;
      abdomen and groin sites in total completed, 42 abdomen and groin sites per each test and&#xD;
      control material) will be evaluated using the standardized ASTM E1173 test method. Following&#xD;
      a 14-day restriction period, subjects will be sampled for baseline, 10 minutes, 6 hours, and&#xD;
      24 hours post application (subjects will not be sequestered) for microbial reduction&#xD;
      evaluations. Test day baseline criteria will be set at: abdomen: ≥ 3.0 log10 CFU/cm2, and&#xD;
      groin: ≥ 5.0 log10 CFU/cm2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At least 84 subjects will be treated bilaterally with two of the four test materials (Test&#xD;
      Product #1, Test Product #2, Positive Control, and Negative Control), one per each side of&#xD;
      the abdomen and inguinal test sites. Subjects will be required to complete a 14-day pretest&#xD;
      conditioning period. Subjects will complete a 2-day test period, during which time subjects'&#xD;
      sites will be treated with the test materials and samples taken following treatment. The&#xD;
      Cylinder Sampling Technique will be performed for baseline and for sampling 10-minutes,&#xD;
      6-hours, and 24-hours post-test material-application on Test Days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness criteria are that the log10 recoveries of the two test products (1% and&#xD;
      1.5%) are non-inferior to the Positive Control (2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate) with a 0.5&#xD;
      margin (log10 scale) per square centimeter on the abdominal and inguinal sites within 10&#xD;
      minutes after drying. The determination of non-inferiority will be based on the upper bounds&#xD;
      of the 95% confidence interval being equal to or less than 0.5. Superiority will not be&#xD;
      evaluated in this study.&#xD;

    <description>A primary efficacy variable for this study is the immediate antimicrobial effect at 10-minutes post-application of the change on measurement of two-test products against a positive control on the skin flora. The effectiveness criteria are that the log10 recoveries of the two test products (1% and 1.5%) are non-inferior to the Positive Control (2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate) with a 0.5 margin (log10 scale) per square centimeter on the abdominal and inguinal sites within 10 minutes after drying. The determination of non-inferiority will be based on a log10 multiple linear regression model. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is the mean difference of the test and the positive control products used in performing a non-inferiority statistic.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistence of Antimicrobial Effect</measure>
    <time_frame>6-hours</time_frame>
    <description>The log10 recoveries of the change in baseline measurements on skin flora by two test products (1% and 1.5%) must show to be superior to the Negative Control with a 1.2 margin (log10 scale) per square centimeter on the abdominal and inguinal sites within 10 minutes after drying. The determination of superiority will be based on a log10 multiple linear regression model. The Average Treatment Effect (ATE) is the mean difference of the test and the negative control products used in performing a superiority statistic.&#xD;
To demonstrate persistence for the test materials, the 6-hour post-treatment measurement should be lower than or equal to the baseline measurement for 100 percent of the subjects on the abdominal and inguinal sites.</description>
