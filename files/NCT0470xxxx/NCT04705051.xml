      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;

                  EFC15392 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. measured at Screening visit for participant enrolled in the LTS15823 study not&#xD;
                  concomitantly to the Visit 12 (Month 24; end-of treatment visit) of the EFC15392&#xD;
                  study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraceptive use by men and women should be consistent with local regulations&#xD;

                  usual lifestyle or to use double contraceptive methods (including a highly&#xD;
                  effective method of contraception) for the entire duration of the study and for&#xD;
                  at least 6 weeks following their last dose of IMP.&#xD;

             Screening visit (Visit 0) in the LTS15823 study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has a new clinically significant, uncontrolled medical condition that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk through&#xD;
             participation, or which would affect the efficacy or safety analysis if the condition&#xD;
             exacerbated during the study, or that may significantly interfere with study&#xD;
             compliance, including all prescribed evaluations and follow-up activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A history of drug abuse and/or alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence during the lag&#xD;
             phase between the end of the EFC15392 study and Screening visit (Visit 0) in the&#xD;
             LTS15823 study when applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of tolvaptan or other polycystic kidney disease-modifying agents&#xD;

             administration).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in another investigational interventional study or use of IMP, within 3&#xD;
             months or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before the Baseline visit (Visit 1)&#xD;

             bilirubin fraction.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;

             visit of the EFC15392 study) or at Visit 0 (for participants enrolled in the LTS15823&#xD;
             study after the end-of-treatment visit of the EFC15392 study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sensitivity to any of the study interventions, or components thereof, or drug or other&#xD;
             allergy that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates participation in the&#xD;
