  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining the effectiveness of pembrolizumab plus cryoablation on&#xD;
      people with urothelial carcinoma, including bladder cancer, that has spread.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label Phase 2, single-arm, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to&#xD;
      study the combination of pembrolizumab and cryoablation on people with urothelial carcinoma,&#xD;
      including bladder cancer, that has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved both cryoablation and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      as a treatment option for urothelial carcinoma, including bladder cancer, that has spread.&#xD;
      However, the FDA has not yet approved the combination of the drug, pembrolizumab, and&#xD;
      intervention, cryoablation, for urothelial carcinoma, including bladder cancer, that has&#xD;
      spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is believed to work by binding to a chemical called PD-1 that is found on a&#xD;
      special type of white blood cell in your body. This may help your body to be better at&#xD;
      finding and destroying tumor cells. Cryoablation is an intervention which may kill cancer&#xD;
      cells using extreme cold. It may help the immune system better recognize tumors and act&#xD;
      against it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment as long as their disease does not get worse or they&#xD;
      do not have any unacceptable side effects for up to two years. Participants will be followed&#xD;
      for up to 2 years after ending the study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biocompatibles UK Ltd, a device company under Boston Scientific, is supporting this research&#xD;
      study by providing funding for the needles used in the study intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will be given 200 mg pembrolizumab intravenously once every 3 weeks. This will continue for up to 2 years as per standard of care. Participants will receive cryoablation between the 1st and 2nd doses of pembrolizumab. Cryoablation consists of using a CT scan to guide one or more thin needles to the tumor through your skin, where extreme cold is applied.</description>
