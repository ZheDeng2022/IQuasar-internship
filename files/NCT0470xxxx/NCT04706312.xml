  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Diminished ovarian response (DOR）have a poor in vitro fertilization（IVF）&#xD;
      outcome, and is considered one of most challenging tasks in artificial reproductive treatment&#xD;
      (ART). Stem cell therapies are rapidly progressing fields and have shown promise in treatment&#xD;
      of lots of disease, including aging and premature ovarian failure. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to determine the safety and efficacy of intra vein injection of human Amniotic Mesenchymal&#xD;
      Stem Cells(hAMSCs) in women suffered from infertility caused by DOR.&#xD;

      Patients with Diminished ovarian response (DOR）have a poor in vitro fertilization（IVF）&#xD;
      outcome, and is considered one of most challenging tasks in artificial reproductive treatment&#xD;
      (ART). Stem cell therapies are rapidly progressing fields and have shown immense promise in&#xD;
      the treatment of lots of disease, including aging and premature ovarian failure. The purpose&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of intra vein injection of human&#xD;
      amniotic mesenchymal stem cells(hAMSCs) in women suffered from infertility caused by DOR. The&#xD;
      hAMSCs were isolated and cultured in vitro and qualified by National Institutes for Food and&#xD;
      Drug Control, China. The serum of each patient was kept and sent for laboratory test before&#xD;
      the transplantation. The biomarkers of hAMSCs were detected again before transplantation. The&#xD;
      hAMSCs were transplanted via venous in the dorsum of hand. The outcomes of patients were&#xD;
      examined during and after the injection. The patients are monitored for hormones, follicles&#xD;
      stimulated with minimal stimulation, number of oocyte retrieval and embryos In Vitro&#xD;
      Fertilization (IVF).&#xD;
