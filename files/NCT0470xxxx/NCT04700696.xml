  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Enhancing Permanency in Children and Families (EPIC) program is a collaborative effort&#xD;
      between the Ohio State University College of Social Work, two county offices of the Ohio&#xD;
      Department of Job and Family Services, two juvenile courts and local behavioral health&#xD;
      agencies. The goal of EPIC is to use three evidence-based and evidence-informed practices to&#xD;
      reduce abusive and neglectful parenting, reduce addiction severity in parents, and improve&#xD;
      permanency outcomes for families involved with the child welfare system due to substance&#xD;
      abuse.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Funded by the federal Regional Partnership Grant (RPG) Program, the Enhancing Permanency in&#xD;
      Children and Families (EPIC) is a partnership between child welfare, juvenile count and&#xD;
      behavioral health to holistically address substance misuse and associated parenting needs of&#xD;
      child welfare-involved families. The overall goals and objectives of the intervention are to&#xD;
      1) Increase timely access to services among substances abusing parents involved in the child&#xD;
      welfare system in Fairfield and Pickaway counties, 2.Enhance child safety and improve&#xD;
      permanency and 3. increase child, parent, and caregiver well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are matched with peer recovery supporters who mentor parents through&#xD;
      the process. Parents are also referred to Family Treatment Drug Court (FTDC) with the option&#xD;
      to receive Medications for Opioid Use Disorders (MOUD), and lastly when children are placed&#xD;
      at home with parents or with kinship caregivers, relational skill building services that&#xD;
      include financial assistance for child care, respite and transportation services. EPIC&#xD;
      participants receive substance abuse and behavioral health treatment services through local&#xD;
      providers including from two partner agencies: Integrated Services for Behavioral Health and&#xD;
      Ohio Guidestone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Participating parents complete a pretest at baseline and up to 5 post-tests&#xD;
      at 6 month intervals. Parents complete questions related to themselves (e.g. Addiction&#xD;
      Severity Index, CES-D) and for one focal child (e.g. CBCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate EPIC, a quasi-experimental design will be employed through a two-stage sampling&#xD;
      procedure. This design provides the ability to assess (1) the effects of EPIC on access to&#xD;
      services for the families in the two intervention counties, and (2) the independent effects&#xD;
      of additional services provided under EPIC that may be over and above Ohio START (an&#xD;
      intervention administered through the Public Children Services Association of Ohio) and&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU). In the first stage, two comparison counties will be identified for&#xD;
      each of the two intervention counties. One comparison county will be part of the Ohio START&#xD;
      program while the second will be a county that has no major interventions to address&#xD;
      substance use among child welfare families. Counties are matched based on child population&#xD;
      size, rate of child protective services referrals, percent of naloxone administrations per&#xD;
      adult population, percent white, percent poverty, child welfare tax levy, and to the extent&#xD;
      possible, behavioral health service availability. During the second stage, EPIC families are&#xD;
      matched with substance using families in each of the comparison counties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents may consent to one or all three components of EPIC based on the specific needs of&#xD;
      each family, however all parents receive intensive case management services, including&#xD;
      frequent home visits from caseworkers and peer recovery supporters.&#xD;

    <measure>Change length of stay in out-of-home placement for children in EPIC program compared to substance-affected families not receiving EPIC.</measure>
    <time_frame>Through program completion, an average of 1 year.</time_frame>
    <description>Data source: Statewide Automated Child Welfare Information System (SACWIS), obtained twice a year through study completion.&#xD;
Measures: Length of stay in out-of-home placement will be operationalized using placement dates obtained in SACWIS.&#xD;
Analyses: Survival analysis will be utilized to study outcome measures (e.g., length of stay in out-of-home placement) Due to the likelihood of censored measures when we have families who are still involved in the child welfare system, particularly for families who enter the system near the end of the study period, we will use survival analysis to estimate treatment effects on length of stay in out of home placement in comparison to Ohio START and treatment as usual families.</description>

    <ipd_description>Datasets will be be stripped of identifying information prior to construction. Specifically, parents (along with one focal child) will be identified with a case and individual identification numbers. No names, addresses, telephone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, child welfare records, etc. will be retained. We will only share data with external investigators when a data use agreement (DUA) is executed between the Ohio State University and the requester's institution. The DUA will specify the requested data elements (each of which must be justified), the specific research question and the timeline for the project. These data will be made available in Fall, 2023 by the PI.</ipd_description>
