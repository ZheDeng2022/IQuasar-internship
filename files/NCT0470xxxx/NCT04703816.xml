      To determine whether the implementation of a multifaceted training program relying on the&#xD;
      conceptual framework of the Four Habits Model improved the communication and interpersonal&#xD;
      skills for hospital physicians during consultations compared with control physicians&#xD;
      receiving no intervention, the investigators will conduct a prospective randomized,&#xD;
      controlled, open-label, two parallel arms, superiority interventional trial. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization is the physician.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale: Interpersonal skills, encompassing communication and empathy, are key components&#xD;
      of effective medical consultations and represent physician core competences that are most&#xD;
      desired by patients. High-quality communication relates with enhanced patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      greater adherence to treatment, better health outcomes, and decreased risk of malpractice&#xD;
      claims. Many organizations have therefore implemented structured training programs to improve&#xD;
      physician communication skills in North America and Europe. Yet limited evidence exists on&#xD;
      the effectiveness of these programs in improving physician interpersonal skillsMost studies&#xD;
      used unvalidated instruments that may not accurately reflect interpersonal skills, were&#xD;
      underpowered to detect clinically meaningful differences in interpersonal skills due to&#xD;
      relatively limited sample size, lacked a control group, or used a study design that was prone&#xD;
      to evaluation bias. In addition, few studies examined whether these training programs&#xD;
      dedicated to improve physician communication skills altered patient satisfaction therapeutic&#xD;
      alliance or modified physician self-efficacy and professional achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;Four Habits Model&quot; is a training program that has been developed within the US Health&#xD;
      Maintenance Organization Kaiser Permanente and implemented for teaching effective&#xD;
      communication to thousands of clinicians in this organization over the two last decades. The&#xD;
      Four Habits Model refers to basic medical interview tasks that are organized within four&#xD;
      dimensions, namely, Invest in the beginning, Elicit the patient's perspective, Demonstrate&#xD;
      empathy, and Invest in the end. Since its development, the Four Habits Model has been&#xD;
      successfully implemented outside the Kaiser Permanente system, in various settings in North&#xD;
      America and Western Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team recently carried out the cross-cultural adaptation of the Four Habits&#xD;
      Coding Scheme (4-HCS) scale into French. The 4-HCS is a standardized instrument designed to&#xD;
      assess physician communication skills from an external rater's perspective, relying on the&#xD;
      conceptual framework of the Four Habits Model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a multifaceted training program&#xD;
      based on the Four Habits Model improved physician interpersonal skills without altering&#xD;
      consultation duration, increased patient satisfaction and therapeutic alliance, and modified&#xD;
      physician self-efficacy and professional achievement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine whether the implementation of a multifaceted training program&#xD;
      relying on the conceptual framework of the Four Habits Model improved the communication and&#xD;
      interpersonal skills for hospital physicians during consultations compared with control&#xD;
      physicians receiving no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare study arms with regard to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mean duration of medical consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient satisfaction with the consultation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  therapeutic alliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For physicians:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4-HCS subscale scores&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Professional achievement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: Prospective, randomized (with a 1:1 allocation ratio), controlled, open-label,&#xD;
      two parallel arms, superiority interventional trial in one study site. The unit of&#xD;
      randomization is the physician. Randomization will be performed by minimization, taking into&#xD;
      account the status (attending versus non-attending) and specialty (medical versus surgical)&#xD;
      of the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-intervention trial period: The participating physicians will be invited to videotape&#xD;
           medical consultations with at least four consecutive patients (consenting to the&#xD;
           research) over a 3-month period. The video-recorded consultations will be independently&#xD;
           evaluated by two raters using the 4-HCS scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: Physicians will be randomly assigned to study arms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: Physicians in the intervention arm will receive the training program&#xD;
           consisting of two half-day group workshops with a review of the skills needed to build&#xD;
           effective patient relationships and a discussion of difficult consultations. Physicians&#xD;
           in the control group will not receive any specific intervention at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-intervention trial period: The participating physicians in the two study arms will&#xD;
           be invited to videotape medical consultations with at least four consecutive patients&#xD;
           (consenting to the research) over a 3-month period Personalized feedback will then be&#xD;
           given on the acquisition of skills of the physicians in the intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      224 consecutive patients included (112 per arm) nested within 28 physicians (14 per arm). A&#xD;
      sample of 56 patients included by 14 physicians in each arm would confer a power greater than&#xD;
      80% to show an average difference of 7.5 points in the 4-HCS score (alpha risk of 0.05 in&#xD;
      bilateral situations). Each arm of the trial will include 56 pre-intervention and 56&#xD;
      post-intervention patients, for a total of 224 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure allocation concealment, participating physicians will be randomized at the end of&#xD;
      the pre-intervention study period. A third party will generate allocation sequence, with a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio, using minimization stratified by physician specialty (i.e., medical versus&#xD;
      surgical) and attending status (i.e., attending physician versus non-attending physician).&#xD;
      The investigators will use the software RStudio with package Minirand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open label trial, the participating physicians will not be blinded to allocation.&#xD;
      Only the physicians who will rate video-recorded consultations and the statistician will be&#xD;
      blinded to study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed prior to database lock, reviewed by the&#xD;
      principal investigator and an independent statistician, and approved by the steering&#xD;
      committee. Any post-hoc or unplanned analyses not specified in the SAP will be clearly&#xD;
      identified as such in the final statistical report (FSR) and manuscripts for publication. No&#xD;
      formal interim analysis is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis populations A statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be developed prior to database&#xD;
      lock, reviewed by the principal investigator and an independent statistician, and approved by&#xD;
      the steering committee. Any post-hoc or unplanned analyses not specified in the SAP will be&#xD;
      clearly identified as such in the final statistical report (FSR) and manuscripts for&#xD;
      publication. No formal interim analysis is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis populations The intention-to-treat (ITT) population will consist of all observations&#xD;
      for participating physicians who have been randomized. Patients and physicians will be&#xD;
      analyzed in the study arm assigned by randomization. The per-protocol (PP) population will&#xD;
      consist of all observations for randomized physicians without any major deviation from the&#xD;
      protocol (non-compliance with the multifaceted training program) and evaluable. The numbers&#xD;
      of patients and physicians in ITT and PP populations will be presented by study arm&#xD;
      throughout a CONSORT-style flow-chart extension for cluster randomized trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics Baseline and demographic characteristics will be summarized for both&#xD;
      ITT and PP populations. Baseline patient and physician characteristics will be compared&#xD;
      between the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary outcome The primary outcome analysis (i.e., 4-HCS overall score) will&#xD;
      be conducted within the ITT population and, for sensitivity reason, repeated within the PP&#xD;
      population. For this purpose, the investigators will use a difference-in-differences&#xD;
      approach, with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. To account for patient clustering within&#xD;
      participating physicians, the investigators will analyze 4-HCS overall score using&#xD;
      random-intercept linear regression model for continuous dependent variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the secondary outcomes. The analysis of secondary outcomes will be exploratory in&#xD;
      nature. Inferential comparisons for participating physicians between study arms will be&#xD;
      performed using the Student t or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for unpaired data for continuous&#xD;
      outcome variables. To account for patient clustering within participating physicians, the&#xD;
      investigators will analyze secondary outcome measures using random-intercept linear&#xD;
      regression model for continuous dependent variable. All tests of secondary outcome analyses&#xD;
      will be performed on both ITT and PP populations at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analysis. No subgroup analysis is planned for the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures. Missing data. The completeness of study data will be reported for baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and outcome variables. The investigators will perform multivariate imputation&#xD;
      using chained equations (MICE) for replacing missing primary and secondary outcome values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators identified the American multidimensional Four Habits Coding Scheme (4-HCS)&#xD;
      scale, which produces a composite score of the quality of interpersonal skills that can be&#xD;
      used in initial or continuing education. No instrument for measuring interpersonal skills was&#xD;
      available in French. Therefore, the investigators proceeded with the cross-cultural&#xD;
      adaptation of this scale. The cross-cultural adaptation of this scale was used to evaluate&#xD;
      simulated filmed consultations of approximately 200 students from the Grenoble Faculty of&#xD;
      Medicine during the period 2017-2018. This experiment allowed for the verification of the&#xD;
      feasibility of the evaluation of interpersonal skills via this scale and made it possible to&#xD;
      constitute a sufficient sample of videos to validate the psychometric properties of the&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this tool can be used in initial or continuing education for the evaluation of&#xD;
      interpersonal skills and allows for the measurement of the progression of these skills within&#xD;
      the framework of an intervention aimed at improving them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interest of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention should increase the physician's skills in establishing a caregiver-patient&#xD;
      relationship and in managing difficult consultations, particularly those with high emotional&#xD;
      load, without significantly altering the duration of the consultation. The proposed trial&#xD;
      should document the effect of this intervention on specific patient (satisfaction,&#xD;
      therapeutic alliance) and clinician (professional fulfillment) outcomes.&#xD;
