    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized clinical trial was to compare the incidence, intensity and&#xD;
      duration of postoperative pain following the removal of root canal obturation materials&#xD;
      canals using rotary (ProTaper Universal or Hyflex EDM) or reciprocating file (Reciproc Blue&#xD;
      or WaveOne Gold) systems. The null hypothesis tested was that there is no difference in&#xD;
      postoperative pain following the retreatment procedure between the four systems used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain (PP) is not a certain reason for the long term success of root canal&#xD;
      treatment. However, PP control is important for patient comfort and satisfaction. Apical&#xD;
      extrusion of debris containing dentin, necrotic pulp tissue, microorganisms, and/or&#xD;
      irrigation solutions may occur during retreatment procedures which may result in the&#xD;
      induction of periapical inflammation, postoperative pain, and delayed periapical healing. All&#xD;
      available techniques and instruments are associated with apical extrusion of debris to some&#xD;
      degree during the root canal preparation or removal of the obturation materials. The aim of&#xD;
      this randomized clinical trial was to compare the incidence, intensity and duration of&#xD;
      postoperative pain following the removal of root canal obturation materials canals using&#xD;
      rotary or reciprocating file systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients referred for non-surgical endodontic retreatment were included. Hundred and eighty&#xD;
      cases were selected on the basis of the determined inclusion criteria and randomly allocated&#xD;
      to four groups (n = 45).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProTaper Universal group D1, D2 and D3 files were used respectively with a full rotational&#xD;
      motion with a endodontic motor until working was reached as recommended by the manufacturer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hylex EDM group Hylex EDM files were used with a full rotational motion with a endodontic&#xD;
      motor until the working was reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reciproc Blue group R25 files were used with a reciprocating motion using with the &quot;RECIPROC&#xD;
      ALL&quot; mode with a slow in-and-out pecking motion, and the amplitude of pecking movements did&#xD;
      not exceed 3 mm until the working lenght was reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Waveone Gold group Primary files were used with a reciprocating motion using with the&#xD;
      &quot;WAVEONE ALL&quot; mode with a slow in-and-out pecking motion, and the amplitude of pecking&#xD;
      movements did not exceed 3 mm until the working was reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of postoperative pain Before participation, all patients had read and signed an&#xD;
      informed consent form., all patients were given a pain report form on which they would report&#xD;
      their preoperative level of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before beginning of treatment, the clinician filled in an example of pain report with each&#xD;
      patient to confirm that they understood the instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The degree of the postoperative pain was measured using an 11-level numeric rating scale&#xD;
      (NRS) at 24, 48, and 72 h following the retreatment. The NRS is a segmented numeric version&#xD;
      of the visual analog scale (VAS) and consists of successive numbers from 0 to 10 on a&#xD;
      horizontal line. The respondent selects a number that best represents the intensity of his&#xD;
      pain. Number &quot;0&quot; represents &quot;no pain&quot; whereas number &quot;10&quot; represents &quot;the worst pain&#xD;
      imaginable&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were asked to fill out forms at relevant times in accordance with the instructions&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analgesic tablet (400 mg Ibuprofen) was prescribed to take an in case of severe pain, at&#xD;
      6-h intervals. Also they were requested to record the number of analgesic pills consumed each&#xD;
      day. The forms were collected on the 4th day following the retreatment. Also a phone call was&#xD;
      made every day for 3 days to obtain information on the postoperative pain and the frequency&#xD;
      of analgesic intake. The patients were asked to call the contact number on the form if they&#xD;
      encountered severe pain or if they needed to ask any questions regarding the treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Postoperative pain after removal of gutta-percha using four different NiTi systems.</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>Pain intensity was evaluated at 24 hours after retreatment procedures. An 11 item numerical rating scale (NSR) was used to assess the pain. The NSR is a segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. The number 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; wheres number 10 represents &quot;pain as bad as someone can imagine&quot;. All patients were requested to mark a number corresponding to their average pain.</description>
