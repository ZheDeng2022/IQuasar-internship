&#xD;
          5. Patients suffering from NBD symptoms defined by Wexner feacal incontinence score ≥10&#xD;
             and/or Cleveland Clinic constipation score ≥10 confirmed at Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Only TAI treatment naïve patient (not having previously used any particular TAI&#xD;
             system).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Judged eligible for TAI as per standardized treatment pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Able to read, write and understand information given to them regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             HealthCare and site personnel).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Previous enrolment in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Simultaneous participation in another clinical study that may interfere with the&#xD;
             present study as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Expected severe non-compliance to protocol as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Any other condition, as judged by the investigator, which might make follow-up or&#xD;
             investigations inappropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Any patient that according to the Declaration of Helsinki is unsuitable for enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Agranulocytosis (&lt;0.5 10^9 / L) [Only applicable for Switzerland].&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If symptoms and signs compatible with UTI is present but no urine culture test&#xD;
                  has been performed yet, a test should be performed, and the result received prior&#xD;
                  evaluating if the subject is eligible for study participation. After successful&#xD;
                  and completed treatment of a UTI, the subject may be rescheduled for Visit 1 in&#xD;
                  order to re-evaluate study participation.&#xD;
