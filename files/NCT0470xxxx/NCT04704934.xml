  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) compared&#xD;
      with ramucirumab and paclitaxel (Ram + PTX) in participants with HER2-positive gastric or&#xD;
      gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma who have progressed on or after a&#xD;
      trastuzumab-containing regimen and have not received any additional systemic therapy.&#xD;

      This study will assess the efficacy and safety of T-DXd compared with Ram + PTX in&#xD;
      participants with HER2-positive (defined as immunohistochemistry [IHC] 3+ or IHC 2+/in situ&#xD;
      hybridization [ISH]+) gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma (based on [American Society of Clinical&#xD;
      Oncology (ASCO) College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines and confirmed by central&#xD;
      assessment of tumor tissue) who have progressed on or after a trastuzumab-containing regimen&#xD;
      and have not received any additional systemic therapy. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      either T-DXd or Ram + PTX treatment. The primary objective will assess overall survival.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will further assess progression-free survival, objective response rate,&#xD;
      duration of response, disease control rate, safety, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      T-DXd.&#xD;
