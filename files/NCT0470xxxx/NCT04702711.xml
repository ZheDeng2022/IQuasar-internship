  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of generalized anxiety is common in the general population and is often treated in&#xD;
      primary health care. Anger is an emotion that can lead to interpersonal problems but can also&#xD;
      be an agent for justice and change. Previous research has shown a link between generalized&#xD;
      anxiety and anger but there is a lack of qualitative research investigating how individuals&#xD;
      with symptoms of generalized anxiety experience anger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research study is to increase knowledge about how anger is experienced in&#xD;
      adult patients in primary health care with symptoms of generalized anxiety and about the&#xD;
      experiences of health care professionals working with patients with symptoms of generalized&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Symptoms of generalized anxiety is common in the general population and is often treated in&#xD;
      primary health care. The core of the diagnostic criteria for generalized anxiety disorder&#xD;
      (GAD) is excessive long-term worry that is difficult to control and concerns a number of&#xD;
      events or activities. In this study we use the term &quot;symptoms of generalized anxiety&quot; by&#xD;
      which we refer to these symptoms, regardless of whether the patient has a clinically&#xD;
      established diagnosis of GAD or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anger is an emotion that can lead to interpersonal problems but can also be an agent for&#xD;
      justice and change. Previous research has shown a link between generalized anxiety and anger&#xD;
      but there is a lack of qualitative research on how individuals with symptoms of generalized&#xD;
      anxiety experience anger.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research study is to increase knowledge about how anger is experienced in&#xD;
      adult patients in primary health care with symptoms of generalized anxiety and about the&#xD;
      experiences of health care professionals working with patients with symptoms of generalized&#xD;
      anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has the following research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How do adult patients in primary health care with symptoms of generalized anxiety&#xD;
           experience their own anger?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How do health care professionals experience anger in patients in primary health care&#xD;
           with symptoms of generalized anxiety?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How do health care professionals experience attitudes towards and treatment of adult&#xD;
           patients with symptoms of generalized anxiety in primary health care with special focus&#xD;
           on the patients' anger?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with symptoms of generalized anxiety and health care professionals at primary health&#xD;
      care centers are interviewed (se section on eligibility). The goal is to include 15-20&#xD;
      patients and 15-20 health care professionals. A questionnaire with background questions is&#xD;
      completed and the interviews follow an interview guide. The background questionnaire and&#xD;
      interview guide differ between patients and health care professionals. The interviews are&#xD;
      audio recorded and transcribed into text. The data is analyzed using thematic analysis&#xD;
      according to the guidelines given by Braun and Clarke (2006; 2013).&#xD;
