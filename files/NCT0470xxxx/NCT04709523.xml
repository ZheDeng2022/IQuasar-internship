  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the change in augmentation thickness after guided bone&#xD;
      regeneration (GBR) using bovine-derived xenograft in combination with or without injectable&#xD;
      platelet-rich fibrin (i-PRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized-controlled clinical trial was conducted on patients with horizontal bone&#xD;
      deficiency in the posterior regions of mandible. After implant placement, GBR procedures were&#xD;
      randomly performed using i-PRF enriched bovine-derived xenograft (test group) or bovine&#xD;
      derived xenograft alone (control group). Cone-beam computed tomography was taken at the&#xD;
      implant sites immediately, and 6 months after surgery for assess the change in augmentation&#xD;
      thickness as the primary outcome of the study. The secondary outcomes included marginal bone&#xD;
      level and implant survival rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was conducted on patients who had partially edentulism with horizontal deficiency&#xD;
      of the alveolar bone in the posterior regions of mandible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were informed about treatment protocol of the study and also, the risks and&#xD;
      benefits associated with participation. Each patient provided written informed consent prior&#xD;
      to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was performed after the dental implant surgeries and the patients were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group included 22 patients treated with GBR using i-PRF-enriched bovine-derived&#xD;
      xenograft + resorbable membrane Control group included 22 patients treated with GBR using&#xD;
      bovine-derived xenograft + resorbable membrane All patients underwent two-stage surgical&#xD;
      protocol that performed by the same experienced surgeon. Following implant placement,&#xD;
      i-PRF-enriched bovine-derived xenograft for the test group and bovine-derived xenograft alone&#xD;
      for the control group was carefully positioned with light compression around the implants.&#xD;
      Finally, the resorbable membrane was placed to cover the augmented area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the second stage of surgery, healing caps were placed and the implant-supported fixed&#xD;
      prosthesis were completed in approximately one to two months.&#xD;
