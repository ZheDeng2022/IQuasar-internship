      A randomized, parallel group, active comparator-controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      non-inferiority or superiority of Cryopreserved Platelets with Liquid Stored Platelets in&#xD;
      controlling blood loss in patients undergoing Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery. Patients&#xD;
      planning to undergo Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery with risk factors for significant bleeding&#xD;
      post-surgery will be approached. Subjects will be randomized using clinical site and presence&#xD;
      of an underlying congenital or acquired hypercoagulable state as a stratification variable in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio to receive either Cryopreserved Platelets or Liquid Stored Platelets. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will undergo Cardiopulmonary Bypass Surgery and at the completion of bypass and&#xD;
      heparin reversal subjects will likely be assessed for eligibility before coming of bypass.&#xD;
      Study platelets will be given either intraoperatively after heparin reversal and return of&#xD;
      active clotting time (ACT) to &lt; 140 sec or post operatively (after chest closure).&#xD;
