  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to complete a retrospective chart review of subjects who were&#xD;
      treated at the Wound Care Clinic at Methodist Dallas Medical Center, presented for treatment&#xD;
      between June 2018 and February 2019, and were administered the PHQ-9. The study aims to&#xD;
      measure the prevalence of depression in this sample, feasibility of using PHQ-9 in this&#xD;
      patient population, and identifying variables and functional impairment associated with&#xD;
      clinically significant depression.&#xD;

      The study will review medical records of new patients who presented to the Wound Care Center&#xD;
      at Methodist Dallas Medical Center between June 2018 and February 2019. These patients were&#xD;
      all administered PHQ-9 as part of a quality improvement project. The medical records included&#xD;
      for analysis will be from male and female patients aged 18 years or older. The medical&#xD;
      records will be reviewed for the following information: general demographics, information&#xD;
      including age, sex, ethnicity, race, PHQ-9 score (total and individual items), medical&#xD;
      conditions, wound history, past medical history, general symptoms, abuse and suicide risk,&#xD;
      activities of daily living, motivation assessment, mental status, and pain ratings. This&#xD;
      information will be used to measure the prevalence of clinically significant depression in&#xD;
      the sample, which is the primary aim. We will also use the data to establish factors and&#xD;
      variables correlated with the presence and severity of clinically significant depression.&#xD;
