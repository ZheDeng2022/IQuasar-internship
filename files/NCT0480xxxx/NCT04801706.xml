      Evaluation of the association of ultrasonographic parameters suggestive of placenta accreta&#xD;
      with intraoperative clinical diagnosis of placenta accreta according to the the clinical&#xD;
      grading system for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) disorders proposed recently by FIGO and&#xD;
      histopathological diagnosis of placenta accreta in hysterectomy specimens The following&#xD;
      ultrasound items will be examined: number and viability of fetuses, amniotic fluid&#xD;
      assessment, fetal biometries, fetal gender if possible, fetal presentation, Estimated fetal&#xD;
      weight using Hadlock formula, Umbilical Artery Pulsatility Index (UA PI) measured from an&#xD;
      automated/manual trace of at least three consecutive waveforms of the relevant vessel in the&#xD;
      absence of fetal breathing movements or uterine contractions. The UA PI will be recorded from&#xD;
      a free-floating section of cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next step the investigators will look for suggestive ultrasound parameters of placenta&#xD;
      accreta including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Location of placenta: Placenta previa anterior / posterior / totally covering the&#xD;
           internal cervical os.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lacunae staging according to Finberg and Williams as follows: grade 0, none seen; grade&#xD;
           1, 1-3 present and generally small; grade 2, 4-6 present and tending to be larger and&#xD;
           more irregular; grade 3, many throughout the placenta and appearing large and bizarre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Loss of the clear zone, defined as loss or irregularity of the hypoechoic plane in the&#xD;
           myometrium underneath the placental bed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Bladder wall interruption, defined as loss or interruption of the bright bladder wall&#xD;
           (hyperechoic band or 'line' between the uterine serosa and bladder lumen)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Uterovescical hypervascularity, defined as a striking amount of color Doppler signal&#xD;
           seen between the myometrium and the posterior wall of the bladder, including vessels&#xD;
           appearing to extend from the placenta, across the myometrium and beyond the serosa, into&#xD;
           the bladder or other organs, often running perpendicular to the myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Increased vascularity in the parametrial region, defined as the presence of&#xD;
           hypervascularity extending beyond the lateral uterine walls and involving the region of&#xD;
           the parametria .&#xD;

        All females in age range between 18 years old and 45 years old who are diagnosed as&#xD;
        placenta accreta spectrum disorder in antenatal care at Assiut University, Women Health&#xD;
        Hospital at time between May 2021 and May 2023 will be included in the study&#xD;

&#xD;
        All patients diagnosed with placenta previa previa or low lying placenta during pregnancy&#xD;
        at any gestational age will be included and followed up until termination of pregnancy. The&#xD;
        diagnosis of placenta previa was based on the presence of placental tissue overing the&#xD;
        internal cervical os and Low-lying placenta was diagnosed when the placenta was within 2 cm&#xD;
        from the internal cervical os but did not cover it&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impaired liver or renal functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Coagulation disorders.&#xD;
