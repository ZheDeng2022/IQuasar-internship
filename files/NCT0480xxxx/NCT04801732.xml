  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted to investigate the effect of mulligan thoracic sustained natural&#xD;
      apophyseal glide on patients diagnosed as sub acromial impingement syndrome and its effect on&#xD;
      shoulder range of motion, pain, function and disability of affected shoulder joint and size&#xD;
      of sub acromial space, Half of the patients will treated with traditional treatment and&#xD;
      mulligan thoracic SNAGS technique, while the other half will treated with traditional&#xD;
      treatment only.&#xD;

      Forty patients with sub-acromial impingement syndrome will participate in this study.&#xD;
      Intervention for the both group consisted of 12 session (3 times per week ) for one month.&#xD;
      Subjects will be divided randomly and allocated into two groups , study group will received&#xD;
      supervised exercise and mulligan thoracic SNAGS technique and the control group will received&#xD;
      supervised exercise (stretching and strengthening exercises). both group will assessed by x&#xD;
      ray to measure sub-acromial space , visual analogue scale for pain , The Shoulder Pain and&#xD;
      Disability Index for shoulder function and goniometer for shoulder flexion, abduction&#xD;
      ,external and internal rotation range of motion before and after treatment.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Randomized controlled study design were the recruited patients will randomly allocated into two groups control group and study group by Closed Envelope method of randomization. The treatment for all patients in both groups will conducted 3 times per week for one month .The study group (A): will receive SNAGS techniques on thoracic spine with traditional treatment consist of ice application, supervised exercises (stretching and strengthening exercise) and the study group(B) will receive only traditional treatment (ice or application and supervised exercise). All patients will be diagnosed as stage II according to Neer's classification recruited from orthopedic clinic from both sexes who met all the inclusion criteria and will be informed about the study procedure and signed the informed consent prepared for this study.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>for flexion stationary Arm of the goniometer was aligned with the lateral border of the scapula (mid axillary arm), and the moving arm was aligned with the humerus.&#xD;
for abduction the fulcrum was placed at the mid point of the posterior aspect of the glenohumeral joint, stationary arm was parallel to the trunk, and the moving arm was parallel to the longitudinal axis of the humerus. for internal and external rotation patient was in supine with the hips and knees flexed approximately 45°.The tested arm was supported on the table in 90° of abduction, elbow flexed 90°, and the wrist in neutral position.&#xD;
the fulcrum was placed on the olecranon, stationary arm Placed perpendicular to the floor, and the moving arm parallel with the forearm.</description>

    <description>Extension Thoracic Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glides :&#xD;
Patient position: The patient sits astride the end of the table with hands placed behind the neck to protract the scapulae allowing access to the mid thoracic spine for the therapist's hand.&#xD;
Therapist position: Therapist stands on their most efficient side for a centrally applied Sustained Natural Apophyseal Glides.&#xD;
Therapist grasp: The therapist's mobilizing hand (ulnar border) will apply a cephalad glide in line with the facet joint plane of the involved spinal level and the other arm holds the thoracic wall above the level to be mobilized.&#xD;
Traction is applied prior to glide, which is achieved by therapist knee extension&#xD;
Repetitions: Three sets of ten repetitions will be done after a trial for the patient to be familial with the technique.&#xD;
and traditional treatment.</description>
