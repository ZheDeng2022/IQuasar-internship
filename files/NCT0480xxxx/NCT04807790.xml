  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of Telerehabilitation Based Structured&#xD;
      Home Program Implementations on functional status, activity and participation in preschool&#xD;
      children with Cerebral Palsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The structured home program will consist of activities determined by the family members&#xD;
      according to the functional level of the child and the activities child can't do, and which&#xD;
      are determined according to the goals specific to the child. In order to ensure that the&#xD;
      structured home program created can be implemented by the family, a 1 hour family training&#xD;
      will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the structured home program training, a 45-minute video interview will be held with one&#xD;
      of the family members (mother-father-caregiver) once a week, in order to check by the&#xD;
      physiotherapist whether the home program is implemented correctly. Video interviews will be&#xD;
      the telerehabilitation part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices, activities organized by&#xD;
      physiotherapists as one or two sessions per week according to the functional levels of&#xD;
      children with CP. Routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation applications include increasing&#xD;
      postural control, gaining motor development steps, strengthening training, balance training,&#xD;
      long-term stretching training, manual therapy, hydrotherapy, hippotherapy and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental therapy approaches. Telerehabilitation-based structured home program&#xD;
      applications, which are given in addition to routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      applications, and only individuals who receive routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation will&#xD;
      be followed for 24 weeks. Individuals who receive routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation&#xD;
      will be monitored only for control purposes, and a structured home program will be given to&#xD;
      the group that receives Telerehabilitation Based Structured Home Program Practices, which are&#xD;
      given in addition to routine physiotherapy and rehabilitation applications. The researcher&#xD;
      will not be included in the program of the group that only benefits from routine&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices. A total of three evaluations will be made for&#xD;
      both groups, after the training before the training and after 12 weeks from the training.&#xD;
