  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a 2 drugs ART regimen (lamivudine plus&#xD;
      dolutegravir) for prevention of mother to child transmission in pregnant women with HIV. 20&#xD;
      pregnant women will be enrolled in this proof of concept protocol. They will be prescribed&#xD;
      DTG-3TC (fixed-dose combination), and will be followed up to the end of gestation. Initially,&#xD;
      a total of 10 pregnant women will be recruited for the first phase of the study. Once the&#xD;
      first phase is successfully completed, 10 additional participants will be included in a&#xD;
      second step.&#xD;

           virtual phenotype and/or phenotypic resistance testing), if performed and available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Concomitant medications, including any herbal/traditional remedies.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  HIV RNA measurement within the 4 previous weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional laboratory assessments (participants should be asked to abstain from food, except&#xD;
      water, for at least 8 hours prior to providing blood for glucose and lipid measurements):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete blood count (CBC): hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count (WBC) with&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Renal function: serum creatinine to estimate GFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver function: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST),&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin and albumin.&#xD;

           months before study entry may be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV resistance testing Besides the routine medical evaluation they will be asked to&#xD;
           provide a blood sample at every medical visit (every 4 weeks) to assess WBC, platelets&#xD;
           count, hemoglobin, creatinine, liver enzymes, and fasting glucose / lipids. HIV-1 plasma&#xD;
           viral load will also be assessed at the same time intervals. CD4/CD8+ cells count will&#xD;
           be measured at baseline and after 24 and 36 weeks of gestation, or more frequently, at&#xD;
           medical discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the Brazilian MOH recommendations, babies will receive oral AZT for 4 weeks, if&#xD;
      their mothers had a documented HIV RNA plasma viral load &lt;1,000 copies/ml, in the third&#xD;
      trimester of gestation. For those born from mothers presenting higher viral load, nevirapine&#xD;
      will be added for the same period of time. In addition, they will be evaluated at delivery,&#xD;
      after 2 and 6 weeks after the end of prophylaxis for HIV viral load measurements. Blood&#xD;
      chemistry and hematology will be assessed 2 weeks after prophylaxis.16,17&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be excluded from study if the following conditions are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a) HIV-1 plasma viral load decay &lt; 1 log compared with baseline values after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      therapy, OR b) HIV-1 plasma viral load ≥ 1,000 copies/mL after 8 weeks of therapy Women will&#xD;
      be recruited in a stepwise approach. Initially, 10 participants will be included, and&#xD;
      followed up to the end of pregnancy. An interim analysis will evaluate the efficacy of the 2D&#xD;
      ART regimen after the first 10 patients given birth. The study will be interrupted if 3&#xD;
      participants meet stopping criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second phase will start only if the number of women achieving the stopping criteria is ≤&#xD;
      3 at completion of follow up for the first 10 participants, and will include 10 additional&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have an estimated recruitment period of 4 months plus a maximum 6 months of&#xD;
      follow up for the last enrolled patient, for each phase. Taken together, the first and second&#xD;
      phases will require 20 months for enrollment and follow up. An interim analysis following the&#xD;
      first phase will take one month, and the final analysis / writing reports is planned to last&#xD;
      3 months. Thus, the total duration of the study will be 24 months.&#xD;
