  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat people who have advanced cancer. In this&#xD;
      study researchers want to learn more about a new substance called BAY2666605. BAY2666605&#xD;
      triggers the formation of a complex of two proteins called SLFN12 and PDE3A. This complex&#xD;
      drive cancer cells into cell death by a mechanism called apoptosis. The complex is only&#xD;
      formed in the cancers which contain both proteins. This study is done in adult patients who&#xD;
      have certain types of advanced cancers that cannot be cured by drugs that are currently&#xD;
      available. The cancer types include skin cancer that has spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
      and cancer that started in the bones or soft tissue, the ovaries, or the brain. Patients with&#xD;
      these cancers are only included if the cells of the patient's cancer contain the building&#xD;
      plan to produce SLFN12-phosphodiesterase 3A (PDE3A) complex. To confirm this, a specific test&#xD;
      is performed with the cancer cells. The researchers will study how BAY2666605 moves into,&#xD;
      through and out of the body. Researchers will try to find the best dose that can be given,&#xD;
      how safe BAY2666605 is and how it affects the body. Researchers will also study the action of&#xD;
      BAY2666605 against the cancer. Part A will include about 36 participants and up to another 12&#xD;
      participants. Part B will include about 41 participants. All of the participants will take&#xD;
      BAY2666605 by mouth as either a liquid or as tablets. During the study, the participants will&#xD;
      take the treatment in 4 week periods called cycles. In each cycle, the participants will in&#xD;
      general take BAY2666605 once daily. The participants may also be asked to do overnight&#xD;
      fasting before the intake of substance and to have standard high-fat, high-calorie breakfast&#xD;
      on some days before taking the dose. These 4 week cycles will be repeated throughout the&#xD;
      trial. The participants can take BAY2666605 until their cancer gets worse, until they have&#xD;
      medical problems, or until they leave the trial. Participants will have around 18 visits in&#xD;
      each cycle. Some of the visits can also be done via Phone. During the trial, the study team&#xD;
      will take blood and urine samples, do physical examinations and check the participants' heart&#xD;
      health using an electrocardiogram (ECG) and an ultrasound of the heart. The study team will&#xD;
      also take pictures of the participants' tumors using CT or MRI scans. The study team will ask&#xD;
      how the participants are feeling, if participants have any medical problems or if&#xD;
      participants are taking any other medicine. About 1 month and 3 months after the last dose,&#xD;
      the participants will have another visit and a phone call respectively where participants&#xD;
      will be checked for and asked about medical problems. The researchers will then contact the&#xD;
      participants every 3 months until the trial ends.&#xD;
