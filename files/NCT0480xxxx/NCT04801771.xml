    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common implant and follow-up&#xD;
      protocol. The objective will be to follow fifty-seven (57) adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      (10-21 years of age), with Down syndrome, moderate to severe sleep apnea, and&#xD;
      post-adenotonsillectomy, for 12 months after undergoing implant of the Inspire Upper Airway&#xD;
      Stimulation (UAS) System. The study is being conducted in order to evaluate objective change&#xD;
      in cognition and expressive language after implant and therapy with the Inspire UAS System.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-arm study conducted under a common implant and follow-up&#xD;
      protocol. The objective will be to follow fifty-seven (57) adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      (10-21 years of age), with Down syndrome, moderate to severe sleep apnea, and&#xD;
      post-adenotonsillectomy, for 12 months after undergoing implant of the Inspire Upper Airway&#xD;
      Stimulation (UAS) System. The study is being conducted in order to evaluate objective change&#xD;
      in cognition and expressive language after implant and therapy with the Inspire UAS System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to implant subjects will be required to meet eligibility criteria, complete quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires and undergo neurocognitive testing (NCT) and expressive language&#xD;
      sampling. Eligibility criteria will be determined via review of medical records, an in-lab&#xD;
      polysomnography (sleep study), and a drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After implant of the Inspire UAS System, subjects will undergo five (5) study visits. Four&#xD;
      (4) of the visits will include an in-lab sleep study (PSG). Follow-up expressive language&#xD;
      sampling and neurocognitive testing will be performed at 6 months post-implant. Follow-up&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires will be completed at 12 months post-implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will conclude their participation in the study at the end of their 12 month study&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
