  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is a valuable tool in reducing the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC). Older back-to-back studies evaluating novel endoscopes indicated that conventional&#xD;
      colonoscopy misses almost 20% of adenomas. In order to improve the diagnostic accuracy of&#xD;
      colonoscopy and to improve the adenoma detection rate (ADR) (a significant marker of&#xD;
      quality), efforts have been made to improve endoscopic techniques, the bowel preparation, to&#xD;
      keep slower withdrawal time, and to use new technologies and devices. Since 2012, a new&#xD;
      accessory device (Endocuff; ARC Medical Design, Leeds, UK), which is mounted on the tip of&#xD;
      the colonoscope has been introduced to the market. The Endocuff is a device that can be&#xD;
      mounted on the tip of an endoscope and may assist to inspect a greater surface of the colonic&#xD;
      mucosa by pulling backwards, flattening, and stretching the colonic folds as the endoscope is&#xD;
      gradually withdrawn. Use of this device may achieve better visualization of the bowel lumen,&#xD;
      especially behind folds, and improve stability of the instrument on withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to conduct a back-to-back endoscopy study and to evaluate the&#xD;
      contribution of Endocuff-assisted colonoscopy to the detection of missed adenomas in a mixed&#xD;
      population of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening/surveillance and symptomatic patients.&#xD;
