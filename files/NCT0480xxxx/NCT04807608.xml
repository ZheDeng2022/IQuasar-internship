  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usability of the system which includes the&#xD;
      wearable device, app and cloud data processing, including an algorithm (Aura) capable of&#xD;
      detecting possible early signs of respiratory infections in healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators would like to evaluate the presence of any allergic reactions&#xD;
      to materials used in the manufacture of the EmbracePlus.&#xD;

      The investigators wish to evaluate of the usability, according to the requirements of IEC&#xD;
      62366-1:2015/AMD 1:2020 of a wearable device - EmbracePlus, the Empatica Care app and Aura&#xD;
      algorithm, an early-warning wearable/AI platform for alerting to COVID-19 and other possible&#xD;
      respiratory infections before a person is symptomatic. The system consists is a smartwatch&#xD;
      coupled with an AI algorithm (Aura) developed by Empatica. The Aura algorithm analyzes&#xD;
      physiological signals and derived biomarkers (such as sleep patterns) in order to detect&#xD;
      possible early signs of respiratory infection. It has been originally developed by Empatica,&#xD;
      validated with influenza and rhinovirus data and is being currently validated for COVID-19&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;
