      This is a Phase I, Double-Blind, Pharmacokinetic, Safety and Tolerability Study of Ketoprofen&#xD;
      Lysine Salt Combined with Gabapentin (KLS-GABA) Compared to Ketoprofen Lysine Salt (KLS)&#xD;
      Alone in Healthy Male Subjects (Part A) Followed by a Randomised, Double-Blind, Placebo-&#xD;
      Controlled Study to Investigate the Pharmacodynamic Effects of KLS, and KLS in Combination&#xD;
      with Gabapentin (GABA), in Healthy Male Subjects Using the Intradermal (ID) Capsaicin Model&#xD;
      (Part B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a randomised, double-blind, crossover group study to investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and PK profile of a single oral dose of KLS-GABA compared to KLS alone in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects. It is planned to enrol 12 subjects. All subjects take part in 2&#xD;
      treatment periods, in which they are randomised to receive either a single dose of KLS-GABA&#xD;
      (80 mg-34 mg) or a single dose of KLS (80 mg) alone in each treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participation in Part A lasts approximately 7 weeks and will consist of the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening visit (up to 28 days prior to Day 1 of Treatment Period 1),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to the clinical research unit (CRU) on Day -1 prior to Treatment Period 1,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 1 (Day 1 to Day 3),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A washout period of a minimum of 7 days,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to the CRU on Day -1 prior to Treatment Period 2,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Period 2 (Day 1 to Day 3),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up visit (5 to 7 days post-final dose following Treatment Period 2). Safety&#xD;
           will is assessed through AE reporting, 12-lead ECGs, vital signs, physical examinations,&#xD;
           and clinical laboratory examinations. Pharmacokinetics are assessed by blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A treatment lasts 2 days (Day 1 in Treatment Period 1; Day 1 in Treatment Period 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study to investigate&#xD;
      the PD effects, PK/PD correlation, safety, and tolerability of three single oral dose levels&#xD;
      of KLS-GABA compared to KLS alone, 300 mg gabapentin and placebo in the ID capsaicin model in&#xD;
      healthy male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is planned to enrol 128 subjects, randomised evenly to 8 possible treatments; subjects&#xD;
      receive either KLS alone, KLS-GABA, 300 mg gabapentin or placebo. The planned treatments are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KLS alone (40 mg, 80 mg, or 160 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KLS-GABA (40 mg-17 mg, 80 mg-34 mg or 160 mg-68 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gabapentin (300 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects participantion in Part B lasts approximately 6 weeks and consists of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening visit (up to 28 days prior to dosing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An additional screening visit (at least 7 days prior to dosing) to determine the&#xD;
           subject's response to capsaicin and to familiarise them in the pain measurements,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to the CRU on Day -1, for collection of pain measurements and completion of&#xD;
           the ID capsaicin model&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment period (morning of Day 1 until 12 hours postdose)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discharge from the CRU 12 hours postdose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up visit (5 to 7 days postdose). Safety is assessed through AE reporting,&#xD;
           12-lead ECGs, vital signs, physical examinations, and clinical laboratory examinations.&#xD;
           Pharmacokinetics are assessed by blood sampling. Pharmacodynamics are assessed using the&#xD;
           ID capsaicin model and pain measurements. Part B treatment lasts 1 day (Day 1).&#xD;

    <description>Pain reduction/analgesia is measured through visual analogue scale (VAS) consisting of a 100 mm line, with 0 representing &quot;no pain'' and 100 &quot;worst pain imaginable.&quot; Subjects are asked to mark the VAS using a single vertical stroke at the point they consider to appropriately reflect their level of pain from the injection of capsaicin (not general pain). A new VAS are provided for each time-point and subjects are not allowed to see their previous VAS responses. The VAS is scored by measuring from the left-hand end of the scale to the point where the subject has marked the line, and the distance in mm recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>During treatment period (Day -1, Day 1) at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The area of mechanical hyperalgesia is assessed using a standard 24 g von Frey hair. The von Frey hair is applied at 1-second intervals along each of the 4 lines intersecting at the injection site drawn onto the skin before the injection. Stimulation begins distal from the injection site and advances in 1cm increments toward the injection site until a pain response is elicited. Subjects are asked to report when the von Frey hair first begins to cause any pain sensation or discomfort and the distance of that point from the injection site in centimetres for each line at each time-point is recorded. The area of hyperalgesia is then calculated and recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
Pain in response to von Frey stimulation of the hyperalgesic area is recorded using an 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). The pain score reflects the maximum pain experienced during the assessment.</description>

    <time_frame>During treatment period (Day -1, Day 1) at 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes post injection</time_frame>
    <description>The area of allodynia is assessed by sweeping a standard paintbrush at 1-second intervals across each of the 4 lines intersecting at the injection site drawn onto the skin before the injection. Stimulation begins distal from the injection site and advances in 1 cm increments toward the injection site until a pain response is elicited. Subjects are asked to indicate when the brush first begins to cause any pain or discomfort and the distance of that point from the injection site in centimetres for each line at each time-point is recorded.The area of allodynia is then calculated and recorded in the CRF.&#xD;
Pain in response to brush stimulation of the allodynic area is recorded using an 11-point NRS ranging from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;). The pain score reflects the maximum pain experienced during the assessment.</description>
