      The investigators would like to explore whether Hypotension Prediction Index during and&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that some patients have a prolonged and difficult recovery after major surgery,&#xD;
      which impacts their long-term health and wellbeing. A major issue is that scores for&#xD;
      predicting recovery are typically generated only once in the period before surgery, but&#xD;
      subsequent events during and immediately after surgery can also alter the likelihood of a&#xD;
      prolonged and difficult recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such event appears to be low blood pressure (hypotension). Hypotension Prediction Index&#xD;
      can be calculated from routine blood pressure measurements, and is an indicator of blood&#xD;
      pressure instability. The investigators propose that Hypotension Prediction Index during and&#xD;
      immediately after surgery may be used to improve their accuracy of scores that predict&#xD;
      postoperative problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore this, the investigators will collect information about the health and care needs,&#xD;
      surgery and postoperative recovery of adult patients' requiring major surgery. This data will&#xD;
      be taken from hospital information systems, a bedside monitor, test reports, a questionnaire&#xD;
      and National Databases. The investigators will then use statistical models to determine&#xD;
      whether Hypotension Prediction Index improves the accuracy of preoperative scores for&#xD;
      predicting postoperative problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the investigators hope to create a tool for predicting how well a patient will&#xD;
      recover based on the information available at any given point in time. Healthcare&#xD;
      professionals will be able to use this tool to identify and support the needs of patients who&#xD;
      need extra help recovering from major surgery.&#xD;
