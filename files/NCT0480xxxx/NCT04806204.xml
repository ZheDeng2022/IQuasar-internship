      Aim: This study was planned as randomized controlled to determine the effect of music therapy&#xD;
      applied before and during angiography on pain, anxiety and physiological parameters after&#xD;
      angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was planned as a pre-test, post-test design, single center, randomized controlled&#xD;
      experimental study.The study is planned to be conducted in the coronary angiography (CAG)&#xD;
      unit of a university hospital between January 2021 and December 2021., the study sample will&#xD;
      be composed of a total of 102 individuals, 34 in each group (intervention 1 group listening&#xD;
      to music before the procedure = 34, intervention 2 group listening to music during the&#xD;
      procedure = 34, control group = 34).Data in the research; The Introductory Form will be&#xD;
      collected using the State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Vital Signs Follow-up Form and Visual Pain&#xD;
      Scale (VAS).Patients in the Intervention 1 group will be offered Turkish Folk, Classical,&#xD;
      Turkish Art and Sufi Music as an option, and the music preferred by the patients will be&#xD;
      played with headphones for 15-20 minutes before the CAG procedure.Patients in the&#xD;
      Intervention 2 group will be offered Turkish Folk, Classical, Turkish Art and Sufi Music as&#xD;
      an option, and the music preferred by the patients will be played through a speaker that will&#xD;
      be placed in the angiography hall during the CAG procedure. Routine care will be applied to&#xD;
      patients in this group and music therapy will not be applied.&#xD;

      It is predicted that music therapy will be beneficial before and during angiography in order&#xD;
      to prevent complications, reduce anxiety and pain, and provide patient comfort and&#xD;
      satisfaction. This study was planned as randomized controlled to determine the effect of&#xD;
      music therapy applied before and during angiography on pain, anxiety and physiological&#xD;
      parameters after angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material - Method Research design: The study was planned as a pre-test, post-test design,&#xD;
      single center, randomized controlled experimental study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and Time of the Study: The study is planned to be conducted in the coronary&#xD;
      angiography(CAG) unit of a university hospital between January 2021 and December 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population and sampling: The population of the study consists of patients who will undergoing&#xD;
      CAG between January 2021 and December 2021. No special method is used for sample selection,&#xD;
      individuals who are treated on the specified dates, who meet the inclusion criteria and who&#xD;
      volunteer to participate in the study will be included in the sample. Power analysis will be&#xD;
      done to determine the sample size. The sample of the study will be composed of individuals&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria of the study within the time that the study is planned. As a&#xD;
      result of the literature review, the number of samples for each group was found to be 28 at a&#xD;
      significance level of α = 0.05 and a power of 80% in randomized controlled studies with CAG.&#xD;
      However, considering that there may be losses in the implementation phase of the study,&#xD;
      provided that the individuals who will be treated with CAG are included, 20% more of these&#xD;
      numbers in each group will be included in the study. Thus, the study sample will be composed&#xD;
      of a total of 102 individuals, 34 in each group (intervention 1 group listening to music&#xD;
      before the procedure = 34, intervention 2 group listening to music during the procedure = 34,&#xD;
      control group = 34). In addition, while the application of the study continues, the data&#xD;
      obtained will be transferred to the computer program and it will be evaluated whether the&#xD;
      sufficient sample number has been reached by power analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Data in the research; The Introductory Form will be collected using the&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Scale, Vital Signs Follow-up Form and Visual Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Information Form This form consists of 17 questions in order to determine the&#xD;
      personal information of the patients (age, gender, occupation, educational status, marital&#xD;
      status, people living with them, income level, smoking-alcohol use, family angiography&#xD;
      history, social security, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Scale The original of this scale was developed by Spielberger et al. In&#xD;
      1970 to determine the level of anxiety. It consists of two parts as &quot;State and Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State Anxiety Scale: It is a 4-point Likert type scale consisting of 20 questions aiming&#xD;
           to measure how individuals feel at the moment. The scores obtained from the scale vary&#xD;
           between 20 and 80, and a high score indicates that anxiety is high, and a low score&#xD;
           indicates that anxiety level is low. The adaptation to the Turkish form was made by Öner&#xD;
           and Le Compte. In the state anxiety scale; There are two types of expressions: direct&#xD;
           expressions expressing negative feelings and inverted statements expressing positive&#xD;
           feelings. The expressions to be scored in reverse in the State Anxiety Scale are items&#xD;
           1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 19 and 20. While these items are scored, those with 1 weight&#xD;
           value are converted to 4, and those with 4 weight values are converted into 1 and the&#xD;
           score is calculated. A total score of 0-19 from the scale indicates that there is no&#xD;
           anxiety, the total score between 20-39 indicates mild, the total score between 40-59&#xD;
           indicates moderate, and the total score between 60-79 indicates severe anxiety, while 60&#xD;
           points above indicate the need for professional help. Test-retest reliability of the&#xD;
           scale was found between 0.16 and 0.54.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trait Anxiety Scale: Indicates how the person feels regardless of the situation and&#xD;
           conditions. Scores from each scale range between 20 and 80. A high score means high, and&#xD;
           a low score means a low level of anxiety. The same is true when interpreting the scores&#xD;
           in order of percentage. That is, a low percentage (1, 5, 10) shows that anxiety is low.&#xD;
           The average score level determined in the applications varies between 36 and 41. 0-30&#xD;
           indicates low anxiety, 31-49 indicates moderate anxiety, and 50 and above indicate high&#xD;
           anxiety. The expressions with reverse scoring on the Spielberg Trait Anxiety Scale are&#xD;
           1, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19. Test-retest reliability was found between 0.73 and 0.86.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital Signs Follow-up Form This form; It was prepared with the aim of recording body&#xD;
      temperature, pulse, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and respiratory values from vital signs&#xD;
      of the individual measured before and after the procedure. The vital signs of the patients&#xD;
      measured by the clinical nurses before and after the procedure and recorded on the nurse&#xD;
      observation form will be recorded in the vital signs follow-up form by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Pain Scale Visual analog scale was used to evaluate the pain. It consists of a&#xD;
      straight line with endpoints defining the extremes such as &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;pain as bad as&#xD;
      possible&quot;. The patient is asked to mark the pain level on the line between the two end&#xD;
      points. This tool was first used in psychology by Freyd in 1923. Kersten et al. Proved in&#xD;
      their study that VAS is a valid tool for pain assessment. This results in accordance with&#xD;
      Unsal and Ergül vase 2.9% rate in their study has determined that it is being used in studies&#xD;
      in Turkey. The horizontal form of VAS will be used in the assessment of pain in our study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Individuals meeting the inclusion criteria in data collection will be&#xD;
      randomized into 3 groups. Individuals who meet the inclusion criteria in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized in a computer program and divided into intervention group 1, intervention group 2&#xD;
      and control group. Individuals undergoing elective angiography will be included in the groups&#xD;
      according to their arrival order. In the randomization table, the first column represents the&#xD;
      &quot;intervention 1 group&quot;, the second column represents the &quot;intervention 2 group&quot;, and the&#xD;
      third column represents the &quot;control group&quot;. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      included in the group in which column they are included in the order of arrival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 1 Group After the polyclinic controls of the patients, on the day of the CAG&#xD;
      procedure, data collection forms will be applied in the CAG unit 30 minutes before the&#xD;
      procedure. Patients in the Intervention 1 group will be offered Turkish Folk, Classical,&#xD;
      Turkish Art and Sufi Music as an option, and the music preferred by the patients will be&#xD;
      played with headphones for 15-20 minutes before the CAG procedure. Since individuals are in&#xD;
      the CAG unit collectively before the procedure, headphones will be used in order not to&#xD;
      disturb other individuals. In determining the music to be played, literature was searched and&#xD;
      expert opinion was obtained from the academicians of Fine Arts Education Department Music&#xD;
      Department. After the interviews, musical types will be arranged as instrumental, non-verbal,&#xD;
      at 70 decibels, approximately 60 metronome per minute, in terms of rhythm and duration, and&#xD;
      will be played according to the individual's choice. Instrumental works will be uploaded to&#xD;
      the portable MP3 player provided by the researchers. The patients in the Intervention 1 group&#xD;
      will be introduced to the MP3 player before the procedure and how they should use it and the&#xD;
      questions of the patients will be answered. After the patients who are taken to the CAG unit&#xD;
      for the CAG procedure are prepared for the operation, the patients will be told to imagine&#xD;
      that the outcome of the procedure will be positive, headphones will be worn and music therapy&#xD;
      will be started. In addition, patients will be informed that they can interfere with the&#xD;
      sound of the music, turn the sound on and off, stop the music and start listening again if&#xD;
      they wish. The physiological parameters of the patient will be measured by the clinical nurse&#xD;
      15 minutes after the procedure, and data collection forms will be applied again after 20&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention 2 Group After the polyclinic controls of the patients, on the day of the&#xD;
      angiography procedure, data collection forms will be applied in the angiography unit 30&#xD;
      minutes before the procedure. Patients in the Intervention 2 group will be offered Turkish&#xD;
      Folk, Classical, Turkish Art and Sufi Music as an option, and the music preferred by the&#xD;
      patients will be played through a speaker that will be placed in the CAG hall during the CAG&#xD;
      procedure. In determining the music to be played, literature was searched and expert opinion&#xD;
      was obtained from the academicians of Fine Arts Education Department Music Department. After&#xD;
      the interviews, musical types will be arranged as instrumental, non-verbal, 75 decibels,&#xD;
      approximately 60 metronome per minute, in terms of rhythm and duration, and will be played&#xD;
      according to the individual's choice. The physiological parameters of the patient will be&#xD;
      measured by the clinical nurse 15 minutes after the procedure, and data collection forms will&#xD;
      be applied again after 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group After the polyclinic controls of the patients, on the day of the aCAG&#xD;
      procedure, data collection forms will be applied in the angiography unit 30 minutes before&#xD;
      the procedure. Routine care will be applied to patients in this group and music therapy will&#xD;
      not be applied. The physiological parameters of the patient will be measured by the clinical&#xD;
      nurse 15 minutes after the procedure, and data collection forms will be applied again 20&#xD;
      minutes later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations: Ethical approval will be obtained from the &quot;Bolu Abant İzzet Baysal&#xD;
      University Clinical Research Ethics Committee&quot; in order to conduct the study. Institutional&#xD;
      permission will be obtained from &quot;Izzet Baysal Training and Research Hospital where the study&#xD;
      will be conducted. In addition, before starting the application, written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained by the researcher explaining the purpose of the study to those who meet the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: In evaluating the data, the significance level was taken as p &lt;0.05, and the&#xD;
      data will be analyzed using the SPSS (25.00) program. In the evaluation of the data, besides&#xD;
      descriptive statistical methods (frequency, percentage and average), Independent Samples&#xD;
      Unrelated samples t test will be used for intergroup comparisons of parameters showing normal&#xD;
      distribution, and related samples t test will be used for intragroup comparisons. In the&#xD;
      intergroup comparisons of non-normally distributed parameters, Kruskall Wallis will be used&#xD;
      to determine the significant difference of variables with more than three subcategories, the&#xD;
      Mann Whitney U will be used to determine the group that causes the difference, and the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed rank test (for the same group data) will be used for intragroup comparisons&#xD;
      of non-normally distributed parameters.&#xD;
