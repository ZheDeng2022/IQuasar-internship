      Longitudinal pilot study among heart failure patients from six Spanish hospitals to evaluate&#xD;
      the feasibility of establishing and maintaining for one year the set of standards for&#xD;
      measuring results in patients with heart failure proposed by ICHOM (International Consortium&#xD;
      for Health Outcomes Measurement), as well as identifying factors that hinder the use and&#xD;
      applicability of this group of standards in real life, where appropriate, defined as the&#xD;
      variables not filled in and the reason for the absence of such information.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      1. MAIN GOAL To evaluate through a pilot study the viability of establishing and&#xD;
           maintaining for one year in selected Spanish centers the set of standards for measuring&#xD;
           results in patients with heart failure proposed by ICHOM (International Consortium for&#xD;
           Health Outcomes Measurement). (International Consortium for Health Outcomes&#xD;
           Measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SPECIFIC GOALS To identify factors that hinder the use and applicability of this group&#xD;
           of standards in real life, where appropriate, defined as the variables not filled in and&#xD;
           the reason for the absence of such information To estimate the workload necessary to&#xD;
           implement this set of variables within everyday clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN Observational pilot study with prospective follow-up with data collection&#xD;
           at 30 days, 6 months and 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the defined objective, the methods used are, to a large extent, those proposed by&#xD;
      ICHOM, except in those sections that may be slightly modified to adapt to the local&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Selection of centers and patients Six centers with experience and adequate organization&#xD;
      (heart failure unit) and with a sufficient size have been selected to guarantee the&#xD;
      recruitment of patients in a short period of time (around three weeks). The main&#xD;
      justification was to seek, within the usual clinical practice, centers where, due to the&#xD;
      organization and interest in heart failure, the chances of success of this initiative were&#xD;
      greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 consecutive patients with a diagnosis of heart failure who meet inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      with no exclusion criteria will be selected in each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Sample size considerations For the main outcome, success is considered if the proportion&#xD;
      of patients followed is ≥ 70%. A random sample of 588 individuals is sufficient to estimate,&#xD;
      with 95% confidence and a precision of +/- 3.5 percentage units, a population percentage that&#xD;
      is expected to be around 75%. Six Spanish centers will participate and a recruitment target&#xD;
      of 100 consecutive patients is set, for a total of 600 patients in the study. In addition,&#xD;
      these sizes in each center offer, accepting an alpha risk of 0.05, a power greater than 80%&#xD;
      to detect statistically significant differences between two centers, assuming that a&#xD;
      follow-up of 75% of patients is achieved in one and 55% in the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3. Follow-up From the baseline or inclusion visit and afterwards, in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      patients or in those recruited in an acute situation, follow-up visits at 30 days, 6 months&#xD;
      and 1 year [Hospitalized patients (1. A recent diagnosis, that is, they did not previously&#xD;
      have the diagnosis of HF and 2.Patients with a previous diagnosis of HF and who are admitted&#xD;
      for an episode of decompensation of HF) and Outpatients (1. A recent diagnosis that is in the&#xD;
      process of titration and/or compensation and 2.A previous diagnosis, that they have suffered&#xD;
      a decompensation, either defined because they have had to go to the emergency room or have&#xD;
      been seen in the outpatient clinic for that reason)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who were included in a stable situation, the 30-day visit will not be carried out&#xD;
      (Outpatients: &quot;Stable&quot; patients attending a follow-up visit. A simple follow-up) since doing&#xD;
      so would unjustifiably complicate the follow-up, giving more work and discomfort to patients&#xD;
      and health professionals. The outcomes reported by the patient (PROMs) in the visits every&#xD;
      six months may be collected by telephone contact if the doctor, due to the stable situation&#xD;
      of the patient, does not consider the face-to-face visit necessary. Information will be&#xD;
      collected at in the case of hospital admissions during follow-up, these admissions also set&#xD;
      the &quot;counter to zero&quot; with regard to time for the following visits (30 days, six months…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT A data entry application will be enabled that will include&#xD;
      filters to detect inconsistencies and anomalous data and alarms for patient monitoring. The&#xD;
      data will be anonymized for all the people involved in the study except for the person in&#xD;
      charge in each center, who will be able to identify their patients to enable follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS Two data analyses are planned, one that includes the information&#xD;
      from the baseline visit and the 30-day visit (in patients for whom it is indicated in the&#xD;
      protocol) and the final one with all the information collected. In both cases, a global&#xD;
      analysis and a comparison between centers (benchmarking) will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In line with the main objective of this pilot study, the main variables are the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who remain in follow-up, the proportion of patients in whom follow-up is carried&#xD;
      out, in terms of time, as planned, and the proportion of missing data in each one of the&#xD;
      defined outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot's success criteria will be a follow-up&gt; 70%, a proportion of missing data in the&#xD;
      outcomes &lt;10%.&#xD;

        Based on the situation at the time of inclusion,5 types of patients are defined that&#xD;
        reflect different clinical situations and influence the necessary follow-up plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A.Hospitalized patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A recent diagnosis (at that admission), that is, they did not previously have the&#xD;
             diagnosis of HF&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a previous diagnosis of HF and who are admitted for an episode of&#xD;
             decompensation of HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        B.Outpatients:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A recent diagnosis that is in the process of titling and/or compensation&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A previous diagnosis, that they have suffered a decompensation, well defined because&#xD;
             they have had to go to the emergency room (and the diuretic treatment has been&#xD;
             increased) or have been seen in the outpatient clinic for that reason&#xD;
