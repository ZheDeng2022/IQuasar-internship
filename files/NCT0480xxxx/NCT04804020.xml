  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fresh embryo transfer is a routine procedure in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. Since&#xD;
      the first live birth after an IVF-FET (frozen embryo transfer), recent years have seen a&#xD;
      dramatic rise in the number of FET cycles. Three endometrial preparation protocols for&#xD;
      frozen-thawed embryo transfer, including artificial, natural, modified natural protocol, have&#xD;
      been studied and applied to maximize treatment outcomes. However, those methods are being&#xD;
      applied empirically as their efficacy and safety are yet to be determined. The objective of&#xD;
      this study is to compare the effectiveness and safety of those protocols.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial will be conducted at My Duc Hospital, Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam. Women who are&#xD;
      potentially eligible will be provided information about the trial as long as their&#xD;
      stimulation cycles are initiated. Screening for eligibility will be performed by treating&#xD;
      physicians on day 2 of the menstrual cycle in the subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycles.&#xD;
      Patients will be provided a copy of the informed consent documents. Written informed consent&#xD;
      is going to be obtained by the investigator from all women before the enrolment. Women will&#xD;
      be randomized (1:1:1) to AC (artificial cycle) or NC (natural cycle) or mNC (modified natural&#xD;
      cycle) protocols using block randomization with a variable block size of 6 or 9 by an&#xD;
      independent study coordinator via telephone, using a computer-generated random list (block&#xD;
      size of 6, or 9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artificial protocol The endometrium is prepared using oral estradiol valerate (Valiera®;&#xD;
      Laboratories Recalcine) 8 mg/day, ranging from the second or fourth menstruation day. The&#xD;
      endometrial thickness will be monitored from day six onwards, and vaginal progesterone&#xD;
      (Utrogestan®; Besins) 800 mg/day will be initiated when endometrial thickness reaches ≥7 mm.&#xD;
      Estradiol exposure must be lasting for ≥9 days before progesterone administration. Embryo&#xD;
      transfer will be scheduled by the time of the initiation of progesterone and embryo stages.&#xD;
      In cases where a dominant follicle emerged, serum LH and progesterone will be determined to&#xD;
      rule out luteinization. If LH concentrations are &lt;13 IU and progesterone levels &lt;7 nmol/l,&#xD;
      luteinization will deem not to have occurred, and FET was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Natural protocol The first ultrasound scan will be performed on the second to the fourth day&#xD;
      of the menstrual cycle to identify any problem related to the patients' uterus or adnexa. The&#xD;
      second ultrasound will be performed on the sixth day of the cycle. Daily ultrasound and serum&#xD;
      estradiol and LH level evaluation will be performed when the mean diameter of the dominant&#xD;
      follicle of ≥14 mm. LH surge initiation is defined as a concentration of 180% above the&#xD;
      latest serum value available in that patient with a continued rise thereafter9 to a level of&#xD;
      20 IU/l or more10 detected by the ECLIA method (Roche Cobas® E 801, Roche Diagnostics,&#xD;
      Germany). Embryo transfer will be scheduled by the time of the initiation of LH and embryo&#xD;
      stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      modified Natural protocol The first ultrasound scan will be performed on the second to the&#xD;
      fourth day of the menstrual cycle to identify any problem related to patients' uterus or&#xD;
      adnexa. A second ultrasound scan will be performed on the sixth day of the cycle; if there is&#xD;
      at least one follicle with a diameter of ≥12 mm, an ultrasound scan will be performed daily.&#xD;
      When the dominant follicle's mean diameter is ≥16 mm, human chorionic gonadotropin - hCG&#xD;
      (Ovitrelle® 250 μg; Merck, Kenilworth, NJ, USA) will be injected to trigger ovulation. Embryo&#xD;
      transfer will be scheduled by the time of the hCG injection and embryo stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle cancellation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Artificial protocol: When the endometrial thickness is below 7mm after a duration of&#xD;
           estradiol administration of ≥21 days or the emerging of a dominant follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Natural cycle protocol: When there is no onset of LH surge observed after a duration of&#xD;
           ≥21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modified Natural cycle protocol: When there is no dominant follicle with a diameter of&#xD;
           16mm emerged after a duration of ≥21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both protocols: When there is no embryo survived after thawing. Frozen embryo transfer A&#xD;
           maximum of 2 day-3 and one day-5 embryo will be thawed on the day of embryo transfer,&#xD;
           three days after the start of progesterone. Two hours after thawing, surviving embryos&#xD;
           will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance using a soft uterine&#xD;
           catheter (Gynétics®, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A series of progesterone levels evaluation will be performed at three times: (1) The start of&#xD;
      the cycle, (2) Before the time the embryo transfer is scheduled, (3) On the day of embryo&#xD;
      transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood sample at the start of the cycle will be stored for further epigenetics analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future babies' health will also be performed separately.&#xD;
