      Intravenous Lipid Emulsion in Improving Coma Of Antipsychotic drugs Acute Poisoning: A&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trial in Poison Control Center of Ain Shams University Hospitals&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs) have been recently used in treatment of acute toxicity&#xD;
      caused by lipophilic drugs including local anesthetics, antidepressants, anti-arrhythmics,&#xD;
      beta blockers and calcium channel antagonists with few case reports concerning their use in&#xD;
      treatment of acute antipsychotics overdose (Muller et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to&#xD;
      evaluate the antidotal effect of ILEs on the level of consciousness of acutely poisoned&#xD;
      patients by antipsychotics and their routine metabolic profile tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute poisoning by antipsychotics could result in various life-threatening toxic effects&#xD;
      mainly on cardiovascular and central nervous systems (CNS). Tachycardia, hypotension, and QT&#xD;
      prolongation in electrocardiogram are the most common cardiovascular findings while sedation,&#xD;
      extrapyramidal symptoms, agitation, and coma are the most common CNS findings following acute&#xD;
      antipsychotic exposures (Divac et al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As acute antipsychotic drugs overdose lack specific antidote, the primary goal in treatment&#xD;
      is aggressive supportive therapy. In order to prevent CNS depression and respiratory failure,&#xD;
      patients may need to be supported by mechanical ventilation. Hypotension is treated by&#xD;
      intravenous fluids with use of direct-acting vasopressors (Orazel et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several mechanisms for the antidotal properties of ILEs have been proposed including their&#xD;
      ability to capture lipophilic drugs and extract them from vital organs such as the heart and&#xD;
      brain thus reducing their toxicity, preferential distribution of lipophilic drugs into a&#xD;
      circulating lipid phase, thereby reducing tissue drug concentrations. In addition, ILEs have&#xD;
      direct inotropic effect due to improved fatty acid oxidative metabolism resulting in&#xD;
      restoration of myocardial contractility (Zyoud et al., 2016 &amp; Kehayova et al., 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Based on the calculated sample size by statistics committee (Community Medicine,&#xD;
      Environmental, and Occupational Medicine Department - Faculty of Medicine, Ain shams&#xD;
      University), a total of at least 30 patients with history of acute intoxication by&#xD;
      antipsychotic drugs will be enrolled and randomly assigned into case (n=15) and control&#xD;
      (n=15) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of rondamization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Randomization will be achieved via a computer-generated random -sequence table.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission, the patient will receive the conventional management including history taking,&#xD;
      clinical examination, investigations and treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination will be repeated every six hours through the period of hospital stay of the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical data of the patient will be recorded in a special sheet that include the&#xD;
      following data :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sociodemographic data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Residence&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intoxication data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type of antipsychotic drug responsible for intoxication.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Amount of antipsychotic drug (if available).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mode of poisoning, whether suicidal, accidental, criminal or therapeutic error.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Route of intake of the poison.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time elapsed between the exposure and arrival to the PCC-ASU (delay time).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Preconsultation management.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Presence of comorbidities (as underlying medical or psychiatric diseases).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The current medications used by the patient including all drugs used in treatment&#xD;
                of diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical data (on admission and during hospital stay):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In both groups, detailed examination of the patients will be carried out on&#xD;
                admission and routinely according to the severity of poisoning.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Assessment of the level of consciousness of all patients under the study will be&#xD;
                carried out on admission and every six hours by using Glasgow coma scale (GCS) and&#xD;
                Alert, Voice, Pain, Unresponsive (AVPU) scale till the patient discharge or&#xD;
                mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Investigations:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Laboratory: all required laboratory investigations will be performed including&#xD;
                arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis, and routine metabolic profile tests (e.g.&#xD;
                glucose, sodium, potassium, urea and creatinine).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Other required investigations: Electrocardigraphy (ECG) will be done on admission&#xD;
                and 12 h later, then every 24 h till the patient discharge or mortality.&#xD;
