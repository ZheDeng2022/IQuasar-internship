      This pilot study is being performed to examine whether epidermal axons are altered in&#xD;
      patients taking opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, and if epidermal axonal changes&#xD;
      predict heightened pain sensitivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, 1 in 25 adults in the USA regularly uses prescription opioids. Now described as a&#xD;
      healthcare crisis, increased prescription opioid use is linked with greater healthcare&#xD;
      utilization and its associated negative costs. Prescription opioid use leads to increased&#xD;
      mortality due to unintentional overdose, misuse and abuse, transition into illicit opioid&#xD;
      use, decreased pain thresholds, and widespread neuropathic pain. In addition, opioid- induced&#xD;
      hyperalgesia is a dangerous and paradoxical condition wherein patients on opioids develop&#xD;
      increased super- heightened pain. In the USA, the increase in prescription opioid use has&#xD;
      followed a similar trajectory of the incidence of overdose due to prescription and illicit&#xD;
      opioids. Sadly, even with this drastic escalation in opioid use, there has been no change in&#xD;
      the rate or severity of chronic pain conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analysis of cutaneous innervation of the epidermis provides an indication of the&#xD;
      health of peripheral sensory axons. Studies in various pain conditions (e.g., painful&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy, painful chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, and fibromyalgia) suggest&#xD;
      changes in epidermal innervation may underlie pain in the feet and hands. Our preclinical&#xD;
      studies reveal that changes in epidermal axons play a key role in the development of pain.&#xD;
      Here, we postulate that chronic opioid use in patients with chronic pain due to non- cancer&#xD;
      conditions 1) contributes to detrimental changes in epidermal axons, 2) works against&#xD;
      pain-relieving actions of opioids to reduce pain, and 3) is possibly linked to opioid-induced&#xD;
      hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our short-term goals are to determine if epidermal axons are altered in patients taking&#xD;
      opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain, and if epidermal axonal changes predict&#xD;
      heightened pain sensitivity. This pilot study will test whether changes in epidermal axons&#xD;
      are &quot;dose-dependent&quot; in patients taking low-dose, moderate-dose, or high-dose opioid therapy.&#xD;
      Our long-term goals will determine whether dose-reduction or cessation of opioids can reverse&#xD;
      axonal changes, or whether these adverse chances can be prevented with other medications. Our&#xD;
      central hypothesis is that patients on opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain will&#xD;
      exhibit elevated epidermal axon densities, and these elevations are accompanied with&#xD;
      hyperalgesia and allodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Do patients on long-term opioid therapy have abnormal intraepidermal nerve fiber&#xD;
      (IENF) density? We hypothesize that patients taking chronic opioids for non-cancer pain&#xD;
      conditions will exhibit abnormal epidermal nerve fiber density compared to chronic pain&#xD;
      patients not taking opioid therapy and healthy controls. We will recruit 20 patients with&#xD;
      chronic pain due to non-cancer conditions on opioid therapy, 20 patients with chronic pain&#xD;
      not taking opioid therapy, and 20 healthy controls and perform a skin biopsy on the ankle.&#xD;
      The skin biopsy will then be assessed to ascertain IENF density and compared to normative&#xD;
      density values for sex and age. Next, we will compare quantitative measurements of IENF&#xD;
      density to total daily oral morphine equivalents (OME) taken by the patients. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that higher daily opioid consumption will correlate with abnormalities in epidermal&#xD;
      innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Do patients on long-term opioid therapy have heightened cutaneous pain sensitivity&#xD;
      that correlates with IENF density? We will perform quantitative sensory testing (QST) in all&#xD;
      patient cohorts to objectively assess pain sensitivity. Patients will undergo QST for&#xD;
      pressure pain threshold, temporal summation, and conditioned pain modulation. We will&#xD;
      determine whether heightened pain sensitivity, as evidenced by reduced pressure pain&#xD;
      thresholds, increased temporal summation, and reduced conditioned pain modulation, is&#xD;
      associated with altered IENF from skin biopsies. We hypothesize that heightened pain&#xD;
      sensitivity will correlate with reductions in epidermal innervation and that higher daily&#xD;
      opioid consumption in chronic pain patients will correlate with abnormalities in epidermal&#xD;
      innervation and altered QST parameters.&#xD;
