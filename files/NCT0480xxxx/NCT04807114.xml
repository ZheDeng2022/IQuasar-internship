  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this prospective non-interventional exploratory study is to characterize the&#xD;
      tumor micro-environment of advanced NSCLC in single-cell resolution, prior to immune&#xD;
      checkpoint blockade exposure, and correlate the findings to clinical outcome. This approach&#xD;
      will allow to generate new hypotheses regarding mechanism of action of ICI and (primary)&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms. The long-term goal is that these novel mechanistic insights will be&#xD;
      translated to a clinical setting to develop better biomarkers of ICI efficacy. Importantly,&#xD;
      since the investigators will also sequentially profile the immune composition of peripheral&#xD;
      blood, this research offers an opportunity to develop circulating (non-invasive) biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim is to characterize the immune cell composition of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)&#xD;
      fluid from these ICI-treated cancer patients if they would develop ICI-pneumonitis. These&#xD;
      mechanistic insights can directly lead to putative diagnostic biomarkers and therpeutic&#xD;
      targets. Since single-cell profiling of blood samples will also be performed, circulating&#xD;
      biomarkers of ICI toxicity can also be identified, making non-invasive diagnosis feasible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will collect tumor biopsies from 70 st.IV NSCLC patients before start of&#xD;
      treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. These biopsies are taken during a medically&#xD;
      required routine procedure for diagnostic purposes, and will be subjected to the following&#xD;
      experimental procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, scRNA-seq and TCR-seq will be applied on up to 5,000 randomly dissociated cells.&#xD;
      Additionally, cell surface protein expression can be integrated with the transcriptional&#xD;
      information. Various bioinformatics pipelines, including Seurat, will be used to identify&#xD;
      different cell clusters, which through marker gene expression will be assigned to known cell&#xD;
      types, cellular subtypes or phenotypes. For instance, this will enable the researchers to&#xD;
      monitor the abundance of PD-1/PD-L1 expressing T cells, cytotoxic T-cells, immune-suppressive&#xD;
      myeloid cells, etc. The following parameters at single-cell level will be relevant&#xD;
      (non-exhaustive):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The composition and relative abundancies of established immune cell types (e.g. T cells&#xD;
           (CD4+, CD8+ and regulatory subsets), NK cells, B cells, MDSCs, macrophages, neutrophils,&#xD;
           dendritic cells). Transcriptomic data for each of these immune cell subtypes will be&#xD;
           analyzed, allowing characterization of specific gene expression programs that define&#xD;
           specific phenotypic states.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Composition of all stromal cellular subtypes identified by single-cell transcriptomics,&#xD;
           including fibroblasts and endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A gene regulatory network for each cell type and cellular subtype (or cell state) will&#xD;
           be established and master transcriptional regulators will be identified. Individual T&#xD;
           cells and T cell sub-clusters will be classified based on interferon activation, high&#xD;
           rates of proliferation and transcription and increased granzyme expression, which are&#xD;
           all indicative of T cell activation. Since high CD8+ T cell activity correlates with&#xD;
           high immune checkpoint expression, T cell activity (based on granzyme expression) will&#xD;
           be correlated with expression of other genes in these cells to identify co-regulated&#xD;
           receptors, which possibly represent novel checkpoint molecules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be subjected to similar experimental procedures. First, PBMC are isolated&#xD;
      using Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis in&#xD;
      combination with CITE- seq will be performed on 5000 PBMC. Cellular composition will be&#xD;
      determined using the same bioinformatic pipelines as used for processing the tumor biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a second objective, immune profiling of the cellular composition of ICI-pneumonitis BAL&#xD;
      fluid and PBMC will be performed using scRNA-seq, scTCR-seq and CITE-seq as previously&#xD;
      outlined.&#xD;
