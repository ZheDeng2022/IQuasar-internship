      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to treat early prostate cancer is still limited. Thermal ablation methods are&#xD;
      being tested for focal prostate cancer therapy. Researchers want to improve on these methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand if Transurethral UltraSound Ablation (TULSA) in combination with MRI guidance&#xD;
      is useful to treat localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      English-speaking adults ages 18 and older with localized prostate cancer that can be seen on&#xD;
      MRI and can be treated by thermal ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digital rectal exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire to assess urinary tract symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI of the pelvis. The MRI scanner is a long, narrow tube. Participants will lie on a&#xD;
           bed that moves in and out of the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also be screened with the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest x-ray&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urodynamic studies to see how well the bladder, sphincters, and urethra hold and release&#xD;
           urine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI of the brain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transrectal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Computer tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. A CT scan is a series&#xD;
           of x-ray images taken of parts of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some screening tests will be repeated during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have the TULSA procedure. They will have an MRI for guidance. A small&#xD;
      ultrasound applicator will be placed into their urethra. It uses heat to destroy the cancer&#xD;
      areas in the prostate. It is controlled by a robotic arm. A cooling catheter will be placed&#xD;
      into their rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will use a urethral catheter for 1-7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is relatively slow growing, with doubling times for local tumors estimated at&#xD;
      2 to 4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some prostate cancers prove to be small, low grade, and noninvasive and they appear to pose&#xD;
      little risk to the life or health of the host. Recent patient series suggest that 20% to 30%&#xD;
      of men undergoing radical prostatectomy have pathologic features in the radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      specimen consistent with an insignificant or &quot;indolent&quot; cancer which poses little threat to&#xD;
      life or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that participants with low volume and low grade disease can be best served with&#xD;
      focal ablation of the visible prostate cancer without the side effects of urinary&#xD;
      incontinence and erectile dysfunction associated with radiation therapy or radical surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focal Therapy for prostate cancer has gained popularity however prior studies demonstrate a&#xD;
      failure rate as high as 50% with a laser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the feasibility of magnetic resonance image (MRI)-guided ultrasound-induced&#xD;
      thermal therapy of biopsy-confirmed and MRI visible, prostate tumor(s) using the TULSA&#xD;
      Thermal Therapy System (Profound Medical)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with prostate cancer, amenable for ultrasound ablation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organ confined clinical T1c or clinical T2a prostate cancer, visible on MRI, and confirmed by&#xD;
      prostate biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ and marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) &lt; 20 ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;=18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study testing feasibility and tolerability of ultrasound ablation of focal prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that 15 participants will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
