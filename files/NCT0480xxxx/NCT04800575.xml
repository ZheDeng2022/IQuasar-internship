      This prospective single center RCT aims to compare sterile gauze and tape versus&#xD;
      Semi-permeable film dressing on the incidence of exit-site infection, CRBSIs&#xD;
      (catheter-related bloodstream infections), skin irritation, total bacterial count, dressing&#xD;
      intactness and cost-benefit, nursing workload in hemodialysis patients with a non-tunneled&#xD;

      This prospective single center RCT aims to compare sterile gauze and tape versus&#xD;
      Semi-permeable film dressing on the incidence of exit-site infection, CRBSIs&#xD;
      (catheter-related bloodstream infections), skin irritation, total bacterial count, dressing&#xD;
      intactness and cost-benefit, nursing workload in hemodialysis patients with a non-tunneled&#xD;
      hemodialysis catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      154 eligible patients in our HD center will be enrolled consecutively and randomly allocated&#xD;
      to one of the two groups according to computer-generated randomization sequences in a 1:1&#xD;
      ratio. Experiment group use semi-permeable film as dressing in exit-site of CVC, and a&#xD;
      sterile gauze and tape in control group. Both groups share same disinfection and dressing&#xD;
      change procedure. Dressings will be replaced per hemodialysis session, or as needed.&#xD;
      Socio-demographic data and disease-related information will be collected, as well as&#xD;
      catheterization site, physician, skin and exit status of the catheterization site at&#xD;
      baseline. Data as listed in the beginning will be recorded in the next 2 weeks follow-up at&#xD;
      every session, such as sign of exit-site infection, CRBSIs (catheter-related bloodstream&#xD;
      infections), skin irritation and dryness, dressing intactness. Before the 2nd dressing&#xD;
      change, skin around exit of CVC under dressing area will be swabbed by a cotton swab. Nursing&#xD;
      time of dressing change will be recorded by a third nurses. Cost and benefit will be&#xD;
      calculated and compared by the end.&#xD;

    <description>The following scale was used for erythema [modified from Fitzpatrick et al.
