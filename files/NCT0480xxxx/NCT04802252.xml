    <textblock>
      Pulse diagnosis is one of the traditional diagnostic methods of traditional Chinese medicine,&#xD;
      which is of great significance in the process of disease diagnosis.Pulse diagnosis is the&#xD;
      diagnosis of disease by touching the pulse of the radial artery at the wrist. Different&#xD;
      diseases reflect different pulse characteristics.What we've found in long-term clinical&#xD;
      observation is that patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia have something different in&#xD;
      their pulse,the abnormal pulse we called &quot;astringent pulse&quot;.There is no modern physiologic&#xD;
      and pathological description on the occurrence of &quot;astringent pulse&quot; in traditional pulse&#xD;
      science, so we study it from acoustics perspective.Our team thinks that every beat of the&#xD;
      heart produces a vibration, which produces sound waves，the sound waves travel through the&#xD;
      blood and eventually reflect off the arterial walls.When an organ(such as the&#xD;
      prostate)，develops hyperplasia, local blood flow changes,the flow of blood, which should be&#xD;
      laminar, changes and becomes turbulent，the conduction of sound waves in turbulence is&#xD;
      disordered，so we end up with pulse features that are different from normal people that are&#xD;
      reflected on the arterial wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have previously studied the pulse characteristics of chronic gastritis, coronary heart&#xD;
      disease, cirrhosis and some other diseases，different pulse sounds were collected and analyzed&#xD;
      using an independently developed Acoustic Pulse Detection System，the ideal results have been&#xD;
      obtained.We found that most of the abnormal sound waves were between 20Hz and 500Hz, so we&#xD;
      classified this sound wave as low frequency and audible sound wave.Based on the above&#xD;
      analysis, this study will use the acoustic pulse detection system to collect the pulse images&#xD;
      of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH).We expected to collect the pulse waves of&#xD;
      62 patients and 62 relatively healthy people without BPH, and use Fourier transform, wavelet&#xD;
      analysis and other analysis methods to study the characteristics of the collected sound&#xD;
      waves, and observe the pulse characteristics of BPH disease.Then diagnostic tests were&#xD;
      carried out to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the acoustic pulse detection&#xD;
      system in the diagnosis of BPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This experiment will further verify the effectiveness of pulse diagnosis of diseases, and&#xD;
      finally lay a foundation for the development of pulse diagnostic instrument can diagnose a&#xD;
      variety of diseases.&#xD;
