    <textblock>
      This study will examine the feasibility and acceptability of using virtual reality (VR)&#xD;
      meditation to manage fatigue in outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The specific aims&#xD;
      of this feasibility study include: 1) examining the feasibility of implementing VR meditation&#xD;
      as an adjunct for managing fatigue in outpatients with rheumatoid arthritis; 2) determine the&#xD;
      acceptability of using VR-delivered meditation training for fatigue management in outpatients&#xD;
      with rheumatoid arthritis; and 3) is to explore outpatient's experience of using VR-delivered&#xD;
      meditation to manage fatigue.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      RA is a debilitating disease that affects over 1.3 million people in the U.S. While recent&#xD;
      advances in medicine have enhanced management of the disease, a staggeringly large portion of&#xD;
      outpatients with RA still suffer from fatigue. A profound, unrelenting exhaustion affecting&#xD;
      energy, motivation, and concentration, fatigue often develops over time without an inciting&#xD;
      event. Fatigue includes complex interactions between physiological, psychological, and&#xD;
      behavioral processes, making it not only insidious, but difficult to treat. Being&#xD;
      multifaceted, fatigue impacts depression, mood, and physical activity, and can be exacerbated&#xD;
      by pain, and current treatment options target each of these correlates of fatigue. Meditation&#xD;
      has been extensively and effectively utilized in RA and other rheumatic diseases, yet, to&#xD;
      date, VR meditation has yet to be deployed in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will employ a mixed-methods design. Thirty adult outpatients with&#xD;
      clinically-diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis will be enrolled from a local rheumatology clinic&#xD;
      and utilize VR in their own home. Donning an Oculus Quest VR headset and using two handheld&#xD;
      controllers, patients will have the opportunity to choose from several virtual outdoor&#xD;
      settings, three types of meditation, and three session lengths. PROMIS measures of fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, mood, pain, and physical activity will be collected at baseline and weekly&#xD;
      intervals for the first 4 weeks, after which, an eight-week follow-up measure will be taken.&#xD;
      Semi-structured patient interviews will be used to capture patient's experience of RA,&#xD;
      fatigue, as well as experience of the virtual environment. This feasibility study's results&#xD;
      will address the acceptability, desirability, implementation, practicality, adaptation,&#xD;
      integration, expansion, and &quot;limited&quot; efficacy testing of utilizing VR meditation for&#xD;
      managing fatigue in outpatients with RA.&#xD;

    <description>Scores Range: 0-100; Uses a T-score metric in which 50 is the mean of a relevant reference population and 10 is the standard deviation (SD) of that population.&#xD;
On the T-score metric, a score of 40 is one SD lower than the mean of the reference population and a score of 60 is one SD higher than the mean of the reference population.&#xD;
PROMIS measures are scored on the T-score metric. High scores mean more of the concept being measured. PROMIS measures for fatigue will be deployed using a computer-adaptive test (CAT) that will be emailed to participants.
