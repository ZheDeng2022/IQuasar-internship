  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a restrictive lung disease characterized by impaired lung&#xD;
      function, exercise limitation and skeletal muscle dysfunction. There is limited data on&#xD;
      skeletal muscle function in ILD, most of which are focused on the lower limb muscles. The aim&#xD;
      of this study were to evaluated the change of pectoralis muscle strength and relationship of&#xD;
      pulmonary function with pectoralis muscle strength.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consisted of intervention and control groups. Thirty one patients with ILD were&#xD;
      included in the patient's group and 37 healthy volunteers in the control group. All&#xD;
      participants were selected from the geriatric population. Demographic and cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      physiotherapy assessment of all participants were performed. Lung function test, maximal&#xD;
      inspiratory and expiratory pressure and pectoralis muscle strength were measured in&#xD;
      participants of both groups. All measurements were performed once.&#xD;

    <measure>Pectoralis muscle strength test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The pectoralis muscle strength were measured with handheld dynamometer in supine position. The shoulder joint of participant was positioned at 90º abducted and at 0º internal/external rotation and the elbow joint was flexed at 90º. The other shoulder joint was fixed by the physiotherapist. While the participant performed isometrically horizontal adduction movement, the measurement was performed on the distal part of the upper arm and the contraction was sustained for at least 5 seconds by the participant. The test was performed three times and with 60 seconds rest between tests. The mean of the best value on both sides was recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Respiratory muscle strength test</measure>
    <time_frame>15 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Maximal mouth pressures were measured to evaluate respiratory muscle strength. The test was performed with mouth pressure device in sitting position. Participants breathed through a flanged mouthpiece inside the lips at near residual volume for the MIP value and near total lung capacity for MEP value . The maximum effort was sustained for at least one second. The test was repeated at least 3 times until no more than 10% difference was present between highest and previous measurements . The higest value and percentage value of predicted highest value were recorded</description>

    <description>In both groups, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and FEV1 / FVC ratio were measured with portable spirometer according to the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS). Maximal inspiratory (MIP) and expiratory pressure (MEP) were evaluated with mouth pressure device as per ATS/ERS guidelines. Sensation of dyspnea was assessed with Modified medical council research scale. Pectoralis muscle strength were measured isometrically using with digital hand held dynamometer.</description>
