  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have study medicine applied by site staff- delgocitinib cream or vehicle,&#xD;
      and then exposed to UV light. The trial is designed to find out if delgocitinib cream can&#xD;
      cause skin photoallergy after UV-light exposure in people with healthy skin.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, within-subject&#xD;
      comparison phase 1 trial in Germany.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of a screening phase, an induction phase, a rest phase, and a challenge&#xD;
      phase. There will be 2 columns of test fields on each participant's back with the 3&#xD;
      treatments in either column for a total of 6 treatments. One column of test fields will be&#xD;
      irradiated and the other will not be irradiated. All participants will be exposed to UV-light&#xD;
      on skin treated delgocitinib cream or vehicle and on untreated skin on test fields to be&#xD;
      irradiated.&#xD;

0 negative&#xD;
1 equivocal&#xD;
