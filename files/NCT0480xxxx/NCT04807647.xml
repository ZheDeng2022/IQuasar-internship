      orally by a full enteral mother hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and Time of the Study&#xD;

      orally by a full enteral mother hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Universe&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe of the study consisted of newborn babies who were born in the Bulent Ecevit&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit between 01.09.2020 and 01.03.2021&#xD;
      and who met the inclusion criteria in the study and the babies who were fed by the mother who&#xD;
      passed to the mother's room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Sample Thirty control newborn infants who volunteered to participate in the study&#xD;
      and met the inclusion criteria were formed by 30 newborns in the white noise group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Selection Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age between 34-37 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Having a birth weight of 1800-3600 g,&#xD;

      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, babies who were called to feed mothers who started to be fed orally with&#xD;
      breast milk after leaving intensive care were selected. Informed consent form, Patient&#xD;
      Identification Form and Application Registration Form, Premature Infant Comfort Scale, and&#xD;
      LATCH Breastfeeding Diagnostic Measurement Tool were used for parents who accepted to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The control group and the intervention group were first told about&#xD;
      white noise and how it could affect breastfeeding, and the Informed Volunteer form, the&#xD;
      Patient Identification Form and the Application Registration Form were filled. The mother and&#xD;
      the baby were given the appropriate position and breastfeeding was initiated. No application&#xD;
      was applied to the mother during the first breastfeeding. During the second breastfeeding, 30&#xD;
      neonatal groups were listened to the song &quot;Your Baby Don't Cry&quot; from Orhan OSMAN's album&#xD;
      &quot;Kolik&quot;. During the second breastfeeding, no music was played to the control group. After the&#xD;
      procedure was completed, the data were collected by the researcher using the Premature Baby&#xD;
      Comfort Scale, LATCH breastfeeding diagnostic measurement tool, Patient Diagnosis Form and&#xD;
      Application Registration Form. Then the data will be analyzed in the spss 16.0 package&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

    <measure>LATCH Breastfeeding Diagnostic Measurement Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 month</time_frame>
    <description>This measurement tool consists of five evaluation items, a combination of the first letters of these items. The item is between 0 and 2 points. The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is ten. The measurement tool does not have a cut-off point and the higher the LATCH score, the better the breastfeeding success is evaluated.If we look at the five criteria, breast retention, Seeing the swallowing movement of the baby, Type of nipple, Comfort of dyeing the mother's breast and nipple, Holding the baby is the position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Premature comfort scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2-6 month</time_frame>
    <description>It was developed to measure the pain and stress levels of 0-18 years old children hospitalized in the intensive care unit.&#xD;
It is considered as 7 parameters such as Physical Movement, Muscle Tone, Facial Movements and Average Heart Rate. Each group is a 5-point Likert type scored from 1 to 5, from bad to good. Accordingly, the comfort of the baby is interpreted on the total score. According to this score, 35 is the lowest and 7 the highest comfort score. A high score on the scale indicates that the baby's comfort level is low. If the total score received is 17, the cut-off value of the scale is the limit for the baby's comfort level, indicating the need for an intervention to reduce pain.</description>
