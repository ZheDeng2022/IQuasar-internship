      Objective: To compare Trans Abdominis Plane block in providing post cesarean analgesia with&#xD;
      control group, in terms of mean postoperative use of Opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized controlled trial. Place and duration Department of Anesthesiology,&#xD;
      Combined Military Hospital, Sargodha, 25th February 2021 to 25th April 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods: A total of 60 female patients, who are planned to undergo elective c&#xD;
      section and aged between 20-45 will be selected randomly and divided into two groups ( A and&#xD;
      B) with 30pts each group. In Group A, at the end of surgery, TAP block will be given with&#xD;
      20ml of 0.25%bupvicaine via ultrasound guided sub-costal approach on both sides of midline.&#xD;
      Time of TAP block will be recorded as time 0. Our outcomes will be: mean postoperative&#xD;
      consumption of opioids and VAS score within 24hrs of surgery. Independent t test will be used&#xD;
      to compare group A and B in terms of mean usage of tramadol within 24hrs of surgery. P value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;

      Analgesic efficacy of trans abdominis plane block in women undergoing Cesarean section: a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cesarean section is considered as one of the most commonly performed surgery worldwide. Based&#xD;
      on the data from 121 countries, the trend analysis showed that between 1990 and 2014, the&#xD;
      global average CS rate increased 12.4% (from 6.7% to 19.1%) with an average annual rate of&#xD;
      increase of 4.4%.Its incidence in 2010 and 2013 was 41.9% and 48% respectively which was&#xD;
      contrary to the rate of C/S recommended by the World Health Organization as fifteen percent&#xD;
      for year 2014 .Just like all other major abdominal surgeries, c section comes with severe&#xD;
      postoperative pain ,which if not managed properly can not only leads to prolonged immobility&#xD;
      and its associated adverse effects but can also affect mother-baby bonding, care of baby,&#xD;
      breast feeding and may lead to chronic pain and post-partum depression Multiple modalities&#xD;
      are available for managing this post cesarean pain. Mostly systemic opioids are used but they&#xD;
      are often associated with a number of undesirable side effects such as nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      pruritus, constipation, and respiratory depression,sedation.Other than opoids, systemic&#xD;
      NSAIDS such as ketorolac, acetoaminophen are also used but alone they may be insufficient to&#xD;
      treat post cesarean pain. Other analgesic options currently being used include local&#xD;
      anesthetic techniques (local anesthetic infiltration, neuraxial blocks) acetaminophen ,&#xD;
      cyclooxygenase-2-specific inhibitors as well as analgesic adjuncts such as steroids, ketamine&#xD;
      and α-2 agonists such as clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neruoaxial anesthesia such as lumbar or thoracic epidurals are also used but because of&#xD;
      constant and strict monitoring ,they are not considered economical for patients as well as&#xD;
      for hospitals. With recent advancements in regional anesthesia, some regional blocks are now&#xD;
      being utilized for postoperative pain relief in c sections such as TAP blocks but their use&#xD;
      is still limited because of nonavailability of sufficient data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block provides analgesia by blocking nerves in anterior&#xD;
      abdominal wall through introduction of a long-acting local anesthetic solution between the&#xD;
      internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscles. Its use in c section is still limited&#xD;
      ,but is considerd to be increased in future as is now been shown by several studies .&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of these studies is done by Uma Srivastava and collegues which showed that cumulative&#xD;
      tramadol usage during first 24 h after surgery was significantly reduced in women given TAP&#xD;
      block in comparison to control group C (75 ± 22 vs. 168 ± 45 mg in groups B and C,&#xD;
      respectively, P &lt; 0.0001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no local study is available and in the light of above mentioned studies, we proposed that&#xD;
      with bilateral TAP block after c section you can provide better analgesia and improve&#xD;
      patient's quality of life in postoperative period by reducing opoid usage and its associated&#xD;
      side effects .&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare TAP block in providing post cesarean analgesia with control group, in terms of&#xD;
      mean reduction in postoperative use of opoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block: injection of 20ml 0.25% bupvicaine given between internal oblique and transversus&#xD;
      abdominis muscle on both sides of midline with no intervention in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS (visual analogue score) : VAS , a linear scale that identifies the pain by the&#xD;
      self-report of patient, and it is considered as gold standard for evaluation of pain in&#xD;
      conscious patients 7. VAS &gt;4 trigger for inj tramadol 1mg/kg i/v.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic consumption:- postoperative consumption of injection tramadol will be measured&#xD;
      within 24hrs after surgery .&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block is a safe and effective option to control postoperative analgesia after c section&#xD;
      by reducing postoperative consumption of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized control trial Sampling technique: Consecutive non-probability&#xD;
      sampling Sample size: Using the study by Uma Srivastava at el, the results of which showed&#xD;
      efficacy of TAP block in terms of cumulative tramadol usage during first 24 h after surgery&#xD;
      in study group vs control group C as (75 ± 22 vs. 168 ± 45 mg in groups B and C ) and with&#xD;
      the help of WHO sample size calculator, following calculations were made Level of&#xD;
      significance: 5% Confidence interval: 95% Power of test: 80% Sample size=n= 6 patients in&#xD;
      each group As sample size is very small, minimum 30 pts in each group will be used Group A:&#xD;
      TAP block will be given Group B: no TAP block will be given Setting: Anesthesia department,&#xD;
      Combined Military Hospital, Sargodha ,Pakistan. Duration: After approval from ethical&#xD;
      committee Source: Admitted patient Patients will be allocated to two groups A or B, using&#xD;
      lottery method. All patients will be assessed on day of surgery and written informed consent&#xD;
      will be taken after explaining all the risks and benefits to patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day of surgery, patients will be prepared for surgery and spinal anesthesia as per&#xD;
      institutional protocols. Every patient will be given 1.5ml of 0.75% bupivacaine intrathecally&#xD;
      to provide anesthesia for c section by consultant anesthetist. During surgery no drug other&#xD;
      than oxytocin and anti-emetic (if required) will be given. In group A, at the end of surgery,&#xD;
      TAP block will be given via ultrasound guided subcostal approach on both sides of midline.&#xD;
      After strict monitoring for next 15-20mins,pt will be shifted to PACU. Time of TAP block will&#xD;
      be recorded as time 0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In ward , all patients will be given analgesia as per departmental protocol (injection&#xD;
      ketorolac 30mg i/v TDS).In postoperative period intensity of pain and opioid consumption&#xD;
      within 24hrs of surgery will be recorded. Performa till the application of TAP block will be&#xD;
      filled by treating anesthetist, whereas remaining will be filled by trainee anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After collecting all data, data would be entered and analyzed using SPSS Version 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to calculate quantitative and qualitative variables. Mean&#xD;
      and SD will be calculated for quantitative variables i.e. age weight, intensity of pain,&#xD;
      dosage of opioids. Frequency and percentage will be calculated for qualitative variables i.e.&#xD;
      gender. P value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All results would be&#xD;
      presented as frequency tables. Effect modifiers like weight and age will be controlled by&#xD;
      stratification and post stratification independent sample t test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Independent t test will be used to compare group A and B in terms of mean usage of tramadol&#xD;
      within 24hrs of surgery.&#xD;
