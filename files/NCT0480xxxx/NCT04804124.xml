  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study with an optional intervention that will examine how extreme&#xD;
      sleep durations relate to cardiovascular health, physical activity, and sleep quality by&#xD;
      studying three groups of participants: short sleepers (≤ 6 hrs), long sleepers (≥ 9 hrs), and&#xD;
      average duration sleepers (7-8 hrs). The optional intervention asks participants to maintain&#xD;
      an 8-hour per night regular sleep schedule for one week.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To test the hypothesis that vascular endothelial function in the brachial artery, and&#xD;
      other associated cardiovascular risk markers are impaired in short sleepers and long sleepers&#xD;
      as compared to the control group of average duration sleepers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that the optional intervention to maintain an 8-hour per night sleep&#xD;
      schedule will alleviate vascular endothelial function impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will measure sleep, physical activity, and blood pressure with at-home devices&#xD;
      before coming in for one in-lab visit, where they will have vascular function and blood&#xD;
      markers measured, as well as an optional CT scan to measure calcium in the coronary arteries.&#xD;
      An optional intervention may occur after this: Participants will continue the at-home&#xD;
      measures while maintaining a chosen regular 8-hour per night sleep schedule, before coming in&#xD;
      for a second in-lab visit with all same measures except for CT scan.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Coronary Atherosclerotic Burden</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Investigators may measure coronary atherosclerotic measure from a computerized tomography (CT) scan. This measure is optional for participants.&#xD;
The scan will be used to calculate coronary artery calcium score (CAC score and/or Agatston score). The CAC score indicates risk of future coronary artery events. A CAC score of 0 indicates absence of coronary artery calcification. A score of 0 is very low risk, and risk increases with increasing numbers (e.g. 100-300 is increased risk, &gt;300 is very high risk). Higher scores may indicate higher risk of future coronary events.&#xD;
The Agatston score is also an atherosclerotic measure that may indicate risk of future coronary artery events. Agatston also goes up from 1 on a linear scale (e.g. 1-100 is discreet atherosclerosis, up to 400 is moderate, &gt;400 is severe).</description>

POMS may indicate both positive and negative moods. There is a minimum score of 0, and maximum of 260. In general, lower scores indicate less mood disturbance, while higher scores indicate higher mood disturbance. Subsets of particular scores may indicate particular mood states.</description>
