  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single arm, non-randomized, multicenter phase II study to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of spartalizumab in monotherapy in metastatic patients with Programmed Death-1&#xD;
      (PD1)-high-expressing tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A molecular pre-screening will be performed to know PD1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression&#xD;
      levels on a tumor sample using the nCounter-based technology. This will be centrally&#xD;
      performed at Hospital Clinic of Barcelona. If the tumor is PD1-high (Cohort 1), as defined by&#xD;
      the pre-specified cutoff, patients (a total of 111) will receive spartalizumab 400 mg every&#xD;
      four weeks. A cohort of 30 patients with PD1-low advanced solid tumors where the efficacy of&#xD;
      PD1 inhibitors has been previously established (i.e. with a FDA or EMA monotherapy indication&#xD;
      approved) will also be recruited (cohort 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the aims of the study is to show the value of the biomarker independently of the tumor&#xD;
      histology. Thus, a wide variety of cancer-types (30 different types) will be represented.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Note: in the event that 72 hours have elapsed between the screening pregnancy test and&#xD;
             the first dose of study treatment, another pregnancy test (urine or serum) must be&#xD;
             performed and must be negative in order for subject to start receiving study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;

             that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;

&#xD;
         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the study, starting with the screening visit through 150 days&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception&#xD;
             during dosing and for 150-days after stopping treatment with spartalizumab. Highly&#xD;
             effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening). The vasectomized male&#xD;
                  partner should be the sole partner for that subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system&#xD;
                  (IUS) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Notes:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Double-barrier contraception: condom and occlusive cap (diaphragm or&#xD;
                  cervical/vault caps) with a vaginal spermicidal agent&#xD;
                  (foam/gel/cream/suppository) are not considered highly effective methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they&#xD;
                  have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate&#xD;
                  clinical profile (i.e. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have&#xD;
                  had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total&#xD;
                  hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of&#xD;
                  oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been&#xD;
                  confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
                  bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Sexually active males, unless they use a condom during intercourse while on treatment&#xD;
             and for 150 days after stopping treatment with spartalizumab should not father a child&#xD;
             in this period. A condom is required to be used by vasectomized men as well during&#xD;
             intercourse in order to prevent delivery of the drug via semen.&#xD;
