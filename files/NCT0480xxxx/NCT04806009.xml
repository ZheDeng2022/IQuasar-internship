  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia has significantly negative impact on work, quality of life, psycho-somatic health on&#xD;
      individuals and imposes substantial economic burdens on society. Mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions (MBIs) have shown its efficacy in the treatment of insomnia, however the effect&#xD;
      of online MBIs need more studies to verify. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an online MBI named 'Mindful Living With Insomnia (MLWI)' to online CBI-I for insomnia.&#xD;

      This will be an online based, randomized, controlled trial. Investigators will recruit 1000&#xD;
      participants, and will randomize and allocate participants 1:1 to the 'Mindful Living With&#xD;
      Insomnia (MLWI)' group (n=500) and the 'CBT-I' group (n=500). The Intervention will involve&#xD;
      12 sessions over 6 weeks course, 2 sessions a week and 0.5 hours per session. The primary&#xD;
      outcome will be sleep quality assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), severity&#xD;
      of insomnia symptoms assessed by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and sleep parameters&#xD;
      recorded using Mi Smart Band. The secondary outcomes include perceived stress, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and mindfulness. Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period, and at a 3-month follow-up. Analysis of covariance, regression analysis,&#xD;
      Ï‡2 test, t-test, Pearson's correlations will be applied in data analysis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The 19-item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) measured sleep quality subjectively and assesses sleep disturbances during the past month on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 -3.A lower global PSQI score indicates better sleep quality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived stress will be assessed by Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The PSS has 14 items. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale, with higher total scores indicating higher perceived stress (0-13, low perceived stress; 14-26, moderate perceived stress; 27-40, high perceived stress).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Depression will be assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). The PHQ-9 consists of 9 items and all items are rated on a 4-point scale (0 = never; 3 = always), with higher total scores indicating more severe depression. Cutoffs are 5, 10, 15, and 20 for mild, moderate, moderately severe, and severe depression, respectively. The standard cut-off score of 10 or greater maximized combined sensitivity and specificity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of mindfulness</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Mindfulness level will be assessed using Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ).FFMQ consists of 39 items which range from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The higher the total score, the more mindful the individual is.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety will be assessed using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7). The GAD-7 has 7 items for assessing the level of general anxiety.All items are rated on a 4-point scale (0 = never; 3 = always), with higher total scores indicating higher levels of anxiety, and a cutoff score &gt;6 is recommended to identify anxiety symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>change of severity of insomnia symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The 7-item ISI assesses the current severity of insomnia symptoms, sleep dissatisfaction, daytime impacts, and distress concerning difficulties with sleep on a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never; 4 = always). Total scores range from 0 to 28. Cutoffs are 8, 15, 22 for subthreshold, moderate and severe insomnia respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, the end of the 6-week Intervention Period, and at a 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Digital biomarker data such as sleep duration and quality, and daytime activity will be assessed by Mi Wristband.</description>
