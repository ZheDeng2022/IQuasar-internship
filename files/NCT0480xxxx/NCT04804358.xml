  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies suggest that patients with an history of trauma may represent a specific&#xD;
      subtype of anorexia nervosa (AM) underlined by specific neurobiological and&#xD;
      psychopathological mechanisms. Thus, AM-T subjects would manifest cognitive (specific&#xD;
      difficulties in executive functions), emotional (emotional disruption, impulsivity, etc.) and&#xD;
      neurobiological (secretion of kynurenine and neurokinins in the face of stress)&#xD;
      caracteristics different from those of AM subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will recruit a total of 100 patients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa in the&#xD;
      university hospital of Montpellier : 50 patients with an history of psychological trauma and&#xD;
      50 patients without any history of psychological trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation consists of a half-day visit. Patients will perform clinical and&#xD;
      neuropsychological assessments and an exposition test. During this test, participants will be&#xD;
      exposed, for 7 minutes, to neutral, positive or negative emotional photos. Heart rate&#xD;
      variability will be determined through a Biopac MP160 before, during and after this event.&#xD;
      Saliva samples to measure kynurenin, tryptophan, substance P and neurokinin-1 will be&#xD;
      collected before and directly after the test.&#xD;

    <description>We aim to assess the link between emotional regulation and psychological trauma in AN. DERS is a self-assessment scale measuring emotion dysregulation. The original DERS includes 36 items scored 1-5 where 1 is almost never, 2 is sometimes, 3 is about half the time, 4 is most of the time, and 5 is almost always. Of the 36 items, 11 are reverse scored. The DERS-36 yields a total score as well as six subscales where higher scores indicate more difficulties.</description>

    <intervention_name>Exposition Test</intervention_name>
    <description>During this test (7 minutes) participants will be exposed to photos evoking positive or negative emotions (anger, disgust, sadness and fear) interspersed with emotionally neutral photos.&#xD;
The test sequence is composed of 3 blocks as follows:&#xD;
12 photos evoking positive emotions (2 min)&#xD;
Pause of 30 seconds (white screen)&#xD;
12 photos presenting a neutral emotional valence (2 min)&#xD;
Pause of 30 seconds (white screen)&#xD;
12 photos evoking negative emotions (2min)&#xD;
In each block, photos will be selected and presented to the participant in a randomized and sequential manner. In total, 30 photos will be presented in 7 minutes to each participant (10 seconds per photo).&#xD;
The participant must be at rest in front of the computer screen during these 7 minutes with optimal visibility. The photos will be presented sequentially using software (E-Prime or Visual Basic 6.0). During this exposure test, a heart rate recording will be made using a BIOPAC MP160 recording system.</description>
