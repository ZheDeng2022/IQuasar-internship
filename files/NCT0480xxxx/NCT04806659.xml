  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An open label single-arm clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, PD, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of SH1573 in subjects with advanced relapsed, refractory acute&#xD;
      myelogenous leukemia that harbor an IDH2 mutation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SH1573 is an IDH2 mutation inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1, open-label, multicenter, single-arm study to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, PK, PD, and preliminary efficacy of SH1573 capsules in treatment of subjects&#xD;
      with advanced relapsed, refractory acute myeloid leukemias (AML) that harbor an IDH2&#xD;
      mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 parts: a dose-escalation part (Phase Ia) and a dose-expansion part&#xD;
      (Phase Ib). The dose-escalation part will determine the MTD/R2PD. The dose-expansion part&#xD;
      will administer the MTD/RP2D to subjects with mIDH2-positive AML.&#xD;
