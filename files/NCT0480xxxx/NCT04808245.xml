      The study &quot;A MultIceNTER Phase I Peptide VaCcine Trial to Exploit NeoePitope-Specific T Cells&#xD;
      for the Treatment of H3K27M-Mutated Gliomas - (INTERCEPT H3)&quot; is a non-controlled,&#xD;
      open-label, single arm, multicenter phase I trial involving patients with gliomas carrying an&#xD;
      H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient population will be molecularly defined and include adult patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed K27M-mutant histone-3.1 (H3.1K27M) or histone-3.3 (H3.3K27M) diffuse midline&#xD;
      gliomas (DMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this trial, a long peptide vaccine containing a K27M-mutated histone-3 sequence, will&#xD;
      be administered subcutaneously in addition to standard radiotherapy and thereafter in&#xD;
      combination with the human anti-PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifteen patients (pts. 1-15) will receive 11 doses of H3K27M peptide vaccine in total&#xD;
      starting with standard radiotherapy (RT) and 14 doses of the human anti-PD-L1 antibody&#xD;
      Atezolizumab (every three weeks, q3w) starting four weeks after completion of RT. The first 3&#xD;
      vaccines will be given bi-weekly (q2w) in combination with RT. One dose of vaccination will&#xD;
      be given at the beginning of recovery (RE) period following RT. Vaccines 5-11 (q6w) will be&#xD;
      initiated with Atezolizumab after completion of RE. In a safety lead-in, the first three&#xD;
      patients (pts. 1-3) will be enrolled sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the last IMP administration, a safety / immunogenicity follow-up is planned for 24&#xD;
      weeks until end of study (EOS). To be able to assess safety, tolerability and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of the peptide vaccine in combination with Atezolizumab 15 evaluable patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffuse gliomas of the thalamus, brain stem, spinal cord or other midline structures&#xD;
      represent 3-4% of high-grade glioma and harbor H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M mutations as a&#xD;
      characteristic founder mutation in &gt; 70% of cases. H3K27M-mutant gliomas typically occur in&#xD;
      children and adolescents but also in adult patients. After biopsy or resection, the standard&#xD;
      of care consists of involved-field radiotherapy. Adding alkylating chemotherapy to&#xD;
      radiotherapy does not offer additional benefit in retrospective case series and prospective&#xD;
      clinical trials in children with pontine gliomas, probably as hypermethylation of the MGMT&#xD;
      promoter in DMG is typically lacking. After radiotherapy gliomas frequently recur with a&#xD;
      median 12-month progression-free survival of 20 %. Importantly, at recurrence particularly in&#xD;
      the adult patient population, there is frequent distant progression and leptomeningeal&#xD;
      dissemination, arguing for the necessity of systemic therapy upfront.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From an immunological point of view H3K27M represents an attractive tumor antigen&#xD;
      specifically expressed in tumor but not normal cells. Patients with H3K27M-mutant gliomas may&#xD;
      harbor mutation-specific T cells, indicating that H3K27M is specifically presented to and&#xD;
      recognized by the immune system in a mutation-specific manner. Vaccination of humanized mice&#xD;
      with a long H3K27M vaccine results in an anti-tumor immune response effective in controlling&#xD;
      H3K27M-expressing tumors in a preventive and a therapeutic manner without causing toxicity.&#xD;
      In addition, eight adult patients with H3.3K27M-mutated gliomas were treated with an H3K27M&#xD;
      27 amino acid long peptide vaccine on a compassionate-use basis. None of the patients treated&#xD;
      either with the peptide vaccine alone or in combination with an anti-human PD(L)-1 antibody&#xD;
      showed any clinical or laboratory sign of treatment-related toxicity except for grade 1&#xD;
      injection site reactions. Importantly, all patients developed H3K27M-specific T cell&#xD;
      responses with one patient of the combination treatment group showing long-term response with&#xD;
      no sign of tumor progression for &gt;24 months after vaccination and one patient experiencing&#xD;
      complete response after pseudoprogression (unpublished observations). Based on these&#xD;
      observations we hypothesize that checkpoint inhibition targeting PD-L1 is required for&#xD;
      optimal amplification of a vaccine-induced H3K27M-specific T cell response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase I trial is to evaluate the safety and immune response to the H3K27M&#xD;
      peptide vaccine in combination with Atezolizumab in patients with H3K27M-mutant diffuse&#xD;
      midline gliomas.&#xD;

             H3.3K27M-mutated diffuse midline glioma WHO grade IV (with or without measurable&#xD;
             residual tumor after tumor resection or biopsy after primary diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumoral H3.1K27M or H3.3K27M mutation proven by immunohistochemistry or H3 DNA&#xD;
             sequencing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous treatment except for surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 30 mL/min according to the Cockcroft-Gault formula&#xD;
             (or local institutional standard method)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Availability of tumor tissue for translational analyses (FFPE bulk tissue or biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients are scheduled to receive radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should be immunocompetent (i.e. no concomitant treatment with dexamethasone&#xD;
             (or equivalent), or receive stable/decreasing steroid levels not exceeding 2 mg/day&#xD;
             dexamethasone (or equivalent) during the last 3 days prior to clinical screening; no&#xD;
             severe lymphopenia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  minimum 18 years old, smoking or non-smoking, of any ethnic origin and sex&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky Performance Status minimum 60. For patients with spinal gliomas,&#xD;
             paralysis-caused mobility impairments will not be considered&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of patient to understand character and individual consequences of the clinical&#xD;
             trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of informed consent document personally signed and dated by the patient (or a&#xD;
             witness in case the patient is unable to write) covering all trial-related procedures&#xD;
             and indicating that the patient has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the&#xD;
             study and that the patient consents to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-nursing and non-pregnant women: Women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have&#xD;
             a negative urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L or equivalent units of&#xD;
             HCG) prior to the start of the investigational medicinal product (IMP). A woman is&#xD;
             considered of childbearing potential, i.e. fertile, following menarche and until&#xD;
             becoming post-menopausal unless permanently sterile. Permanent sterilization methods&#xD;
             include hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy and bilateral oophorectomy. A&#xD;
             postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative&#xD;
             medical cause. In case of possible postmenopausal status or doubtful childbearing&#xD;
             potential, assessment of serum FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) level will be&#xD;
             performed once at baseline visit to confirm postmenopausal status. In this case, urine&#xD;
             pregnancy tests during the trial as well as contraception are not necessary. However,&#xD;
             in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  WOCBP must be using a highly effective method of birth control (failure rate of less&#xD;
             than 1% per year) to avoid pregnancy throughout the study and at least 5 months after&#xD;
             the last dose of the IMP. Such methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  combined (estrogen and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception associated&#xD;
                  with inhibition of ovulation: oral intravaginal transdermal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation:&#xD;
                  oral injectable implantable&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  intrauterine hormone-releasing system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  bilateral tubal occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  vasectomised partner&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  sexual abstinence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile men must be willing and able to use an effective method of birth control&#xD;
             (condom) throughout the study for up to at least 5 months after the last dose of the&#xD;
             IMP, if their sexual partners are WOCBP, using an effective method as well (acceptable&#xD;
             methods see above). A man is considered fertile after puberty unless permanently&#xD;
             sterile by bilateral orchidectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Previous or concurrent standard or experimental treatment for the tumor other than&#xD;
             resection. This includes local therapies such as interstitial radiotherapy or local&#xD;
