      The aim of this study is Evaluation of the efficacy &amp; toxicity of concurrent paclitaxel and&#xD;
      breast radiotherapy and assesment of overall survival &amp; progression free survival&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the recent years , breast cancer remains the most common cancer in women in the world .&#xD;
      With nearly 107 Million new Cases diagnosed in 2012 (second most common cancer over all) .&#xD;
      this represent about 12 % of all new cancer cases and 25 % of all cancers in women . By&#xD;
      contrast the mortality rate has declined dramatically since the introduction of adjuvant&#xD;
      systemic therapy &amp; radiation therapy, which are now used extensively for their established&#xD;
      benefit in local (radiotherapy ) ,survival without metastasis (chemotherapy) and overall&#xD;
      survival of both of them . However , the optimal sequence of chemotherapy &amp; radiotherapy&#xD;
      remain controversial three sequence were investigated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Delivering all radiotherapy first .&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A &quot; Sandwich &quot; approach .&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Delivering all chemotherapy first . Observational studies have suggested that delaying&#xD;
           initiation of chemotherapy increase the incidence of distant metastasis &amp; delaying the&#xD;
           initiation therapy more than 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis might increase risk&#xD;
           of local regional recurrence . Concurrent chemoradiation therapy has an advantage of&#xD;
           shortening the duration of therapy , allowing radiotherapy &amp; chemotherapy to start&#xD;
           temporally and potentially improving local control via radiation sensitizing effect of&#xD;
           chemotherapy.The feasibility of concurrent radiotherapy with taxane, which constitute a&#xD;
           standard treatment used as adjuvant therapy has been evaluated in stage II,III breast&#xD;
           cancer. Taxane Promote stabilization of microtubules causing cell cycle arrest in G2/M&#xD;
           junction and serve as radio sensitizing agents.In a prospective study using Paclitaxel &amp;&#xD;
           radiotherapy concurrently Paclitaxel given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles the authors&#xD;
           concluded that Concurrent chemoradiation therapy improve local control with acceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
