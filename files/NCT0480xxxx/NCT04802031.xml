  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of isatuximab given as a rapid-infusion in treating&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment&#xD;
      (refractory). Isatuximab, also known as Sarclisa, is an antibody (proteins that can protect&#xD;
      the body from foreign organisms, such as bacteria and viruses) directed against cluster of&#xD;
      differentiation 38 (CD38), a receptor antigen (a receptor or protein on the outside of blood&#xD;
      cells that can be used as a target). Isatuximab may stop the growth of some blood cancers.&#xD;
      Normally, the fastest that intravenous isatuximab can be given - for patients who have not&#xD;
      had any reactions to their first two doses - is over 1 hour and 15 minutes. This study is&#xD;
      designed to test whether intravenous isatuximab can be given over 30 minutes (&quot;rapid&#xD;
      infusion&quot;) among patients who have not developed any reactions to at least 2 prior doses of&#xD;
      intravenous isatuximab at normal speeds. If shown to be safe, &quot;rapid infusion&quot; isatuximab may&#xD;
      ultimately improve the patient experience while reducing the overall cost of the infusion.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the incidence of grade 2 or higher (Gr2+) infusion-related reactions (IRRs)&#xD;
      with rapid-infusion (RI) isatuximab across 6 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate time savings with RI isatuximab (versus estimated standard of care [SOC]&#xD;
      isatuximab duration lengths) across 6 doses of isatuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must have received standard of care isatuximab IV over for at least 2 doses without&#xD;
      any Gr2+ IRRs reported. Patients will then receive a rapid infusion of isatuximab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes. If a &gt;=Grade 2 iRR occurs, then participants will revert to a SOC infusion time and&#xD;
      be taken off the study. If a Grade 1 or no IRR occurs, then participants will receive another&#xD;
      rapid infusion of 30 minutes and assessed again for IRRs. Rapid infusions and IRR assessment&#xD;
      after each RI will continue for up to at least 6 doses or until the patient experiences an&#xD;
      Grade 2 or higher IRR.&#xD;
