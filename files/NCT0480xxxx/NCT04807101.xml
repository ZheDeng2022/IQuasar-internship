  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a noninferiority study designed to examine whether conscious sedation with midazolam&#xD;
      alone results in efficacy and safety that is not inferior to the combination of midazolam and&#xD;
      fentanyl. English-speaking patients ≥18 years old and ≤75 years old presenting for GI&#xD;
      endoscopy planned with conscious sedation using midazolam and fentanyl, will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 to single agent sedation with midazolam or combination sedation with midazolam and&#xD;
      fentanyl. Participants will be blinded to the choice of sedation. Sedation quality and&#xD;
      adverse events will be measured with a validated patient-centered measure of procedural&#xD;
      sedation quality, the PROcedural Sedation Assessment Survey (PROSAS) [Leffler, et al.&#xD;
      Gastrointest Endosc. 2015;81(1):194-203]. Endoscopic quality measures in the 2 study groups&#xD;
      will be collected by retrospective chart review, as an additional metric to ensure the&#xD;
      quality of the procedure is not compromised by the choice of sedation.&#xD;

    <description>Level of discomfort during the procedure as assessed by the previously validated PROcedural Sedation Assessment Survey (PROSAS) questionnaire [Leffler, et al. Gastrointest Endosc. 2015;81(1):194-203]. The patient will answer the question &quot;How much discomfort did you experience during the procedure?&quot; A visual analog scale will be used ranging from 0 to 10 with higher numbers indicating more pain.</description>

    <description>Adequacy of sedation as assessed by the previously validated PROcedural Sedation Assessment Survey (PROSAS) questionnaire [Leffler, et al. Gastrointest Endosc. 2015;81(1):194-203]. The patient will answer the question &quot;If having this procedure again in the future, how much sedation would you prefer to have?&quot; A visual analog scale will be used ranging from -5 to 5, with lower numbers indicating a preference for less sedation in the future and higher numbers indicating a preference for more sedation in the future.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in pain pre and post procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <description>Difference in level of pain felt prior to the procedure versus after the procedure as assessed by the previously validated PROcedural Sedation Assessment Survey (PROSAS) questionnaire [Leffler, et al. Gastrointest Endosc. 2015;81(1):194-203]. The patient will rate the level of pain felt prior to the procedure and after the procedure, using 2 visual analog scales both ranging from 0 to 10 with higher numbers indicating more pain. The pain score for prior to the procedure will be subtracted from the pain score for after the procedure with the resulting number giving a score for the difference in pain pre and post procedure. A positive number indicates more pain post procedure and a negative number indicates less pain post procedure.</description>
