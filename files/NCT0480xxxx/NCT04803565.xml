  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the efficacy of custom-made shoe insoles, for subjects with&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do that, a sample of PD subjects has been randomly assigned to an intervention group that&#xD;
      will receive the custom-made insoles or a control group that will receive a sham insole&#xD;
      without any specific manufacturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy according to PD&#xD;
      rehabilitation guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal outcome will be the Time Up&amp;Go test time, secondary outcomes 10 Meters Walking&#xD;
      test speed, Berg Balance Scale score, SF12 score, and orthesis liking.&#xD;
