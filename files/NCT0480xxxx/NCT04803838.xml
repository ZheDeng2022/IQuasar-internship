  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of this project is to demonstrate an association between gut and oral microbiota&#xD;
      and their metabolites to carotid atherosclerosis and risk of ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to show that these metabolite levels are diet-dependent (mainly egg&#xD;
      yalk and red meat) and associated with specific types of microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators to assess serum microbiota metabolite levels as a predictor of stroke and&#xD;
      plaque progression for patients with carotid atherosclerosis.&#xD;

      The Project will include four studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 1: (Comparative cross-sectional study) The main objective in this study is to assess if&#xD;
      patients with carotid atherosclerosis have increased serum levels gut microbiota dependent&#xD;
      metabolites compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done on prospectively collected information already available in our&#xD;
      existing database. Approximately 215 patients will be included in this study where collected&#xD;
      samples will be analyzed and levels of metabolites quantified. These metabolite levels will&#xD;
      be compared to a control group of 70 healthy controls without carotid atherosclerosis&#xD;
      (verified by ultrasound), cardiovascular outcome defined as stroke/TIA or vascular death, as&#xD;
      well as traditional risk factors for ischemic stroke (diabetes, hypertension, smoking and&#xD;
      coronary artery disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 2: (Comparative cross-sectional study) The aim of this study is to asses if microbiota&#xD;
      and microbiota metabolite Levels are Associated With certain types of diet, in particular&#xD;
      Rich in red meat and egg yalk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 215 patients with ultrasound verified carotid atherosclerosis with or without&#xD;
      symptoms of TIA/stroke will be compared to 70 controls. Dietary intake and food habits will&#xD;
      be recorded using the SmartDiet questionnaire developed by 'Lipidklinikken Rikshospitalet'.&#xD;
      Feces, saliva and blood will be collected analyzed for microbiota and metabolites.&#xD;
      Antroprometrics, blood pressure and pulse will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy and immunohistochemical analysis will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 3: (Comparative cross-sectional study) The aim of this study is to evaluate correlation&#xD;
      between the microbiota and microbiota metabolite Levels With other inflammatory markers in&#xD;
      blood, as well as known risk factors for stroke and inflammation on imaging modalities&#xD;
      (ultrasound, 3-T MRI and PET/CT) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, 215 patients with ultrasound verified carotid atherosclerosis with or without&#xD;
      symptoms of TIA/stroke will be compared to 70 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo investigations with carotid ultrasound, carotid and cerebral MR&#xD;
      imaging, blood tests including inflammatory biomarkers. A sub-group of patients will in&#xD;
      addition undergo PET/CT imaging of carotid arteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study 4: (Follow up study) The aim of this study is to evaluate the ability of microbiota and&#xD;
      microbiota metabolites to predict ischemic stroke in patient With carotid stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in study 2 and 3 will be followed up after 2 years with repetition of&#xD;
      investigations. Findings with serum levels of microbiota metabolites, traditional risk&#xD;
      factors and imaging will be correlated to clinical and radiological ischemic events and&#xD;
      plaque progression.&#xD;
