  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility of the Lumme smartphone&#xD;
      app for smoking cessation in people living with HIV (PLWH) and evaluate its effect on smoking&#xD;
      cessation. Mobile health (mHealth) technology can be used for achieving health equity in&#xD;
      vulnerable groups because it is a widely available and relatively inexpensive tool for health&#xD;
      behavior change and can be adapted to meet the needs of its end-users. Therefore, a mHealth&#xD;
      intervention such as the Lumme App proposed through this study is timely, relevant, scalable&#xD;
      and likely to improve health outcomes in PLWH who smoke.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Of the approximately one million persons living with HIV (PLWH) in the United States (U.S.),&#xD;
      it is estimated that between 40-70% smoke cigarettes, at least three times the prevalence&#xD;
      (14%) observed in the general U.S. adult population. Consequently, PLWH experience&#xD;
      substantial tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. In PLWH, after achieving and maintaining&#xD;
      a suppressed viral load, smoking cessation is the next most important health behavior to&#xD;
      maximize both quality of life and life expectancy. Given the high prevalence of cigarette&#xD;
      smoking among PLWH and the benefit of smoking cessation, there is an urgent need for swift&#xD;
      action to intervene to reduce tobacco use rates. However, evidence to improve tobacco&#xD;
      cessation among PLWH is inadequate. Given the need for improving smoking cessation in PLWH,&#xD;
      and the great promise of mHealth tools, this research study will assess smoking behaviors in&#xD;
      people living with HIV and the subsequent efficacy of mHealth intervention for improving&#xD;
      tobacco cessation.&#xD;

    <description>Technology Acceptance: The Perceived Ease of Use and Potential Usefulness Questionnaire (PSSUQ) is a 14-item questionnaire that provides a method for assessing participants' perception of the usefulness of the technology. Items are scored such that higher values indicate more positive perception, where the maximum total score is 70.</description>

    <description>Technology Acceptance: The Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES) consists of 20 items rated on a five-point Likert scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5). A higher scale value indicates higher perceived usability of the technology.</description>
