  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comorbidities associated with severe obesity determine an important public health problem.&#xD;
      Few methods are considered potentially effective for the treatment of severe obesity and the&#xD;
      clinical relevance of bariatric surgery is growing, as well as the number of procedures&#xD;
      performed. The insertion of the physiotherapist in the multiprofessional team responsible for&#xD;
      performing the surgical procedure is essential from the preoperative screening and evaluation&#xD;
      to the prevention and treatment of postoperative complications. Therefore, the&#xD;
      physiopathological aspects involved with severe obesity, the technical aspects and risks of&#xD;
      the surgical procedure, as well as the physiotherapeutic techniques that have scientific&#xD;
      proof must be known by the physiotherapist responsible for the surgical follow-up of the&#xD;
      patient. In this context, the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in the postoperative&#xD;
      period of bariatric surgery has ample therapeutic potential. The present research project&#xD;
      aims to evaluate the immediate prophylactic use of NIV on the respiratory and functional&#xD;
      recovery of the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be performed at the surgical center of the Hospital de Clínicas of Porto&#xD;
      Alegre. After approval by the Research Ethics Committee, patients must sign the Term of&#xD;
      Consent for inclusion in the study. A blinded investigator will record clinical,&#xD;
      anthropometric, pulmonary function tests, and functional measures. Patients submitted to open&#xD;
      bariatric surgery will be divided into two groups for the use of NIV: immediate&#xD;
      post-extubation (IG) and non-intervention (standard group [GP]). Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the groups. All subjects will undergo general anesthesia and postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia, using a standardized surgical team approach. Patients who present the&#xD;
      contraindication criteria for the use of NIV will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the surgical procedure and extubation, GP subjects will receive oxygen therapy through&#xD;
      a nasal cannula with 4 to 6 L / min of oxygen according to the team routine and patient need.&#xD;
      The subjects in the immediate intervention group (GI) will be extubated and placed in NIV the&#xD;
      moment they enter the recovery room through a portable ventilator (Esprit ® or BiPAP Vision&#xD;
      ®, Respironics) in face mask. The parameters will be adjusted as follows: FiO2 = 50%,&#xD;
      positive expiratory pressure (EPAP, starting at 4-6 cmH2O and adjusting 1-2 cmH2O to avoid&#xD;
      snoring, apnea, paradoxical breathing and desaturations) and adjusted inspiratory positive&#xD;
      pressure (IPAP) to maintain a tidal volume of 400 to 500 ml, maintaining IPAP &lt;15cmH2O17.&#xD;
      Individuals will receive this ventilatory support for 1 hour. After this period the patients&#xD;
      will be submitted to the same care of GP patients. Measurement of respiratory muscle strength&#xD;
      and lung function will be recorded in Time 1 (in the preoperative period), Time 2 (at the&#xD;
      time of entry of the recovery room) and Time 3 (1 hour after extubation, with withdrawal of&#xD;
      the support ventilatory). Vital signs (heart rate, peripheral O2 Saturation and Blood&#xD;
      Pressure) will also be recorded through the multi-parameter monitor (IntelliVue MP40).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional evaluation will be performed in the period of the initial data collection&#xD;
      through the Functional Status Score for the ICU (FSS-ICU) and Functional Independence Measure&#xD;
      (MIF). Patients will be monitored during the hospitalization period until hospital discharge&#xD;
      and records of postoperative complications (radiological changes, infections and surgical&#xD;
      anastomosis fistulas) will be recorded by blinded evaluator. The final evaluation will be&#xD;
      done through the MIF, through telephone contact 1 month after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study participation patients may present with discomfort, nausea, vomiting and /&#xD;
      or pain related to the use of non-invasive ventilation and procedures performed to evaluate&#xD;
      muscle strength, lung function and functionality. In a study with methodology and similar&#xD;
      population, such risks / complications were not reported16, however, if they occur, the&#xD;
      procedures will be immediately interrupted and patients will be assisted by the study&#xD;
      researchers in order to preserve the patients and the reliability of the results.&#xD;
