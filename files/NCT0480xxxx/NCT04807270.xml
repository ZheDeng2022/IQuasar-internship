  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to determine the effects of intra-articular Platelet Rich Plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) prepared with two different techniques on pain intensity, functional status, quality of&#xD;
      life, functional balance and femoral cartilage thickness in patients with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common form of chronic joint disease. Platelet Rich Plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) is an injection therapy used to treat chronic painful musculoskeletal conditions,&#xD;
      including knee OA. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single blind, interventional&#xD;
      study, a total of 75 patients with stage 2-3 knee osteoarthritis according to the kellgren&#xD;
      lawrence classification who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups using&#xD;
      computer-generated random numbers.The patients to be included in the study will be randomized&#xD;
      into three groups and the first group will be given platelet-rich plasma (PRP) prepared with&#xD;
      T-LAB / PRP KIT, the second group will be given PRP prepared with T-LAB PRP INJECTION&#xD;
      SYRINGA, and the third group will be given saline injection. Home exercise program for knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis will be given to all three groups and the exercise program will be followed by&#xD;
      weekly phone calls. During the follow-up period, patients will be asked to continue their&#xD;
      current medical treatments, not to make changes in their activities of daily living.&#xD;
      Participants are going to evaluate before injection, and at the 1-month follow-up and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain during activity, at rest, and&#xD;
      at night, with the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)&#xD;
      change in pain, stiffness and physical function score, the change in the Timed Up and Go Test&#xD;
      (TUG) time, change in femoral cartilage thickness measurement by ultrasound and the change in&#xD;
      the patient's daily activities with the numerical global patient assessment scale.&#xD;

    <description>Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) measures knee pain, stiffness, and physical function. The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-20 for Pain, 0-8 for Stiffness, and 0-68 for Physical Function. The sum of the scores for the three subscales gives a total WOMAC score. High scores are associated with more pain, stiffness, and poor function, while low scores indicate well-being.</description>

    <description>The Timed Up and Go test requires the person to stand up from a standard chair in which they are sitting, walk 3 m at a comfortable speed to the marked place on the floor, turn around, walk backwards to the starting point and return to the sitting position in the chair. The time taken for the person to complete the test is measured in seconds. The timing of the test is related to the function.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline femoral cartilage thickness measurement by ultrasound at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6-month</time_frame>
    <description>Distal femoral cartilage thickness will be evaluated by the same clinician using the MyLab60 model ultrasonography device and high-resolution 7-12 MHz linear probe available in our clinic. During the measurement, patients will be positioned in the prone position with their knees in full flexion and ankles in neutral to examine the distal femoral cartilage, and the probe will be placed in the axial position in the suprapatellar area at the outer edge of the patella. After the distal femoral cartilage is anechogenically imaged between the hyperechogenic bony cortex and suprapatellar fat, the distance between the thin hyperechoic line of the synovial cavity on the stratified face and the hyperechoic sharp line on the bony face of the cartilage will be measured and recorded as the thickness of the cartilage. Cartilage thickness measurements for each intervention knee will be recorded by recording three measurements from the midpoint: lateral condyle, intercondylar area and medial condyle.</description>
