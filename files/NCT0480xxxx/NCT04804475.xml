  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity plays an indispensable role to lead a healthy life. Square-stepping&#xD;
      exercises (SSE) are aerobic exercises. Our study was designed to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      square-stepping exercise training on the attention, dynamic balance and lower extremity motor&#xD;
      coordination of sedentary healthy young individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 112 volunteers within the age range of 20-25 participated in the research.&#xD;
      Participants were randomly divided into two groups, as 56 participants were study group (28&#xD;
      females, 28 males) and 56 participants were control group (28 females, 28 males). Demographic&#xD;
      data and exercise habit of the individuals were documented. Stroop Test was used to assess&#xD;
      Attention, Four-step Square Test was used to assess Dynamic Balance and Lower-extremity Motor&#xD;
      Coordination Test was used to assess Motor Coordination. Throughout 3 weeks SSE training was&#xD;
      administered 4 days a week for a length of 45 minutes in each session. All the analyses were&#xD;
      conducted at the start and at the end of 3-week long training.&#xD;

    <description>SSE is performed on a thin exercise mat divided into 40 small squares in 250 cm x 100 cm of size (25 cm each part). Participants are given patterns of a few steps and asked to take steps that match them. Participants must, in principal, move ahead in line with the length forward with no contact on the lines forming the squares. Forward, backward, lateral and oblique stepping patterns are required. Stepping patterns get increasingly difficult. Each pattern consists of 2 to 16 steps; participants are asked to repeat step pattern till the end of exercise mat. Upon completing a pattern, another pattern in the same mirror-image is repeated. In essence each pattern is reiterated for 3-5 times and next its mirror-image pattern is repeated but if participants face challenge in performing the pattern it is repeated till the pattern is learnt</description>
