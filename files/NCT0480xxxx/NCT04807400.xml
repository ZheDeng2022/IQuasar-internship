  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to find out if a study treatment called Inclisiran can be given&#xD;
      in regional primary care setting (i.e. at a GP surgery in the NHS) in the UK, and to&#xD;
      understand how this health care service may be set-up by the NHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclisiran, also known as KJX839, is a medication made to reduce the level of &quot;bad&quot;&#xD;
      cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol) in the blood. Inclisiran works in a way that makes the liver&#xD;
      produce less of a substance called 'PCSK9'. PCSK9 reduces the ability of the liver to remove&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol from the blood. By lowering the production of PCSK9, Inclisiran leads to more&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol being removed by the liver from the blood, thereby reducing LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      overall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 900 patients will participate in this study, at about 20 GP surgeries across the&#xD;
      Greater Manchester area within the UK.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using implementation science methodology, the study seeks to assess the effect of 9 months&#xD;
      treatment with inclisiran with or without behavioural support, compared to standard of care&#xD;
      with behavioural support, on LDL-C reduction, total lipid profile, assessments of patient and&#xD;
      healthcare professional (HCP) satisfaction, health-care resource utilisation and healthcare&#xD;
      service process evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate superiority of inclisiran +/-&#xD;
      behavioural support compared to standard of care + behavioural support in a primary care&#xD;
      setting, in reducing the percentage change in LDL-C from baseline to Day 270 in adults with&#xD;
      elevated LDL-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking part in the study, will do so for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking part in the study will be randomised to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continue your current lipid lowering medication, plus a telephone-based lifestyle&#xD;
           support programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Continue your current lipid lowering medication, plus Inclisiran&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continue your current lipid lowering medication, plus Inclisiran and plus a&#xD;
           telephone-based lifestyle support programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients assigned to group 2 or 3 who will receive Inclisiran, this will be given&#xD;
      as an injection from a pre-filled syringe. The patients will be given Inclisiran twice during&#xD;
      the study, once at the start of the study on day 1 and a second time 3 months later at day&#xD;
      90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those patients assigned to group 1 or 3 they will receive a telephone-based lifestyle&#xD;
      support programme. Support will be provided to patients through monthly telephone-based&#xD;
      support calls, from a health care professional and health advisors. During the calls, support&#xD;
      will be offered to ensure patients understand their cardiovascular disease diagnosis and how&#xD;
      to implement lifestyle changes that may reduce their risk.&#xD;
