  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Dielectrics Properties of Thoracic Malignancies Study (DPTMS) is to&#xD;
      provide a wealth of knowledge for investigators involved in establishing a new and effective&#xD;
      treatment for a variety of solid tumors using tumor treatment fields. It is intended to&#xD;
      provide biospecimen (tumor/healthy) together with demographic data (age, sex, race,&#xD;
      occupational history, and other epidemiologic information), and clinical data (stage,&#xD;
      treatment, survival information, and annotated CT's). Our specific aims are to test the&#xD;
      following hypotheses: 1) Electric properties of thoracic tumors differ from electric&#xD;
      properties of surrounding healthy tissue 2) Different tumor types will have different&#xD;
      electric properties 3) Electric properties of individual tumors are heterogeneous 4) Electric&#xD;
      properties of tumors are related to the structure and composition of the underlying tissue 5)&#xD;
      Use of standard medical imaging data (CT) will permit mapping of electric properties.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Thoracic malignancies represent a significant burden of disease in the US population. Lung&#xD;
      cancer, for example, is the most common cause of cancer mortality in the US among both men&#xD;
      and women and long-term survival remains poor with a 5-year survival rate less than 20%.&#xD;
      There is significant need for additional therapeutic options for all stages of patients.&#xD;
      Esophageal cancer, although less common in the US with an incidence of 1% among new cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis, also has significant mortality with a similar survival rate of about 20% at 5&#xD;
      years. There are a variety of additional thoracic malignancies that contribute to morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality of the US population including mesothelioma and other pleural based cancers and&#xD;
      thymoma. All of these thoracic malignancies pose unique challenges that have limited the&#xD;
      effectiveness of current therapies, necessitating the development of new and innovative&#xD;
      approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor treatment fields (TTF) have recently been established as a new and effective treatment&#xD;
      for a variety of solid tumor malignancies. TTF provides a unique ability to deliver targeted&#xD;
      and sustained therapy via an LCR meter. TTF has shown promise for some of the most aggressive&#xD;
      malignancies such as glioblastoma and therefore should be considered for aggressive thoracic&#xD;
      malignancies as well. In order to develop a TTF protocol that is both efficient and&#xD;
      efficacious, the electric field properties of target tumors must be understood. Although well&#xD;
      established for some tumors, the complete electric properties of thoracic malignancies as&#xD;
      they apply to TTF is still not fully understood. The proposed project is to address this gap&#xD;
      of knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our plan is to analyze 3-5 tissue probes acquired from 30 patients with a variety of thoracic&#xD;
      malignancies. Tissue will be acquired in the operating room and will be analyzed immediately.&#xD;
      The investigators will plan to acquire tissue from each type of malignancy including: lung&#xD;
      cancer, esophageal cancer and pleural based tumors. After acquisition of data, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess the data and continue to acquire patients to obtain significant&#xD;
      estimates of overall tissue properties in each type of tumor. The investigators will offer&#xD;
      all patients at our center undergoing resection of thoracic malignancies the opportunity to&#xD;
      participate in the study. After undergoing an informed consent process in accordance with IRB&#xD;
      approval, patients with be formally enrolled. The LCR meter used for electric property&#xD;
      analysis of the tissue will be positioned on and secured to a movable cart so that it can be&#xD;
      brought to the operating room for rapid tissue analysis following surgical excision of the&#xD;
      tumor. Impedance measurements will be collected on multiple sections of excised tissue and&#xD;
      will be translated into dielectric properties. All tumor electric property data will be&#xD;
      stored securely and remain anonymous of patient identifying data.&#xD;
