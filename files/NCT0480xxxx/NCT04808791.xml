&#xD;
          2. Histologically documented locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma&#xD;
             not previously treated with palliative systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must be capable of providing consent to enrolment and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a performance status of ECOG 0-1 will be eligible for enrolment (see&#xD;
             appendix 1).&#xD;

             pregnancy test at the time of screening. WOCBP is defined as any female who has&#xD;
             experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or&#xD;
             bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral salpingectomy) and is not postmenopausal.&#xD;
             Menopause is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 years in the&#xD;

             highly effective method of birth control is defined as those that result in low&#xD;
             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Note:&#xD;
             abstinence is acceptable if this is established and preferred contraception for the&#xD;
             patient and is accepted as a local standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female patients who are breast-feeding should discontinue nursing prior to the first&#xD;
             dose of study treatment and until 30 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;

             least 6 months after last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Absence of any condition hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow- up&#xD;

             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients may have received prior surgery if this surgery was ≥ 4 weeks before study&#xD;
             entry and patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of this treatment.&#xD;

             resection or local ablative techniques) and who are either off steroids or on a stable&#xD;
             dose of steroids for at least one month (30 days), AND who are off anticonvulsants,&#xD;
             AND have radiological documented stability of lesions for at least 3 months may be&#xD;
             eligible. Each case should be discussed with the study Chair.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Patients who have received prior chemotherapy or radiation delivered as part of&#xD;
             initial curative therapy (i.e. neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy administered alone&#xD;
             and/or concurrently delivered with radiation and/or surgery) are permitted as long as&#xD;
             that treatment was completed at least 6 months prior to study start date.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients may have received prior palliative radiotherapy (unless radiation was&#xD;
             curative therapy to pelvis or to ≥ 25% of bone marrow stores) if this radiation was ≥&#xD;
             4 weeks before study entry and patients must have recovered from the toxic effects of&#xD;
             this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Patients with unknown Her2/neu status, or negative Her2/neu status based on IHC and/or&#xD;
             FISH/CISH (Testing does not need to be done unless it is standard of care at&#xD;
             participating centres).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. The following adequate organ function laboratory values must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hematological:&#xD;
