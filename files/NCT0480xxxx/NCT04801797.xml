  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to assess the therapeutic activity of a promising combination&#xD;
      (azacitidine and venetoclax) versus conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy in induction-eligible&#xD;
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax and azacitidine (investigational combination)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cytarabine and idarubicin or daunorubicin (per standard of care) or Liposomal&#xD;
           daunorubicin and cytarabine (per standard of care)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase II randomized clinical trial to compare the&#xD;
      therapeutic activity of conventional induction chemotherapy (7+3 regimen or liposomal&#xD;
      daunorubicin and cytarabine) to the combination of venetoclax and azacitidine among fit,&#xD;
      traditionally induction-eligible adults with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the combinations of liposomal&#xD;
      daunorubicin and cytarabine as well as cytarabine and idarubicin or daunorubicin as treatment&#xD;
      options for acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved the combination of venetoclax and azacitidine for people with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) that are over the age of 75 or who have comorbidities that preclude&#xD;
      intensive induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venetoclax may interact with BCL-2 (a protein that initiates tumor growth, disease&#xD;
      progression, and drug resistance) and inhibit BLC-2 which can lead to cancer cell death.&#xD;
      Azacitidine may cause cell death in rapidly dividing cells, which may lead to cancer cell&#xD;
      death since cancer cells do not grow at a normal rate. Induction Chemotherapy which includes&#xD;
      the drugs idarubicin or daunorubicin, cytarabine, and liposomal daunorubicin and cytarabine&#xD;
      is the standard of care chemotherapy treatment for someone with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment,&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive study treatment for as long as they and their doctor believe they&#xD;
      are benefitting from the study drugs. Participants will then be followed for 3 years or until&#xD;
      they withdraw their consent to be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 172 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AbbVie, a biopharmaceutical company, is supporting this research study by providing funding&#xD;
      for the study, including one of the study drugs.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have pathologically confirmed, newly diagnosed acute myeloid&#xD;
             leukemia (AML). The AML may be either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  De Novo: AML in patients with no clinical history of prior myelodysplastic&#xD;
                  syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative disorder, or exposure to potentially&#xD;
                  leukemogenic therapies or agents&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Secondary AML (sAML): refers to an acute leukemic process (1) evolving from known&#xD;
                  prior myelodysplasia, myeloproliferative disorder, or aplastic anemia with or&#xD;
                  without treatment or; (2) as a product of previous exposure to a proven&#xD;
                  leukemogenic chemotherapeutic agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for intensive induction chemotherapy, according to their treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%, see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50% as measured by echocardiogram or MUGA scan&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must not have received systemic prior antineoplastic therapy for treatment for the&#xD;
             newly diagnosed AML, including radiation therapy, except hydroxyurea for the purposes&#xD;
             of cytoreduction. Patients may also have received all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) if&#xD;
             there is an early suspicion of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL, M3-AML), although if&#xD;
             confirmed to have APL these patients will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function per local laboratory reference ranges as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) ≤ 3.0X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN (unless bilirubin rise is known to be due to&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome or of non-hepatic origin)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of venetoclax on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because other chemotherapeutic agents are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration&#xD;
             of study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant&#xD;
             while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her&#xD;
             treating physician immediately. Women should use contraceptives for at least 30 days&#xD;
             following the last dose of venetoclax. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must&#xD;
             also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and 4 months after completion of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known GI disease or GI procedures that could interfere with the oral absorption or&#xD;
             tolerance of the study drugs. Examples include, but are not limited to partial&#xD;
             gastrectomy, history of small intestine surgery, and celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because venetoclax and azacitidine, along&#xD;
             with standard induction chemotherapy, carries the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is potential risk for adverse events in nursing&#xD;
             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with venetoclax as well as azacitidine,&#xD;
             cytarabine, daunorubicin and idarubicin, breastfeeding should be avoided. Confirmation&#xD;
             that the subject is not pregnant must be established by a negative serum ß-human&#xD;
             chorionic gonadotropin (ß-hCG) pregnancy test result obtained during screening.&#xD;
             Pregnancy testing is not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychological, familial, social, or geographic factors that otherwise&#xD;
             preclude them from giving informed consent, following the protocol, or potentially&#xD;
             hamper compliance with study treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are otherwise felt unable to comply with the protocol, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator.&#xD;
