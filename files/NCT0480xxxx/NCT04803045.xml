  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine a) if a follow-up email to selected patients who had&#xD;
      an initial consult with an infertility specialist, but did not return for a second visit,&#xD;
      would change return to care behavior and b) why patients had not returned.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      From July 2017 to March 2018 all patients who had attended an initial visit with an&#xD;
      infertility specialist at the clinic, but had not returned for at least three months were&#xD;
      selected to receive a follow up email. Those selected for an email excluded patients who the&#xD;
      Investigator's knew had achieved a pregnancy, already had a plan for treatment, had visited&#xD;
      for an egg freeze and all LGTBQ patients. The email asked if the patient had any questions&#xD;
      about that visit, offered support to the patient and included contact information for the&#xD;
      patient liaison sending the email. The email also asked each participant to indicate why they&#xD;
      had not returned and were provided 4 options and an opportunity to write in a response. From&#xD;
      April 2018 to December 2018 no emails were sent to patients. No other change of patient&#xD;
      contact practice was initiated during the trial period. This study will observe routine to&#xD;
      care behavior of these patients after 11 months post initial consult date.&#xD;
