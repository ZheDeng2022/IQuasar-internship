  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study to assess the drug-drug interaction of SH-1028 tablets and&#xD;
      Itraconazole/Rifampicin tablets. The study also evaluates the pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      tolerability of SH-1028 tablets in healthy subjects. This study provides evidence for the&#xD;
      designing of following clinical trial protocols.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 40 evaluable healthy male subjects will be enrolled in this study.The subjects&#xD;
      will be divided into two groups, A and B, with 20 people in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the itraconazole study (Group A), patients received single-dose SH-1028 200 mg on Days 1&#xD;
      and 12 and itraconazole(200 mg twice daily) on Days 8-14 orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the rifampicin study (Group B), patients received SH-1028 200mg once daily on Days 1 and&#xD;
      14 and rifampicin 600 mg once daily on Days 8-16.&#xD;
