      -  To evaluate the role of SPECT/CT in assessment of the osteoblastic activity in patients&#xD;
           with persistent or recurrent back pain after spine surgery with inconclusive CT/MRI&#xD;
           findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the value of bone SPECT/CT in the management of back pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common disorder, with international studies having found prevalence rates&#xD;
      between 12% and 35% and life time prevalence rates ranging from 49% to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is caused mainly by degenerative spinal disorders, such as spondylolisthesis, degenerative&#xD;
      scoliosis, degenerative disc disease and recurrent disc herniations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management of low back pain varies from conservative to more invasive methods, such as&#xD;
      spinal stabilization surgery that involves the placement of metallic screws, rods, plates or&#xD;
      cages. Such surgery is increasingly performed to improve spinal stability in a variety of&#xD;
      spine pathologies, including disc degeneration, spinal stenosis and spondylolisthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, spinal fusion surgery is performed in patients with severe chronic back&#xD;
      pain when segmental instability is believed to cause the symptoms. The rationale for this is&#xD;
      that pain relief will be achieved once the fusion restricts motion in the painful segments.&#xD;
      For this purpose, a wide array of techniques has been proposed, including dorsal or&#xD;
      dorsoventral spondylodesis, either in a one-step or two-step procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that more than 300,000 lumbar spinal fusion procedures are performed annually&#xD;
      in the United States, and a continuously rising trend has also been observed in other parts&#xD;
      of the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, recurrent pain after spinal surgery is a well known problem. It is reported&#xD;
      that up to 10-20% of patients experience persistent/recurrent pain after lumbar spinal&#xD;
      instrumentation and fusion , with studies estimating the surgical reintervention rate to be&#xD;
      around 14% over a 4-year follow-up period and 19% over 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This may be related to loosening of the metallic implants or to a failure of a stably&#xD;
      implanted graft to immobilize the fused segments. A further differential diagnosis is&#xD;
      degenerative disease involving the spinal segments above or below the instrumented region.&#xD;
      This so-called adjacent instability (AI) or adjacent level disease (ALD) may be precipitated&#xD;
      by arthrodesis, as this procedure alters the biomechanics of the spine, thereby increasing&#xD;
      motion of a mechanical load on the segments neighboring the graft. The differentiation&#xD;
      between these conditions has therapeutic consequences as the treatment varies according to&#xD;
      the cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard evaluation of patients with persistent or recurrent pain following spinal&#xD;
      stabilization surgery includes clinical examination and conventional imaging using plain&#xD;
      radiography, CT or MR imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional imaging is performed for the evaluation of hardware position (changes), hardware&#xD;
      failure, fusion evolution, alignment of the vertebrae, possible pseudarthrosis and hardware&#xD;
      loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, because of the presence of nonspecific postoperative changes and metal-related&#xD;
      imaging artifacts, the interpretation of CT images is often challenging and inconclusive.&#xD;
      Thus, whether surgical reintervention is indicated based on conventional imaging may prove&#xD;
      difficult to ascertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The value of bone scintigraphy with single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT/CT) in patients with persistent or recurrent back pain after spine stabilization&#xD;
      surgery has been addressed in a number of studies and the technique has been suggested to be&#xD;
      a useful diagnostic tool for identification of postsurgical spine pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although most of these studies were based on a small sample size and lacked robust reference&#xD;
      standards; it has been concluded that the use of SPECT/CT adds value in assessing patients&#xD;
      following spinal surgery.&#xD;
