      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and high-grade neuroendocrine cancers (HGNEC) are aggressive&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cancers. At first, SCLC and HGNEC respond to chemotherapy. But then they&#xD;
      relapse quickly and become resistant to treatment. Researchers want to see if a combination&#xD;
      of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the combination of lurbinectedin and berzosertib may be effective to shrink SCLC&#xD;
      and HGNEC tumors, and to find the best dose of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older with a solid tumor, SCLC, or HGNEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get lurbinectedin by intravenous (IV) catheter on Day 1 of each cycle (1&#xD;
      cycle = 21 days). They will get berzosertib by IV on Days 1 and 2 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive treatment as long as they are benefiting from&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical exams and blood tests. Their symptoms, medicines, and ability&#xD;
      to perform their normal activities will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have electrocardiograms to test heart function. Sticky pads will be placed&#xD;
      on their chest, arms, and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will give blood and hair samples for research. They may have optional tumor&#xD;
      biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have computed tomography (CT) scans to see if the treatment is effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 1 month after treatment ends. Then they will be&#xD;
      followed by email or phone for the rest of their life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and high-grade neuroendocrine cancers (HGNEC) are aggressive&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cancers with poor prognosis. Although responsive to chemotherapy initially,&#xD;
      both tumor types relapse quickly and become refractory to treatment within a few months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replication stress is an SCLC hallmark, driven by oncogenes that drive rapid and unscheduled&#xD;
      proliferation (TP53 and RB1 inactivation, MYC amplification, etc.). HGNECs share similarities&#xD;
      in morphology, biologic behavior with SCLC. Treatment paradigms have largely paralleled those&#xD;
      established for SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATR is the master regulator of replication stress response. Upon activation, the ATR CHK1&#xD;
      signaling leads to cell cycle arrest and promotes replication fork stabilization and restart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATR inhibition generates replication stress and disables cell cycle checkpoints to ultimately&#xD;
      cause mitotic catastrophe and cell death. Many genotoxic agents currently used in cancer&#xD;
      therapy are also potent inducers of replication stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berzosertib is a potent and selective kinase inhibitor of ATR, with demonstrated safety and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity as monotherapy and combination with multiple chemotherapeutics (including&#xD;
      platinum, gemcitabine, and topoisomerase inhibitors) in high replication stress tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lurbinectedin is a recently approved second-line SCLC treatment which forms DNA adducts by&#xD;
      covalently binding to the minor groove of DNA that kills cancer cells by inhibiting Pol-II&#xD;
      and causing DNA damage&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that a combination of ATR kinase inhibition with lurbinectedin will provide an&#xD;
      attractive synergistic therapeutic option for SCLC and HGNEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of lurbinectedin in combination with&#xD;
      berzosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: To assess the efficacy with respect to clinical response rate of a combination of&#xD;
      lurbinectedin and berzosertib in previously treated participants with SCLC and HGNECs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All phases: Participants must be greater than or equal to 18 years of age and have a&#xD;
      performance status (ECOG) less than or equal to 2. Participants must not have received&#xD;
      chemotherapy or undergone major surgery within 2 weeks and radiotherapy within 24 hours prior&#xD;
      to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Participants with histologically confirmed solid tumors and progression on standard&#xD;
      therapies. Participants with evaluable, but not measurable disease will be eligible for Phase&#xD;
      I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Participants with histological confirmation of SCLC or HGNEC. Participants must&#xD;
      have measurable disease to be eligible for Phase II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I/II, open label clinical trial identifying the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      of lurbinectedin in combination with berzosertib in a phase I trial, and assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy with respect to clinical response rate of a combination of lurbinectedin and&#xD;
      berzosertib as treatment of participants with recurrent SCLC and HGNEC. The accrual ceiling&#xD;
      will be set to 75 for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive lurbinectedin on day 1 and berzosertib on days 1 and 2,&#xD;
      administered every 21 days (1 cycle), until disease progression or development of intolerable&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, hair follicles, and tumor will be collected at various time points to support the&#xD;
      exploratory objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I will use a standard 3 + 3 design to determine MTD of the combination of lurbinectedin&#xD;
      and berzosertib. With a maximum of three dose levels to be explored, there will be up to 18&#xD;
      participants treated in phase I.&#xD;
