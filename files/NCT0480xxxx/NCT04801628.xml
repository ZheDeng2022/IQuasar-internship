      The experimental procedures will be composed of two sessions. The following steps will be&#xD;
      constituted the first session: warm-up on the cycle ergometer, and familiarization with the&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer then baseline measurement of isokinetic parameters. Afterward, the&#xD;
      placebo or active TECAR therapy will be applied (according to the randomization). At the end,&#xD;
      isokinetic parameters will be taken again. After 7 days, the second session will be performed&#xD;
      following identical procedures to the first session. However, an inverse mode of TECAR&#xD;
      therapy from the first session (placebo or active) will be applied for each individual. The&#xD;
      two sessions will be held 7 days apart, either on a Sunday or Tuesday. Procedures are&#xD;
      summarized in Figure 1. The dominant lower limb test will be used to elect the lower limb&#xD;
      selected for isokinetic Dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Muscle performance measurement by Isokinetic Dynamometer:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadriceps muscles of dominant lower limb will be tested for all participants with Biodex&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer (Biodex Medical System, Shiley, NY, USA, linked to IBM PC-computer&#xD;
      software). Calibration of the Biodex for torque and angular speed will be done according to&#xD;
      the prescribed manufacturer's guidelines before each recording session. Prior to assessment,&#xD;
      the volunteers held a 5-min cycle ergometer warm up (speed in the range of 60-70 rpm and no&#xD;
      load). After that, participants will be positioned with hip angle of 100o on the previously&#xD;
      calibrated isokinetic dynamometer and will be properly aligned and stabilized with straps in&#xD;
      order to avoid possible compensatory movements. Thus, the dominant knee axis (lateral&#xD;
      epicondyle of the femur) of each subject was adjusted to the dynamometer rotation axis. The&#xD;
      lever arm of the equipment was fixed approximately 2 cm above the tibial malleolus. The chair&#xD;
      height, backrest distance, seat angle, and dynamometer base were adjusted for each subject&#xD;
      and noted for the second session. Before starting the recording of isokinetic muscle&#xD;
      performance, there will be a familiarization period with the apparatus consisting of five&#xD;
      submaximal voluntary concentric muscle contractions in the full range of standardized and&#xD;
      preprogrammed motion (90-20°) according to the guideline procedures of the dynamometer, with&#xD;
      a constant angular velocity of 180°/s. the isokinetic protocol will be performed with a set&#xD;
      of 60 concentric/eccentric contractions of quadriceps. The participants will be visually and&#xD;
      verbally encouraged throughout the test protocol to achieve maximum effort from the&#xD;
      beginning. The muscle performance, in terms of work fatigue index, peak torque, average&#xD;
      power, and total work of the knee extensor muscles, will be evaluated by isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometry in accordance with the guidelines of the equipment manufacturer (Biodex Medical&#xD;
      System Inc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental protocol of TECAR therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after the baseline measurement of muscle performance of each session, the&#xD;
      participants will be received placebo or active TECAR therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this experiment, Transfer Electrode Capacitive and Resistive (TECAR) Therapy (radio&#xD;
      frequency therapy; INDIBA, Spain) will be used. TECAR therapy is a systematic treatment for&#xD;
      providing capacitive energy transfer (CET) and resistive energy transfer (RET). In CET mode,&#xD;
      heat transfer is concentrated on the skin and superficial muscles, which are tissue with high&#xD;
      electrolytes, while the RET mode focuses heat transfer on bones, tendons, joints, and deep&#xD;
      muscles. In this study, both CET and RET modes will be applied to the participant' quadriceps&#xD;
      for 15-20 minutes at stable frequency of 448 KHz. According to the manufacturer's guidelines&#xD;
      for safety, the CET mode will be first implemented for 5 minutes. Then will be continued in&#xD;
      RET mode using for the rest of the treatment. Participants will be asked to lie down&#xD;
      comfortably, and treatment will be beginning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of the current will be set at the level of comfort between 0%-100%, averaging&#xD;
      about 40%. TECAR therapy will be applied by a physical therapist for all participants.&#xD;
