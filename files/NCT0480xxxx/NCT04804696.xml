  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy or chemotherapy followed by surgery is the standard treatment&#xD;
      for local advanced esophageal cancer (EC). It had been demonstrated that patients who achieve&#xD;
      pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment had better prognosis. However,&#xD;
      the pCR rate were about only 5-10% in neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 20-40% in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PD-1 antibody based immunotherapy alone as second-line treatment or combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy as first-line treatment had been proved that could prolong overall survival of&#xD;
      EC patients. And a recent phase 3 clinical trial CheckMate 577 reported that, as adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment, nivolumab could improve disease-free survival in EC and esophageal-gastric&#xD;
      junction cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of toripalimab, an anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody, combined with paclitaxel and cisplatin as neoadjuvant treatment in local advanced&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We hope this combining treatment would increase&#xD;
      the pCR rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and improve survival of patients, and at the&#xD;
      menatime avoid the adverse events of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. This study will provide&#xD;
      valuable information for further clinical trials of both Toripalimab and other immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibition agents in treatment of esophageal cancer.&#xD;
