  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if a non-functioning UroMonitor device can be safely inserted,&#xD;
      monitored, and removed in patients with SCI.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, observational study will be conducted with 10 patients with chronic&#xD;
      thoracolumbar SCI who are already undergoing routine UDS studies as part of their care.&#xD;
      Following their routine UDS, a non-functioning UroMonitor device will be inserted and removed&#xD;
      after 3 hours. Participants' symptoms will be monitored after the UroMonitor is inserted,&#xD;
      following the 3 hour monitoring period, and again after UroMonitor removal. A second&#xD;
      cystoscopy will be conducted for research purposes after removal to examine the urethra and&#xD;
      bladder for any irritation or trauma. During insertion and removal, the urologist will&#xD;
      document the time required for insertion and any difficulties encountered&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Cervical or Thoracolumbar (T2-L1 spinal level) spinal cord injury with AIS A, B, C, or&#xD;
             D severities of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 17-75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. At least 1 year post-injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least one prior urodynamics study in the past 12 months that has objectively&#xD;
             documented abnormalities on bladder function consistent with an upper motor neuro&#xD;
             lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of neurogenic bladder symptoms requiring some form of intervention (e.g. clean&#xD;
             intermittent catheterization, condom catheter)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lumbar injuries (L2-S1 spinal level) where the injury is primarily to the cauda equina&#xD;
             and not to spinal cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of autonomic dysreflexia (such individuals are excluded to minimize the chance&#xD;
             of inducing autonomic dysreflexia with device insertion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active urinary tract infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Past urethral or bladder reconstruction surgery&#xD;
