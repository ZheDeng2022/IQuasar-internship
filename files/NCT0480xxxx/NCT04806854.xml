      The goals of this single site trial are to study the pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of LUM-201 and effects of LUM-201 administration on growth hormone release&#xD;
      over time in children with pediatric growth hormone deficiency (PGHD).&#xD;

      This trial will have a single screening visit to assess if subjects are eligible to start&#xD;
      study therapy. Once subjects have completed screening, and if they are determined to be&#xD;
      eligible, they will return to the clinic for a 12-hour pulsatility study. On Day Two of the&#xD;
      trial, subjects will be randomized to receive one of two oral daily doses of LUM-201 and PK&#xD;
      samples will be collected. All subjects will have an equal chance of being placed in either&#xD;
      of the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of 6 months of treatment. After screening, subjects will return to the&#xD;
      clinic monthly for visits. At most clinic visits, subjects will have a physical exam, blood&#xD;
      and urine collections. At the Month 6 visit subjects will repeat the 12-hour pulsatility and&#xD;
      PK studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a chronological age &gt; 4.0 years and &lt; 8.0 years for girls and &lt; 10.0 years for&#xD;
             boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a minimum body weight of 17 kg at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a bone age examination at screening or within the 6 months prior to screening&#xD;
             that, in the interpretation of the PI, is delayed with respect to chronological age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a HT-SDS &lt; -2.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a maximal GH response &lt; 10 ng/mL from at least one prior GH stimulation test&#xD;
             within the past 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have prepubertal status as evidenced by Tanner Stage I breast development in girls and&#xD;
             testicular volume &lt; 4.0 mL in boys.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have height minus arm span difference &lt; 4.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In girls, have genetic testing results to rule out Turner syndrome. If SHOX genetic&#xD;
             testing results are available, they need to be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have normal thyroid function. Subjects diagnosed with hypothyroidism must have&#xD;
             documented successful treatment for at least 30 days prior to the Baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any medical or genetic condition which, in the opinion of the PI or Medical Monitor&#xD;
             (MM), can be an independent cause of short stature and/or limit the response to&#xD;
             exogenous growth factor treatment (e.g., diabetes).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A medical or genetic condition that, in the opinion of the PI and/or MM, adds&#xD;
             unwarranted risk to use of LUM-201 (e.g., scoliosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any medication that, in the opinion of the PI and/or MM, can independently&#xD;
             cause short stature or limit the response to exogenous growth factors (e.g.,&#xD;
             glucocorticoids).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence or history of an intracranial mass (e.g., pituitary tumor,&#xD;
             craniopharyngioma).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with growth factors including, but not limited to, GH, IGF-1, and GH&#xD;
             secretagogues. (These may be used for limited times as a diagnostic test.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suspicion of absence of pituitary function as evidenced by a maximal stimulated GH ≤ 3&#xD;
             ng/mL or pituitary hormone deficiencies beyond GH and thyroid function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Gestational age-adjusted birth weight &lt; 5th percentile (small for gestational age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At birth, gestational age &lt; 36.0 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any trial of investigational drug(s) within the prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of spinal or total body irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A diagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and/or use of&#xD;
             medication to treat ADHD.&#xD;
