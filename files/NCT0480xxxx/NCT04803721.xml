  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a pre-leukemic condition with an extremely poor prognosis&#xD;
      despite current treatments that justify new therapeutic approaches. Various studies have&#xD;
      described the potential involvement of both immune compartment and cellular metabolism in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of MDS. The aim of this study is to determine the specific immune and&#xD;
      metabolic profiles of the different classes of MDS and to identify predictive markers of&#xD;
      progression/survival/response to therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a pre-leukemic condition with an extremely poor prognosis&#xD;
      despite current treatments. It is the most frequent haematological disorder after the age of&#xD;
      65. Different approaches targeting the immune compartment have been developed but preliminary&#xD;
      results seem to show variable response rates to these therapeutic highlighting the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of MDS and the need to identify detailed immune profiles that are predictive of&#xD;
      disease progression and can help in treatment choices. It therefore seems essential to&#xD;
      complement the knowledge of immune profiles with an understanding of the metabolic profiles&#xD;
      of MDS patients, as well as the links between these profiles and changes associated with&#xD;
      progression and/or treatment resistance, in order to consider new therapeutic pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh samples from patients with MDS will be used to perform flow cytometry mapping of immune&#xD;
      populations, T-cell and blast cell metabolism. Subsequently, a study of energy metabolism&#xD;
      will be conducted using an extracellular flow analyzer and a sensitivity test for certain&#xD;
      molecules targeting metabolic pathways. If possible, samples will be taken at different times&#xD;
      during the course of treatment, according to the therapeutic protocols: diagnosis,&#xD;
      progression/transformation, during azacitidine treatment.&#xD;
