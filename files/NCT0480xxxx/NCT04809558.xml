  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research team will conduct a multi-site, randomized controlled trial examining the&#xD;
      effectiveness of exercise intensity progression compared to standard practice (no&#xD;
      progression) in the context of swallowing rehabilitation. The study will also determine the&#xD;
      impact of using biofeedback during resistance training on tongue strength. The study is a&#xD;
      first step in determining an optimal delivery of tongue strengthening exercise in typically&#xD;
      aging older persons, with the plan to develop a framework for guiding clinical practice of&#xD;
      tongue strengthening in various dysphagic populations. Participants will be randomized into&#xD;
      one of four treatment groups and complete 8 weeks of tongue resistance training.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rehabilitative exercises have been central to dysphagia (swallowing difficulty) treatment for&#xD;
      decades, with the goal to increase strength, endurance, and/or coordination of the muscles&#xD;
      responsible for swallowing. With any exercise-based therapy, an understanding of dosing is&#xD;
      critical to optimize outcomes and to avoid over- or under-prescribing exercise, which can&#xD;
      have a negative effect. For example, overtraining can lead to reductions in strength, which&#xD;
      may put patients who are completing a swallowing rehabilitation program at increased risk.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is important to develop dosing recommendations specific to swallowing&#xD;
      musculature. Clinical practice remains unguided in terms of whether a progressive or maximum&#xD;
      intensity, both common forms of rehabilitative exercise for dysphagic patients, should be&#xD;
      used for lingual resistance training. Speech-Language Pathologists (SLP) currently base these&#xD;
      decisions on preference and experience; however, research is desperately needed in this area&#xD;
      to support and guide clinical decisions. The investigators aim to fill this gap in evidence&#xD;
      by determining an optimal dosing for tongue strengthening in older persons. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that the study findings will directly influence clinical decisions in both inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation facilities and home health post-acute care settings, and ultimately improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes in the area of swallowing. This study represents the start of a research&#xD;
      program intended to provide significant information on optimal delivery of tongue&#xD;
      strengthening exercise in various populations with difficulty swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine an optimal delivery method for tongue resistance training in healthy older&#xD;
      persons by examining how intensity progression and biofeedback impacts tongue strength,&#xD;
      participant motivation, and program adherence. The data collected in this initial study will&#xD;
      inform future studies designed to develop a framework for guiding clinical practice with SLPs&#xD;
      prescribing tongue strengthening exercise to patients with swallowing issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is tongue strength impacted by exercise resistance intensity when comparing progressive&#xD;
           resistance to maximum resistance?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is tongue strength impacted by visual biofeedback during tongue resistance training?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is participant motivation impacted by progressive intensity exercise when compared to&#xD;
           maximum intensity exercise?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is participant motivation impacted by the use of biofeedback when compared to no visual&#xD;
           biofeedback?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is participant adherence to the exercise program impacted by progressive intensity&#xD;
           exercise when compared to maximum intensity exercise?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is participant adherence to the exercise program impacted by the use of biofeedback when&#xD;
           compared to no visual biofeedback?&#xD;
