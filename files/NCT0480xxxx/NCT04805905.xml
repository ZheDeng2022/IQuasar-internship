    <textblock>
      A prospective single-centered feasibility study will be conducted. The purpose of the&#xD;
      feasibility study is to define the variables to be included in a subsequent pilot study,&#xD;
      assess the feasibility of conducting a prospective cohort study, and the logistics for the&#xD;
      study (i.e., training, patient recruitment, data collection, statistical analysis, etc.).&#xD;

&#xD;
      Upon completion of the feasibility study, a prospective pilot cohort study would be performed&#xD;
      to measure outcomes using the FACE-Q Skin Cancer module for patients receiving skin grafting&#xD;
      or local flaps after excision of facial skin cancers.&#xD;

    <description>FACE-Q is a recently developed and validated patient reported outcome measure (PROM) tool that allows clinicians to assess patient perspectives after skin cancer surgery of the face.The PROM is used to assess the perspective and impact of skin cancer as well as its treatment on the patient's quality of life (QoL). Patients with skin cancer may have increased anxiety, social isolation, and cosmetic concerns after surgery. The FACE-Q utilizes five scales to measure the psychometric, QoL, patient experience, and cosmetic outcomes. Raw scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale with a higher score indicating a better outcome</description>

    <description>As both interventions of treatment are gold standards and clinical equipoise exists if one intervention is superior to the other, there is no true control group. However, for the purpose of the application, the local flap group will be chosen as the &quot;control&quot; group.&#xD;
Skin graft (Experimental): Participants in the experimental group will receive a skin graft and receive the FACE-Q skin cancer questionnaire pre- and post-treatment. There will also be photos taken of the patient's face along with the distributed questionnaires.&#xD;
Local flap (Control): Participants in the experimental group will receive a local flap and receive the FACE-Q questionnaire pre- and post-treatment.</description>

        Patients will be included in the study if they are 18 years or older, presenting for&#xD;
        treatment of a suspected non-melanoma facial skin cancer, including pre-malignant cancers&#xD;
        (i.e., actinic keratosis), and scheduled to undergo reconstruction with either a skin graft&#xD;
        or local tissue flap. Patients will be excluded in the study if they: present with altered&#xD;
        level of consciousness, cannot provide consent, have facial nerve injury/previous facial&#xD;
        nerve injury, have Melanoma skin cancer or Merkel cell carcinoma based on pathology&#xD;
        reports, have polytrauma/multiple injuries, are pregnant, are undergoing free flap&#xD;
        reconstruction, have bone involvement, or if they are under the age of 18.&#xD;
