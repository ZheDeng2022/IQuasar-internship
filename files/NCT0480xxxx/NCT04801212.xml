  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Core stability strength &amp; coordination is necessary to perform smooth &amp; coordinated upper &amp;&#xD;
      lower extremity movements &amp; function. Altered core stability muscle strength, coordination &amp;&#xD;
      poor motor control can cause low back pain (LBP). Physical therapists especially those&#xD;
      working with children having neurodevelopmental problems or adults with neurological&#xD;
      disorders such as stroke are aware of the concepts of global movements. In this concept,&#xD;
      alterations in one body segment may bring changes in other body segments. In neurological&#xD;
      rehabilitation, the concept of Neuro-Developmental Technique (NDT) introduced by Bobath got&#xD;
      worldwide recognition. This concept states that there are specific key points in the neck, &amp;&#xD;
      shoulders that can facilitate normal movements by enhancing the activity of core musculature&#xD;
      in functional movements for instance, sit to stand &amp; walking. This concept was further&#xD;
      explored by Burnstein and suggested that biomechanically body joints and motor control works&#xD;
      together as functional unit and not as single limb movement. Bobath and proprioceptive&#xD;
      neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) concepts further explained that movements of the eye, head&#xD;
      and neck facilitate trunk movements. Electromyography studies have shown that both single and&#xD;
      rhythmical jaw opening and closing movements not only produced well-coordinated jaw and&#xD;
      head-neck movements but also produced atlanto-occipital and cervical spine joints movements.&#xD;
      The author further concluded that mouth opening and closing in fetal yawning is associated&#xD;
      with head extension-flexion movements indicating that functional connections between the jaw&#xD;
      and head-neck is innate. A human jaw or masticatory system is connected to the motor system&#xD;
      through cranial nerves unlike central motor system which is connected to the body through&#xD;
      spinal motor system. Brainstem central pattern generator (CPG) control masticatory system&#xD;
      through descending pathways and are involved in voluntary movements of the jaw such as mouth&#xD;
      opening and closing. The higher brain centers cortical masticatory area and primary motor&#xD;
      cortex control these movements. In the current back pain literature core stability exercises&#xD;
      have been used in the management of chronic low back pain. The jaw is connected to the&#xD;
      head-neck and neck is connected to the trunk. Therefore there is to study the effects of core&#xD;
      stability exercises performed with and without jaw movements in the management of chronic low&#xD;
      back pain.&#xD;

      A randomized experimental controlled trial will be carried out to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of core stabilization exercises performed with and without jaw movements in the management of&#xD;
      nonspecific chronic low back pain. A total of 80 male and female volunteers having subjects&#xD;
      with chronic nonspecific low back pain will be recruited in this study. All subjects will be&#xD;
      assessed for transverse abdominal muscle strength contraction, pain and disability using&#xD;
      Pressure Biofeedback Unit (BPU), Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS 0-10cm) and Ronald Morris&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ 0-24) respectively. The scores on the mentioned scales will be&#xD;
      documented as per guidelines. After baseline assessment, all subjects will be allocated to&#xD;
      two groups through computer-generated random sampling. Group 1 will perform core stability&#xD;
      exercises alone; Group 2 will perform core stability exercises with teeth clenching This&#xD;
      study will be conducted at the Physiotherapy Department of Sindh Institute of Physical&#xD;
      Medicine and Rehabilitation (SIPM&amp;R). The computer-generated random sampling technique will&#xD;
      be used to allocate the participants into the study groups. Data will be analyzed using SPSS&#xD;
      22 and one-way repeated measure ANOVA will be applied to see the mean difference in the 2&#xD;
      groups. For pair-wise comparison, the Tukey test will be applied. For pain and disability&#xD;
      scales Friedman's test will be applied to see the two scales' median differences.&#xD;
