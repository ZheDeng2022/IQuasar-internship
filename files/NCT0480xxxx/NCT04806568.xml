  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study aims to identify MS related beneficial plasticity and by contrast&#xD;
      maladaptive reorganization in combination with elements of daily functional status as a&#xD;
      response to a cognitive training program&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Cognitive decline is a debilitating and widespread comorbidity of Multiple Sclerosis (MS)&#xD;
      affecting up to 65 percent of patients with MS (PwMS). Cognitive changes can be the only&#xD;
      behavioral index of MS activity. But how accurately and timely can these be captured? The&#xD;
      existing clinical tools are subjective and do not have the dynamic of prognosis. It remains&#xD;
      uncertain how much change in cognitive status is required to translate into a meaningful&#xD;
      clinical outcome and how long it may subsequently take to become apparent. Moving towards a&#xD;
      holistic approach, MS-NEUROPLAST aims to further expand previously-published prognostic&#xD;
      marker candidates and previous work of the applicant and the members of the research team and&#xD;
      employ a group of methodologies for interventions and applications which will quantify via&#xD;
      real-world assessment the MS-related cognitive changes in order to characterize not only&#xD;
      decline but given the right dosage of stimulation improvement as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS-NEUROPLAST has three main objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Utilize state of-the-art neuroimaging and network science measures to more thoroughly&#xD;
      understand neural indices of cognitive impairment in PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Evaluate the efficacy for treating MS-associated cognitive deficits using a computerized&#xD;
      cognitive training treatment by determining the differences, between subjects treated with&#xD;
      cognitive training and controls, on network science measures indexing network efficiency or&#xD;
      collapse and on the performance of a battery of neuropsychological tests that are frequently&#xD;
      impaired in MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) Investigate the dissociation of the cortical mechanisms related to training-induced&#xD;
      plasticity and maladaptive reorganization (namely separate good from bad), by taking into&#xD;
      account the homeostatic capacity of the human organism as a whole and thus examining whether&#xD;
      the correlation of the neurophysiological and cognitive indices with longitudinal digital&#xD;
      biomarkers of daily functional status can capture the underlying pathology.&#xD;

    <description>Change of scoring in neuropsychological tests related to memory, attention, and executive function. Change is defined as statistical significance in the comparison between before and after the training. The Brief International Cognitive Assessment for MS (BICAMS) will be used to perform cognitive evaluation. It consists of:&#xD;
the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) for processing speed assessment. The score of the test is the number of correct answers in 90 seconds. (higher is better)&#xD;
the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT2) for auditory/verbal learning assessment. The score output is between 0 and 80 (higher is better).&#xD;
the revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMTR) for visual/spatial memory assessment. The score output is between 0 and 12 (higher is better).</description>

    <measure>Change in neurologic impairment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>Change of scoring in neurologic impairment test. Change is defined as statistical significance in the comparison between before and after the training. The test that will be used is the EDSS. It consists of scores in each of seven functional systems (FSs) and an ambulation score that are then combined to determine the EDSS steps, ranging from 0 (normal) to 10 (death). The FSs are Visual, Brainstem, Pyramidal, Cerebellar, Sensory, Bowel &amp; Bladder, and Cerebral functions.</description>

    <description>The cognitive training treatment is a Greek adaptation of BrainHQ developed by Posit Science Corporation. The intervention will target speed, attention, working memory, and executive function through the visual and auditory domains via a set of 15 exercises. Each daily training session consists of four exercises chosen from an active set of six. Participants will be instructed to train for one hour per day, three days per week, over 12 weeks via a tablet or a laptop. Each subject will receive at least 20 sessions of computerized cognitive training.</description>
