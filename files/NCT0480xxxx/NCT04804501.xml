  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature cessation of screen usage is a common behavior post-concussion, given the taxing&#xD;
      nature of a screen-time task. In the academic setting, screen-time is a near unavoidable&#xD;
      component, however, complete avoidance of class and screen use may in fact provoke&#xD;
      psychological symptoms of anxiety and depression in students, for fear of falling behind in&#xD;
      their studies. Thus, compensatory measures should be investigated to assist students as they&#xD;
      attempt to maintain academic involvement throughout their concussion recovery. Blue light&#xD;
      blocking glasses have been shown to significantly increase screen-time usage in individuals&#xD;
      with post-concussion syndrome, yet these results are only representative of a small portion&#xD;
      of the concussion population. Thus, we propose investigating whether blue light blocking&#xD;
      glasses can prolong screen usage prior to symptom exacerbation, specifically in concussed&#xD;
      students that are still within the normal recovery timeframe. This cross-sectional randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial will provide further evidence of the utility blue light blocking glasses can&#xD;
      offer as a therapeutic tool for students recovering from concussion. We would like to test&#xD;
      volunteers from the Rochester Institute of Technology who have been treated by a medical&#xD;
      provider within the university's health center. Blue light glasses will be worn during a&#xD;
      one-time computer reading task while the subject is participating in the study. The total&#xD;
      time for the complete the reading task is dependent upon the participant's symptom&#xD;
      fluctuations; however, we suspect completion criteria will be met within 20 minutes from&#xD;
      beginning. The risks in this study are minimal and results may increase our understanding of&#xD;
      therapeutic tools for patients with ocular-driven concussion symptoms.&#xD;
