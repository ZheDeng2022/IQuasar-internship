  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of peripheral arterial disease is 12.2% in France. Intermittent claudication&#xD;
      is the most common symtom of this disease. During physical exercise, such as walking, blood&#xD;
      oxygen (O2) requirements increase. The development of atherosclerosis in the lower limbs,&#xD;
      causes narrowing of the arteries and limits the increase in blood flow required for muscular&#xD;
      effort. Patients then experience muscle pain, the intensity of which gradually increases&#xD;
      until it forces them to stop. After stopping, the pain subsides and disappears in less than&#xD;
      10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The location of the pain (calves and/or thighs and/or buttocks) is related to the location of&#xD;
      the ischemia (distal in the calf, proximal in the thigh or buttock, or proximo-distal if&#xD;
      several locations). This can have different consequences on the biomechanical parameters of&#xD;
      walking and muscle activity. To date, the impact of this localization on physical capacity&#xD;
      has never been studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These limitations are very disabling and impact the quality of life of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, poor lower limb performance is associated with higher mortality. Reducing&#xD;
      symptomatology and improving functional abilities is therefore a major issue in patients with&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease. This can be achieved through the practice of an Adapted Physical&#xD;
      Activity, an essential recommendation in the care of patients with peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our main hypothesis is that the physical activity rehabilitation protocol &quot;Activ'AO&quot; will&#xD;
      improve the functional capacities of patients with peripheral arterial disease who have&#xD;
      followed the program with the localization of ischemia with a greater consideration than in&#xD;
      patients in the group following a &quot;standard&quot; APA protocol. Improvements in functional&#xD;
      abilities (such as walking) will lead to improvements in quality of life.&#xD;
