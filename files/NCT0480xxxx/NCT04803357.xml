  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether RT-CGM (real time continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring) use improves glucose control, maternal outcomes, and fetal outcomes in patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Currently, there is very limited data on whether RT-CGM&#xD;
      use helps patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes. By conducting this study, the&#xD;
      investigator hopes to develop a deeper understanding of how use of a RT-CGM may affect&#xD;
      glucose control in the gestational diabetes population.&#xD;

      Pregnant Participants diagnosed with gestational diabetes are being invited to take part in a&#xD;
      research study because these participants are pregnant and have gestational diabetes.&#xD;
      Participants will be offered an opportunity to wear a medical device that monitors blood&#xD;
      sugars (glucose). This device is called a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). The CGM measures&#xD;
      glucose levels through a tiny plastic filament that is inserted under the skin in the abdomen&#xD;
      by a skin prick. Typically, participants cannot feel this device once it is inserted. If&#xD;
      participants agree to participate in this study, participants will be randomly placed into&#xD;
      one of two groups: (1) the intervention group or (2) the control group. Participants will&#xD;
      have a 50% (1 out of 2) chance like a coin toss of being placed into either group. If&#xD;
      participants are in the intervention group, they will wear a real-time continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring device (RT-CGM). The RT-CGM will allow participants to see glucose levels in real&#xD;
      time. The RT-CGM will send information about glucose levels to a phone or display device so&#xD;
      participants may see the glucose at all times. If participants are in the control group, they&#xD;
      will not be given a RT-CGM. Instead, participants will be given a blinded CGM device. You&#xD;
      will not be able to view your blood sugar results on the blinded CGM device. If participants&#xD;
      are in the control group, they will also be given a blood glucose meter to check glucose&#xD;
      using finger sticks according to the recommendations of the provider.&#xD;
