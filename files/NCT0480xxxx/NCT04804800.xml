  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body distortions are responsible for anorexic behavior reinforcing loops. It is necessary to&#xD;
      target this behavior and develop appropriate therapies taking into account the perceptual&#xD;
      (implicit) and conceptual (explicit) phenomenon of body representations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main originality of the proposed program consists on combining virtual visual impulses&#xD;
      and multisensory recalibration (touch, proprioception, vestibular sensations) in order to&#xD;
      compare the body distortions evolution in anorexic patients with or without a multimodal care&#xD;
      program including Virtual Reality from its own body scan, coupled or not to a multisensory&#xD;
      remediation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid weight loss associated with mental anorexia leads to dysmorphophobia and body&#xD;
      distortions. Patients perceive themselves to be bigger than they really are. Body distortions&#xD;
      are responsible for anorexic behavior reinforcing loops. It is then necessary to target this&#xD;
      behavior and develop appropriate therapies taking into account the perceptual (implicit) and&#xD;
      conceptual (explicit) phenomenon of body representations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current treatment programs which are recommended by the Haute Autorité de Santé (HAS) in&#xD;
      France focus on the somatic, nutritional, individual and family psychological aspects. These&#xD;
      recommendations hardly mention the bodily distortion phenomenon which frequently leads&#xD;
      patients to relapse into the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3D body scanner enables to get awareness of the body through visual feedback allowing the&#xD;
      patient to get a reassuring overview of her weight development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This projects aims to combine virtual visual impulses and multisensory recalibration (touch,&#xD;
      proprioception, vestibular sensations) in order to compare the body distortions evolution in&#xD;
      anorexic patients with or without a multimodal care program including Virtual Reality from&#xD;
      its own body scan coupled or not to a multisensory remediation.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Eating disorders will be assessed by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q). This questionnaire is divided into several sub-scores: restriction, dietary concerns, body shape concerns and weight concerns. It has 30 items scored from 0 (= no day) to 6 (= every day). A score for each subscale and an overall score can be obtained.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 15 to ≤ 26 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anorexic nervosa eating disorder according to the criteria of Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM 5). As patients are&#xD;
             hospitalized for anorexic nervosa, the medical diagnosis of each care center&#xD;
             participating in the inclusions will be trusted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient hospitalized (full hospitalization or day hospital) in one of the&#xD;
             investigative centers for a minimum period of 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  14 ≤ BMI ≤ 18.5 for adult patients. For minors, Cole's curves will be used. The Body&#xD;
             mass index (BM)I should be between the 1st percentile and the 10th percentile (if the&#xD;
             weight curve shows a clear break indicating abnormal weight loss). For example, for a&#xD;
             15-year-old girl, the BMI should be between 14.5 and 16.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of body distortion (BSC ≥ 20%)&#xD;

             contraindication to people without anorexia. In fact, appropriate physical activity is&#xD;
             prescribed in anorexic patients in order to reduce the cardiovascular risks,&#xD;
             osteopenia or anxiety and allow them to become aware of an adapted physical practice&#xD;
             (reduction of anarchic physical hyperactivity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in other research programs or psychomotor treatments in parallel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding woman&#xD;
