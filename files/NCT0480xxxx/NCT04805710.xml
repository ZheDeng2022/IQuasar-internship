      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban or aspirin combined&#xD;
      with clopidogrel in patients with coronary heart disease and gastrointestinal diseases&#xD;
      undergoing PCI.&#xD;

      Background：Aspirin combined with P2Y12 receptor antagonist are the antithrombotic basis of&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for coronary heart disease. Guidelines at home and&#xD;
      abroad recommend that patients with stable coronary heart disease need double antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy for 6 months, and patients with acute coronary syndrome need double antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy for 12 months to prevent stent thrombosis and reduce the risk of ischemic or&#xD;
      atherosclerotic thrombosis events, including stent thrombosis, recurrent myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and cardiogenic death. Aspirin can inhibit the activity of cyclooxygenase in&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract, causing gastrointestinal mucosal epithelial injury and bleeding. For&#xD;
      patients with gastrointestinal diseases, the risk of bleeding is higher after taking aspirin&#xD;
      for a long time. 48.7% of PCI patients suffered from bleeding in digestive tract, so it is&#xD;
      very important to protect gastrointestinal mucosa. In the past, patients with coronary heart&#xD;
      disease who were accompanied by gastrointestinal diseases and could not tolerate aspirin&#xD;
      often delayed PCI or conservative treatment with drugs, and the prognosis was very poor. In&#xD;
      the study of patients with coronary heart disease complicated with atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      undergoing PCI, it is concluded that the bleeding rate in the clopidogrel combined with&#xD;
      rivaroxaban group is lower and the curative effect is not inferior to that of triple&#xD;
      antithrombotic regimen. Whether rivaroxaban can replace aspirin for coronary heart disease&#xD;
      complicated with gastrointestinal diseases has no research evidence and no relevant&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:Patients who have been selected will be randomized to the clopidogrel combined with&#xD;
      rivaroxaban arm versus the clopidogrel combined with aspirin arm. Patients selected in the&#xD;
      clopidogrel combined with rivaroxaban arm will receive clopidogrel 75 mg once daily and&#xD;
      rivaroxaban 10 mg once daily. Patients selected in the clopidogrel combined with aspirin arm&#xD;
      will receive clopidogrel 75 mg once daily and aspirin 100 mg once daily. The therapy will&#xD;
      last for at least six months in the both arms. The primary endpoints will be evaluated at&#xD;
      six-months follow-up.&#xD;
