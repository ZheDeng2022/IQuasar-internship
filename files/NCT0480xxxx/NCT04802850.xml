      Introduction: Although the effectiveness of many mobilization methods in chronic low back&#xD;
      pain (CLBP) was shown, these effects were not monitored in the long term. The aim of this&#xD;
      study was to identify the immediate, short and long-term effects of mulligan mobilization&#xD;
      with movement (MWM) in terms of pain, range of motion (ROM), flexibility, endurance,&#xD;
      functionality and disabilities in patients with CLBP. Methods: The study was designed in&#xD;
      randomized-placebo controlled with 36 people randomly distributed into 2 groups. Sustained&#xD;
      natural apophyseal glide (SNAG) was applied to the lumbar region, straight leg raise (SLR)&#xD;
      with traction to the hip, and internal rotational mobilization techniques and home exercise&#xD;
      program were applied in Group 1 (n=19); and the same techniques were applied as sham&#xD;
      mobilization in Group 2 (n=17). The evaluations were made as post-intervention for immediate&#xD;
      effect, and were also made at the 5th week, 3rd month, and 6th months for short and long-term&#xD;
      effect. Evaluation was also made for pain in 12th month.&#xD;
