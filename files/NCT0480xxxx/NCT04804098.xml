  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and middle ear barotrauma (MEB) are common reported&#xD;
      complications during hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The Phase I study data was the first to&#xD;
      demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in the occurrence of symptomatic ETD and&#xD;
      middle ear barotrauma (MEB). The Phase I Trial suggested the total time interval and rate&#xD;
      (slope) of compression (ROC) may be a determining factor in ETD and MEB. This Phase II study&#xD;
      investigates an optimal total time interval and rate of compression to reduce ETD and MEB&#xD;
      when considering each multiplace treatment (with multiple patients) as the unit of&#xD;
      observation collectively as a group, rather than for each individual patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected prospectively on group patient-treatment exposures. Our investigators&#xD;
      randomly assign patient-treatment group exposures to two different rates (slopes) of&#xD;
      compression. These are limited to the linear versus the non-linear rates (slopes) of&#xD;
      compression identical to two of four compression profiles used in the Phase I and Phase II&#xD;
      trials. All patients experiencing symptoms of ETD and MEB requiring compression stops will be&#xD;
      evaluated post treatment to confirm the presence of ETD and MEB using the O'Neill Grading&#xD;
      System (OGS). Data will be analyzed using the IBM-SPSS statistical software program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of compression holds observed in each of the compression schedules/compression&#xD;
      profiles using an identical 15-minute total time interval of compression but varying in the&#xD;
      rate (slope) of compression will be recorded as in the Phase I and II studies. Symptomatic&#xD;
      patients who required compression stops (as in the Phase I trial) using a USN TT 9 during&#xD;
      elective hyperbaric oxygen treatments in a Class A multiplace hyperbaric chamber will be&#xD;
      compared. Statistical analysis using descriptive and Inferential statistics will be applied&#xD;
      to the patients requiring first stops in the compression profiles. This will be used to&#xD;
      further evaluate the data restricted to the rate of compression (linear vs. non-linear) and&#xD;
      whether this is associated with the number of compression holds. The 15-minute total time&#xD;
      interval of compression will be identical in both compression profiles studied since this was&#xD;
      found to be the total time interval of compression with the least number of treatment&#xD;
      stops/holds in the phase I and phase II studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and middle ear barotrauma (MEB) are common reported&#xD;
      complications during hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The Phase I study data was the first to&#xD;
      demonstrate a statistically significant decrease in the occurrence of symptomatic ETD and&#xD;
      middle ear barotrauma (MEB) in specific compression profiles among those used as common&#xD;
      standards of care in hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The Phase I Trial suggested the total time&#xD;
      interval and rate (slope) of compression (ROC) may be a determining factor in ETD and MEB.&#xD;
      The Phase II study investigated tested the robustness of these findings with a larger sample&#xD;
      size and failed to determine an optimal rate of compression to reduce ETD and MEB when&#xD;
      considering each multiplace treatment (with multiple patients) as the unit of observation&#xD;
      collectively as a group, rather than for each individual patient. In this phase III trial we&#xD;
      will increase sample size further to determine if the effect size of the rate (slope) of&#xD;
      compression is smaller than anticipated in the phase I and II studies requiring a larger&#xD;
      sample size and greater power. This study will be restricted to the two compression profiles&#xD;
      limited to the 15 minute total time interval of compression which was found to be the time&#xD;
      interval associated with the least number of treatment holds or stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected prospectively on group patient-treatment exposures. The investigators&#xD;
      will randomly assign patient-treatment group exposures to a single identical time interval&#xD;
      but different rates (slopes) of compression. These compression rates (slopes) were identical&#xD;
      to those used in the Phase I and II trials. All patients experiencing symptoms of ETD and MEB&#xD;
      requiring compression stops or holds will be evaluated post-treatment to confirm the presence&#xD;
      of ETD and MEB using the O'Neill Grading System (OGS) for ETD/MEB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For approximately 10 years, the investigators hyperbaric center used a routine daily&#xD;
      multiplace chamber treatment protocol to a depth of 45 feet of seawater (fsw) (modified U.S.&#xD;
      Navy Treatment Table 9). The chamber was compressed over a 10-minute time interval&#xD;
      representing a 4.5 fsw/minute uniform rate of compression. This 4.5-fsw/minute compression&#xD;
      rate throughout the total 10-minute time interval of treatment was used as a baseline&#xD;
      compression rate to compare all other compression schedules [total compression time&#xD;
      interval/compression rates (slopes)]. The investigators will prospectively collect data on&#xD;
      patient-treatment group exposures after formalizing two different compression schedules each&#xD;
      including a unique compression rate (slope) linear vs. non-linear but using the same&#xD;
      15-minute time interval of compression. This was similar to the Phase I and Phase II study&#xD;
      but limited to two compression profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected prospectively on all patients receiving treatment from September 1,&#xD;
      2021, and October 31, 2023, and combined with the data obtained in the Phase I and II trials&#xD;
      collected from September 8, 2014 to September 8, 2016; and February 11, 2019, and February&#xD;
      10, 2020 respectively. This Phase III study defines the unit of observations as a multiplace&#xD;
      patient-treatment group exposure rather than individual patient treatment exposures. This&#xD;
      approach was considered appropriate as a treatment stop or hold in a multiplace chamber&#xD;
      affects all other patient occupants in the same treatment group exposure. It results in a&#xD;
      hold for all patients in the multiplace chamber during that respective treatment. The&#xD;
      possible effects on the other patients in the same treatment group could possibly confound&#xD;
      our outcomes. The effect of rate (slope) of compression on an individual patient can be&#xD;
      better ascertained at the individual patient level in a monoplace chamber, without&#xD;
      influencing the effect on other patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate the risk of confounding, only the first stop will be used as the stop or hold&#xD;
      indicator for that particular patient-treatment group exposure. Data will be collected on the&#xD;
      patient(s) experiencing the stop or hold. All patients will undergo pre-treatment video&#xD;
      otoscopy with baseline tympanic membrane (TM) photos and video of TM motion documenting the&#xD;
      patients ability to equalize. This is used to assess potential Eustachian tube patency and&#xD;
      proper equalization performance to help exclude individual patient technique as a confounding&#xD;
      variable. Photos will be repeated at the end of treatment on any patient(s) complaining of&#xD;
      symptoms referable to ETD/MEB that require a stop during compression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple stops for the same patient on the same treatment will not be considered. Only the&#xD;
      first compression stop or hold during each treatment exposure will be recorded or assigned as&#xD;
      a patient-treatment stop representing that particular patient-treatment group exposure.&#xD;
      Compression stops will be made when any patient experiences difficulty equalizing (requests a&#xD;
      stop or complains of ear discomfort of any type).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat video otoscopy will be conducted on all patients complaining of symptoms referable to&#xD;
      ETD or MEB to objectively document the grade of barotrauma at the end of the treatment. The&#xD;
      O'Neill Grading System will be used to record the severity of the ETD or MEB. The depth of&#xD;
      the stop, the treatment number for that particular patient, and the actions taken to&#xD;
      alleviate the symptoms during equalization will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The depth of the compression stop will be recorded in feet of seawater (fsw) as will be the&#xD;
      ascent (fsw) required for the patient to clear the middle ear pressure and relieve the&#xD;
      symptoms. The patients symptoms must be resolved, rendering the patient asymptomatic and able&#xD;
      to continue the treatment compression profile. All team members (physicians, nurses, and&#xD;
      technicians) present and working on the day of the exposure, are responsible for viewing the&#xD;
      patients pre and post tympanic membrane photos and determining the grade of barotrauma using&#xD;
      the OGS criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All stops were categorized under the respective compression protocol used for that particular&#xD;
      patient-treatment group exposure. Data will then compared using both descriptive and&#xD;
      inferential statistical analysis including the risk difference, odds ratio (OR), two-tailed&#xD;
      Chi Square analysis using α=0.05, and outcomes will be studied separately in a logistic&#xD;
      regression analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) protocols include a compression phase. Pressure is increased until final treatment pressure is achieved. Pressure changes vary between 14.7 psi to 35 psi. Patients experience symptoms of pain or pressure in the middle ear space because they cannot clear middle ear pressure upon compression of the chamber. Pressure symptoms are time related but not as yet slope related. Using varying rates of pressure may decrease discomfort related to clearing middle ear pressure known as Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) and middle ear barotrauma (MEB). They are the most common adverse effects of HBOT. The authors believe a change in slope rate of compression may decrease the occurrence of stops and decrease the incidence of ETD and MEB during HBOT. Decreasing rate of compression may further mitigate risk and decrease the incidence of symptomatic ETD and MEB.</description>
