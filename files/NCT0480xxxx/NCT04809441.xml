      Background: One of the major public health problems of the 21st century is obesity.&#xD;
      Baropodometry is commonly used to determine specific loads on the plantar surface of the foot&#xD;
      and the comportment of the body center of pressure (CoP). To evaluate the redistribution of&#xD;
      the baropodometric parameters: static and dynamic plantar pressures and antero - posterior&#xD;
      CoP, by decreasing body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A sample of 43 overweight subjects (24 male, 19 female) would be recruited for the&#xD;
      study. A hypocaloric diet would be designed with the aim to reduce participants body weight.&#xD;
      The baropodometric exam would performed in two occasions: weight 1 - Session 1 and weight 2 -&#xD;
      Session 2, when participants lost between 12 and 18 kg. The foot would be divided in 9 areas:&#xD;
      heel, midfoot, 5 metatarsal heads (MTHs), Hallux, 2-5 toes. The Footwork® pressure platform&#xD;
      would be used to carry out the evaluation.&#xD;

      Scientific Background Obesity is in one of the major public health problems of the 21st&#xD;
      century and its prevalence has tripled in many European countries in the last decades. It is&#xD;
      a strongly problem associated with a lower quality of life, as well as with the development&#xD;
      of serious chronic metabolic, cardiac and circulatory pathologies and musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disorders. Quantitative data showed that excessive body weight negatively effects on standing&#xD;
      and walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plantar pressure measurement is commonly used to determine specific loads on the plantar&#xD;
      surface of the foot. There are many case studies that assess pressures of the normal foot and&#xD;
      try to establish patterns of pathological pressures. The CoP represents the average of all&#xD;
      the weight that is in contact with the surface of the floor and is expressed as the point&#xD;
      where the vector of the vertical reaction forces of the soil is located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature it can be found how body weight influences on plantar pressure data and on&#xD;
      the position of the CoP. Excesses of body weight has shown to have negative structural&#xD;
      consequences in the feet and lower limbs. Obesity is also related with an anterior&#xD;
      displacement of the CoP, since the instability in obese people, associated to weight&#xD;
      increasing, seems to be determinant with CoP in an anterior position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computerized baropodometry is helpful for foot diseases diagnosis, foot function evaluation&#xD;
      and to follow-up the treatment. It has been practiced to determine specific weight parameters&#xD;
      in obese adults, among others. Nonetheless, there are not in the literature specific studies&#xD;
      that have analyzed by computerized baropodometry how plantar pressures and CoP improve by&#xD;
      decreasing body weight in obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective The present research wanted to evaluate plantar pressures and antero - posterior&#xD;
      CoP improvement by decreasing body weight in static and dynamic baropodometry data collection&#xD;
      in obese adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The design of the present research was based on and executed according to the STROBE&#xD;
      reporting guideline. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Clinical Research of&#xD;
      Aragón (CEICA) with number C.P.-C.I. PI17/0203. Participants voluntarily signed an informed&#xD;
      consent. The study has been conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants The study would include overweight subjects between 18 and 65 years old, medical&#xD;
      weight loss indicated, no lower limb or spine pathology that might affect normal gait, nor&#xD;
      structural or functional deformities in the feet. Candidates who not comply inclusion&#xD;
      criteria, or reported pain in participant´s feet within the previous 6 months, or had any&#xD;
      previous foot surgery would be excluded. Them would be recruited at one Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Nutrition private clinic in Huesca, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure Participants would be rigorously evaluated by the same endocrine doctor and&#xD;
      podiatrist at baseline (Session 1) and at the end of the study after weight loss intervention&#xD;
      (Session 2), when each participant lost between 11-12% of its corporal weight. Therefore,&#xD;
      there will be obtained 2 weight related with the two sessions: Session 1 - Weight 1; Session&#xD;
      2 - Weight 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve the propose weight loss, lifestyle modification would be applied: A&#xD;
      specific very low-calorie diet (&lt;800kcal/day), and 2 daily sessions of 15 minutes of&#xD;
      anaerobic physical exercise depending on the capacity of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Session 1 and Session 2, before and after weight loss intervention, participants would be&#xD;
      subjected to a baropodometric examination (static and dynamic). It allows to quantitatively&#xD;
      mapping pressures in each segment of the plantar surface. For the static, participants would&#xD;
      be asked to stand in the center of the platform for 5 seconds, with their arms on either side&#xD;
      of the body in a natural position looking straight ahead. To minimize individual´s corporal&#xD;
      fluctuations in static (as body weight oscillation and imbalance) the procedure would be&#xD;
      applied 3 times per session. For the dynamic, participants would be asked to walk barefoot on&#xD;
      the platform at their normal pace following the 3-step protocol, which requires landing on&#xD;
      the platform on the third step of gait. To minimize corporal individual fluctuations in&#xD;
      dynamic (as body weight oscillation, imbalance and changes in gait speed) the procedure would&#xD;
      be applied 3 times per session. Both feet would be subdivided into 9 areas: heel, midfoot, 5&#xD;
      MTHs, the Hallux, 2-5 toes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peak pressures of these areas in kg/cm2 and the position of the CoP, were obtained using the&#xD;
      Footwork® software. Peak pressure data were graphically exposed and related with the two&#xD;
      weights for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Equipment Participant´s weight and height were measured during each session with an Año-Sayol&#xD;
      scale and stadiometer, respectively (Año-Sayol SL, Barcelona, Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Footwork® platform (AM3-IST®, France), was used for the baropodometric analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis An initial exploratory analysis of all clinical variables would be&#xD;
      carried out. Continuous variables would be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD),&#xD;
      whereas qualitative variables would be expressed as frequencies and percentages. Continuous&#xD;
      data would be checked for normality by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. Chi-Square Test would be&#xD;
      applied to show the relationship between qualitative variables. To compare mean weights&#xD;
      between two independent groups according to normality, Student's-T Test and ANOVA Test to &quot;m&quot;&#xD;
      groups would be used. Differences between Session 1 and Session 2, would be performed using&#xD;
      mean comparison methods, Wilcoxon when the variable does not follow normal distribution, and&#xD;
      Student's T for related samples when there is normality. To quantify the difference between&#xD;
      weight and plantar pressures and the CoP at Session 1 and Session 2 the &quot;change percentage&quot;&#xD;
      would be calculated, which would be defined as the relative variation in percentage points&#xD;
      between both sessions: Weight-Change % (WC%)= [(Weight at Session 2 - Weight at Session 1)/&#xD;
      Weight Session 1] x 100; Plantar-Pressure-Change % (PPC%) = [(Pressure at Session 2 -&#xD;
      Pressure at Session 1)/ Pressure at Session 1] x 100; CoP-Change % = [(time CoP X+1 - time&#xD;
      CoP X)/ time CoP X] x 100. The &quot;change percentage&quot; would be analyzed through Spearman&#xD;
      correlation coefficient, according to normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;improve&quot; variable would be established in order to analyze the possible relationship&#xD;
      between weight loss and the 9 pressure foot areas considered at Session 1 and Session 2 for&#xD;
      both: static and dynamic baropodometry. Statistical significance level would be set at p&#xD;
      &lt;0.05, confidence level set in the comparisons was 95%. The statistical analyses would be&#xD;
      performed using the SPSS software 22.0 for Windows (SPSS Ibérica, Madrid, Spain).&#xD;
