    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of PRF, CGF and AFG application on early&#xD;
      wound healing after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty operations. In the study designed split&#xD;
      mouth, gingivectomy and gingivoplasty surgery were performed on 19 patients. The&#xD;
      postoperative PRF, CGF, and AFG applied areas were compared with the control regions. 0th,7&#xD;
      th,14 th and 28 th on the days, the surgical area was painted with mira-2-tone solution and&#xD;
      evaluated in the ImageJ program. Measurements of clinical periodontal parameters including&#xD;
      PI, GI, SC and SD were recorded at the beginning, after IPT and 28 days after the operation.&#xD;
      Wound healing was evaluated with H2O2 test, VAS-Pain, and LTH index on 7th, 14th and 28th&#xD;
      days. The patients were asked to evaluate their aesthetic perceptions on the VAS aesthetic&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;

      Study design and patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized, controlled, split-mouth (lower, upper jaw, right and left anterior&#xD;
      regions) clinical study, who applied to İnönü University Faculty of Dentistry Department of&#xD;
      Periodontology between January 2020 and May 2020, due to gingival problems, chronic&#xD;
      examination was performed. included individuals diagnosed with inflammatory gingival&#xD;
      enlargement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients received initial periodontal therapy (BPT). The patients were called for control&#xD;
      after 2 weeks and surgery was planned for the patients who provided adequate oral hygiene. In&#xD;
      our study, the vertical DM index, first described by Goaz and Angelopoulos, and later&#xD;
      modified by Damm and Miller (DM), was used to classify the gingival enlargement in the&#xD;
      vertical direction (1). In order to classify the bucco-lingual gingival growths in the&#xD;
      interdental papillae, the horizontal MB index, first described by Seymour et al. And later&#xD;
      modified by Miranda and Brunet (MB), was used (2). As a result of the measurements made,&#xD;
      grades other than score 0 according to the DB and MB indices were accepted as having gingival&#xD;
      enlargement. The distribution of control (n = 19) and three test groups (n = 19, n = 19, n =&#xD;
      19) after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty was randomized (block randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical periodontal evaluation, plaque index (PI) (3), gingival index (GI) (4), bleeding&#xD;
      on probing (SC) and probing depth (SD ) measurements were performed at baseline (T0), after&#xD;
      BPT (T1) and on the 28th day (T2) after gingivectomy and gingivoplasty operation.&#xD;
      Measurements were made in a total of 6 regions of all teeth: mesio-buccal, mid-buccal,&#xD;
      disto-buccal, disto-lingual / palatinal, mid-lingual / palatinal and mesio-lingual /&#xD;
      palatinal. Clinical periodontal measurements of all teeth of the individuals included in the&#xD;
      study were performed by a single investigator (E.B.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gingivectomy and gingivoplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, all patients were gargled with 0.12% chlorhexidine for 1 minute. The incision&#xD;
      lines were determined by applying infiltrative anesthesia (Maxicaine Fort) to the areas to be&#xD;
      operated, and the external bevel incision was performed with a # 15 scalpel (Broche® Medical&#xD;
      scalpel tip; carbon steel) and a Kirkland blade (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). Orban blade&#xD;
      (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) was used in the interproximal areas. After the incision was&#xD;
      completed, the remaining gum pieces were removed with the help of periodontal curette and&#xD;
      microsurgical scissors (Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA). Then gingivoplasty was performed. After&#xD;
      gingivectomy and gingivoplasty, the control areas were left to recover spontaneously. PRF,&#xD;
      CGF and AFG were applied to the test areas. Surgical areas in control and test areas were&#xD;
      covered with a periodontal pat (Coe-Pak, lsip, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of platelet-rich fibrin membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood taken from the antecubital veins of the patients was collected into 10 ml sterile&#xD;
      glass-covered plastic tubes (Vacuette serum tubes, Greiner Bio-one) that did not contain&#xD;
      anticoagulants. The collected venous blood was placed in the PC-02 (Process, Nice, France)&#xD;
      centrifuge device and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 (400xg) minutes (5). The obtained PRF&#xD;
      was taken out of the tube, placed in the PRF-BOX and turned into a membrane by compressing&#xD;
      with light pressure for about 1 minute. The prepared PRF membranes were applied to the&#xD;
      surgical operation area and the operation area was closed with a periodontal pat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of concentrated growth factor membrane&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood taken from the antecubital veins of the patients was collected into 10 ml sterile&#xD;
      glass-covered plastic tubes (Vacuette serum tubes, Greiner Bio-one) that did not contain&#xD;
      anticoagulants. These tubes were then centrifuged in a centrifuge device (Medifuge;&#xD;
      Silfradent srl, Sofia, Italy) using a program with the following features: acceleration for&#xD;
      30 seconds followed by 2 minutes (692xg) at 2700 rpm, 4 minutes (547xg) at 2400 rpm, 2700&#xD;
      rpm. Centrifugation for 4 minutes (592xg) at 3000 rpm for 3 minutes (855xg) and finally&#xD;
      deceleration for 36 seconds (6). After centrifugation, CGF was taken from the middle part of&#xD;
      the tube, placed in PRF-BOX and turned into a membrane by compressing with light pressure for&#xD;
      about 1 minute. Prepared CGF membranes were applied to the surgical operation area and the&#xD;
      operation area was closed with a periodontal pat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of autologous fibrin glue&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood taken from the patient was transferred to a 9 ml glass-covered plastic tube&#xD;
      (Vacuette serum tubes, Greiner Bio-one) that did not contain any anticoagulants. Sohn et al.&#xD;
      In the protocol he recommended (7), the venous blood collected in the tube was centrifuged in&#xD;
      a centrifuge device (Medifuge, Silfradent, Italy) at 2700 rpm (approximately 692 g) for 2&#xD;
      min. AFG obtained from the upper part of the tube after centrifugation was collected with the&#xD;
      help of an injector and transferred to the metal body. The polymerization was allowed for&#xD;
      15-20 minutes. After polymerization was completed, AFG was applied to the surgical operation&#xD;
      area and the operation area was covered with a periodontal pat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Operative Care and Suggestion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were advised to protect the wound area with periodontal pats from trauma, not to&#xD;
      consume too hot and too cold foods, and to eat soft foods. It was stated that the pat should&#xD;
      be kept in the mouth for 1 week, and if the pat was damaged during this period, they should&#xD;
      apply to our clinic immediately. Patients were prescribed paracetamol-containing analgesic&#xD;
      (Parol 500 mg) and a mouthwash containing 0.12% chlorhexidine to use three times a day for a&#xD;
      week. The patients were only advised not to brush their teeth in the operation area for 1&#xD;
      week. It was stated that he should provide oral hygiene in areas that were not operated. They&#xD;
      were advised to use an extra soft toothbrush in the area after the pat was removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface area determination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mira-2-tone, a plaque staining agent (GMBH &amp; Co., Duisburg, Germany), was used to detect&#xD;
      wound surface epithelization at baseline, postoperative 7, 14, and 28 days. Standardized&#xD;
      photographs were taken from each patient to evaluate the dark stained areas after staining&#xD;
      with Mira-2-tone in the gingiva where epithelialization was not completed and wound healing&#xD;
      continued. During the photo shoot, the patients were seated upright and facing straight&#xD;
      ahead. All photos were taken by a single person on the same camera (Nikon Coolpix 4500,&#xD;
      Tokyo, Japan), at the same distance (20 cm) and light values (ISO-800). The photo size was&#xD;
      scaled by using a 10 mm Williams periodontal probe during the photo taking. Wound surface&#xD;
      epithelization was calculated using Image J software program (National Institutes of Health,&#xD;
      USA ImageJ 1.48V) from the photographs obtained. Each measurement step was done by the same&#xD;
      researcher (E.B.) each time. The calibration of the person who made the measurements was&#xD;
      performed by repeating the wound surface epithelialization area measurement at one-week&#xD;
      intervals on the photo images of 10 patients who had undergone gingivectomy and gingivoplasty&#xD;
      surgery and were not included in the study. In these two separate evaluations, the&#xD;
      calculations were 95% compatible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epithelialization test&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate the wound surface epithelization during the healing process, 3% H2O2 was&#xD;
      applied to the surface of the operation area with the help of an injector. As a result of the&#xD;
      decomposition of H2O2 into water and oxygen through the catalase enzyme released by the blood&#xD;
      cells present in the wound area, it was evaluated as &quot;epithelization incomplete&quot; if foaming&#xD;
      was observed with oxygen formation, and &quot;epithelization completed&quot; if foaming was not&#xD;
      observed . H2O2 test was performed at the controls on the 7th, 14th and 28th days after the&#xD;
      operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healing index Landry, Turnbull, and Howley (LTH) index, which classified the healing process&#xD;
      according to wound surface redness, presence of bleeding, granulation tissue, epithelization,&#xD;
      and suppuration (8). The wound healing process with LTH index was performed at the&#xD;
      postoperative 7th, 14th and 28th days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain and aesthetic&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS was used for postoperative pain and aesthetic evaluation (9). The patient's 7th, 14th He&#xD;
      was asked to evaluate the level of pain he felt from 1 to 10 according to the VAS-Pain (1:&#xD;
      low pain, 10: severe pain) scale in the control sessions on the 28th and 28th days. In the&#xD;
      control session on the 28th day, the patients were asked to evaluate their aesthetic&#xD;
      perceptions from 1 to 10 according to the VAS-Aesthetics (1: dissatisfied, 10: very&#xD;
      satisfied) scale.&#xD;
