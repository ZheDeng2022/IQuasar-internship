      In this study, using a fermented grape drinks made of fermented grapes with fruit and&#xD;
      vegetable powder to explore whether it can improve the skin's condition and achieve&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects. Sixty subjects were recruited and divided into placebo group and&#xD;
      fermented grape drinks group. After drinking for 8 weeks, skin test and blood biochemical&#xD;
      analysis were performed.&#xD;

    <description>The subjects divided into a placebo group (n=30) and an experimental group (n=30). Each subject was informed to consume one bottle of a 50 mL of grape drink or a placebo drink daily for 8 weeks, then using corneometer CM825 to examine skin brightness (The higher the value, the more water content, C.U., corneometer units )</description>

    <description>The subjects divided into a placebo group (n=30) and an experimental group (n=30). Each subject was informed to consume one bottle of a 50 mL of grape drink or a placebo drink daily for 8 weeks, then using cutometer dual MPA580 to examine skin elasticity (The closer the R2 value is to 1, the better the elasticity and no unit)</description>

    <description>The subjects divided into a placebo group (n=30) and an experimental group (n=30). Each subject was informed to consume one bottle of a 50 mL of grape drink or a placebo drink daily for 8 weeks, then using probe system GL2000 &amp; MPA10 to examine skin moisture (The higher the value, the higher the gloss, no unit)</description>

    <description>The subjects divided into a placebo group (n=30) and an experimental group (n=30). Each subject was informed to consume one bottle of a 50 mL of grape drink or a placebo drink daily for 8 weeks, then usig VISIA-CR to examine skin spot (The higher the value, the larger the pore area, mm2)</description>

    <description>The subjects divided into a placebo group (n=30) and an experimental group (n=30). Each subject was informed to consume one bottle of a 50 mL of grape drink or a placebo drink daily for 8 weeks, then using VISIOSCAN-VC20 to examine skin wrinkle (The higher the value, the more wrinkles, surface evaluation of wrinkles, SEW)</description>
