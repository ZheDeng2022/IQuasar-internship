    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (PMBL,&#xD;
      Ismigen) on the clinical course of grass pollen-induced allergic rhinitis (using: total nasal&#xD;
      symptom score, visual analogue scale, peak nasal inspiratory flow measurement) in children&#xD;
      aged 5 to 17 and to assess changes in the concentration of iNKT cells under the influence of&#xD;
      the therapy. Half of the 80 participants will receive PMBL while the other half will receive&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is caused by the allergens of wind-pollinated plants, and in&#xD;
      Poland mainly by grass pollen allergens. During the grass pollen season, patients may suffer&#xD;
      from fatigue, weakness, lack of fitness, difficulty in sleeping and reduced performance at&#xD;
      school. In people allergic to the above-mentioned pollen, the disease significantly reduces&#xD;
      the quality of life and requires intensive treatment in the pollen period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high incidence of allergic rhinitis, the negative impact of the disease on the&#xD;
      quality of life, and incomplete effectiveness of previously available therapeutic methods,&#xD;
      new methods of treatment are being developed. Recent research highlights the immunoregulatory&#xD;
      potential of bacterial lysates, indicating the possibility of their future use in the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis, and asthma. However, the mechanism of action of these drugs in allergic diseases is&#xD;
      still not entirely clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iNKT (Invariant Natural Killer T) are a conserved line of T cells with unique features&#xD;
      expressing the invariant TCR alpha chain and recognizing glycolipids presented in the context&#xD;
      of the non-classical MHC molecule, CD1d. As a result of TCR stimulation, iNKT cells are able&#xD;
      to quickly secrete a variety of cytokines, thus stimulating various immune processes and&#xD;
      playing an immunoregulatory role. iNKT cells are a small percentage of all T cells, however&#xD;
      numerous studies indicate their possible participation in the pathogenesis of allergic&#xD;
      diseases.The ambivalence of the activity of iNKT cells may result from the heterogeneity of&#xD;
      this subpopulation. iNKT cells, like T lymphocytes, can be divided into further&#xD;
      subpopulations: iNKT1, iNKT2, iNKT10, iNKT17 and iNKTreg. Individual subpopulations have a&#xD;
      different cytokine profile, and thus may play opposite functions in the pathomechanism of&#xD;
      many diseases, including allergic ones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical course of the pollen allergic&#xD;
      rhinitis, caused by grass pollen allergens in children during the grass pollen season,&#xD;
      treated with polyvalent mechanical bacterial lysate (PMBL) and to assess the impact of PMBL&#xD;
      on changes in the concentrations of the iNKT cell subpopulation. The approval of the&#xD;
      Bioethics Committee at the Medical University in Lublin was obtained for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eighty children with SAR will be enrolled to this study and randomly assigned to the PMBL&#xD;
      group (n=40) and placebo group (n=40). The study will include six visits, 2 site visits&#xD;
      (before the grass pollen season and at the peak of the grass pollen season) and 4 telephone&#xD;
      visits.The first site visit will be the randomization visit. The second site visit will take&#xD;
      place after the end of the drug intake period. Telephone contact with the patient will take&#xD;
      place twice during the period of taking the drug, and twice after the end of this period&#xD;
      (follow-up visits).The time frame of the grass pollen season for south-eastern Poland will be&#xD;
      determined using the &quot;95%&quot; method on the basis of measurements of grass pollen concentration&#xD;
      in the atmospheric air, which will be obtained from the Environmental Allergy Research Centre&#xD;
      in Warsaw. Patients will start taking sublingual tablets at the beginning of the April 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasal SAR symptoms will be recorded by parents of children in the daily patient diary&#xD;
      according to the standard scoring system (TNSS, total nasal symptom score), and their&#xD;
      intensity will be also evaluated during six visits using VAS (visual analogue scale). At each&#xD;
      site visit, peak nasal inspiratory flow (PNIF) will be also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the mechanism responsible for the possible effects of PMBL, blood&#xD;
      samples (8 ml) will be taken from patients for additional tests during two site visits. The&#xD;
      following iNKT cell subpopulations will be measured in the blood: iNKT1, iNKT2, iNKT10,&#xD;
      iNKT17 and iNKTreg.&#xD;

    <description>The severity of nasal SAR symptoms (sneezing, runny nose, itchy nose and nasal congestion) will be recorded by parents of children in the daily patient diary using the following scale: 0 = absent (no symptom); 1 = mild (symptom present, easily tolerated); 2 = moderate (awareness of symptom, bothersome but tolerable); 3 = severe (symptoms hard to tolerate, interfere with daily activities and/or sleeping).&#xD;
The total nasal symptom score (sum of the 4 symptom scores) ranges from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (worst symptoms).&#xD;
Weekly average TNSS values from the baseline period (before the grass pollen season) and obtained 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months and 5 months after initiating therapy will be used for statistical analysis.</description>
