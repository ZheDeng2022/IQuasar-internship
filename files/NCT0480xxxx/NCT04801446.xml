  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective interventional single center randomized sham controlled dose-escalation&#xD;
      study will assess safety, tolerability, feasibility and potential efficacy of transcranial&#xD;
      direct current stimulation (tDCS) in acute stroke patients with substantial salvageable&#xD;
      penumbra due to a large vessel occlusion who are ineligible for both intravenous thrombolysis&#xD;
      (IV tPA) and endovascular therapy (EVT). Patients will be randomized in a 3:1 design, to&#xD;
      cathodal versus sham (control) tDCS, at each six designed dose tiers. The dose tiers will be&#xD;
      increasing in both intensity and duration of the stimulation. The occurrence of symptomatic&#xD;
      intracranial hemorrhage will determine the pace of the escalation through the dose tiers.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary safety outcome: the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) in the active treatment arm compared to sham arm, and between higher and lower dose tiers.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24-hour post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The presence of SICH will be assessed on 24-hour post-stimulation non-contrast CT scan. SICH will be defined as an intracranial hemorrhage with an increase of ≥ 4 points on the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 24h after stimulation. In case of sudden worsening of neurostatus anytime within first 24 hours after stimulation, first follow-up CT will be performed immediately (earlier). The treatment will be considered to have exhibited adequate safety if tDCS results in lower or equivalent rates of SICH compared to sham.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary safety outcome: the rate of asymptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (AICH) in the active treatment arm compared to sham arm, and between higher and lower dose tiers.</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24-hour post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>The AICH will be defined as an intracranial hemorrhage on 24h post-stimulation non-contrast CT scan that is not associated with NIHSS worsening ≥ 4 within 24 hours after stimulation.The treatment will be considered to have exhibited adequate safety if tDCS results in lower or equivalent rates of AICH compared to sham.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary safety outcome: the rate of early neurologic deterioration in the active treatment arm compared to sham arm, and between higher and lower dose tiers.</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 24-hour post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Early neurological deterioration will be defined as worsening ≥ 4 on NIHSS during the 24-hour period after stimulation without intracranial hemorrhage. The treatment will be considered to have exhibited adequate safety if tDCS results in lower or equivalent rates of early neurological deterioration compared to sham.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary safety outcome: the rate of mortality in the active treatment arm compare to sham arm, and between higher and lower dose tiers.</measure>
    <time_frame>By day 90 post stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>Mortality will be defined as death or modified Rankin Scale of 6. The treatment will be considered to have exhibited adequate safety if tDCS results in lower or equivalent rates of mortality compared to sham.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Secondary safety outcome: the rate of all serious adverse events occurring during the 90 days of study participation in the active treatment arm compare to sham arm, and between higher and lower dose tiers.</measure>
    <time_frame>By day 90 post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>A serious adverse event is any adverse event that is fatal, is lifethreatening, is permanently or substantially disabling, requires or prolongs hospitalization, or requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the above outcomes. The rate of serious adverse events will be compared between the active treatment and sham patients, and between higher and lower dose tiers.The treatment will be considered to have exhibited adequate safety if tDCS results in lower or equivalent rates of serious adverse events compared to sham.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability outcome: percentage of the patients completing the stimulation</measure>
    <time_frame>During procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of the patients completing the protocol-assigned stimulation treatment. A patient will be considered to have tolerated the stimulation if at least 75 percent of the stimulation period is completed. The treatment will be considered generally tolerable if, among all enrolled patients, tolerated procedures are achieved in ≥90 percent of patients without early cessation.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability outcome: rate and severity of cutaneous, neurological, nociceptive and other adverse effects</measure>
    <time_frame>During procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The rate and severity of cutaneous, neurologic, nociceptive or other adverse effects will be assessed. At the end of each 20-minute stimulation cycle, a tolerability form will be completed based on validated cutaneous, neurological and pain items of the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTAE). A separate tolerability form will be completed by the patient at the of each stimulation cycle.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>During procedure</time_frame>
    <description>The speed with which tDCS will be implemented. The predefined success threshold for feasibility will be median time from randomization to tDCS initiation ≤ 10 minutes in the last 10 enrolled patients.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory imaging efficacy outcome: final infarct growth</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24-hour post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>By comparing the baseline CTP imaging with the CT imaging at 24-hour post-stimulation the final infarct growth will be calculated as: final infarct volume at 24h follow-up CT minus ischemic core volume at baseline CTP. This imaging efficacy endpoint will be characterized in the active and sham patients, and in higher and lower dose tiers. The study is underpowered to definitely assess reduction of final infarct growth, however, the treatment may be considered to be effective if tDCS results in higher reduction of final infarct growth compared to sham.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory clinical efficacy outcome: neurological deficit</measure>
    <time_frame>At 24-hour post-stimulation and at day 90 post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>At 24-hour post stimulation, a severity of early neurological deficit will be assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS). At day 90 post-stimulation, residual NIHSS will be assessed. These clinical efficacy endpoints will be characterized in the active and sham patients, and in higher and lower dose tiers. The study is underpowered to definitely assess efficacy, however, the treatment may be considered to be efficacious if tDCS results in an improved neurological deficit compared to sham.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory clinical efficacy outcome: global disability</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 90 post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>At day 90 post-stimulation, a rate of global disability will be assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). This clinical efficacy endpoint will be characterized in the active and sham patients, and in higher and lower dose tiers. The study is underpowered to definitely assess efficacy, however, the treatment may be considered to be efficacious if tDCS results in lower global disability compared to sham.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory clinical efficacy outcome: instrumental activities of daily living</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 90 post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>At day 90 post-stimulation, a measure of global disability will be assessed using the Barthel Index (BI). This clinical efficacy endpoint will be characterized in the active and sham patients, and in higher and lower dose tiers. The study is underpowered to definitely assess efficacy, however, the treatment may be considered to be efficacious if tDCS results in improved instrumental activities of daily living compared to sham.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory clinical efficacy outcome: health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 90 post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>At day 90 post-stimulation, a health-related quality of life will be assessed using the EuroQol- 5 Dimension instrument (EQ-5D). This clinical efficacy endpoint will be characterized in the active and sham patients, and in higher and lower dose tiers. The study is underpowered to definitely assess efficacy, however, the treatment may be considered to be efficacious if tDCS results in an improved health-related quality of life compared to sham.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Exploratory clinical efficacy outcome: granular degree of disability</measure>
    <time_frame>At day 90 post-stimulation</time_frame>
    <description>At day 90 post-stimulation, a granular degree of disability will be assessed using the Academic Medical Center (AMC) Linear Disability Score. This clinical efficacy endpoint will be characterized in the active and sham patients, and in higher and lower dose tiers. The study is underpowered to definitely assess efficacy, however, the treatment may be considered to be efficacious if tDCS results in an improved granular degree of disability compared to sham.</description>
