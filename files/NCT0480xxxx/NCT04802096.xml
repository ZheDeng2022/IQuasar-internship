  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inspiratory muscle weakness, limited functional exercise capacity and worse quality of life&#xD;
      have been shown in patients with exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD). Recommendations from clinical practice guideline state that promoting pulmonary&#xD;
      rehabilitation after exacerbation can improve the conditions above. Inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      training (IMT) has been proven to enhance inspiratory muscle strength and endurance in&#xD;
      patient with stable COPD. However, there is less research on whether IMT in addition to&#xD;
      pulmonary rehabilitation after exacerbation can benefit inspiratory muscle function,&#xD;
      functional exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with COPD. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the effects of IMT in addition to pulmonary rehabilitation on respiratory&#xD;
      muscle function, functional exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with moderate&#xD;
      exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.&#xD;

    <description>The surface electromyography (EMG) signal was analyzed in the time domain, calculating root mean square (RMS) amplitude with a time constant of 30 mini seconds. A 1.5 seconds window of diaphragm muscle signals at peak pressure during maximal inspiratory pressure test were obtained and calculated as maximal effort. Diaphragm activation were calculated using mean RMS values of each threshold loaded breathing test, and then normalized to maximal effort (%EMGDia).</description>

    <description>The surface electromyography (EMG) signal was analyzed in the time domain, calculating root mean square (RMS) amplitude with a time constant of 30 mini seconds. A 1.5 seconds window of SCM muscle signals at peak pressure during maximal inspiratory pressure test were obtained and calculated as maximal effort. SCM activation were calculated using mean RMS values of each threshold loaded breathing test, and then normalized to maximal effort (%EMGSCM).</description>
