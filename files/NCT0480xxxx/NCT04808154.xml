      A Phase 1 Single Dose Study to investigate the safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of SNP-630 in Health Subjects To evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic profile of SNP-630 when oral administered to healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 1, open-label, single-dose study to assess its safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of SNP-630 in 14 health volunteers. Subjects will receive oral&#xD;
      SNP-630 at a dose of 720 mg to assess its safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After written informed consent has been obtained, all screening procedures and tests that&#xD;
      establish study eligibility will be performed within 28 days prior to day -1 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is to assess the following variable:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical safety observations will include Adverse Events (AEs), vital sign measurements,&#xD;
      12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory assessments. Safety data will be tabulated and where&#xD;
      appropriate, analyzed by the use of descriptive statistics. Safety data will be tabulated by&#xD;
      system organ class and preferred term and will be further classified by relationship to&#xD;
      treatment. The probability of safety events will be estimated and with associated 95%&#xD;
      corresponding confidence intervals for each cohort using the binomial distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time upon request&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical event that occurs in a participant administered an investigational product, and it does not necessarily indicate only events with clear causal relationship with the relevant investigational product. An SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged in-patient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>

    <description>Concentrations of SNP-630 and it metabolites in plasma and urine will be measured by a specific and sensitive LC/MS/MS method developed in the laboratory of Clinical Pharmacokinetic Laboratory of Tri-Service General Hospital. According to the pharmacokinetic parameters of SNP-630 and its metabolites in health subjects oral SNP-630 to assess the safety information.The study will be conducted to validate the precision, accuracy (including with-run and between-run variation), linearity, specificity, reproducibility, limit of quantitation based on recovery studies. Assays will be performed in the laboratory of Clinical Pharmacokinetic Laboratory of Tri-Service General Hospital. Spiked samples of known concentrations will be analyzed together for quality control of the assay method.</description>
