  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ventilated pediatric patients are frequently over-sedated and the majority suffer from&#xD;
      delirium, a form of acute brain dysfunction that is an independent predictor of increased&#xD;
      risk of dying, length of stay, and costs. Universally prescribed sedative medications-the&#xD;
      GABA-ergic benzodiazepines-worsen this brain organ dysfunction and independently prolong&#xD;
      duration of ventilation and ICU stay, and the available alternative sedation regimen using&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, has been shown to be superior to benzodiazepines in&#xD;
      adults, and may mechanistically impact outcomes through positive effects on innate immunity,&#xD;
      bacterial clearance, apoptosis, cognition and delirium. The mini-MENDS trial will compare&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine and midazolam, and determine the best sedative medication to reduce delirium&#xD;
      and improve duration of ventilation, and functional, psychiatric, and cognitive recovery in&#xD;
      our most vulnerable patients-survivors of pediatric critical illness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The need for mechanical ventilation (MV) following acute respiratory and myocardial failure&#xD;
      is the leading cause of admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Over 90% of MV&#xD;
      pediatric patients receive continuous sedation, most commonly with gamma-aminobutyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA) agonist benzodiazepines. Recently, we demonstrated that exposure to the benzodiazepine&#xD;
      midazolam contributed to iatrogenic harm in pediatric patients-prolonging PICU length of stay&#xD;
      and increasing the prevalence and duration of delirium. Delirium is prevalent in the PICU&#xD;
      with rates of up to 30% in older children, over 50% in infants and toddlers, and up to 60-70%&#xD;
      in those on MV. Delirium in children is a significant contributor to longer duration of MV,&#xD;
      substantial consequential costs, prolonged ICU stay, and mortality. Adult studies have shown&#xD;
      that an alternative sedation paradigm using dexmedetomidine, an alpha-2 agonist, decreases&#xD;
      the prevalence and duration of delirium, duration of MV, ICU length of stay, cost, and&#xD;
      infection rates compared to benzodiazepine-based sedation. Furthermore, the FDA recently&#xD;
      published warnings regarding the possible role of anesthetics, including benzodiazepines, on&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction in children. Dexmedetomidine has unique anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-oxidant characteristics that are appealing given the association between inflammation,&#xD;
      and endothelial and blood-brain barrier (BBB) injury with prolonged delirium and worse&#xD;
      cognitive impairment in adults. To this end, there has been no large pediatric cohort study&#xD;
      to examine the relationship between sedative choice and exposure in the ICU (a much longer&#xD;
      exposure) with cognitive impairment among pediatric survivors. We therefore propose&#xD;
      mini-MENDS (Maximizing Efficacy of Goal-Directed Sedation to Reduce Neurological Dysfunction&#xD;
      in Mechanically Ventilated Infants and Children STUDY), in which we will determine whether&#xD;
      sedation of MV pediatric patients with an alpha-2 agonist (dexmedetomidine) versus a&#xD;
      GABA-ergic benzodiazepine (midazolam) will decrease daily prevalence of delirium (Aim 1A) and&#xD;
      duration of MV (Aim 1B), will be associated with better functional, psychiatric, and&#xD;
      cognitive recovery (Aim 2), and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and biomarkers&#xD;
      of endothelial and blood brain barrier injury (Aim 3). To accomplish these aims, we will&#xD;
      randomize 372 pediatric patients on MV, aged 6 months to 11 years, to receive goal-directed&#xD;
      continuous sedation with either dexmedetomidine or midazolam for up to 10 days. Our primary&#xD;
      outcome, daily prevalence of delirium, will be objectively measured by trained research&#xD;
      nurses who are blinded to intervention arm. Screening for delirium will be completed using&#xD;
      the Preschool or Pediatric Confusion Assessment Methods for the ICU (ps/pCAM-ICU), based on&#xD;
      developmental age, twice daily for up to 14 days while in the PICU. Cognition, functional&#xD;
      status, and parental/patient psychological health will be assessed at enrollment (baseline),&#xD;
      hospital discharge (DC), and 6 months following ICU-DC during an in-person evaluation by the&#xD;
      pediatric neuropsychiatry team. Blood will be collected on days 1, 3, and 5&#xD;
      post-randomization to measure cytokines, markers of endothelial and BBB injury, and for&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;

    <description>The analysis of delirium prevalence will be conducted using a modified Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, defined as all patients who were randomized and received study drug. We chose a 14 day evaluation period for delirium, because it represents the best balance of gaining valuable clinical information, while maximizing resource utilization, given the average study drug infusion to be 5 days and maximum duration to be 10 days. Thus our follow-up period will cover 9 additional days of delirium monitoring after the study drug is stopped in the majority of our patients.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be eligible for enrollment if they are 1) aged â¥ 6 months and &lt; 11&#xD;
             years, 2) admitted to the pediatric ICU at Monroe Carell Jr. Children's Hospital at&#xD;
             Vanderbilt (MCJCHV), and 3) on mechanical ventilation (MV) requiring sedation.&#xD;
             Pre-pubescent children (&lt;11 years) are typically different from older children who&#xD;
             often behave physiologically more similar to adults. Pre-pubescent children are more&#xD;
             likely to be admitted to the PICU and are undergoing a steeper curve of neurocognitive&#xD;
             maturation. Therefore, these patients may be at greatest risk for worse brain&#xD;
             dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: Patients will be excluded (i.e., not approached for consent) if any one&#xD;
        is present:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Receiving continuous sedation for &gt; 48 hours prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Rapidly resolving respiratory failure at screening, with planned immediate liberation&#xD;
             from MV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe developmental delay at baseline defined as a score of â¥ 4 (severe disability)&#xD;
             on the Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category (PCPC) Scale, referencing cognitive&#xD;
             status prior to critical illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Clinically significant 2nd or 3rd degree heart block or bradycardia &lt; 60 beats per&#xD;
             minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Benzodiazepine dependency with ongoing medical requirement of continuous&#xD;
             benzodiazepine (infusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability to co-enroll with another study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Expected death or care plan for withdrawal of support measures within 24 hours of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Bilateral vision loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to understand English or deafness that will preclude delirium evaluation.&#xD;
             The inability to understand English in verbal participants will not result in&#xD;
             exclusion when the research staff is proficient and/or translation services are&#xD;
             actively available in that particular language.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Documented allergy to either dexmedetomidine or midazolam.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Medical requirement of continuous (infusion) neuromuscular blockade administration&#xD;
             that is planned ongoing for at least 48 hours at time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Inability to start the informed consent process within the 48 hours from the time that&#xD;
             all inclusion criteria were met (possible reasons):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Attending physician refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. 48-hour period of eligibility was exceeded before the patient was screened&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Legal Authorized Decision Maker (e.g. legal guardian/power of attorney) refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Legal Authorized Decision Maker (e.g. legal guardian/power of attorney)&#xD;
                  unavailable&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Legal Authorized Decision Maker (e.g. legal guardian/power of attorney) is&#xD;
                  non-English speaking and available research staff is not proficient and/or&#xD;
                  translation services are not available in that particular language.&#xD;
