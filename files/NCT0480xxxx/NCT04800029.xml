      The study will rigorously evaluate whether synchronous, within-visit telemental health&#xD;
      evaluation and intervention services can successfully overcome poor access to behavioral&#xD;
      health and substandard suicide-related care in emergency departments (EDs), including&#xD;
      evaluating the impact on system metrics, a primary goal of RFA-MH-20-226. Notably, the study&#xD;
      will surpass this primary requirement, because it will extend understanding of the relative&#xD;
      added value of the ED-SAFE post-visit telephone intervention and will create knowledge about&#xD;
      key factors related to implementation and sustainment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is one of the most pressing public health problems facing the United States (US),&#xD;
      ranking as the 10th leading cause of death, with incidence rates increasing year after year&#xD;
      in the recent past. The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention (NAASP) has&#xD;
      prioritized suicide prevention efforts in emergency departments (EDs) because of their&#xD;
      well-established safety-net role in treating patients with suicide risk. However, there are&#xD;
      serious problems with accessing timely, high-quality behavioral healthcare in many EDs,&#xD;
      leading to unnecessary psychiatric hospitalizations, long waiting times, and substandard&#xD;
      suicide-related care. As suggested by RFA-MH-20-226, telemental health service delivery has&#xD;
      promise for not only improving timely access to behavioral health specialists, it also holds&#xD;
      promise for improving adherence to best practice suicide prevention standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate whether telehealth can improve behavioral health specialist access&#xD;
      and suicide-related care quality using a Type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial,&#xD;
      titled Telehealth to Improve Prevention of Suicide (TIPS) in EDs. The study will involve ED&#xD;
      patients with suicide risk from two Intervention EDs that do not currently have on-site&#xD;
      behavioral health specialists and two Non-intervention control EDs. The study design will&#xD;
      blend a three-phase interrupted time series design with a nested individual level randomized&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness trial. Phase 1, Treatment as Usual (TAU), will comprise a&#xD;
      historical control for the four EDs. It will use data spanning three years (October 2017 to&#xD;
      September 2020) and will include all patients who screened positive on a universally&#xD;
      administered, evidence-based screener, or who received a mental health evaluation in the&#xD;
      participating EDs, which will allow the study team to establish a stable, representative&#xD;
      control sample. Phase 2, Intervention, will involve implementing the TIPS telehealth protocol&#xD;
      into routine clinical care for 24 months within the two Intervention EDs. Masters-level&#xD;
      behavioral health specialists from an existing mental health center will perform a behavioral&#xD;
      health evaluation using synchronous, two-way televideo software and hardware. In addition,&#xD;
      for patients with a preliminary decision to be hospitalized, a telepsychiatrist will be&#xD;
      consulted, with the goal of reducing hospitalization for those who can be adequately managed&#xD;
      in a lower level of care. When needed, the telepsychiatrist will also complete his or her own&#xD;
      televideo evaluation of the patient and collaterals. In addition to expanded behavioral&#xD;
      health specialist access, the study team will improve the quality of suicide-related care.&#xD;
      The study team will not only provide enhanced training for behavioral health specialists on&#xD;
      best practice suicide risk assessment, safety planning, and care transition strategies, the&#xD;
      study team will leverage fidelity review of recorded televideo evaluations and provide&#xD;
      personalized feedback to improve adherence to performance standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, during Phase 2, a 50% subset of patients who received the TIPS evaluation during&#xD;
      their visit and who are discharged from the ED will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      evidence-based Emergency Department Safety Assessment and Follow-up Evaluation (ED-SAFE)&#xD;
      protocol after the visit (TIPS+EDSAFE). This will allow the Investigators to evaluate the&#xD;
      added value of contact after the visit to further decrease suicidal behavior compared to the&#xD;
      within-visit components alone (i.e., comparative effectiveness). Phase 3, Sustainment, will&#xD;
      be the final phase during which the study team will remove grant financial subsidies for&#xD;
      clinical services to definitively ascertain self-sustainability of the interventions. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect the same system metrics and clinician behaviors on two&#xD;
      Non-intervention EDs across the same time periods. These EDs will not implement the study&#xD;
      interventions, and their data will help control for confounders, like macro-system or secular&#xD;
      trends.&#xD;
