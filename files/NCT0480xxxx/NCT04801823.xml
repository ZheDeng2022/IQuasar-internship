  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early and regular ingestion of the common allergens, peanut and egg has been shown to be an&#xD;
      effective allergy prevention strategy. It is not clear whether this is also true of tree nut&#xD;
      allergy. Current practice in many Australian allergy clinics for children with peanut allergy&#xD;
      (high risk of tree nut allergy), is to advise families to introduce each individual tree nut&#xD;
      into their child's diet via a cautious home introduction protocol without prior allergy&#xD;
      testing (screening). The safety and effectiveness of an early and regular ingestion strategy&#xD;
      for the prevention of tree nut allergy has not been formally evaluated and it is known that&#xD;
      around a third of children with peanut allergy develop one or more other nut allergies. This&#xD;
      trial is a 2-armed, open-label, randomized, controlled trial (RCT) to assess the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of a supervised hospital based multi-tree nut (almond, cashew, hazelnut and walnut)&#xD;
      oral food challenge (OFC) + then home introduction of the remaining tree nuts versus standard&#xD;
      care (home introduction of all 8 tree nuts) in infants with peanut allergy to reduce the risk&#xD;
      of developing tree nut allergy.&#xD;

    <description>The Food Allergy Quality of Life Questionnaires (FAQLQ) are disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL) questionnaires for patients with food allergy. FAQLQ-PF (Parent Form), completed by parents of children aged 0-12 years consists of 30 items over 3 domains (emotional impact, food anxiety, social and dietary restrictions). Total and domain scores are calculated by dividing the sum of completed items by the number of completed items. Questions are based on a 6 point Likert scale with higher scores indicating greater impact on quality of life</description>

    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) is a psychological inventory based on a 4-point Likert scale and consists of 40 questions on a self-report basis. The STAI measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event, and trait anxiety, or anxiety level as a personal characteristic. The total score ranges from 0-63 with higher scores positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.</description>
