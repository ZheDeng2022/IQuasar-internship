    <textblock>
      The main objectives of FEIRI are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) To describe the demographic and arterial characteristics of FMD and related diseases at a&#xD;
      global scale and according to countries and/or ethnic origin&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) To evaluate the incidence and predictors of novel FMD lesions and complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iii) To explore the commonalities and differences between FMD, SCAD and so-called atypical&#xD;
      FMD (patients with multiple dissections and/or aneurysms without string-of-beads, focal&#xD;
      stenosis or evidence of inherited arteriopathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (iv) To contribute to the unravelling of genetic, proteomic and molecular mechanisms&#xD;
      underlying FMD and related diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation to the FEIRI study implies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Collection of demographic and standard-of-care clinical data, both retrospectively (from&#xD;
      the diagnosis of FMD to signature of the informed consent) and prospectively (on the occasion&#xD;
      of standard-of-care follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) Optional participation to a biobank implying collection of blood, urine and, in rare&#xD;
      cases of intervention, tissue samples for genomic and proteomic analysis and identification&#xD;
      of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in centres from over 20 countries in Europe and beyond.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is an idiopathic, segmental, nonatherosclerotic, and&#xD;
      noninflammatory disease of the musculature of arterial walls, leading to stenosis of small-&#xD;
      and medium-sized arteries. FMD can be classified in multifocal FMD, characterized by&#xD;
      alternation of stenosis and dilations (&quot;string-of-beads&quot;) and focal FMD, corresponding to a&#xD;
      solitary narrowing. While for long FMD was considered as a rare cause of renovascular disease&#xD;
      mostly affecting young women, during the last decades, joint international efforts have led&#xD;
      to a thorough reappraisal of the disease. In summary, (i) FMD is no more considered as a&#xD;
      truly rare disease; (ii) FMD may be also diagnosed in men (10-20%) and at all ages; (iii)&#xD;
      beyond arterial stenosis, FMD is often associated with dissections, aneurysms and arterial&#xD;
      tortuosity; (iv) FMD is not restricted to renal arteries and often affects two or more&#xD;
      arterial beds; (iv) multifocal FMD lesions are frequent in patients with Spontaneous Coronary&#xD;
      Artery Dissection (SCAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite traditional views on the role of female hormones, mechanical factors and smoking, the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of FMD remains largely unknown. In the last decade, research has been focused&#xD;
      on genetic dissection of the disease and identification of biomarkers. Recent advances&#xD;
      include: (i) identification of an association between FMD and an intronic variant of the&#xD;
      Phosphatase and actin regulator 1 (PHACTR1) gene; (ii) identification of rare mutations in&#xD;
      several genes such as Prostaglandin I2 Receptor (PTGIR) and Collagen type V alpha 1 chain&#xD;
      (COL5A1) genes; (iii) documentation of mild Connective-Tissue Disease-like features and&#xD;
      increased levels of Transforming Growth Factor-beta in patients with FMD; (iv) identification&#xD;
      of a tentative proteo-genomic signature of the disease. All elements are thus in place to&#xD;
      further dissect the pathophysiology of FMD and related diseases, refine clinical&#xD;
      characterization, identify predictors of complications and improve screening, management and&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unravelling the clinical characteristics, genetic and molecular basis of FMD nevertheless&#xD;
      requires large numbers of well characterized patients. In order to address these challenges&#xD;
      and generate new evidence pertaining to FMD and associated diseases, we aimed to create an&#xD;
      overarching resource and study named &quot;the European/International FMD Registry and Initiative&quot;&#xD;
      (acronym: FEIRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of FEIRI are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the demographic and arterial characteristics of FMD and related diseases at a&#xD;
      global scale and according to countries and/or ethnic origin&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify environmental/ hormonal factors and exposures associated with the onset and&#xD;
      progression of FMD&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the incidence and predictors of novel FMD lesions and complications&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide evidence-based algorithms for the diagnosis and optimal management and follow-up&#xD;
      of patients with FMD&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the commonalities and differences between FMD, SCAD and so-called atypical FMD&#xD;
      (patients with multiple dissections and/or aneurysms without string-of-beads, focal stenosis&#xD;
      or evidence of inherited arteriopathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To contribute to the unravelling of genetic, proteomic and molecular mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      FMD and related diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation to the FEIRI study implies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of demographic and standard-of-care clinical data, both retrospectively (from the&#xD;
      diagnosis of FMD to signature of the informed consent) and prospectively (on the occasion of&#xD;
      standard-of-care follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional participation (both for centres and patients) to a biobank implying collection of&#xD;
      blood, urine and, in rare cases of intervention, tissue samples for genomic and proteomic&#xD;
      analysis and identification of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers of FMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in centres from over 20 countries in Europe and beyond.&#xD;
