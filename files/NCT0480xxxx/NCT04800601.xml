  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, interventional, experimental, prospective, controlled and&#xD;
      randomized study. We propose a reeducation protocol based on an early over-solicitation of&#xD;
      the ankle dorsiflexor muscles to promote their &quot;awakening&quot;, limit the loss of strength&#xD;
      associated with the functional loss and thus allow to reach a more effective walking&#xD;
      activity. This should encourage social participation following discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the impact of this 6 weeks program on walking speed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to HAS, stroke is the leading cause of disability acquired in France. If 90% of&#xD;
      patients recover walking, it is often limited with a steady speed around 0.7m/s. This&#xD;
      limitation of walking activity is partly related to a decrease in strength associated with&#xD;
      more or less significant spasticity. In stroke, this decrease in strength is the result of&#xD;
      central impairment. Rehabilitation therefore involves gestural repetition. Mentiplay's review&#xD;
      (Mentiplay et al., 2015) showing the predominance of ankle muscle strength in walking&#xD;
      activity, we propose a protocol based on repetitive mobilization of this joint during&#xD;
      subacute phase to promote awakening control, to limit the loss of muscle strength and thus&#xD;
      potentiate the recovery of a more efficient walking. The strength of this study would be to&#xD;
      verify the effectiveness of such a program in a large number of patients (5 centers&#xD;
      involved). Its originality is to measure the impact of this program on social participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited in 5 centers during their hospitalization, in sub-acute phase.&#xD;
      Two groups will be formed: a control group in conventional rehabilitation; an experimental&#xD;
      group that will perform 5x/week 300 movements of plantarflexion, dorsiflexion on isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer (in passive mode, with the intention of producing the greatest possible force).&#xD;
      This protocol will take place over 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits will take place at the end of the 6th week (which corresponds to the end of&#xD;
      the ankle rehabilitation protocol), 6 months and one year after the beginning of the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These visits will include a clinical examination, a GaitRite carpet walking test, an&#xD;
      isokinetic evaluation of the ankle dorsiflexor muscles strength and a SIPSO self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire (social participation) at 6 months and one year.&#xD;
