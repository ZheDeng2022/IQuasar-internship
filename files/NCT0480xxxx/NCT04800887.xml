      To compare visual outcomes for various distances, reading speed, contrast sensitivity, glare&#xD;
      occurence, defocus curve and subjective satisfaction in patients implanted with the extended&#xD;
      depth of focus lens (Tecnis Eyhance) in one eye and monocal aspheric lens (Tecnis ZCB00) in&#xD;
      second eye. Patients undergo visit in 3,6 and 12 months after the surgery.&#xD;

      The goal of refractive cataract surgery is to remove the opacity, or cataract and to produce&#xD;
      the desired refractive outcome. In most cases, the desired outcome is an emmetropic eye, or&#xD;
      an eye that sees 20/20 Snellen for distance vision post-surgery with the implant of a&#xD;
      monofocal IOL. This, however, does not offer much in the way of intermediate and near vision.&#xD;
      The increased desire for simultaneous distance, intermediate and near vision has increased&#xD;
      the popularity of multifocal IOLs (MIOLs). However MIOLs provide visual acuity for all&#xD;
      distances, they has occurence of optical phenomena such as glare and halo and lower contrast&#xD;
      sensitivity. Extended depth of focus (EDOF) lens should provide distance vision as good as&#xD;
      monofocal lens and intermediate vision better than monofocal but without any optical&#xD;
      phenomenon or decreased contrast sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted from 11/2019 to 08/2021 in the Ophthalmology department of Faculty&#xD;
      Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady in Prague. The research protocol was explained to all&#xD;
      participants and informed consent was signed before enrolling patient to the study. The study&#xD;
      was approved by the Ethics Committee of Faculty Hospital Kralovske Vinohrady and will&#xD;
      enrolled up to 25 patients with presence of cataract in both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral clear corneal phacoemulsification and IOL implantation is performed by one surgeon&#xD;
      using the same technique in both eyes. The surgical process involved topical anesthesia,&#xD;
      superior 3-step clear corneal incision (2,2mm), 5,0mm curvilinear capsulorhexis,&#xD;
      phacoemulsification, bilateral irrigation- aspiration and IOL implantation. One eye is&#xD;
      implanted with EDOF IOL second eye with monofocal IOL. Type of IOL is chosen randomly and&#xD;
      double masked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are scheduled for visit at 3,6 and 12 months after the surgery.&#xD;
