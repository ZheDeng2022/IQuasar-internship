  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LIA is the mainstay of postoperative analgesia in patients having knee arthroplasty. The&#xD;
      combination of ACB-iPACK blocks has also been proposed as an effective analgesic modality for&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty. However, whether combining these two modalities yields any important&#xD;
      incremental analgesic benefit remains unclear. The investigators hypothesized that the&#xD;
      addition of ACB and iPACK blocks to LIA will yield clinically important analgesic benefits&#xD;
      compared to LIA alone in patients having total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LIA is the mainstay of postoperative analgesia in patients having knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
      Performed by surgeons, LIA provides effective postoperative pain relief and reduces opioid&#xD;
      requirements. Similar analgesic benefits have also been attributed to adductor canal and&#xD;
      iPACK blocks, which partially block sensory innervation to the knee and its posterior&#xD;
      capsule. Performed by anesthesiologist preoperatively, these blocks have also been&#xD;
      incorporated into the care standard in numerous centers. However, it is not clear whether&#xD;
      adding the adductor canal and iPACK blocks yields any incremental analgesic benefits. The&#xD;
      investigators aimed to evaluate the benefits of adding adductor canal and iPACK blocks to LIA&#xD;
      in patients having total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;
