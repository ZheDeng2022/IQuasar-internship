  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium is an acute state of confusion, which is characterized by changes in&#xD;
      attention and cognitive functions and fluctuations in consciousness; postoperative cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction is a common central nervous system complication in elderly patients after&#xD;
      surgery, often manifested as memory, Obstacles in abstract thinking and orientation are&#xD;
      accompanied by a decline in social activity ability. Postoperative delirium and cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction can prolong hospital stay, increase medical expenses, affect postoperative&#xD;
      functional recovery, and even increase postoperative mortality. Sleep disorders are a group&#xD;
      of diseases that affect the ability to sleep well regularly and cause severe impairment of&#xD;
      social and occupational functions. Stellate ganglion block is a selective sympathetic&#xD;
      ganglion block, in which a local anesthetic is injected into the loose connective tissue of&#xD;
      the neck including the stellate ganglion. There are complex connections between stellate&#xD;
      ganglia and multiple brain regions in the brain, which can improve postoperative delirium,&#xD;
      cognitive function and sleep disturbance to a certain extent, and have certain guiding&#xD;
      significance for postoperative rehabilitation of elderly patients.&#xD;
