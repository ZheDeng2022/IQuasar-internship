      Objective: To determine in real life the efficacy, safety and tolerability of galcanezumab in&#xD;
      the prevention of high-frequency episodic migraine (HFEM) and chronic (CM) migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted between November 2019 and&#xD;
      January 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Consecutive adult HFEM and CM patients clinically prescribed galcanezumab were&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Multicenter study in 13 Italian headache centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure: Galcanezumab subcutaneous injection 120 mg monthly with the first loading dose of&#xD;
      240 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): The primary end-point was the change in monthly migraine days&#xD;
      (MMDs) in HFEM patients and monthly headache days (MHDs) in CM ones after six months of&#xD;
      therapy (V6) compared to baseline. Secondary end-points included variation in Numerical&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS), monthly painkiller intake (MPI), HIT-6, and MIDAS scores. We assessed&#xD;
      50%, 75%, and 100% responder rates (RR), the conversion rate from CM to episodic migraine&#xD;
      (EM), and the Medication Overuse condition to the non-overuser.&#xD;

      GARLIT is an independent, multicenter, prospective, cohort, real-life study. All consecutive&#xD;
      patients aged 18 or older with a diagnosis of HFEM (8-14 migraine days per month) or CM (1.3&#xD;
      ICHD-3), who had failed at least three migraine preventive treatments and not previously&#xD;
      involved in any CGRP mAbs trial, are considered for enrolment. Patients are assessed at&#xD;
      baseline by a headache expert neurologist with a face-to-face interview using a&#xD;
      semi-structured questionnaire addressing socio-demographic factors, clinical migraine&#xD;
      features, previous and current acute and preventive migraine treatments, comorbidities and&#xD;
      concomitant medications. Headache-related dopaminergic and autonomic symptoms, temporal&#xD;
      artery turgidity/hyperpulsatility, and allodynia during or between attacks are also&#xD;
      investigated. Patients are also requested to rate the overall efficacy of triptans in most&#xD;
      attacks as none/poor (0) or fair/excellent (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will carefully fill in a headache diary during a run-in month period&#xD;
      (baseline) and the entire duration of the study, to report monthly migraine days (MMDs) for&#xD;
      HFEM patients, all monthly headache days (MHDs) of at least moderate intensity for CM&#xD;
      subjects, and monthly painkillers intake (MPI). Patients were also asked to rate pain&#xD;
      severity (using the 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale, NRS) of the worst painful attack and fill in&#xD;
      migraine disability questionnaires (Headache Impact Test, HIT-623, monthly, and the MIgraine&#xD;
      Disability Assessing Scale24, MIDAS, quarterly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with galcanezumab subcutaneous injection with the first loading dose&#xD;
      of 240mg and then every month with 120mg as recommended, according to real life clinical&#xD;
      indication (www.europa.ema.eu).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-reported variables and any adverse event (AE) are recorded at baseline and monthly&#xD;
      at every in-office visits. Telephone/email contacts are allowed when in-office visits are not&#xD;
      possible. All AEs are reported to Eudravigilance and classified as gastrointestinal (e.g.&#xD;
      nausea, constipation), cutaneous (e.g. injection-site reactions: rash/erythema, pruritus,&#xD;
      urticaria, oedema/induration), arthralgia, Raynaud phenomenon, dizziness and other (&lt;1% of&#xD;
      patients: i.e. somnolence, alopecia, anxiety).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will provide written informed consent.&#xD;
