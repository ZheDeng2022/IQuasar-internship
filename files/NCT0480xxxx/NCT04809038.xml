  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical neck pain is a prevalent condition in various populations. Neck pain occurrence is&#xD;
      affected by several factors, involving environmental, psychological, and social aspects. Neck&#xD;
      pain represents the fourth major disorder responsible for a person's year lived with&#xD;
      disability and ranked eleventh as disability-adjusted life years of a person. The neck pain&#xD;
      incidence ranges from 10.4 to 23.3% in 1-year time, while the range of prevalence was 0.4 to&#xD;
      86.8%. It has a high prevalence among computer users, office workers, and females, especially&#xD;
      females aged 35 to 49 years old. Myofascial trigger point (MTrP) might play an important role&#xD;
      in the formation of mechanical neck pain and is known as a hyperirritable spot in skeletal&#xD;
      muscle that is accompanied with a hypersensitive palpable nodule in a taut band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      dry needling and iontophoresis play a major role in the treatment of mechanical neck pain so&#xD;
      this trial was conducted to determine which one has superiority. this trial has three groups.&#xD;
      two experimental and one control group.pain, function, pressure pain threshold and emg will&#xD;
      be measured&#xD;

    <description>Patient will be placed in a comfortable prone position and encouraged to maintain complete relaxation. The selected active MTrPs was prepared by wiping the area with alcohol pad, and a gauge needle with its plastic guide tube in place will be palced over the active MTrPs .a tapping motion will be used to advance the needle to a depth of 5 to 10 mm for 30 seconds</description>

    <description>The subjects in the iontophoresis group received MgSO4 iontophoresis using an iontophoretic drug delivery system (Phoresor_IIAuto,ModelPM850,IOMED. MTrPs were examined using pincer palpation and marked by pin. MgSO4 was applied to the active positive electrode using a syringe with a concentration of 100 mg/cm2. The active electrode was placed directly over the marked area where the sensitive MTrPs were located. The dispersive electrode was applied to the skin 6 inches distal from the active electrode.</description>

    <description>The patient will be placed in a comfortable and relaxed sitting position with his back supported ; one hand was placed on the side of the head applying the stretching force, while the other hand was placed on the patients shoulder applying shoulder stablization . The direction of stretched force was in flexion , side bending to the opposite side and rotation to the same side . The stretched position will be sustained for 30 seconds , then a relaxation period of 30 seconds . This procedure was repeated 3 times .</description>
