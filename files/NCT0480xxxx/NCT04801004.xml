  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, real world, observational study, which aims at&#xD;
      evaluating the safety, efficacy and economic cost of endovascular treatments for endovascular&#xD;
      therapies in tosaka III (totally occluded) in-stent restenosis.It is estimated that 300&#xD;
      subjects diagnosed with tosaka III in-stent restenosis and receive endovascular treatments&#xD;
      will be enrolled in nine centers from March 2021 to December 2022 nation-widely. All the&#xD;
      subjects will be under follow-up for 24 months. There is no restriction on the endovascular&#xD;
      techniques. The primary outcomes include the rate of primary patency and freedom from TLR at&#xD;
      3,6,12,24 months.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In-stent restenosis was a series of complications of treatment in peripheral artery disease,&#xD;
      which lead the fluid of lower extremity re-limited even chronic limb ischemia and amputation.&#xD;
      Its typical symptoms were recurrent claudication, rest pain and ischemic. Tosaka III in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis, which also called in-stent occlusion was one of the most serious of this kind of&#xD;
      complications. Its symptoms usually more severe and irreversible, and its treatments were&#xD;
      complicated and challenging. The efficacy of single balloon angioplasty is limited. New&#xD;
      devices including drug-coated balloon, intravascular Lithotripsy, directional atherectomy,&#xD;
      laser debulking devices and stent-grafts offer another chance and better prognosis. The data&#xD;
      of these new devices, however, are mainly from low-quality evidence. Therefore, we start this&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter, real-world, observational study, providing new data on the safety,&#xD;
      efficacy and health economics evaluation of endovascular treatments for Tosaka III in-stent&#xD;
      restenosis.&#xD;

    <description>The VascuQol was designed as a questionnaire containing five domains: pain (4 items), symptoms (4 items), activities (8 items), social (2 items), and emotional (7 items) to evaluate Health related quality of life (HRQL). Every item has seven response options, with scores ranging from 1 to 7. A total score is the sum of all 25 item scores divided by 25.And both the total score as well as the domain scores range from 1 (worst HRQL) to 7 (best HRQL).The lower the value, the poorer the quality of life.</description>
