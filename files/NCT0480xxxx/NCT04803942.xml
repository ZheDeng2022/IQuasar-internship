  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a syndrome involving infection and an abnormal systemic inflammatory response in&#xD;
      the infected organism, resulting in organ dysfunction and possibly death. It is a major cause&#xD;
      of hospital mortality. A large proportion of sepsis diagnoses are made in emergency&#xD;
      departments. Early diagnosis and appropriate treatment have been shown to reduce mortality&#xD;
      from this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a context of limited resources, it is therefore important to be able to quickly stratify&#xD;
      patients presenting to the emergency department with a suspected infection into those who&#xD;
      require rapid and intensive management because they are at risk of developing sepsis and&#xD;
      septic shock and those who can be managed conventionally The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the clinical intuition of emergency room physicians and nurses with the qSOFA score&#xD;
      to predict the clinical course of patients presenting to the emergency room with potential&#xD;
      sepsis.&#xD;
