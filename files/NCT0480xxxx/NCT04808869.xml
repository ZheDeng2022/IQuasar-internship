  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood flow restriction (BFR) training has become a popular alternate rehabilitation modality,&#xD;
      intending to improve muscle strength, hypertrophy, metabolic response, and functional&#xD;
      outcomes in diverse populations. However, there is a paucity of research evidence on the&#xD;
      effectiveness of using BFR during aerobic exercise. Most BFR interventions have used BFR&#xD;
      cuffs in two to four limbs, however, it is unknown if using BFR cuffs in a single limb&#xD;
      instead of multiple limbs can produce the desired outcomes in muscle physiology and muscular&#xD;
      adaptations. Therefore, we have divided the purpose of this study into the following three&#xD;
      aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare physical performance measures of balance, isokinetic muscle strength, knee stability,&#xD;
      and aerobic capacity between cycling exercise with and without BFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare physical performance measures between performing cycling exercise at 60% versus 80%&#xD;
      blood flow occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare physical performance measures between bilateral BFR versus single-leg BFR during a&#xD;
      cycling protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will be accomplished by randomizing 55 participants into five groups of eleven&#xD;
      participants each: 1) control; 2) bilateral BFR cuffs with 60% occlusion; 3) bilateral BFR&#xD;
      cuffs with 80% occlusion; 4) single-limb BFR with 60% occlusion; and 5) single-limb BFR with&#xD;
      80% occlusion. All participants will undergo balance, isokinetic knee strength, knee&#xD;
      stability, and aerobic testing at baseline, 3-week, and 6-week follow-ups. The intervention&#xD;
      for all groups will consist of 15 minutes cycling on a stationary ergometer at 70&#xD;
      revolutions/minute. A within- and between-group (5) by time (3) repeated measures analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be used to explore differences between group and time in addition to&#xD;
      the interaction between these two.&#xD;

      Experimental Design &amp; Sample Size: This study is a randomized controlled trial with five&#xD;
      groups of 11 participants each (N=55). Sample size was estimated with GPower using a 5-group&#xD;
      within- and between-groups repeated measures design with three follow-up visits (0, 3, 6&#xD;
      weeks) yielding a power greater than 80% including 10% in attrition or missing data.&#xD;
      Population: Healthy adults between the ages of 21-35 will be recruited. Recruitment will be&#xD;
      as close to an equal amount of women and men as possible for all groups as the participation&#xD;
      of women in intervention studies assessing the effectiveness of BFR training has been&#xD;
      documented to be no more than 17%. Other criteria for participation in the study will be&#xD;
      committing to the training and testing sessions, being in good health, and familiarization&#xD;
      with physical activity and exercise, including riding a stationary bicycle. Participants will&#xD;
      be excluded if they have any of the following: 1) suffered a musculoskeletal injury in the&#xD;
      lower extremities or lower back in the past three months, 2) any contraindication to aerobic&#xD;
      exercise testing as determined by The American College of Sports Medicine [12], 3) any&#xD;
      contraindication to blood flow restriction training, 4) meeting or exceeding the recommended&#xD;
      ACSM exercise guidelines of aerobic exercise 5-times/week for &gt;20 minutes and strengthening&#xD;
      exercise &gt; 2-days/week [12], and 5) pregnancy for female participants (self-reported). Each&#xD;
      participant will be required to read and sign an informed consent document approved by the&#xD;
      Institutional Review Board before enrolling in the study and any testing being performed. The&#xD;
      55 participants in the five groups of 11 participants will be randomized by using a random&#xD;
      number generator. The five groups will be randomized as follows: 1) control (Con), 2) 60%&#xD;
      bilateral occlusion BFR (60BILAT), 3) 80% bilateral occlusion BFR (80BILAT), 60% unilateral&#xD;
      BFR occlusion (60UNIT), and 80% unilateral BFR occlusion (80UNIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instrumentation &amp; Outcomes: Single leg balance will be measured using a Balance System SD&#xD;
      (Biodex Medical Systems, Inc, Shirley, NY). This device measures static and dynamic&#xD;
      multidirectional balance by the use of the validated Balance Error Scoring System (BESS) by&#xD;
      measuring sway with eyes closed in the following conditions: 1) double-leg firm surface, 2)&#xD;
      single-leg firm surface, 3) tandem stance firm surface, and 4) repeating the previous tests&#xD;
      on a foam (unstable) surface. Balance and postural stability are fundamental components of&#xD;
      athletic performance and activities of daily living making its assessment imperative to&#xD;
      measure changes during different conditions such as injury, fatigue, concussions, etc.&#xD;
      Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that BFR training improves balance in functional&#xD;
      activities, but the only evidence is in the population of older adults. Knee stability will&#xD;
      be measured during a 5-repetition single-leg step down from a 30-cm step platform with a&#xD;
      10-camera (120Hz sampling rate) motion analysis capture system (Qualisys AB, Göteborg,&#xD;
      Sweden) time-synchronized to a wireless electromyography (EMG) system (Trigno, Delsys, Inc.,&#xD;
      Natick, MA). EMG data will be collected through three pre-amplified (Ag) electrodes (Trigno,&#xD;
      Delsys Inc., Natick, MA; Bandwidth: 450 ± 50 Hz &gt; 80 dB/dec; overall channel noise: &lt;0.75uV)&#xD;
      bilaterally from the vastus medialis, rectus femoris, and vastus lateralis at 2kHz and&#xD;
      filtered through a 2nd order Butterworth filter. Knee stability is an essential outcome in&#xD;
      rehabilitation as it is the foundation for proper alignment to prevent injuries [14], while&#xD;
      muscle activation is one of the main constraints to knee instability, helping to prevent&#xD;
      injuries. Given there is evidence showing BFR training increases muscle recruitment and&#xD;
      muscular activation by the use of EMG it is imperative to determine if such improvements&#xD;
      translate into better motor control and knee stability during functional activities. Muscle&#xD;
      strength of the quadriceps and hamstrings will be measured with an isokinetic dynamometer&#xD;
      (System 4 Pro, Biodex Medical Systems, Inc, Shirley, NY) at the speeds of 60˚ and 180˚&#xD;
      degrees per second. The dynamometer will be calibrated according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      recommendations. Several investigations have found improvements in isokinetic strength after&#xD;
      BFR training. Therefore, assessment of muscle strength via isokinetic dynamometer will allow&#xD;
      to make comparisons between the study and the current literature. Aerobic Capacity will be&#xD;
      measured during a cycle ergometer protocol in a stationary ergometer (Velotron, Quarq&#xD;
      Technology, Spearfish, SD) while connected to a gas analyzer (TruOne 2400, Parvomedics, Salt&#xD;
      Lake City, UT) for the assessment of oxygen consumption [VO2 (ml/min)]. This is an&#xD;
      exploratory outcome as aerobic exercise in a cycle exercise for 15 minutes is not expected to&#xD;
      improve cardiovascular metabolic performance. However, Abe et al 2010 reported improvements&#xD;
      in VO2max with a similar protocol to this study of 15 minutes of cycling with BFR cuffs.&#xD;
      Thus, by evaluating VO2, the study will be able to determine if there is any benefit of BFR&#xD;
      training during aerobic exercise and compare our results to the small cycling evidence with&#xD;
      BFR cuffs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: After consenting to participation, demographic and anthropometric information&#xD;
      will be recorded. After measurements, participants will be equipped with retroreflective&#xD;
      markers per Qualisys CAST model, using appropriate hypoallergenic double-side retroreflective&#xD;
      markers for individual markers and elastic bandages with Velcro for retroreflective casts.&#xD;
      EMG electrode placement will follow a standardized setup previously published by Ortiz et al.&#xD;
      To minimize the effects of fatigue in task performance, the order of testing will remain&#xD;
      constant in the following order: 1) BESS, 2) single-leg step down, 3) isokinetic testing, and&#xD;
      4) aerobic capacity. For the BESS, the order of the testing will be according to the protocol&#xD;
      displayed on the platform's computer screen. Participants will perform all tests with eyes&#xD;
      closed for 20 seconds with 10-seconds rest between conditions. Each participant will first&#xD;
      perform the three stable conditions (double-leg, single-leg, tandem) followed by the same&#xD;
      conditions after placing a 6cm thick foam pad over the balance platform. A special note for&#xD;
      those participants in the single-leg BFR group will be written, denoting which leg was used&#xD;
      for the BFR cuffs. The single-leg step-down will be performed from a 30-cm step for three&#xD;
      5-steps repetitions per leg, alternating legs. Each participant will stand initially on the&#xD;
      step with both feet on the step. Upon the command &quot;go,&quot; they will lift the corresponding leg&#xD;
      and step down touching the floor (force plate) with the non-weight-bearing leg and will&#xD;
      return to the original stance position. This process will be performed continuously five&#xD;
      consecutive times. Valgus motion will be tracked with the 3-dimensional motion system and EMG&#xD;
      through the entirety of the five single-leg stance time epochs. Valgus will be measured at&#xD;
      the point where the participant touches the force plate. The highest valgus and EMG amplitude&#xD;
      (RMS) of the three middle trials will be considered for analysis. A special note for those&#xD;
      participants in the single-leg BFR group will be written, denoting which leg was used for the&#xD;
      BFR cuffs. For the fatigue analyses, the average of the five trials for motion analysis and&#xD;
      the entire frequency of the EMG signal will be considered for analysis. Muscle strength&#xD;
      assessment of the quadriceps and hamstrings will follow the step-down assessment. Each&#xD;
      participant will be seated in the dynamometer based on standardized positions. The right leg&#xD;
      will be tested first, followed by the left one. For those participants in the single-leg BFR&#xD;
      group, a special note will be written denoting which leg was used for the BFR cuffs. The&#xD;
      standardized protocol set by the dynamometer computer will be followed with 60˚ and 180˚ per&#xD;
      second. A familiarization warm-up of three to five repetitions at each speed will be&#xD;
      performed previous to the testing at each speed, followed by a minute of rest. A total of&#xD;
      five contractions will be performed at 60˚/second and 10 repetitions at 180˚/second. Aerobic&#xD;
      capacity will be assessed through a standardized maximal cycle ergometer protocol. VO2 max,&#xD;
      VO2 peak, and heart rate will be measured directly from the metabolic analyzer during this&#xD;
      protocol. After a 10-minute rest to obtain resting heart rate, participants will start&#xD;
      pedaling at 70 rev/min with a load of 25 Watts. Heart rate (HR) will be monitored&#xD;
      continuously in real-time and the heart rate at the end of the first three minutes will be&#xD;
      used to determine further load increases. The test will continue until the participant&#xD;
      reaches one or more of the following criteria: reaches 80% of their predicted heart rate by&#xD;
      using the heart rate reserve formula; (([220-age] -resting heart rate) x 80%) + resting heart&#xD;
      rate, reaches an RER &gt;1.0, or there is a leveling of the oxygen curve. Intervention: Control&#xD;
      group: the control group will perform 15 minutes of cycling in a stationary cycle ergometer&#xD;
      at 70 rev/min three times a week for six weeks. Subjects will wear a polar heart rate monitor&#xD;
      through the training to record their heart rate response during the 15 minutes of training.&#xD;
      BFR groups: all four BFR groups will perform the same training as the control group while&#xD;
      using the BFR cuffs. This training program follows the recommendations for stationary cycling&#xD;
      while wearing BFR cuffs of 45-60 minutes per week. Each participant in the BFR group will&#xD;
      undergo the protocol defined by Delfi (Delfi Medical Innovations, Inc., Vancouver BC,&#xD;
      Canada), consisting of placing the BFR cuff in the upper part of the thigh while the&#xD;
      participant is lying supine on a table against gravity to determine full occlusion then to&#xD;
      derived the percentage of desired occlusion (60% or 80%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Data will be screened for normality, homoscedasticity, and outliers.&#xD;
      Independent t-tests will be performed to compared demographic (age, weight, height, BMI)&#xD;
      variables between groups. A within- and between-group (5) by time (3) repeated measure ANOVA&#xD;
      with interactions will be used to compare groups for all outcomes of interest. Post-hoc&#xD;
      analyses will be used to follow up significant differences between groups, time, and the&#xD;
      group by time interaction.&#xD;
