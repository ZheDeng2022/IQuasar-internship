  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lactation cookies contain ingredients thought to increase breast milk production. Although&#xD;
      these cookies are widely purchased and consumed with the intention to increase breast milk&#xD;
      supply, no scientific investigation has explored the effects of lactation cookies on human&#xD;
      breast milk production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effects of a lactation cookie in breast milk production,&#xD;
      relative to cookies without ingredients thought to increase breast milk production in&#xD;
      exclusively breastfeeding mothers of healthy, term babies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Caring for an infant is demanding, and breastfeeding can become a stressful experience,&#xD;
      particularly if mothers are concerned about their breast milk supply or whether their milk is&#xD;
      nutritious enough to meet their infant's nutritional needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the US, research suggests that about 60% of women perceive their breast milk as&#xD;
      insufficient to meet their infant's nutritional needs. As a consequence, about one-fourth of&#xD;
      women that perceive insufficient milk production wean their infants prematurely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactation cookies contain ingredients thought to increase breast milk production and are&#xD;
      widely consumed for this purpose. However, there is no research that has explored the effects&#xD;
      of lactation cookies on breast milk supply. To answer this, the investigators plan a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial involving 176 exclusively breastfeeding mothers of 2-month-old&#xD;
      infants. Participants will be randomized into &quot;lactation cookies&quot; or &quot;control cookies&quot;&#xD;
      (cookies without ingredients thought to increase breast milk production&quot; and will be asked to&#xD;
      eat a bag (2 OZ) of cookies per day for 1 month.&#xD;
