  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study investigators aimed to investigate whether homeodomain interacting&#xD;
      protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) polymorphism is associated with renal stone formation in Turkish&#xD;
      population or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and twenty nine participants with calcium nephrolithiasis and 67 sex and&#xD;
      age-matched healthy controls were enrolled in this study. For analysis of HIPK2 polymorphism,&#xD;
      the real-time PCR amplification was performed in a final volume of 20μL reaction mixture,&#xD;
      including 10 ng of genomic DNA, 5 µL of TaqMan® Universal PCR Master Mix, and 0.5 µL of 40X&#xD;
      TaqMan® assay. The Rotor-Gene Q Series Software Version Q 2.3.1 (Rotor-Gene Q Series, Ziagen)&#xD;
      was used for allelic discrimination. Chi square test was utilized to compare the differences&#xD;
      of the genotype and allele frequencies between patients and controls.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Kidney stone incidence depends on geographical, climatic, ethnic, dietary and genetic&#xD;
      factors. Thus the prevalence rates for urinary stones change from 1% to 20%. 1,2 Genetic&#xD;
      polymorphism also causes nephrolithiasis. The most known polymorphic genes are the&#xD;
      calcium-sensing receptor (CASR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), and matrix gla protein (MGP),&#xD;
      plasminogen activator, urokinase (PLAU). 3,4 Furthermore, the concordance rate of the stone&#xD;
      disease in monozygotic twins is substantially higher than in dizygotic ones (32.4% vs. 17.3%)&#xD;
      demonstrating that genetic factors play a vital role in the formation of nephrolithiasis. 5&#xD;
      Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) has been shown to be a new androgen receptor&#xD;
      regulator. HIPK2 and androgen were demonstrated to mediate kidney tubular epithelial cell&#xD;
      injury and apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informations on HIPK2 polymorphism about renal stone formation are newfound and inconclusive.&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, authors aimed to investigate whether HIPK2 polymorphism is&#xD;
      associated with renal stone formation in Turkish population or not.&#xD;
