  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondylolisthesis is a serious health condition that is often treated with surgery or&#xD;
      pain-relieving lumbar epidural steroids. Patients with persistent and debilitating symptoms&#xD;
      who have failed to respond to conservative treatment should consider surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the therapeutic efficacy of three ultrasound&#xD;
      guided PRP injections of the facet joint capsule to surgical procedures in patients with&#xD;
      degenerative spondylolisthesis G1 and their effect on neurogenic pain relief and functional&#xD;
      improvement over a one-year follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-year prospective randomised comparative clinical trial was performed on 60 patients&#xD;
      with degenerative spondylolisthesis G1 who were randomly assigned to one of two groups: Group&#xD;
      1: thirty patients were injected in the facet joint capsule with a series of three&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided PRP injections at four-week intervals, and Group 2: thirty patients&#xD;
      underwent surgery. They were exposed to clinical neuropsychological testing.They were&#xD;
      assessed for pain and function using clinical neurological assessments, VAS (Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale), FRI (Functional Rating Index), Roland Morris, and ODI.&#xD;
