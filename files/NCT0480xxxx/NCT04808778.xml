  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease, affecting about 25 million&#xD;
      people worldwide. Approximately 150,000 Nigerian children are born each year with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD), making it the country with the largest burden of SCD in the world. Recent&#xD;
      advancements in care for children with SCA have translated into improved survival of children&#xD;
      in both high and low-resource settings. However, more complications of SCD are seen in those&#xD;
      who survive to adulthood. Silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) and strokes are among the most&#xD;
      devastating complications of SCD, affecting 40% and 10% of children, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to extend the Investigator's successful capacity-building&#xD;
      effort in the assessment of neurological morbidity in children with SCD living in northern&#xD;
      Nigeria (Kano) to young adults with SCD living in the same region. About 50% of all adults&#xD;
      with SCD live in Nigeria. Despite the high prevalence of SCD in Africa, the neurological&#xD;
      morbidity is not well characterized, limiting opportunities for primary and secondary stroke&#xD;
      prevention strategies. At least 50% of young adults with sickle cell anemia (SCA), the most&#xD;
      severe form of the disease, will have SCIs and an estimated 10% will have strokes, based on&#xD;
      studies in high-resource settings. In high-resource settings, screening for abnormal&#xD;
      transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities in children with SCA, coupled with regular blood&#xD;
      transfusion has resulted in a 92% reduction of relative risk for strokes. Despite this&#xD;
      effective strategy, regular blood transfusion therapy does not seem sustainable in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa due to shortages and the risk of transfusion transmissible infections.&#xD;
      Additionally, there is a lack of evidence-based stroke prevention strategies in young adults&#xD;
      with SCA, either in the high-income or in low-resource settings. Based on the foregoing, the&#xD;
      Investigators propose to determine the prevalence of neurological injury (overt stroke,&#xD;
      transient ischemic attacks, and silent cerebral infarcts) in young adults at the transition&#xD;
      age from 16-25 years. The Investigators will also, for the first time, assess conventional&#xD;
      risk factors of stroke in the general population to determine whether a different prevention&#xD;
      strategy is required to reduce the incidence of neurological injury in this high-risk&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Investigator's global hypothesis, to be tested eventually in an NIH-funded phase III&#xD;
      controlled trial, is that hydroxyurea at a fixed moderate dose of 20 mg/kg is safe and&#xD;
      effective for primary and secondary stroke prevention in young adults with SCA. Prior to&#xD;
      testing this global hypothesis, the Investigators must develop a multi-disciplinary team that&#xD;
      provides medical care for young adults with SCD and establish the clinical epidemiology of&#xD;
      neurological morbidity in this distinct age group. Building upon the existing research&#xD;
      platforms of ongoing NINDS-funded primary stroke prevention trials in Nigeria, the&#xD;
      Investigators are uniquely positioned to extend their stroke assessment and treatment to the&#xD;
      next sequential age group, young adults with SCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate goals of this project are 1) to estimate the prevalence of neurological&#xD;
      morbidity in young adults with SCA (R21 application to NIH); 2) to establish a prospective&#xD;
      cohort of young adults to determine the incidence of neurological morbidity, and 3) to&#xD;
      determine the safety and feasibility of fixed moderate dose of hydroxyurea therapy for&#xD;
      prevention of further neurological disease in young adults with SCA in Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The leadership of the current pediatric primary and secondary stroke prevention trials&#xD;
      (NCT01801423, NCT02560935, NCT02675790) in Nigeria will apply a similar effective strategy&#xD;
      used in the Investigator's previous pediatric NINDS-R21 and current pediatric NINDS-R01 to&#xD;
      estimate the prevalence and incidence of neurological morbidity in young adults with SCA.&#xD;
      Young adults with SCA have different stroke risk factors than children less than 16 years of&#xD;
      age with SCA, including risk factors for stroke seen in the general population resulting in&#xD;
      the need for age and disease-specific evidence-based management for primary and secondary&#xD;
      stroke prevention strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the Investigators propose to enroll 350 participants with SCA between 16-25 years of age. The&#xD;
      Investigators believe this sample size is sufficient to estimate the prevalence of stroke and&#xD;
      SCI. This cohort will be followed for 12-18 months to determine the short-term incidence of&#xD;
      strokes and SCI. The Investigators do not intend to calculate a precise incidence of these&#xD;
      neurological injuries due to the short duration of the follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For young adults with SCIs, strokes, and elevated TCD measurements (based on the pediatric&#xD;
      threshold of abnormal â‰¥200 cm/s in the middle cerebral artery or terminal portion of the&#xD;
      internal carotid) the Investigators will initially offer regular blood transfusion therapy as&#xD;
      standard care. If they refuse, the Investigators will offer a dose of 20 mg/kg/day of&#xD;
      hydroxyurea for at least one year of therapy. The hydroxyurea will be supplied free of charge&#xD;
      with monthly follow-up.&#xD;
