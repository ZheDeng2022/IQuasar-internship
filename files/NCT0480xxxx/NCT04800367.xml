  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of the research program is to define optimal treatment for premenopausal&#xD;
      women with clinically significant fracture syndromes that require medical therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that romosozumab will be associated with improvements in bone mass&#xD;
      and microarchitecture in premenopausal women, and also that the responses and response rates&#xD;
      will exceed those observed in premenopausal women treated with teriparatide. The&#xD;
      investigators will test this hypothesis in this phase 2 study of 30 premenopausal women with&#xD;
      idiopathic osteoporosis (IOP) who will receive 12M of romosozumab 210 mg monthly followed by&#xD;
      12M of denosumab 60 mg SC q6M. Aim 1 will define the within-group effects of this regimen.&#xD;
      Aim 2 will compare results from participants treated with romosozumab-denosumab to the&#xD;
      investigator's well-characterized historical controls treated with teriparatide followed by&#xD;
      denosumab.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Romosozumab is an anti-sclerostin antibody that provides powerful skeletal benefits through&#xD;
      concomitant osteoanabolic and antiresorptive effects on bone. In postmenopausal women,&#xD;
      romosozumab is associated with larger increases in spine and hip BMD in comparison to&#xD;
      teriparatide. Romosozumab has an extremely low reported nonresponse rate and transition to&#xD;
      denosumab after romosozumab leads to further BMD increases and sustained anti-fracture&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that romosozumab will be associated with&#xD;
      improvements in bone mass in premenopausal women, and also that the responses and response&#xD;
      rates will exceed those observed in premenopausal women treated with teriparatide. The&#xD;
      investigators will test this hypothesis in this phase 2 study of 30 premenopausal women with&#xD;
      IOP who will receive 12M of romosozumab 210 mg monthly followed by 12M of denosumab 60 mg SC&#xD;
      q6M (&quot;romosozumab-denosumab&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will define the within-group effect of romosozumab-denosumab. The primary outcome&#xD;
      variable will be the within-group change in areal BMD by DXA at the lumbar spine at 12M.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome variables include change in aBMD by DXA at the total hip, femoral neck and&#xD;
      1/3 radius at 12M and change in aBMD at all sites at 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 will compare results from participants treated with romosozumab-denosumab to the&#xD;
      well-characterized historical controls treated with 24 months of teriparatide alone, and a&#xD;
      subset of those treated with 24 months of teriparatide followed by 12 months of denosumab.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that romosozumab over 12M and romosozumab-denosumab over 24M&#xD;
      will be associated with larger BMD gains compared to 12M and 24M of teriparatide. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that 24M of romosozumab-denosumab will be associated with&#xD;
      comparable BMD gains vs. historical controls treated with 36M of teriparatide-denosumab.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Premenopausal women, aged 18-45, with regular menses and no historical or biochemical&#xD;
             secondary cause of osteoporosis; the lower age limit is to ensure epiphyses are fused,&#xD;
             the upper to make it less likely that women will enter menopause during the study. All&#xD;
             subjects under age 25 will be screened (bone age radiograph) prior to enrollment to&#xD;
             rule out open epiphyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented adult fractures judged to be low-trauma (equivalent to a fall from a&#xD;
                  standing height or less) and T-score or Z-score ≤ -1.5 at the LS, TH or FN.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must agree to use highly effective contraception throughout the period of study&#xD;
                  drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Highly effective contraception includes methods considered by the CDC to be &gt;99% effective&#xD;
        (e.g. vasectomized partner, tubal ligation, hysterectomy, IUD) as well as a combination of&#xD;
        barrier method (condoms) with hormonal contraception considered to be &gt; 90% effective (oral&#xD;
        contraceptive pill, patch or ring). Systemic progestin only methods (oral or implanted) are&#xD;
        not included due to their effect on systemic estrogen levels and thus potential effects on&#xD;
        bone health in this premenopausal population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any cardiovascular disease: history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Normal&#xD;
             electrocardiogram (ECG) or ECG with no clinically significant abnormality is required&#xD;
             at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Conditions requiring chronic anticoagulation (coumadin, heparins)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Early follicular phase serum FSH&gt;20 mIU/ml (to exclude perimenopausal women)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disorders of mineral metabolism: primary/secondary hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia&#xD;
             (including that associated with a diagnosis of hypophosphatasia), vitamin D deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Suspicion of osteomalacia (elevated alkaline phosphatase, bone pain exacerbated&#xD;
                  by weight bearing, bone tenderness)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-OHD&lt;30ng/ml). Women with levels of 10-29 ng/ml&#xD;
                  will be eligible after treatment with vitamin D has resulted in levels ≥30 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hypocalcemia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hypercalciuria: urinary calcium excretion over 300 mg/g Cr that can not be&#xD;
                  effectively lowered with medical management (reduced calcium intake, thiazide&#xD;
                  diuretics). As in our prior studies, prevalent nephrolithiasis in the absence of&#xD;
                  pretreatment hypercalciuria is not an exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current pregnancy or lactation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Highly effective contraception is required, pregnancy testing is performed at&#xD;

             lactation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior eating disorder (hypothalamic or exercise induced amenorrhea now resolved may be&#xD;
             acceptable if symptoms occurred at age &gt;20 years, for &lt;1year, &gt;5 years ago). The&#xD;
             Eating Aptitude Test -Questionnaire is given to identify women with subclinical eating&#xD;
             disorders&#xD;

          -  Renal insufficiency (eGFR below 60 ml/min)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver disease (AST, ALT, bilirubin, total alkaline phosphatase activity above upper&#xD;
             normal limit)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intestinal disorders including but not limited to celiac disease, pancreatic&#xD;
             insufficiency, Crohn Disease or ulcerative colitis&#xD;

             heparin is not an exclusion, although known thrombotic disease is an exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Depo Provera (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) unless taken after age 20, more than&#xD;
             5 years ago&#xD;

          -  Drugs for osteoporosis (raloxifene, bisphosphonates, denosumab, calcitonin, TPTD).&#xD;
             Subjects who discontinue these medications will be eligible 3 months after stopping&#xD;
             raloxifene or calcitonin, 12 months after stopping alendronate, risedronate,&#xD;
             ibandronate, or pamidronate and 18 months after stopping denosumab. Subjects with&#xD;
             prior use of zoledronate may be eligible if received only one dose &gt;4 years ago. Total&#xD;
             bisphosphonate/denosumab exposure must be &lt; 1 year. Subjects who have taken TPTD in&#xD;
             the past will not be eligible unless used for &lt;3 months, &gt; 2 years ago.&#xD;

          -  Women with a history of dental extraction or other invasive dental work within 3&#xD;
             months, or who require invasive dental work within the next two years, will be&#xD;
