      Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are 18-65 years old. A maximum of&#xD;
      25 subjects will be enrolled at 1 study center. Subjects will receive up to 6 treatments&#xD;
      (minimum of 4 treatment visits with an optional 5th and 6th treatment) on the face. Subjects&#xD;
      will return for follow up visits at 30 and 90 days post last treatment. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive a phone call 1 week after each treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Photographic evaluation with ECCA (échelle d'évaluation clinique des cicatrices d'acné) grading comparing pre-treatment images to the 90 day follow up images performed by independent reviewers. This scale gives higher scores based on the number of scars, with the description of the scars determining the weighting factor. The scale ranges from 0 to 540, with a lower score meaning less severe scarring.</description>
