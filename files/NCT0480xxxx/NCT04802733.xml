  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed to test whether surgically injecting nerve cells that make&#xD;
      dopamine into the brain of Parkinson's disease patients is safe, and to monitor for potential&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will undergo surgical transplantation of the dopamine-producing cells under general&#xD;
      anesthesia into a part of the brain called the putamen. Subjects then take medicines to&#xD;
      partially suppress their immune system (aimed to prevent the body from rejecting the cells)&#xD;
      for 1 year. Safety, tolerability, evidence of cell survival (using MRI and PET scans of the&#xD;
      brain), and effect on Parkinson's disease symptoms are assessed for 2 years post-transplant.&#xD;
