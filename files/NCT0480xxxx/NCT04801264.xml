  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) accounts for 24% of salivary gland malignant tumors, is&#xD;
      characterized by frequent local recurrences and distant metastasis, mainly to lungs.&#xD;
      Considering its origination from salivary glands, an organ with intense physiological uptake&#xD;
      of 68Ga-PSMA-617, this study aims to evaluate 68Ga-PSMA-617 uptake in local recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic ACC in comparison with 18F-FDG uptake in the same patients, and assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 treatment in patients with the advanced ACC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumor entity with a yearly incidence of 3-5 cases&#xD;
      per million. ACC arises in the major salivary glands and more often in the minor salivary&#xD;
      glands of the oropharynx, lip, nasopharynx, oral cavity, nasal cavity, paranasal sinus,&#xD;
      larynx and tracheobronchial tree. ACC is characterized by frequent local recurrences and&#xD;
      distant metastasis, mainly to lungs. 18F-FDG PET/CT is considered to be a viable tool to&#xD;
      assess ACC at initial presentation. However, FDG uptake in ACC is lower than in squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (SCC) and not all ACC lesions show detectable FDG uptake. So, it is necessary to&#xD;
      find another effective way to detect ACC and its metastases. As in known, PSMA is highly&#xD;
      expressed in salivary glands, and Wim van Boxtel et al had demonstrated high PSMA-ligand&#xD;
      uptake in a patient with recurrent and metastatic ACC using 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT. 68Ga-PSMA has&#xD;
      been developed as a targeting imaging agent widely used in prostate cancer in prostate&#xD;
      cancer. Thus, this prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT may be&#xD;
      superior for diagnosis, therapy response assessment and follow-up of ACC than 18F-FDG PET/CT.&#xD;
      Furthermore, peptide receptor radionuclide therapy has been widely used in the treatment of&#xD;
      prostate cancer lesions that showed high PSMA uptake on 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT, we'll try to assess&#xD;
      the safety and therapeutic response to 177Lu-EB-PSMA-617 in patients with ACC.&#xD;
