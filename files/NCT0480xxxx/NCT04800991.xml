      1. A total of 4 visits will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At the screening visit,subject's written informed consent, assessing the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria and assigning enrollment numbers to eligible subjects,&#xD;
           demographic information taking, medical history/medication history taking, vital signs&#xD;
           measuring, physical examination, height and body weight measuring, instructing how to&#xD;
           install/use the investigational device, and administering quality of life&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. During the treatment period, a total of 3 visits will be performed. To evaluate&#xD;
           feasibility and efficacy, the following procedures will be carried out: vital signs&#xD;
           measuring, physical examination, nutrition assessment/consultation, evaluation of&#xD;
           feasibility for 'subjects', evaluation of feasibility for 'investigators', and adverse&#xD;
           events (AEs)/concomitant medications checking and collecting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. During the treatment period, telephone monitoring is conducted depending on the&#xD;
           compliance of subjects.&#xD;
