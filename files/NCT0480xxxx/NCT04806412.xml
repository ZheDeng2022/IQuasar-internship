  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncological treatment of patients with disseminated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is&#xD;
      depending on the status of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), anaplastic lymphoma kinase&#xD;
      (ALK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), so called oncodrivers. These can be&#xD;
      measured in pleural fluid, but the prevalence is uncertain. In a prospective study, the&#xD;
      research team aim to measure PD-L1, ALK and EGFR in patients with pleural fluid cytology&#xD;
      positive for NSCLC to report the prevalence. Also, the study will investigate if the chance&#xD;
      of obtaining oncodriver status is depending on the volume analysed and how the lack of&#xD;
      oncodrivers influence the following work-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, non-randomized, cohort study of patients with pleural effusion.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from patients referred to the Pleura Clinic or admitted at the&#xD;
      ward at the Department of Respiratory Medicine, Næstved Hospital, Næstved or at the&#xD;
      Department of Respiratory Medicine, Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde, which is the two&#xD;
      regional centres for workup of pleural effusions. Patients will be referred from either&#xD;
      general practice or other hospital departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural fluids with cytology positive for NSCLC will be tested for oncodrivers (for squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinomas (SCC): PD-L1, for adenocarcinomas (AC): PD-L1, ALK and EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be 8 weeks after inclusion.&#xD;

    <description>PD-L1 test will be performed on cell-blocks using PD-L1 antibodies 22C3 and staining platform Dako Omnis (Agilent, Glostrup -Denmark).&#xD;
ALK test will be performed on cell-blocks using staining platform Dako Omnis (Agilent, Glostrup- Denmark) and ALK antibodies &quot;Origene&quot; clone: OT1A4. Sample quality is assessed as for PD-L1.&#xD;
EGFR mutation analysis will be performed as follows: after tumor content evaluation of hematoxylin and eosin stained slides, relevant regions are macrodissected and subjected to a standard genomic DNA extraction procedure using the GeneRead DNA FFPE Kit (Qiagen). Samples will be analysed using the GeneRead QIAact Actionable Insights Tumor Panel (Qiagen)</description>
