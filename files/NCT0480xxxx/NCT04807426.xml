  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is defined as a neurological dysfunction due to sudden or acute injury to the central&#xD;
      nervous system due to vascular causes, which includes cerebral infarction, intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage.Stroke is categorized as ischemic stroke (85%) and&#xD;
      hemorrhage stroke (20%). Hemorrhagic stroke is further classified as interacerebral&#xD;
      hemorrhage (15%) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (5%). Transient Ischemic attack (TIA) is a&#xD;
      temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain and its symptoms resolves within 24 hours of&#xD;
      the injury. Stroke is currently the second leading cause of death worldwide and is one of the&#xD;
      leading causes of long-term disability in the United States. Almost 15 million stroke cases&#xD;
      occur each year worldwide, resulting in 5 million deaths and leaving about 5 million stroke&#xD;
      survivors with unchangeable abnormality and dependency.According to world health organization&#xD;
      (WHO) in 2002 approximately 5.5 million people died due to stroke and 20% of these deaths&#xD;
      occurred in south Asia .In Pakistan stroke cases reported are estimated to be 3,50,000&#xD;
      annually.Stroke survivors experience damaged upper limb function which also affects their&#xD;
      activites of daily living. A large number of them is left with impaired upper extremity&#xD;
      function, even after completion of conventional rehabilitation programmes.Only 5-20 % of&#xD;
      patients regain Upper extremity functional status.Along with motor impairments somatosensory&#xD;
      impairments are also assosoiated with severity of stroke but is overlooked most of the times.&#xD;
      Sensory impairment decreases the ability to discriminate textures, weights ,shapes and&#xD;
      sizes.Proprioception and stereognosis were found to be more impaired than tatile sensation&#xD;
      ,7-53 % had impaired tactile sensations ,31-89% impaied sterognosis and 34-64 % impaired&#xD;
      proprioception.Mostly, the focus is on motor recovery in paretic limb but the studies showed&#xD;
      that improvement in sensory functions also leads to motor recovery. By only focusing on motor&#xD;
      performance without sensory dysfunction assessment, maximum outcomes cannot be achieved.Not&#xD;
      only Sensory dysfunction but Cognitive issues after stroke such as ,decreased perception and&#xD;
      attention ,memory deficits ,difficulty in problem solving tend to be disregarded which&#xD;
      eventually effects patient performance of daily activities.Multisensory stimulation exercises&#xD;
      also known as neurocognitive therapeutic exercises, cognitive exercise therapy or cognitive&#xD;
      sensory motor training was proposed by Carlo Perfetti of Italy .The Hallmark of this training&#xD;
      is that it focuses on sensory retraining along with emphasis on joint position perception. It&#xD;
      considers recovery as a learning process, the movement as a means to know and the body as a&#xD;
      surface receptor for information.Laia Salles et.al conducted a randomized controlled pilot&#xD;
      study to compare the effectiveness of the cognitive exercise therapy with conventional&#xD;
      treatment protocol on upper limb in sub-acute stroke patients. The result showed favourable&#xD;
      clinical progression regarding upper extremity functional gain.Sunghee Lee et.al did a study&#xD;
      on effect of the cognitive exercise therapy on chronic stroke patients upper limb function,&#xD;
      activities of daily living and quality of life .They compared it with Task oriented exercise&#xD;
      group. There was significant difference between two groups and application of cognitive&#xD;
      exercise therapy was found more effective for functional recovery in stroke patients.A study&#xD;
      compared the effectiveness of cognitive sensory motor training therapy with conventional&#xD;
      therapy on recovery of arm function in acute stroke patients. There were no significant&#xD;
      differences found between two groups in acute stroke patients. The studies based on&#xD;
      Multisensory stimulation exercises of perfetti focused on evaluating motor function of upper&#xD;
      limb ,activities of daily living and quality of life but cognitive elements such as attention&#xD;
      and memory also activated in discriminatory tasks and were not evaluated. The past records&#xD;
      shows that in randomized controlled trials Multi sensory stimulation therapy is used alone&#xD;
      for the experimental group .Combination of two protocols has not been analyzed yet .So, the&#xD;
      aim of the study is to observe and determine the combine effect of Task Oriented Exercises&#xD;
      and Multisensory stimulation exercises on upper limb function , Activities of daily living&#xD;
      and Cognition .It is expected that the combination of these two approaches will give more&#xD;
      significant results in improving sub-acute and chronic stroke patients condition.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to measure changes from baseline to 4 weeks. Fugal Meyer assessment scale is used to evaluate paretic upper extremity voluntary movements, reflex activity, grasping and coordination .FMA- UE contains 33 tasks with a scale of 0 to 2 with total scoring of 66. Reliability of FMA is 0.95-1.0</description>

    <measure>Wolf Motor Function Test</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to measure changes from baseline to 4 weeks. Wolf Motor Function Test was designed to assess upper extremity performance for strength and functional ability (quality of movement). It includes 17 tasks that patient completes by using his impaired upper limb ,15 timed and 2 strength tasks ranging from simple to complex. Inter rater reliability of WMFT ranged from 0.92 to 0.97.</description>

    <description>The Nottingum Sensory Assessment is a standardised scale for assessing sensory impairment in stroke patients. It asses Tactile sensations, kinesthesia and stereognosis. Stereognosis Assessment of nottingum sensory assessment is a reliable measure and highly applicable to patients with stroke.</description>

    <measure>Motor Activity log</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to measure changes from baseline to 4 weeks. This instrument is a structured interview intended to examine how much and how well the subject uses their paretic arm outside of the setting. The MAL consists of 30 ADL items where the subject is asked to rate his or her level of performance over the past week .Participants are asked standardized questions about the amount of use of their more-affected arm (Amount Scale or AS) and the quality of their movement (How Well Scale or HW) during the functional activities indicated. Each task is scored along a 5-point rating scale (0 to 5) with half points being assigned by the subject. A mean MAL score is calculated for both scales by adding the rating scores for each scale and dividing by the number of items asked. The test retest reliability of the scale is 0.91.</description>

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment screens cognitive domains (attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, visuo constructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation). Its scores ranges between 0 and 30. A score of 26 or over is considered as normal. Internal Reliability is 0.78.</description>
