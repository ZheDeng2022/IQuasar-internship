  <brief_summary>

      Purpose: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of multimodal interventions based on&#xD;
      Integrative Nursing (IN) principles on blood pressure, stress, and hypertensive treatment&#xD;
      compliance levels in individuals living in the community and with uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This is a single-center, 1:1 randomized, single-blind, parallel, active comparator&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) Statement&#xD;
      2013 checklist is used in this study. The CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting&#xD;
      Trials) flowchart is used in this protocol. This study will be carried out in 23 Nisan&#xD;
      Retirement Coffee House, located within the boundaries of Konyaaltı District of Antalya&#xD;
      province, which is one of the social areas where adults aged 50-65 are gathered. In this&#xD;
      study, multimodal interventions including yoga, meditation, and breathing techniques,&#xD;
      compliance training for hypertension treatment, and home blood pressure measurement training&#xD;
      will be applied. The ongoing health service of the control group will continue. In addition,&#xD;
      the control group will be directed to a specialist doctor and standard brochures prepared by&#xD;
      the Ministry of Health for hypertensive individuals will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses : This will be the first study to evaluate the effect of multimodal interventions&#xD;
      based on integrative nursing principles in uncontrolled hypertensives. If the hypotheses of&#xD;
      the study are reached, it is expected that the planned intervention protocol will be used by&#xD;
      other researchers and thus become widespread in the literature. Also, the results will help&#xD;
      contribute to the provision of care in terms of IN.&#xD;

    <description>Hill-Bone Compliance to High Blood Pressure Therapy Scale: The scale total score varies between 0 and 42 in relation to the number of items. The scores are evaluated for the interpretation of the total, medical, nutrition and interview sub-dimension compliance scores of the scale; If the person gets &quot;0&quot; points in total by giving the most positive answers to all questions, he / she is considered to be fully compatible.</description>

    <description>International Physical Activity Questionnaire: The short form (seven questions) obtains information about walking, moderate and intense activities, and time spent sitting. The energy required for the activities is calculated by the MET minute score. The score obtained is classified as nonphysical (MET ≤ 600 energy level), insufficient physical activity level (MET = 600-3000 energy level), and sufficient physical activity level (MET ≥3000 energy level).</description>
