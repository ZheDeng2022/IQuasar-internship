  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the interplay between environmental (abiotic) factors in&#xD;
      the gut and the gut microbiota composition, diversity and metabolism. Such insights could&#xD;
      help us understand personal responses to diets and be a first step towards personalized&#xD;
      dietary recommendations targeting the gut microbiome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a 9-day trial including 85 healthy adults in age between 18 and 75. The&#xD;
      participants will throughout the trial register their dietary intake, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms including stool frequency and Bristol stool scale, physical activity, and medicine&#xD;
      and supplements intake. Participants will on day 3 and day 5, respectively, consume sweet&#xD;
      corns to estimate intestinal transit time by the time it takes sweet corn to travel through&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal system. Furthermore, the participants will collect daily urine and stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 2 and day 9, participants will arrive fasting at the department in the morning and&#xD;
      have their anthropometry, breath hydrogen and methane levels measured, and a blood sample&#xD;
      will be collected from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first visit (day 2) also includes a standardized meal test (rye bread, butter, jam, egg,&#xD;
      and yogurt with nuts and berries) and intake of paracetamol (250 mg). Subsequently, the&#xD;
      participants will stay at the department for the following 6 hours and have their&#xD;
      postprandial breath hydrogen and methane measured and urine collected at specific intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a sub-set of the participants will on the first visit (day 2) immediately after&#xD;
      intake of the standardized meal swallow a single-use gastrointestinal SmartPill capsule,&#xD;
      which will monitor their gastrointestinal pH, transit time, temperature and pressure.&#xD;
