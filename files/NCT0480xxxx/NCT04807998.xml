  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that some factors are associated with emergence agitation(EA), and investigators&#xD;
      are still unable to predict accurately those who undergoing maxillofacial surgery are at&#xD;
      great risks.This study intend to identify the risk factors for EA and to explore the&#xD;
      mechanism of EA , which is helpful for early prediction, prevention and treatment in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

      This study was divided into two parts. The first part, multivariate regression analysis were&#xD;
      conducted to identify the risk factors for pain and EA following maxillofacial surgery in&#xD;
      children. The second part, metabolomics research was used to explore the relationship between&#xD;
      metabolites and EA in children.&#xD;

    <description>Children aged 3-12 years who undergoing palatopharyngoplasty/adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy, auricle reconstruction, and photodynamic therapy for vascular malformations were enrolled in this study. The general information of children, preoperative anxiety state, preoperative anxiety state of parents, operation type, anesthesia method, analgesic drug, postoperative pain and emergence agitation degree were collected. Multivariate regression analysis were conducted to identify the risk factors for pain and emergence agitation following maxillofacial surgery in children.</description>

    <time_frame>within 24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Children who underwent adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy in part I of this study were included. Urine (5ml) and peripheral venous blood (1ml) samples were collected before anesthesia and immediately after completion of agitation score. EA was defined as a Pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium(PAED) score â‰¥12 points. Children in EA group were matched with non-EA group, and UPLC-Q TOF/MS analysis was performed to identify the metabolites between two groups during the recovery period.</description>

    <description>Serum and Urine samples were collected before anesthesia and immediately after surgery from children who enrolled in part I and undergoing the adenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy. A PAED score of 12 or greater was defined as EA. The serum and urine samples were analyzed by UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS separately.</description>
