  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mortality in patients with sepsis and severe acute kidney injury requiring continuous&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy (CRRT) remains high. Antibiotic therapy is a key treatment of these&#xD;
      patients and in recent years new antibiotics have been licensed. However, data is lacking to&#xD;
      determine the optimal dosing regimens of these antibiotics for high (Australia and other&#xD;
      countries) and low intensity (Japan) of CRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To establish the appropriate dosing regimens of newly available antibiotics during CRRT&#xD;
      can applied globally.&#xD;

    <measure>Plasma new antibiotics concentration during continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVHF) in critically ill patients receiving infusion of these drugs.</measure>

    <description>New drugs are Tedizolid, Daptomycin (anti-MRSA), Tazobactam/ Ceftolozane (anti-gram negative), Metronidazole (Anti-anaerobic). Plasma antibiotics concentrations will be measured at 5 time-points and prefilter and postfilter plasma and filtered-fluid antibiotics levels will be measured at 3 time-points during CVVHF.</description>

    <description>New drugs are Tedizolid, Daptomycin (anti-MRSA), Tazobactam/ Ceftolozane (anti-gram negative), Metronidazole (Anti-anaerobic). Total clearance by CVVHF: (Cltotal) = (Cpre - Cpost / Cpre) × Blood flow (ml/min), Clearance by filtration: (Clfil) = (Clfil / Cpre)× replacement volume (ml/min), Clearance by absorption of the filter: (Clab) = (Cltotal) - (Clfil) (ml/min).</description>

    <description>High dose (world standard dose) and low dose CRRT (Japan local) CRRT protocol Vascular access will be obtained by inserting a double-lumen dialysis catheter into the internal jugular or femoral veins. High dose CRRT in Australia, Blood flow through the extracorporeal circuit will be maintained at 150 ml/min. The CVVHF replacement volume will be set at 25ml/kg/hour and bicarbonate-buffered replacement fluids will be added in post-dilutional mode. Low dose CRRT in Japan, Blood flow through the extracorporeal circuit will be maintained at 80 ml/min. CVVHF replacement volume will be set at 15ml/kg/hour and bicarbonate-buffered replacement fluids will be added in the post-dilutional mode. Fluid balance, volume removal and the duration of CVVHF will be determined by the ICU physician based on the patient's individual clinical status.</description>
