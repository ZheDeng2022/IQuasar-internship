    <textblock>
      Background: Vision Centre (primary eyecare facility): a major eye care service model catering&#xD;
      to underserved rural areas. The sustainability of rural Vision Centres (VC) in north India is&#xD;
      a major challenge due to the under-utilization of services by the local community and&#xD;
      stakeholders. This affects self-sustainability and limits the expansion of services in rural&#xD;
      areas. Dr. Shroff's Charity Eye Hospital is planning an intervention: door-to-door screening&#xD;
      in VC's vicinity areas, to connect with the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this operational research, the investigators plan to study if this intervention package,&#xD;
      consisting of door-to-door screening and awareness generation in the service area can&#xD;
      increase the utilization of VC services to a minimum of 14 out-patient cases per day within&#xD;
      the study period and also analyze its cost-effectiveness for scalability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: The study is a randomized experimental intervention, consisting of 2 VCs&#xD;
      (intervention arm and control arm) selected from poor low-performing VCs i.e. walk-in&#xD;
      out-patient cases≤ 10 per day, in two operational regions (Vrindavan, Mathura District, and&#xD;
      Mohammadi, Kheri District) of Uttar Pradesh. Intervention includes door-to-door screening and&#xD;
      awareness generation in 8-12 villages surrounding the VC. The control VC will follow existing&#xD;
      practices of awareness generation through community activities and health talks. Data&#xD;
      collected from each VC for the 4 months of intervention will include, a number of walk-in&#xD;
      patients, spectacles advised, and their uptake, referral, and uptake for cataract and&#xD;
      specialty surgery as well as operational expenses. Differences across arms in terms of the&#xD;
      number of walk-in patients, referrals, uptake of services, and costs involved would be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Through this study, the investigators would analyze if our intervention package&#xD;
      is effective in increasing the VC service utilization and thus, overall sustainability. The&#xD;
      investigators would also study the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, to assess its&#xD;
      scalability.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Global Action Plan for Universal Eye Health emphasizes the importance of providing basic&#xD;
      eyecare to all individuals, &amp; the communities they constitute, at affordable rates. In India,&#xD;
      PEC is delivered through two main mechanisms. Transient screening camps and permanent&#xD;
      facilities- vision centers (VCs) with catchment areas of roughly 50,000 people, located in&#xD;
      rural areas &amp; urban slums &amp; accessible by public transport. They refract, diagnose &amp; treat&#xD;
      minor eye conditions &amp; refer cases needing further care to their nearest base hospital. The&#xD;
      literature on barriers to PEC in India is limited but points to lack of knowledge about eye&#xD;
      diseases, detrimental social stigmas, low priority being accorded to eye problems, gender&#xD;
      discrimination, unaffordability, lack of perceived need as well as immobility &amp; dependence on&#xD;
      escorts. These barriers potentially affect the operational sustainability of VCs-in large&#xD;
      part by the number of walk-in patients. Our organization is a network of eye care delivery&#xD;
      mechanisms based on the pyramidal model; spread across north India. 36 VCs (9 urban &amp; 27&#xD;
      rural) are under operation; raising awareness, providing refraction, recognition &amp; referral&#xD;
      services to their catchment population &amp; increasing contact of those in need of services. For&#xD;
      the majority of people, these are the first point of contact when accessing or attempting to&#xD;
      access eye care services. Developing trust &amp; high referrals to these VCs, from the entire&#xD;
      catchment population they service, is essential for the overall sustainability of these&#xD;
      centers &amp; to increase the ambit of PEC delivery. This protocol aims to study the effect of an&#xD;
      intervention combining door-to-door screening with regular awareness activities in the&#xD;
      catchment population on the service utilization at VCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design &amp; Process: Randomized experimental intervention, in which four VCs are selected:&#xD;
      two each in the intervention &amp; control arms (one each from a particular operational area).&#xD;
      Our organization has 6 secondary centers (SCs), of which 4 are located in the state of Uttar&#xD;
      Pradesh, namely, Meerut, Mathura, Saharanpur &amp; Kheri. These regions have a total of 23 VCs&#xD;
      operating in rural &amp; semi-urban areas, together serving around 1 million people. Of these 4&#xD;
      SCs, 2 were selected (Vrindavan in Mathura district &amp; Mohammadi in Kheri district) for this&#xD;
      study based on feasibility &amp; the demographic profile of their catchment population. The&#xD;
      Vrindavan region has 8 VCs delivering eyecare services in its' semi-urban areas while the&#xD;
      Mohammadi region has 6 VCs (5 rural &amp; 1 semi-urban). Most of these VCs have been operational&#xD;
      for over 3 years. However, the previous year's data indicated that 80% of VCs as sub-optimal&#xD;
      in performance. The sub-optimal VCs were listed. From a total of 10 VCs (5 in each region,&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria), 2 were randomly selected from each: one each for&#xD;
      the control &amp; intervention arms. The VCs in the 2 blocks of the Mathura district were located&#xD;
      at Chhata &amp; Raya, respectively, while the 2 VCs from 2 blocks of Kheri district were located&#xD;
      at Mitauli &amp; Pashgaon. Due to the nature of the study, it was impossible to mask the field&#xD;
      staff to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria: The regional team gathered detailed information regarding all&#xD;
      VCs operating in the Vrindavan &amp; Mohammadi region. VCs were included based on the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low performance (walk-in OPD ≤ 10/day) Duration of operation &gt;1 year Presence of 1 VC in each&#xD;
      arm from selected VCs VCs with a walk-in OPD greater than 10 per day &amp; those in operation for&#xD;
      less than one year were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: Mathura district has a population of about 2.5 million, 70% resident in rural&#xD;
      areas. Kheri district has a population of 4 million- 88% residents in rural areas. Chhata&#xD;
      block, in Mathura, has 81 villages with 30 within 10km of the VC. These 30 have a combined&#xD;
      population of 70,000. On the other hand, Raya block has 124 villages with 90 within 10km of&#xD;
      the VC, having a combined population of 130,000. In Kheri, the Mitauli block has 138 villages&#xD;
      with 75 within 10km of the VC. The combined population is around 111,000. Pashgaon block has&#xD;
      230 villages with 85 within 10km of the VC, a population of around 110,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Average OPD attendance at the intervention VCs is 7/day, at present. The&#xD;
      investigators expect to achieve 14 after the intervention, failing which, the intervention&#xD;
      will not be considered a success. Therefore, the primary objective of the statistical&#xD;
      analysis should be to estimate the average attendance, post-intervention, with extreme&#xD;
      precision which leads us to assess if the investigators have been able to achieve the target&#xD;
      (14 per day on average). The investigators set the confidence interval ±1 for the&#xD;
      post-intervention sample mean (the narrowest possible confidence interval in this case). To&#xD;
      check if at least 20 per day on average has been achieved, the investigators expect a sample&#xD;
      mean of at least 21 (i.e. the confidence interval will be 20-22). The investigators assume&#xD;
      that the probability of the confidence interval is 95%, &amp; the daily OPD attendance has a&#xD;
      Poisson distribution. Thus, the investigators expect that the post-intervention daily&#xD;
      attendance has a Poisson distribution with a mean of at least 21. It implies that the&#xD;
      variance of the distribution also equals 21 (or more), &amp; the investigators want to estimate&#xD;
      the mean with a 95% confidence interval of ±1. It requires a minimum sample size of 81 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have used the following formula to calculate the sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size= 〖1.96〗^2/d^2 x variance of the distribution Where 1.96 is the 97.5 percentile&#xD;
      point of the standard normal distribution, d is the length of the confidence interval (on one&#xD;
      side of the estimate). d=1 &amp; variance=21 give sample size=81. The investigators had put a&#xD;
      target of 20 in the pre-COVID time but due to the pandemic, the investigators have revised&#xD;
      our desired target to 14 per day to consider the intervention a success. The investigators&#xD;
      have persisted with the additional days in the sample size (instead of 58 days for a target&#xD;
      of 14) to be able to estimate up to 14 per day OPD with precision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm: The intervention will include door-to-door screening &amp; awareness generation&#xD;
      in 8-12 villages surrounding the intervention VC. The VC team will be trained in using the&#xD;
      PEEK acuity20 application for measuring visual acuity &amp; using the data collection software&#xD;
      (Taraka) on android platforms. A list of surrounding villages (within 10km) will be prepared&#xD;
      by the Vision Centre Coordinator &amp; the VC attendant. The Vision Centre Coordinator will meet&#xD;
      the village leader to take permission for the door-to-door intervention survey to be carried&#xD;
      out in the village. After having received the necessary permissions, a priority list of&#xD;
      survey villages would be prepared to initiate the intervention. In the intervention villages,&#xD;
      the VC attendant will go from door to door. During the screening, if any house is locked or&#xD;
      family members are not available, the attendant will attempt to contact those missing at&#xD;
      least 3 times. The attendant will explain the intervention &amp; obtain consent for participation&#xD;
      in the survey. Household or family members, who are unwilling or not interested to&#xD;
      participate in the survey, will also be recorded separately. After obtaining consent, the&#xD;
      attendant will communicate regarding the need for eye care in general &amp; share the IEC&#xD;
      material. For each family member above 5 years of age, the visual acuity of each eye will be&#xD;
      taken &amp; recorded using the PEEK application on a smartphone. Demographic data, ocular&#xD;
      complaints &amp; information regarding any previous eye check-up would be also be recorded in the&#xD;
      android application. Any person with a visual acuity &lt;6/12 (cut-off) or other eye issues&#xD;
      would be counseled &amp; referred for a comprehensive examination to the vision center. A&#xD;
      referral slip will be provided to referred patients along with a reason for referral.&#xD;
      Referred patients' records will be available to the Vision Technician (optometrist) through&#xD;
      the software. Patients reporting to the VC for a comprehensive check-up &amp; treatment, due to&#xD;
      the door-to-door intervention will be recorded in the vision center management software&#xD;
      (VCMS). Any patient requiring surgical treatment or further care will be referred to the&#xD;
      respective secondary center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Arm: The control arm VC will continue its routine awareness activities &amp; health talk&#xD;
      sessions in the community. The VC attendant will prepare a monthly activity plan &amp; organize&#xD;
      activities in the surrounding 8-10 villages. Persons with eye issues will be recorded &amp;&#xD;
      referred to the VC for further evaluation &amp; treatment. Patients reporting to the VC will be&#xD;
      registered in the VCMS. For surgical interventions or further care, patients will be referred&#xD;
      to the respective SC. The activities will be the same in both the arms &amp; will also be&#xD;
      standardized in the same manner. Only their mode &amp; reach will be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project Timelines: The study period will be 12 months. Two months will be spent preparing the&#xD;
      study intervention &amp; obtaining approvals, three months will be needed for pre-intervention&#xD;
      work i.e. training the team, field preparation, finalizing a data collection format &amp; IEC&#xD;
      development, four months for the intervention &amp; data collection. After data collection, the&#xD;
      remaining three months will be used for data analysis &amp; writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection &amp; Variables: Both electronic &amp; manual data collection for both arms.&#xD;
      Intervention arm-field level data (door-to-door survey) through software; Control arm-field&#xD;
      level activity in the activity register manually. VC level data would be extracted from the&#xD;
      VCMS, for both control &amp; intervention VCs. In both arms, programmatic data will be collected,&#xD;
      which includes data regarding the villages screened, door-to-door screening, walk-in OPD,&#xD;
      those reporting after referrals from the field, spectacles advised &amp; their uptake, as well as&#xD;
      referral for cataract, specialty &amp; surgical follow-up. Cost data will be collected for&#xD;
      direct, indirect &amp; opportunity costs like rent, human resources, overheads &amp; community&#xD;
      activities. Also, data for revenue from OPD, spectacles &amp; surgery done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance: Three sources of data: door-to-door screening data will be collected&#xD;
      through the customized android application, data of patients visiting VCs will be captured&#xD;
      through VCMS &amp; additional data pertaining to activities from the control VCs &amp; staff visits&#xD;
      would be collected on the registers. The software has checks &amp; balances ensuring complete&#xD;
      data collection. Manual data collection will be standardized through a checklist. Random&#xD;
      monitoring visits will be made periodically to the field. Data collected during the day will&#xD;
      be uploaded on the cloud server at least once at the end of the day for review. Data quality&#xD;
      will be ensured by clearly defined roles, appropriate resource allocation &amp; regular meetings&#xD;
      with the team members. A regular review process will be followed to ensure quality data&#xD;
      collected &amp; at least 10% of it will be verified by field supervisors. Surgery-related data of&#xD;
      SC referrals would be extracted from the SC EMRs. Data would be collated monthly as a part of&#xD;
      routine program monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Collected data would be tabulated &amp; analyzed by arm: distance of village; age;&#xD;
      gender; eye issues; visual acuity; compliance with treatment- medicine, surgery, glasses &amp;&#xD;
      revenue &amp; expenditure of VC. The difference from baseline in the number of walk-in patients,&#xD;
      referrals, uptake of services &amp; costs involved in intervention would be analyzed. Z-test will&#xD;
      be used to compare the change in walk-in patients between the two arms. A P-value of less&#xD;
      than 0.05 would be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-Effectiveness Analysis: Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) &amp; Incremental CEA will be&#xD;
      performed. The incremental cost for every additional beneficiary attending the VC will be&#xD;
      calculated. To calculate the increase in patients, the average number visiting per day during&#xD;
      the same months last year would be subtracted from the average in the study period. Change in&#xD;
      control VC, if any, would also be deducted before using this as the denominator for&#xD;
      calculation.&#xD;
