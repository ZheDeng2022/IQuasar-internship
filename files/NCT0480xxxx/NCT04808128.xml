  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Quasi-experiment and Cross-sectional study, six-arm design protocol will be carried out. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted under the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will assess the effects of EDs consumption on the physiological and&#xD;
      psychological responses of Israeli Arab adolescents. These effects will also be examined in&#xD;
      association with the adolescent's plasma metabolite profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has five specific aims: (1) to assess the effects of ED consumption with or without&#xD;
      a meal, on Israeli Arab adolescents glucose levels by using mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT)&#xD;
      (2) to assess the effect of ED consumption with or without a meal on their blood pressure (3)&#xD;
      to evaluate the association between ED consumption per day by the Israeli Arab adolescents&#xD;
      and their nutritional status and habits (4) to examine for possible associations between&#xD;
      Israeli Arab adolescents psychological status (i.e. mood and anxiety) and ED consumption per&#xD;
      day (5) to examine for possible associations between ED and caffeine consumption and plasma&#xD;
      metabolite profiles and, the subject's psychological status.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Blood sugar change</measure>
    <time_frame>First measurement at baseline, before consuming the meal, and four times during the intervention - 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after consuming the meal</time_frame>
    <description>Change in blood sugar levels (mg/dL) will be measured with the mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) five times - one time at baseline (before consuming the meal) and four times during the intervention (15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after consuming the meal).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety status</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety status will be measured one time during the intervention - 60 minutes after consuming the meal, with the SCARED-R questionnaire (Muris et al., 1999) in Arabic. SCARED-R is a self-report questionnaire which measures anxiety status in the last 3 months. Contains 41 statements (such as &quot;I am nervous&quot;) in Likert scale of 0 (&quot;Not True or Hardly Ever True&quot;) to 2 (&quot;Very True or Often True&quot;). A total score of ≥ 25 may indicate the presence of an Anxiety Disorder.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mood change</measure>
    <time_frame>First measurement at baseline, before consuming the meal, and another measurement during the intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>Mood change will be measured two times - one time at baseline (before consuming the meal) and another time during the intervention - 60 minutes after consuming the meal. Mood will be measured with the UMACL questionnaire (Matthews et al., 1990) in Arabic. UMACL is a self-report questionnaire which measures the current mood of the subject. Contains 29 statements (such as &quot;I am happy&quot;), in Likert scale of 1 (&quot;absolutely&quot;) to 4 (&quot;not at all&quot;). The higher the score, the better the current mood is.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Insulin levels status</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention, between 30-45 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>Insulin levels status will be measured based on blood samples that will be taken from subjects during the intervention, 30-45 minutes after consuming the meal. Analysis will take place after the data collection stage.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>SCFA levels status</measure>
    <time_frame>During the intervention, between 30-45 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>SCFA levels status will be measured based on blood samples that will be taken from subjects during the intervention, 30-45 minutes after consuming the meal. Analysis will take place after the data collection stage.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>HR change</measure>
    <time_frame>First measurement at baseline, before consuming the meal, and four times during the intervention - 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after consuming the meal</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in heart rate (BPM) will be measured five times - First at baseline (before consuming the meal) and four times during the intervention - 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after consuming the meal.</description>

    <description>Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg) will be measured five times - one time at baseline (before consuming the meal) and four times during the intervention (15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes after consuming the meal).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life habits status</measure>
    <time_frame>During intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>Life habits status will be measured one time during the intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal, using the Nutritional Status Questionnaire (based on the Israeli Ministry of Health 2nd nutrition survey [MABAT], 2017) in Arabic. The questionnaire includes 8 questions (such as &quot;Are you eating breakfast?&quot;), with no cut-off score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Energy drinks consumption status</measure>
    <time_frame>During intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>Energy drinks consumption status will be measured one time during the intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal, using a questionnaire by Attila &amp; Çakir, 2011, in Arabic. The questionnaire includes 9 questions (such as &quot;Do you drink energy drinks?&quot;), with no cut-off score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Caffeine consumption frequency</measure>
    <time_frame>During intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal.</time_frame>
    <description>Caffeine consumption frequency will be measured one time during the intervention, 60 minutes after consuming the meal, using a questionnaire from Harpaz et al., 2016 in Arabic. The questionnaire contains 2 questions (such as &quot;Please choose the products you consumed during the last week&quot;), with no cut-off score.</description>
