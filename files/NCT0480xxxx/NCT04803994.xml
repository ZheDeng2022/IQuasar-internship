  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ABC-HCC trial is a Phase IIIb, randomised, multicenter, open-label study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab versus TACE in patients&#xD;
      with intermediate-stage HCC. Approximately 434 patients in two arms of treatment will be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this phase IIIb study is to test the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab&#xD;
      in combination with bevacizumab compared to TACE in patients with intermediate stage liver&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy objective is to assess the efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      bevacizumab compared to TACE in patients with intermediate stage liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy objective is to further characterize the responses obtained with the&#xD;
      respective therapeutic strategy and to assess the impact of each therapeutic strategy on&#xD;
      liver function over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore the objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of each therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy and their respective impact on Quality of Life and to identify prognostic and&#xD;
      predictive angiogenic and immune related biomarkers (tissue and circulating) for study&#xD;
      endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase IIIb, randomised, multicenter, open-label study. Approximately 434 patients&#xD;
      suffering from intermediate-stage hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled in this trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from up to 60 sites in 10 different countries.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Locoregional therapy with TACE</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Patients will receive initial TACE and - if required to achieve or improve an objective response - a second TACE after 8 weeks (±7 days window). Thereafter, additional TACE can be applied on demand until failure of strategy, participant request, or withdrawal of consent for a maximum of up to 24 months.&#xD;
TACE must be discontinued in cases of technical difficulties making additional TACE impossible.&#xD;
Only conventional TACE (cTACE) and drug-eluting bead TACE (DEB-TACE) approaches are accepted as TACE therapy. However, consistency in the TACE procedure and the use of the chemotherapeutic agent has to be maintained for each individual patient.</description>

             TACE procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;

               -  With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use&#xD;
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for 6 months after&#xD;
                  the last dose of bevacizumab or 1 month after the last TACE procedure. Men must&#xD;
                  refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With pregnant female partners, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during&#xD;
                  the treatment period and for 6 months after the last dose of bevacizumab or 1&#xD;
                  month after the last TACE procedure to avoid exposing the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
