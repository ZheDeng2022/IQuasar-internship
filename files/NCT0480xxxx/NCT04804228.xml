      The main objective of this study is to determine the efficacy of electrical dry needling&#xD;

      active myofascial trigger points in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A double-blind clinical trial will be developed in a sample of 80 subjects with chronic low&#xD;
      back pain. Patients in the experimental group will receive electrical dry needling at the&#xD;
      active myofascial trigger points (PGM) of the quadratus lumbar, multifidus, and iliocostal&#xD;
      muscles (following the PGM maps described by Travell and Simons). The technique will be&#xD;
      performed using needle electrodes, the generated current will be produced by a TENS device&#xD;
      with a frequency of 2 Hz and a pulse width of 250 μs, during 30 min of application. The&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention will be 1 weekly session for a total of 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will perform an ischemic compression technique in active PGM with a time&#xD;
      between 20 seconds and 1 minute until pain inhibition is achieved, and finally, analytical&#xD;
      stretching will be carried out on the quadratus lumbar, multifidus and iliocostal muscles.&#xD;
      The treatment will consist of 1 weekly session for 3 weeks, in addition they will be provided&#xD;
      with a training dossier on postural education in their activities of daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline assessment of the primary and secondary outcome measures will be carried out&#xD;
      before randomization of the participants to the different groups, an immediate post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment (1 day after the last intervention) and an assessment one month after the end of&#xD;
      the intervention ( short-term follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to compare the repercussions of dry electropuncture versus&#xD;
      ischemic compression in active PGM plus stretching in terms of pain, functionality, mobility&#xD;
      of the spine, and quality of life in patients with non-specific chronic low back pain; and&#xD;
      analyze the impact on active myofascial trigger points in terms of pressure tolerance&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
