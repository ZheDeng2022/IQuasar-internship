  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of giving intestinal&#xD;
      transplant patients CD34+ stem cells (the cells that make all the types of blood cells)&#xD;
      obtained from their organ donor's bone marrow. The goal of this is to develop a&#xD;
      post-transplant treatment strategy that controls rejection while reducing the high risk of&#xD;
      infection and malignant disease associated with the high levels of immunosuppression&#xD;
      medication(s) that intestinal and multi-organ transplant patients must take. Infusion of bone&#xD;
      marrow cells from the same donor of the transplanted organ(s) could promote a state called&#xD;
      &quot;mixed chimerism&quot; in which both donor cells and recipient cells coexist in the body with the&#xD;
      ultimate goal of minimizing the amount of immunosuppression medication(s) needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal trauma, congenital abnormalities and ischemic injury cause intestinal damage that&#xD;
      prevents the digestion and absorption of fluids and nutrients essential for life. Intestinal&#xD;
      transplantation is life-saving for patients with complications related to the administration&#xD;
      of intravenous nutrients. Approximately 100-160 intestinal transplants (ITx) are performed in&#xD;
      the US annually. However, patient survival rates are far from optimal, due to high rejection&#xD;
      rates resulting from an immune attack of the recipient against the donor, termed&#xD;
      host-vs-graft (HVG) reactivity The high levels of global immunosuppression used to prevent&#xD;
      rejection come with a high risk of infections and malignant disease (i.e. lymphoma). Thus,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need for a well-tolerated treatment strategy that controls rejection while&#xD;
      reducing these risks. Immune tolerance, in which the immune system regards the donor as&#xD;
      &quot;self&quot; so that long-term graft acceptance is achieved without life-long immunosuppression,&#xD;
      would accomplish this goal . Infusion of bone marrow cells from the same donor of the solid&#xD;
      organs could promote a state called &quot;mixed chimerism&quot; in which both donor cells and recipient&#xD;
      cells coexist in the body. Mixed chimerism has been shown to induce tolerance to the&#xD;
      transplanted organ in animal models and in patients receiving kidney transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose studies to promote tolerance induction in intestinal transplant&#xD;
      recipients by administering donor bone marrow stem cells to promote lasting mixed chimerism.&#xD;
      The investigators' proposal builds on their demonstration that mixed chimerism commonly&#xD;
      occurs in intestinal transplant (ITx) recipients without bone marrow transplant, and that its&#xD;
      presence correlates with reduced rejection rates. However, this mixed chimerism is not&#xD;
      permanent. The investigators have discovered that there are bone marrow stem cells in the&#xD;
      donor intestinal grafts and that some of these survive and enter the bone marrow of the&#xD;
      recipient. This process is facilitated by a phenomenon called a &quot;lymphohematopoietic&#xD;
      graft-vs-host responses (LGVHR)&quot;, in which T lymphocytes from the ITx donor attack recipient&#xD;
      blood-forming cells to make &quot;space&quot; for their own establishment in the bone marrow, but do&#xD;
      not induce GVHD. The investigators have also obtained evidence that this immune response&#xD;
      suppresses rejection of the graft.&#xD;
