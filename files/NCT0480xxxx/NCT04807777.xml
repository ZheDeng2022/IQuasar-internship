  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this open-label, multicenter, Phase II study, the investigators propose to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of ruxolitinib, an orally administered inhibitor of JAK1/2, in solid organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients with advanced cSCC. In a safety lead-in of 6 patients, subjects will&#xD;
      receive ruxolitinib 15mg twice daily (BID). After 4 weeks, if dose-limiting toxicities (DLT)&#xD;
      are observed in 1 or fewer patients, the study will enter stage 1 of the Simon two-stage&#xD;
      design where all subsequent patients will receive a starting dose of ruxolitinib 15mg BID. If&#xD;
      more than 1 DLTs are observed, another cohort of 6 patients will be treated at a dose of 10mg&#xD;
      BID. If less than 2 DLTs are observed at the new dose of 10mg, then the study will proceed to&#xD;
      stage I using this dose; otherwise the study will stop.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 5.4 million individuals in the United States are diagnosed with non-melanoma&#xD;
      skin cancers (NMSC) annually, with the incidence increasing over time. Twenty-five percent&#xD;
      are cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (cSCC), which affect up to 1,350,000 individuals and&#xD;
      result in up to 12,000 deaths annually in the US alone. Immunosuppressed patients are&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to the development of highly aggressive or catastrophic cSCC.&#xD;
      Patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy, such as solid organ transplant recipients&#xD;
      (SOTRs), and HIV/AIDS patients have an estimated 60 to 250-fold increased risk of cSCC&#xD;
      development. In renal SOTRs, cSCC represents over 70% of all malignancies that develop, with&#xD;
      an incidence up to 200 times that of the general population. Post-transplant cSCC occurs at a&#xD;
      younger age and is more aggressive than in non-transplant cohorts, with 30% of cSCC recurring&#xD;
      within 1 year and up to 8% of disease associated with metastasis. The median survival from&#xD;
      diagnosis of metastasis is 3 years.5 Cemiplimab, an anti-PD1 antibody, recently became the&#xD;
      first agent to achieve regulatory approval for the treatment of advanced cSCC; however, due&#xD;
      to the risk of graft rejection, the role of immunological checkpoint blockade in the SOTR&#xD;
      population is extremely limited. Thus, although surgical excision is effective for sporadic&#xD;
      cSCC, there remains a large unmet medical need for novel strategies for treatment and/or&#xD;
      prevention of multiply recurrent, locally advanced, and metastatic cSCC, particularly in&#xD;
      immunosuppressed patients.&#xD;

             10 subjects (i.e., biopsies are required in at least the first 10 enrolled subjects,&#xD;
             or until a goal of 10 study biopsies are obtained). Subjects in whom a biopsy is&#xD;
             technically not feasible or in whom would result in unacceptable risk in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator, may be exempted from the biopsy requirement with discussion with&#xD;
             the principal investigator.&#xD;

             first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously been treated with a JAK inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents concurrently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had recent major surgery within a minimum 4 weeks prior to starting&#xD;
             study treatment, with the exception of surgical placement for vascular access.&#xD;

             that have been treated and have remained stable for at least one month prior to&#xD;
             initiation of study therapy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of strong CYP3A4 or CYP3A4 substrate drugs with a narrow therapeutic&#xD;

             A.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with ruxolitinib. In addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-&#xD;
             suppressive therapy.&#xD;
