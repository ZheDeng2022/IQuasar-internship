  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial identifies the side effects and best dose of pevonedistat when given&#xD;
      together with pembrolizumab in treating mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR)/high-frequency&#xD;
      microsatellite instability (MSI-H) solid tumor that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (metastatic) or has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and cannot&#xD;
      removed by surgery (unresectable). Pevonedistat may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and&#xD;
      may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving pevonedistat and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine safety and phase II dose of pevonedistat in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      (Phase I) II. To assess the efficacy of pevonedistat in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      patients with dMMR/MSI-H cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess additional efficacy endpoints of the combination of pevonedistat and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in dMMR/MSI-H cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of pevonedistat and pembrolizumab in the dMMR/MSI-H patient cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the pharmacodynamics impact of pevonedistat and pembrolizumab on tumor and&#xD;
      immune-related components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Immune context evaluation of tumor microenvironment. II. Determine clinical benefit. III.&#xD;
      Evaluate pevonedistat pharmacokinetics and resistance mechanisms in combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of pevonedistat followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.&#xD;
