      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For newly-diagnosed patients with brain metastasis, conventional whole-brain radiation&#xD;
      therapy (WBRT) might still remain a common palliative management even for those with brain&#xD;
      oligometastases. However, WBRT-related late consequences, particularly a decline in&#xD;
      neurocognitive functions (NCFs), are a major concern. Actually, WBRT-related neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction is usually characterized as deterioration involving learning and memory, in which&#xD;
      the extremely radiosensitive hippocampus indeed plays a critical role. In order to postpone&#xD;
      or mitigate the effect of conventional WBRT-induced neurocognitive impairments, there have&#xD;
      been some strategies and options in clinical practice. Among them, the technique of highly&#xD;
      precise and accurate stereotactic radiosurgery or stereotactic radiotherapy (i.e.,&#xD;
      hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, HS-SRT) might have been widely administered in&#xD;
      irradiating purely focal metastatic foci in cancer patients with a limited number of brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newly-diagnosed cancer patients harboring 1-3 brain metastatic lesions are eligible if they&#xD;
      are still in a fair/good performance status. All recruited patients should receive baseline&#xD;
      brain MRI examination and pre-radiotherapy neurocognitive assessment. Sticking to the&#xD;
      principles of stereotactic radiosurgery/radiotherapy (SRS/SRT), treatment planning will be&#xD;
      designed via the technique of volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to achieve both&#xD;
      satisfactory in-field local control (but assuring of hippocampal avoidance) and a tolerably&#xD;
      low incidence of radiation necrosis, a course of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy&#xD;
      (HF-SRT) is delivered within 2 weeks with a cumulative dose of 3000 - 3500 cGy in 5&#xD;
      fractions. Accordingly, a battery of neuropsychological measures, which includes 7&#xD;
      standardized neuropsychological tests (e.g., executive functions, verbal and non-verbal&#xD;
      memory, working memory, and psychomotor speed), is used to evaluate neurocognitive functions&#xD;
      for our registered patients. The primary outcome measure is cognitive-deterioration-free&#xD;
      survival, which is defined mainly as the time from enrollment to a NCF decline of exceeding&#xD;
      than 1 SD away from the baseline involving at least one of the assessed NCF tests.&#xD;
      Additionally, patients who expire before 6 months or are alive but fail to undergo all the&#xD;
      neurocognitive testing administered would also be defined as suffering from cognitive&#xD;
      deterioration. There are quite a few secondary endpoints of interest, including the patterns&#xD;
      of (CNS) failure, actual local control rates, time to (CNS) progression, and cumulative&#xD;
      incidence of radiation necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective neurocognitive study aims to examine thoroughly the impact of the technique&#xD;
      of highly focal brain irradiation administered with a course of hypofractionated SRT&#xD;
      delivered to brain metastatic lesions merely (but sparing hippocampal structures), on&#xD;
      neurocognitive performance, time to (CNS) progression, and patterns of (CNS) failure, in&#xD;
      patients with brain oligometastases and a fair/good performance status. It is anticipated&#xD;
      that (in-field) local control would be durable and that neurocognitive outcomes would also be&#xD;
      maintained favorably. Moreover, we also expect that the patterns of (CNS) failure and the&#xD;
      individual time to progression will be clearly demonstrated in this prospective longitudinal&#xD;
      neurocognitive study.&#xD;
