  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Objective of this study is to compare pain levels in women undergoing office-based&#xD;
      hysteroscopies using Virtual Reality versus control in a randomized control prospective&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to see if virtual reality can decrease pain intensity during&#xD;
      office hysteroscopies using a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary aim will be to monitor heart rate for patients using virtual reality versus the&#xD;
      controls during the procedure. Another secondary aim will be to time the length of the&#xD;
      procedure as it is possible if pain perception is reduced, the procedure can be completed&#xD;
      faster. Lastly, we would also want to evaluate both patient and surgeon satisfaction of the&#xD;
      procedure with or without virtual reality by using a satisfaction questionnaire to assess for&#xD;
      patients satisfaction with the procedure, with the VR intervention, perceived realism of VR&#xD;
      game, and measure simulator sickness related to the VR game.&#xD;
