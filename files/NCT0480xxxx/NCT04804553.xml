    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The CHAQ will be used to assess physical ability and functional status of participants as well as their quality of life.&#xD;
The CHAQ consists of 20 items concerning difficulty in performing the following 8 activities of daily living: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping, and activities. Subjects will choose from 4 responses ranging from 0 (without any difficulty) to 3 (unable to do). A lower score indicates a better outcome. The subject's/parent's/guardian's assessment of arthritis-related pain will also be assessed on a VAS that is part of the CHAQ.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Juvenile Arthritis Disease Activity Score (JADAS) at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>JADAS is a composite score of participant well-being visual analog scale (VAS) score, physician global assessment (PGA) VAS score, active joint count, and laboratory marker of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]).&#xD;
There are 4 components of the JADAS:&#xD;
Active joint count (27 joints)&#xD;
PGA (0 to 100) measured on a VAS&#xD;
Patient/parent global assessment of well-being (0 to 100) measured on a VAS&#xD;
CRP (normalized to a 0 to 10 scale)&#xD;
The active joint count is taken from 27 joints: cervical spine, elbows, wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal interphalangeal joints, hips, knees and ankles.&#xD;
The total score is calculated by adding all 4 components of the JADAS. The score for the JADAS ranges from 0 to 57 where a lower score indicates a better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants who Experience Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) Flares at Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PsA flares are defined as more than or equal to 30 percent worsening in at least 3 of 6 American College of Rheumatology Pediatric (ACR Pedi) core set variables with a more than or equal to 30 percent improvement in not more than 1 of 6 ACR Pedi core set variables.</description>

    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)-75 Response at Week 16 for Participants With a Baseline Psoriasis Body Surface Area (BSA) ≥ 3 percent</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity.&#xD;
The PASI score is determined only for subjects whose BSA involved by psoriasis is&#xD;
≥3 percent. PASI scores range from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity. Erythema, thickness, and scaling are scored on a scale of 0 (none) to 4 (very severe) on the 4 anatomic regions of the body: head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs. Degree of involvement on each of the 4 anatomic regions is scored on a scale of 0 (no involvement) to 6 (90 percent &lt; 100 percent involvement). The sum of scores for erythema, thickness, and scaling is multiplied by the degree of involvement for each anatomic region, and then multiplied by a constant corresponding to the region's percentage of BSA. The resultant values for each anatomic region are then summed to yield the PASI score.</description>

    <description>The C-SSRS is an assessment tool that evaluates suicidal ideation and behavior. Number of participants with suicidal ideation or behavior is defined as the number of participants who answer &quot;yes&quot; at any time during the study (up to end of safety follow-up, Week 56) to one of the 10 categories:&#xD;
Category 1: Wish to be dead Category 2: Non-specific active suicidal thoughts Category 3: Active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act Category 4: Active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan Category 5: Active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent Category 6: Preparatory acts or behavior Category 7: Aborted attempt Category 8: Interrupted attempt Category 9: Actual attempt (non-fatal) Category 10: Completed suicide</description>
