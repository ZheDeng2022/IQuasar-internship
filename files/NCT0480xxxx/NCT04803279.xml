  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is part of the Post Market Clinical Follow (PMCF) activity. The investigational&#xD;
      device is the CE-marked Ponto 3 SuperPower (available on the market since December 2016)&#xD;
      already fitted to the subjects, and data is collected retrospectively from clinical routine&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a retrospective study. Therefore there will be no study visits for treatment or&#xD;
      follow-up in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject inclusion for this clinical investigation will be performed among subjects who has&#xD;
      been fitted with the Ponto 3 SuperPower. To have a wide representative selection of subjects,&#xD;
      enrollment will be spread over the 4 years since the device was available on the market since&#xD;
      December 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endpoints in the study will investigate the improvement of hearing with the Ponto 3&#xD;
      SuperPower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected from the subjects in the time period from the clinical routine&#xD;
      visit where the Ponto 3 SuperPower where fitted or just prior, and from the clinical routine&#xD;
      visit following the fitting, where audiologic fitting follow-up procedures are performed&#xD;
      (approximately 3 months).&#xD;
