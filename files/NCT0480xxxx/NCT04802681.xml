  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the current gold standard for correct decision making with&#xD;
      respect to revascularization in the catheterization laboratory. FFR is measured by using a&#xD;
      pressure guidewire equipped with a pressure sensor, positioned distal to the stenosis under&#xD;
      investigation. A newly developed pressure wire using open wire technology has recently become&#xD;
      commercially available. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the Wirecath&#xD;
      pressure guidewire can be used as standard pressure guidewire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the device will be investigated by comparing Wirecath FFR measurements&#xD;
      with the measurements of another regular sensor-tipped pressure guidewires during&#xD;
      simultaneous FFR measurements in the same vessel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FFR is a lesion-specific pressure-derived index of functional severity, defined as the&#xD;
      maximum myocardial blood flow in the presence of an epicardial stenosis compared with the&#xD;
      maximum flow in the hypothetical absence of the stenosis. FFR is measured by advancing a&#xD;
      pressure guidewire into the coronary artery distal to the lesion under investigation and&#xD;
      maintained in that position. Distal coronary pressure (Pd) and aortic pressure (Pa) are&#xD;
      measured simultaneously while inducing steady state maximum hyperemia. FFR is defined as the&#xD;
      lowest value of Pd/Pa achieved during maximum hyperemia. An FFR value = or &lt; 0.80 indicates&#xD;
      the presence of myocardial ischemia and indicates PCI is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing 0.014&quot; wires with pressure measurement capabilities have been available for more&#xD;
      than 20 years. Improvements have been done over time, but they are still regarded as inferior&#xD;
      to ordinary guidewires when it comes to maneuverability and general guidewire properties.&#xD;
      This is attributed to the microelectronics that are needed to facilitate the pressure&#xD;
      measurements in these wires. These existing wires also have issues with signal stability&#xD;
      which is often referred to as 'drift'. Drift is an electronical phenomenon that leads to a&#xD;
      slow progressive change in the pressure value over time. a not entirely reliable signal&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relatively new pressure guidewire, Wirecath, is an equivalent device to the currently&#xD;
      commercially available pressure guidewires. In comparative bench tests it has shown very good&#xD;
      maneuverability. Moreover due to the 'open wire' technology (and thus lack of&#xD;
      microelectronics throughout the wire), the Wirecath has very stable signal properties and is,&#xD;
      according to physical law and bench testing, immune against a hydrostatic error and less&#xD;
      affected by drifting of the signal, which are limitations with current pressure guidewires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to examine and compare the pressure measurements of two commercially&#xD;
      available pressure guidewires (Abbott and Cavis Technologies) by simultaneously measuring FFR&#xD;
      in the same coronary artery with two different pressure guidewires.&#xD;
