      The variable clinical outcome of patients with G2 &amp; G3 well diff GEP-NETs makes the selection&#xD;
      of an optimal treatment strategy challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial data suggests that high DOTATATE uptake and low FDG uptake are suggestive of low&#xD;
      grade disease, with an indolent course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, low DT uptake and high FDG uptake are suggestive of high-grade/ aggressive&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G2/3 GEP NETs may be biologically diverse; clinically relevant cohort for dual-tracer PET&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the distribution of PETNET scores derived from 18F-FDG &amp; 68Ga-DT PET in&#xD;
           patients with G2 &amp; G3 well diff GEP-NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the proportion of patients in whom the addition of 18F-FDG PET data results&#xD;
           in a change in planned clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess intra-individual variability in SSTR expression &amp; glucose metabolism (as seen on DT&#xD;
      and FDG PET) across different tumor sites within the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) To determine whether a correlation exists between tumor texture features on 68Ga-DT &amp; FDG&#xD;
      PET to tumor grade and Ki 67 index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) To assess for an association between tumor texture features on 68Ga-DT PET and glucose&#xD;
      metabolism; and/or an association between tumor texture features on FDG PET and SSTR&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;

      The variable clinical outcome of patients with G2 and G3 well differentiated GEP-NETs makes&#xD;
      the selection of an optimal treatment strategy challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject with 68Ga-DOTATATE uptake on all lesions without FDG uptake is likely to have&#xD;
      low-grade, metabolically inactive disease, leading to an indolent disease course and may also&#xD;
      be a predictive biomarker in subjects being considered for PRRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, avidity on 18F-FDG PET/CT and non-avidity on 68Ga-DOTATATE may indicate a&#xD;
      high-grade NET, and would predict resistance to PRRT, suggesting that a more &quot;aggressive&quot;&#xD;
      approach with systemic chemotherapy might be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the prospective assessment of PETNET score in patients with G2 or G3 GEP NETs,&#xD;
      which may be biologically diverse is the most clinically relevant group for dual-tracer PET&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the distribution of PETNET scores derived from 18F-FDG and 68Ga-DOTATATE&#xD;
           PET/CT in patients with G2 and G3 well differentiated GEP-NETs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the proportion of patients in whom the addition of 18F-FDG PET/CT data&#xD;
           results in a change in planned clinical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mTo determine whether there is intra-individual variability in somatostatin receptor&#xD;
           expression and glucose metabolism (as seen on DOTATATE PET and FDG PET, respectively)&#xD;
           across different tumor sites within the same patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether a correlation exists between tumor texture features on&#xD;
           68Ga-DOTATATE PET and FDG PET to tumor grade and Ki67 index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess if an association exists between tumor texture features on 68Ga-DOTATATE PET&#xD;
           and glucose metabolism; and/or an association between tumor texture features on FDG PET&#xD;
           and somatostatin receptor expression.&#xD;
