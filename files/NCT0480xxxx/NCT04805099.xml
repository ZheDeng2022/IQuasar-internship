  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with cancer and concurrent autoimmune diseases (AID) have been universally excluded&#xD;
      from clinical trials evaluating immunotherapy. Data on the safety and efficacy of checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors in patients with underlying AID is limited. The investigators performed a&#xD;
      retrospective multicenter review of medical records of patients with diverse tumor types and&#xD;
      underlying AID who received checkpoint inhibitors at Departments of Oncology, affiliated with&#xD;
      the Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group (HeCOG). The primary endpoint was progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS).&#xD;
