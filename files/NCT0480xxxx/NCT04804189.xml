      Modifiable risk factors for youth firearm injury and death include unsafe storage of a&#xD;
      firearm in the home, prior victimization/aggression, substance use, and depressive symptoms,&#xD;
      yet there are few partnerships with firearm owners and firearm safety training programs to&#xD;
      implement effective, non-policy-based preventive interventions for youth firearm injury. This&#xD;
      study will conduct a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of The Reframe, a bystander intervention designed to promote changes in firearm injury&#xD;
      prevention norms, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors among a sample of 50 4-H Shooting&#xD;
      Sports Club communities comprising both adults and youth. This project is designed to build&#xD;
      the evidence base for interventions that promote safe behaviors related to youth firearm use&#xD;
      and injury prevention and advance firearm injury prevention science by supporting a&#xD;
      synergistic partnership between well-established firearm injury, suicide, and violence&#xD;
      prevention researchers and the national 4-H Shooting Sports community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Firearm injury and mortality is a major public health concern for American youth age 1-19.&#xD;
      Only motor vehicle crashes kill more American youth than firearms. In 2018 alone, 1729&#xD;
      American youth died from firearm injuries (50% firearm homicide, 42% firearm suicide) and&#xD;
      over 6500 youth were treated in an emergency department for firearm injury; these injuries&#xD;
      have major long-term consequences for youth and their families. Approximately one-third of&#xD;
      American youth live in a home with a firearm. Risk factors for youth firearm injury and&#xD;
      death, such as unsafe home storage of a firearm, prior victimization/aggression, substance&#xD;
      use, and depressive symptoms, can be modified. Community partnerships are essential for&#xD;
      developing and enacting effective change in injury risk factors, particularly for youth. Due&#xD;
      to the fraught political landscape and lack of research funding, partnerships with firearm&#xD;
      owners and firearm safety training programs to create and disseminate effective,&#xD;
      non-policy-based preventive interventions for youth firearm injury are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bystander intervention (BI) is an intervention framework rooted in social psychological&#xD;
      theories such as the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), with proven efficacy and effectiveness&#xD;
      targeting both individual and community behavior change. &quot;The Reframe&quot; is a three-part,&#xD;
      already-piloted intervention that uses the BI framework and TPB mechanisms to promote&#xD;
      community norms change about firearm safety, BI, and harm reduction techniques (e.g., safe&#xD;
      storage, reducing access to lethal means, conflict resolution). Recognizing that BI is most&#xD;
      rigorous when led by credible messengers, The Reframe uses instructional, peer-to-peer, and&#xD;
      social-media strategies in conjunction with community organizations that are deeply connected&#xD;
      to firearm safety efforts. Pilot data supports The Reframe's acceptability and feasibility in&#xD;
      changing firearm owners' norms and behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The necessary next step in this intervention development is to evaluate its effectiveness&#xD;
      using a randomized, controlled study design. Our community partner, the National 4-H Shooting&#xD;
      Sports Program, is a national leader and trusted messenger for firearm safety. Across the&#xD;
      United States, 20,000 trained adult Club Leaders, 5,000 Teen Ambassadors, and 450,000 youth&#xD;
      Shooting Sports participants (age 8-18) learn marksmanship, and safe and responsible use of&#xD;
      firearms, through its structured curriculum. Leaders from 4-H are excited to implement and&#xD;
      study The Reframe among their Shooting Sports Clubs and communities to reduce youth firearm&#xD;
      injury and mortality risk. Our research team will evaluate The Reframe's effectiveness,&#xD;
      compared to usual 4-H training, in changing firearm injury prevention norms, attitudes,&#xD;
      behavioral intention, and practice among a sample of fifty 4-H Shooting Sports Club&#xD;
      communities, via a Type I Hybrid randomized, controlled effectiveness trial. Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Refinement and Planning (Year 1): Adapt The Reframe for the 4-H Shooting Sports Club context&#xD;
      Aim 1: Conduct a series of key informant interviews with an advisory panel of 20 key&#xD;
      stakeholders (teen and adult 4-H Shooting Sports leaders representing a diverse group of&#xD;
      communities and 4-H experience) to ensure The Reframe addresses 4-H-specific issues of&#xD;
      acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Delivery (Years 2-3): Conduct a hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial&#xD;
      of The Reframe with fifty 4-H Shooting Sports Clubs across the United States. For each&#xD;
      intervention Club, we will engage one Adult Site Champion and one Teen Ambassador in a&#xD;
      kickoff meeting; provide materials to incorporate into standard 4-H curricula; support&#xD;
      community and social-media events; and provide ongoing technical support. Evaluations will be&#xD;
      conducted at 0, 3, and 6 months and via social media analytics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2A: Evaluate The Reframe's effectiveness, compared to usual training, in changing&#xD;
      individual- and community-level, proximal and distal behavioral outcomes related to firearm&#xD;
      injury prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2B: Examine barriers and facilitators to implementation of The Reframe intervention using&#xD;
      a mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2C: (Exploratory) Explore injury patterns among all 50 communities using population-level&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will advance the science of firearm injury prevention in youth in the context of a&#xD;
      real-world partnership between well-established firearm injury, suicide, and violence&#xD;
      prevention researchers and the national 4-H Shooting Sports Program to conduct a rigorous&#xD;
      experimental evaluation of a promising universal primary prevention program. Our long-term&#xD;
      goals, consistent with CDC priorities, are to build an evidence base for best practices for&#xD;
      individual- and community-level interventions that are easy to implement; to promote safe&#xD;
      behaviors around firearm use and injury prevention, thereby saving lives; to meld best&#xD;
      scientific practice with deep community-based expertise; and to create a model that can be&#xD;
      scaled across 4-H's network, which reaches nearly 6 million youth across the nation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>We will enroll fifty 4-H Shooting Sports Clubs to participate in a Type I Hybrid Effectiveness Trial. All Clubs will receive standard national-level training and curricula. Clubs randomized to &quot;The Reframe&quot; intervention will add additional training to enable Club Leaders to integrate The Reframe methods into their standard activities. We will provide ongoing technical support to all intervention Clubs. In all enrolled communities, we will measure: (1) short- and intermediate-term outcomes among both Club-level adult and teen leaders and the Club's youth participants and their primary caregivers; (2) reach and tone of conversations on social media; and (3) injury incidence.</intervention_model_description>

    <ipd_description>We will provide an open dataset containing anonymized IPD that results in a publication, along with open code from our analyses, and open access to research articles. The PIs will document collected data using the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI), which is recommended by the national data archive: the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). Audio interviews of participants consenting to be recorded will be transcribed and de-identified; audio recordings will not be available for analysis due to concerns about re-identifiability. Transcripts will only be available with participant consent, and de-identified transcripts would be made available to other researchers via a Data Use Agreement (DUA) facilitated by ICPSR.&#xD;
We will deposit the aggregate data sets, survey and semi-structured interview instruments, analysis code, NVivo codes and associated codebook and relevant README documentation files in the ICPSR data archive.</ipd_description>
