      The study was conducted to determine and compare the effects of the therapeutic exercises and&#xD;
      stabilization exercises given to the patient after the manual therapy session on pain, neck&#xD;
      range of motion, daily living activities and quality of life.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>1 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was developed to transform values which cannot be measured numerically to a numerical form. The patient is instructed to mark the severity of pain on a line marked at one end as 0=no pain to 10=intolerable pain, thereby providing the level of pain in a numerical form</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Range of motion</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Devices to measure range of motion in the joints of the body include the Goniometer and Inclinometer which use a stationary arm, protractor, fulcrum, and movement arm to measure angle from axis of the joint. We measured neck flexio, extantion and rotation</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Lateral Scapular Shift Test</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>This test involves measuring the distance from the inferior angle of the scapula to the nearest vertebral spinous process using a tape measure or goniometer in three positions: shoulder in neutral, shoulder at 40-45 degrees of coronal plane abduction with hands resting on hips, and the shoulder at 90 degrees abduction with the arms in full internal rotation</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Disability Index</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (NDI) is a self-report questionnaire used to determine how neck pain affects a patient's daily life and to assess the self-rated disability of patients with neck pain</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Bournemouth Neck Pain Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Neck Bournemouth Questionnaire (NBQ) was created by Bolton and Humphreys due to the necessity of an evaluation measure to various health domains, such as pain, function, incapacity and psychological and social aspects of patients with neck pathologies. This tool is easily applied, reproducible and responsive to clinical alterations, which makes it adequate to be used for scientific research and clinical practice to monitor the pathology progression and to assist treatment planning.</description>
