  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acquired hemophilia A is a rare condition of hemostasis secondary to the development of&#xD;
      antibodies against factor VIII. This is a potentially serious pathology that can be&#xD;
      life-threatening due to the major risk of bleeding caused by the sometimes drastic decrease&#xD;
      in the level of circulating factor VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pathology occurs overwhelmingly in elderly subjects or, more rarely, in young women,&#xD;
      during the postpartum period. It appears idiopathic in 50% of cases and associated, for the&#xD;
      other cases, with underlying pathologies such as autoimmune pathologies (rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      and bullous pemphigoid in particular) and neoplasias, or with a particular circumstance&#xD;
      represented by the post -partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between this autoimmune pathology and its association with pathologies of the&#xD;
      same type or with circumstances involving the immune system, suggests that common mechanisms&#xD;
      could favor its emergence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore proposes to study lymphocyte populations and subpopulations as well as&#xD;
      Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and the cytokine profile, which are abnormal in a large part&#xD;
      of autoimmune pathologies.&#xD;

        Patients with acquired hemophilia A will be recruited prospectively when diagnosed with&#xD;
        acquired hemophilia A and will be followed in the study until recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with constitutional hemophilia A will be recruited prospectively. They should be&#xD;
        over 50 years old and have severe or moderate hemophilia A, and not be taking any treatment&#xD;
        that could interfere with the immune system or inflammatory markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Population of control subjects without coagulation abnormalities, over 60 years of age and&#xD;
        not taking any treatment likely to interfere with the immune system or inflammatory&#xD;
        markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patient population with inflammatory pathology will include subjects with an inflammatory&#xD;
        pathology likely, according to the literature, to be associated with acquired hemophilia A&#xD;
        and, in particular patients with rheumatoid arthritis, if possible at diagnosis and not&#xD;
        taking any treatment likely to interfere with the disease. immune system or inflammatory&#xD;
