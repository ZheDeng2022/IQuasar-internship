  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of supraphysiologic oxygen (hyperoxia)&#xD;
      on myocardial function in anaesthetized patients undergoing non-cardiac vascular surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 110 patients with either proven coronary artery disease (CAD) or two or more risk&#xD;
      factors for CAD undergoing elective or non-emergent non-cardiac vascular surgery will be&#xD;
      recruited. Three blood samples for levels of myocardial biomarkers will be obtained at&#xD;
      different perioperative time points (before anaesthesia induction, 2 hours after skin closure&#xD;
      and 24 hours after the end of the surgery). The three myocardial biomarkers investigated are&#xD;
      high-sensitive Troponin T (hsTnT), N-terminal (NT)-pro hormone BNP (NT-proBNP) and heart-type&#xD;
      fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP). In the timeframe shortly after the induction of&#xD;
      anaesthesia and prior to the start of surgery, myocardial strain as a marker of cardiac&#xD;
      function will be measured by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Echocardiography&#xD;
      measurements will be acquired at two different oxygen states for each patient.The fraction of&#xD;
      inspired oxygen (FiO2) will be adjusted to reach a normoxaemic state (FiO2=0.3) and a&#xD;
      hyperoxic state (FiO2=0.8). Patients will be randomized to which oxygen level is investigated&#xD;
      first. Thereafter, the patients are again randomly assigned to either the normoxaemic or the&#xD;
      hyperoxic state for the remainder of the perioperative treatment until 2 hours after skin&#xD;
      closure. Surgery will be performed as planned by the treating team. Differences in the&#xD;
      perioperative levels of myocardial biomarkers at the different time points and their dynamics&#xD;
      will be assessed. Echocardiography images will be analyzed in a blinded manner for cardiac&#xD;
      function and systolic and diastolic strain parameters. The results will help&#xD;
      anaesthesiologists to better weigh risks and benefits when selecting an inspired oxygen&#xD;
      fraction in such patients, and will help to evaluate hyperoxia as a risk factor for&#xD;
      myocardial injury.&#xD;
