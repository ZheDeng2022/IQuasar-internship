  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is a major crisis worldwide with rates projected to continue to increase. There is&#xD;
      currently a dearth of novel pharmacologic treatment options for suicide available on the&#xD;
      market. The endocannabinoid system has been recently shown to be associated with mood&#xD;
      disorders including suicidality. The aim of the study is to determine whether treatment with&#xD;
      Nabilone is capable of reducing suicidal ideation in adults after 3 days.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Suicidal Ideation and Behavior as assessed by an abbreviated version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, day 3</time_frame>
    <description>For the abbreviated, six-question version of the CSSRS, total scores range from 0 to 6 with a higher score indicating greater suicidal ideation and behavior.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Depression as assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The MADRS is a ten item instrument, with each of the ten items rated on a scale of 0 to 6, giving a total score range of 0 to 60. A higher score indicates greater depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Suicidal Ideation as assessed by the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The SSI is a nineteen item measure of current suicidal ideation and intention, with each item rated on a scale of 0 to 2, giving a total score range of 0 to 38. A higher score indicates greater suicidal ideation and intention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety as assessed by the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, day 3</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 is a seven item instrument, with each of the 7 items is scored from 0 to 3, giving a total score range of 0 to 21. A higher score indicates greater anxiety.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Biomarkers</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, day 3</time_frame>
    <description>To determine whether treatment with Nabilone would lead to changes in the level of serum biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines; and their association with its antisuicidal and antidepressant effects.</description>
