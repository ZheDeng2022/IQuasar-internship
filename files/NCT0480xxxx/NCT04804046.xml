  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is a lifelong incurable condition that causes inflammation of the&#xD;
      intestinal tract of humans. The exact cause of CD is unknown, but genetics, diet, and the gut&#xD;
      microbiome are all thought to play a major role. Many patients with CD will require surgery&#xD;
      to remove affected portions of the gut, with ileocecal resections being the most common&#xD;
      procedure performed. Regrettably, there is up to an 85% chance that disease returns to the&#xD;
      surgical site. Strong immune suppressive medications may help to prevent disease relapse.&#xD;
      However, patients are then at risk of serious side effects. Currently, no ideal post-op care&#xD;
      exists for CD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess whether a post-op synbiotic therapy (i.e. probiotics plus dietary&#xD;
      fiber) prevents disease relapse in participants with CD. To test this, participants will&#xD;
      consume probiotics (strains of bifidobacteria) before their surgery and then probiotics plus&#xD;
      fiber supplements after surgery. Probiotics are live bacteria that have been shown to reduce&#xD;
      inflammation of the gut. Fiber is given after surgery to help promote beneficial bacterial&#xD;
      taxa and prevent less favorable bacterial taxa from triggering CD relapse. Patients will take&#xD;
      the supplements for 6 months following surgery. They will be seen monthly to assess the&#xD;
      effects of treatment on quality of life, symptoms of disease recurrence, inflammatory&#xD;
      markers, and the gut microbiome. All patients will also undergo a colonoscopy at the end of&#xD;
      the study to check for endoscopic reoccurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by chronic intestinal inflammation and commonly&#xD;
      involves the ileocecal region. Due to disease complications, many patients with CD require an&#xD;
      ileocecal resection (ICR). However, disease often recurs postoperatively at the surgical&#xD;
      anastomosis, with endoscopic recurrence rates as high as 85%. While the immunosuppressant&#xD;
      infliximab has been shown to reduce endoscopic disease recurrence, it was not shown to&#xD;
      prevent clinical relapse. The timing of infliximab treatment might be critical, as starting&#xD;
      infliximab immediately after surgery rather than at the time of post-surgical recurrence&#xD;
      resulted in 1-year remission rates of 92% and 57%, respectively. Currently, no ideal&#xD;
      postoperative care exists for patients with CD. Thus, new approaches are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gut microbiome has long been thought to play a causative role in the high rates of CD&#xD;
      recurrence following surgical resection. Immediately following ICR, a state of inflammation&#xD;
      and oxidative stress promotes aerotolerant microbes at the expense of beneficial short-chain&#xD;
      fatty acid (SCFA)-producing anaerobes. The mucosal microbial composition in CD patients at&#xD;
      the time of surgery is predictive of future disease relapse. Specifically, patients with a&#xD;
      dominance of SCFA-producing anaerobic bacteria in the ileal mucosa at the time of surgical&#xD;
      resection are more likely to remain in remission compared with patients which have a&#xD;
      dominance of aerotolerant bacteria. Nutritional adjuncts based on probiotics or prebiotics&#xD;
      could be applied to shift gut microbial imbalances towards SCFA-producers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though research is limited, probiotics containing bifidobacteria but not lactobacilli have&#xD;
      been shown to lessen mucosal inflammation and recurrence rates when provided immediately post&#xD;
      ICR. In a previous clinical trial, it was found that patients with CD that started the&#xD;
      probiotic VSL#3 (4 Lactobacillus; 3 Bifidobacterium; 1 Streptococcus strains) immediately&#xD;
      post surgery had reduced mucosal inflammatory cytokines and lower recurrence rates when&#xD;
      compared to patients that started VSL#3 at 3-months post surgery. A smaller trial using VSL#3&#xD;
      in combination with antibiotic treatment also showed lower rates of endoscopic recurrence at&#xD;
      3- and 12-months following surgery. These results suggest that probiotic composition and&#xD;
      treatment timing are critical for efficacy. While synergy between probiotics and prebiotics&#xD;
      might improve clinical effects, the efficacy of synergistic synbiotics remains unknown. The&#xD;
      aims of this study are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1. Perform a parallel two-arm, randomized controlled exploratory trial in CD patients&#xD;
      undergoing ICR to determine the safety and tolerability of a synbiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study in patients with CD undergoing ileocecal resection to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of supplementation with a synbiotic preparation that contains a mixture of&#xD;
      resistant starch type 2 (HiMaize 260; Ingredion), arabinoxylan (Naxus; Bioactive), and&#xD;
      galactooligosaccharide (Vivinal; FrieslandCampina) (24g/d) fibers plus probiotic bacteria&#xD;
      (Bifidobacterium longum spp. longum R0175, Bifidobacterium animalis spp. Lafti B94,&#xD;
      Bifidobacterium bifidum R0071; Lallemand Health Solutions) (3x10^9 CFU/d). Participants will&#xD;
      be given the probiotics 2 days prior to surgery and then the synbiotic will both be given 7&#xD;
      days after surgery and will be consumed daily for 6 months. Digestible maltodextrin will be&#xD;
      used as a placebo control (Maltodextrin GLOBE Plus 15; Ingredion). A total of 36 volunteers&#xD;
      will be enrolled, stratified by sex, and randomized to one of 2 groups via computer-generated&#xD;
      numbers, as well as blinded to their group allocation to reduce bias. Safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of synbiotic (primary outcome) will be determined by the percentage of participants who&#xD;
      experience treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events. Symptom and quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaires will also be used to evaluate tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2. Determine if synbiotic therapy attenuates mucosal and systemic inflammation and&#xD;
      reduces rates of disease relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each month, clinical recurrence will be evaluated by Harvey Bradshaw Index and C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, serum cytokines (TNF-Î±, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10), intestinal barrier markers (LPS,&#xD;
      LPS-binding protein, and zonulin), and fecal calprotectin levels will be measured. At&#xD;
      6-months, endoscopic recurrence will be determined by Rutgeerts Index and biopsies will be&#xD;
      taken for the assessment of mucosal inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3. Evaluate the impact on compositional and functional features of the fecal microbiota&#xD;
      and to characterize associations between clinical and microbial outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal samples will be collected each month for the characterization of the microbiota by 16S&#xD;
      rRNA gene sequencing. Fecal concentrations of SCFAs and bile acids will also be determined as&#xD;
      functional measures of the gut microbiota. Associations between clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      microbiota features will be assessed to identify signatures that predict the synbiotic&#xD;
      impact.&#xD;
