  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Data from clinical trials suggest that SurVaxM administered as a single agent, or in&#xD;
      combination with standard glioblastoma chemotherapy treatment regimens to patients with&#xD;
      recurrent or newly diagnosed glioblastoma, is generally well tolerated and may increase&#xD;
      progression free survival and overall survival in some patients&#xD;

    <description>Each participant will receive 4 doses of SVN53-67/M57-KLH (SurVaxM) spaced two weeks apart. This phase of treatment is known as the prime-boost phase and will take 6 weeks to complete. After completion of the prime-boost phase of treatment, the participant will receive a dose ofSVN53-67/M57-KLH (SurVaxM) every 3 months for up to two years</description>

             clinical trial for their glioblastoma, but who meet required eligibility criteria&#xD;
             listed herein and,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Roswell Park patients with glioblastoma who have completed participation in a&#xD;
             nonrandomized clinical trial of SurVaxM, but who wish to continue to receive SurVaxM&#xD;
             as part of their ongoing care, and who meet all other eligibility criteria listed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients at institutions other than Roswell Park who have completed treatment on a&#xD;
             nonrandomizedclinical trial of SurVaxM at their participating institution, but who&#xD;

             or has completed participation in another non-randomized clinical trial of SurVaxM for&#xD;
             glioblastoma and is off study but wishes to receive SurVaxM as part of his/her&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
