  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to implement a comprehensive Pediatrician Wellbeing Program&#xD;
      initiated through and aligning with departmental faculty development and mentorship processes&#xD;
      and goals. The Investigators hypothesize that a wellbeing intervention that incorporates an&#xD;
      innovative health coaching model to cultivate individual behavior change supportive of one's&#xD;
      own and others' wellbeing will lead to improvements in self-reported wellbeing.&#xD;

      The investigators hypothesize that a wellbeing intervention that incorporates an innovative&#xD;
      health coaching model to cultivate individual behavior change supportive of one's own and&#xD;
      others' wellbeing can be implemented using existing institutional infrastructure and will&#xD;
      lead to improvements in self-reported wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a nonrandomized pilot study of a convenience sample. Participants will be assigned to&#xD;
      1 of 2 coaches, based upon availability of schedules. Participants who perform research will&#xD;
      be assigned to the remote coach whenever possible to avoid potential concerns with the&#xD;
      internal coach's dual role as Administrative Director of the Children's Research Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this pilot study (up to 30) was selected for feasibility and not power.&#xD;
      This study is funded for 1-year and study participation is for 6-months. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted at a single site; the University of North Carolina Department of Pediatrics Chapel&#xD;
      Hill. Assistant, Associate and Full Professors, tenure-track or fixed-term, on the UNC main&#xD;
      campus are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Pediatric Wellbeing Program consists of coaching sessions from a certified National Board&#xD;
      for Health and Wellness Coach (NBHWC) through the National Board of Medical Examiners. The&#xD;
      NBHWC pioneered science-based training, education, and research of health and wellness&#xD;
      coaches over the past 15 years. NBHWC became an accredited institution through National Board&#xD;
      of Medical Examiners in 2016, providing certification through examination. By using&#xD;
      NBHWC-certified coaches, the investigators are adhering to a standard and measured&#xD;
      foundational competencies: the knowledge, tasks and skills essential to the practice of&#xD;
      health and wellness coaching. Coaches will assist participants in constructing their&#xD;
      Wellbeing-Individual Development Plan (Wellbeing-IDP). The Wellbeing-IDP is designed to&#xD;
      assist with identifying the participant's vision, goals, and plan for wellbeing; assess&#xD;
      current wellbeing with the WHO-5 to identify areas where they have high wellbeing and areas&#xD;
      they need to develop; secure support and accountability (e.g., UNC resources, familial, peer,&#xD;
      social, professional); and create a timeline for what they want to accomplish when.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As needed, faculty will also receive up to 5 additional coaching sessions from a certified&#xD;
      health coach via video conferencing. All coaching sessions will use principles for health&#xD;
      coaching, including brief motivational interviewing, self-empowerment and determination,&#xD;
      transtheoretical model of stages of change, mindset, sense making, and making SMART goals&#xD;
      (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Timely).&#xD;
