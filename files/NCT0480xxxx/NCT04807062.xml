  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous ICBG and bone tamp methods are often applied to manage depressed tibial plateau&#xD;
      fracture (DTPF), but previous iliac bone harvesting and bone tamp techniques remain&#xD;
      controversial. The purpose of this study is to describe and evaluate the technique of using&#xD;
      structural bicortical autologous iliac crest bone-graft (ICBG) combined with tunnel bone&#xD;
      tamps method (TBTM) in treating DTPFs.&#xD;
