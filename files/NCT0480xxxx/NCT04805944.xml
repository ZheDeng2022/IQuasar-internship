    <textblock>
      This is an interventional phase IV trial enrolling HIV-infected patients treated by&#xD;
      dolutegravir or bictegravir-based combined antiretroviral therapy, and patients with a&#xD;
      planned shift to a dolutegravir or bictegravir-based combined antiretroviral therapy, that&#xD;
      aims at understanding the individual response to dolutegravir and bictegravir, in terms of&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of our research project is to better define the inter-individual&#xD;
      variability in terms of clinical and biological response towards Integrase Strand Transfer&#xD;
      Inhibitors, an important ARV drug class used in the treatment of HIV infection. We aim at&#xD;
      identifying predictors of drug efficacy and toxicity, which are eagerly awaited by clinicians&#xD;
      as INSTIs are now prescribed worldwide and concerns about previously unidentified side&#xD;
      effects are emerging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of the project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the impact of genetic polymorphisms in selected pharmacogenes (including genes&#xD;
           coding for biotransformation enzymes and transport proteins) on INSTIs PK parameters and&#xD;
           biomarkers relevant for TDM, such as trough (C0) and intracellular (IC) concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether genetic polymorphisms in selected pharmacogenes might affect INSTIs&#xD;
           efficacy, as assessed by the measurement of the viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To address the important question of the pathophysiological mechanisms lying behind the&#xD;
           two main side effects of INSTIs, namely neuropsychiatric adverse events and abnormal&#xD;
           weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe how INSTIs affect the gut microbiome of treated patients, and to determine&#xD;
           in turn how and by which pathways the gut microbiome might influence the clinical&#xD;
           response (i.e. efficacy and toxicity) to INSTIs.&#xD;
