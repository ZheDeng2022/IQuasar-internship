  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Enucleation of the prostate equips technology (usually laser) to effectively treat lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The holmium:&#xD;
      yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho: YAG) laser is considered the gold standard laser used to perform&#xD;
      enucleation of the prostate. Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) reduces&#xD;
      hospital stay and hemoglobin drop while improving International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS)&#xD;
      and quality of life, as well as other postoperative outcomes. HoLEP has been found to have a&#xD;
      better enucleation efficiency rate and may have better hemostatic properties when combined&#xD;
      with the modulated pulsed laser energy featured associated with Moses technology (m-HoLEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel laser technology called thulium fiber laser (TFL) delivers a pulsed laser at a more&#xD;
      optimal wavelength and a shallower depth of tissue penetration leading to better hemostatic&#xD;
      properties. However, the differences in clinical outcomes between TFL enucleation of the&#xD;
      prostate (TFLEP) and m-HoLEP have yet to be described. This prospective study aims to compare&#xD;
      the safety profile and clinical outcomes, peri-operatively up to one year post-operatively,&#xD;
      between m-HoLEP and TFLEP with BPH and evidence of bladder obstruction.&#xD;

      Enucleation of the prostate equips technology (usually laser) to effectively treat lower&#xD;
      urinary tract symptoms associated with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH). The holmium:&#xD;
      yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Ho: YAG) laser is the longest running and most studied laser used to&#xD;
      perform this minimally invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) reduces hospital stay and hemoglobin drop&#xD;
      while improving IPSS and quality of life, as well as other positive postoperative outcomes.&#xD;
      HoLEP has been found to have a better enucleation efficiency rate and may have better&#xD;

&#xD;
      This prospective study aims to compare the safety profile and clinical outcomes,&#xD;
      peri-operatively up to one year post-operatively, between m-HoLEP and TFLEP with BPH and&#xD;
      evidence of bladder obstruction. Variables of particular interest include the length of&#xD;
      hospital stay and the need for blood transfusion, which are benefits of both techniques&#xD;
      compared to transurethral resection of the prostate, the current gold standard of BPH&#xD;
      treatment according to American Urological Association (AUA) guidelines. The results of this&#xD;
      study will guide urologists in selecting the most appropriate procedure from the growing&#xD;
      armamentarium of treatments for BPH.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 1-year post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The International Prostate Symptom Score (I-PSS) is based on the answers to seven questions concerning urinary symptoms and one question concerning quality of life. Each question concerning urinary symptoms allows the patient to choose one out of six answers indicating increasing severity of the particular symptom. The answers are assigned points from 0 to 5. The total score can therefore range from 0 to 35 (asymptomatic to very symptomatic).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1-year post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>IPSS includes one question pertaining to QoL which asks: &quot;If you were to spend the rest of your life with your urinary condition just the way it is now, how would you feel about that? Scored from 0-6 with 0 being &quot;delighted&quot; and 6 being &quot;terrible&quot;. Higher the score, the lower the quality of life.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 1-year post-operatively</time_frame>
    <description>The International Consultation on Incontinence Modular Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) reflects the impact of urinary incontinence on QoL. Three (3) items are summed up (frequency of urinary incontinence, amount of leakage, overall impact of urinary incontinence) to provide a score between 0 &amp; 21. Higher scores reflect increased urinary incontinence and poorer QoL.</description>
