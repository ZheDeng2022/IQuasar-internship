  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is based on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to screen the effective&#xD;
      methods of traditional Chinese medicine intervention for dry eye and its applicable&#xD;
      conditions, and optimize the traditional Chinese medicine intervention plan for dry eye&#xD;
      through the evaluation of evidence-based medicine and expert consensus, and construct the&#xD;
      Clinical Decision support system of traditional Chinese medicine intervention for dry eye,&#xD;
      secondly, a real-world prospective cohort study design is adopted, the CDSS system is used in&#xD;
      the ophthalmology clinic, and its practical application effect on patients with dry eye is&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dry eye is a common disease that affects tears and ocular surface. It can cause ocular&#xD;
      surface discomfort, visual impairment and even blindness, affect the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients and cause social and psychological harm. Interventions related to traditional&#xD;
      Chinese medicine can effectively alleviate the clinical symptoms and signs of patients with&#xD;
      dry eye, and are an indispensable part of the treatment of dry eye. However, at present,&#xD;
      patients with dry eye are mainly diagnosed at the western medicine ophthalmology clinic. Due&#xD;
      to the lack of knowledge of Chinese medicine by western medicine ophthalmologists, they are&#xD;
      unable to provide patients with good guidance on Chinese medicine intervention measures,&#xD;
      which may cause patients to miss Chinese medicine-related treatments. This project provides&#xD;
      doctors of Western medicine with a clinical decision support system (CDSS) of Chinese&#xD;
      medicine interventions for dry eye syndrome, so as to improve doctors' guidance and&#xD;
      decision-making of Chinese medicine for patients. This project is based on artificial&#xD;
      intelligence (AI) algorithms to screen the effective methods of traditional Chinese medicine&#xD;
      intervention for dry eye and its applicable conditions, and optimize the traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine intervention plan for dry eye through the evaluation of evidence-based medicine and&#xD;
      expert consensus, and construct the Clinical Decision support system of traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine intervention for dry eye, secondly, a real-world prospective cohort study design is&#xD;
      adopted, the CDSS system is used in the ophthalmology clinic, and its practical application&#xD;
      effect on patients with dry eye is evaluated.&#xD;

    <measure>Tear Meniscus Height</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Before TMH at 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tear Meniscus Height (TMH) refers to the level of tear fluid at the junction of the light band on the surface of the cornea and conjunctiva and the light band on the lower eyelid margin.</description>

    <measure>Tear Break up time</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Before TBUT at 12 months after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tear Break up time (TBUT) is usually used to diagnose dry eye syndrome. Diluted fluorescein sodium liquid is instilled into the conjunctival fornix of the lower eyelid, and the patient is instructed to blink and hold it, and start timing. The time when the first rupture spot appears is the tear film rupture time.</description>
