  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to determine if changes seen during sulforaphane treatment (a&#xD;
      compound that comes from eating certain vegetables) can better be understood using digital&#xD;
      biomarkers. These digital biomarkers are things like heart rate, muscle movement etc. and are&#xD;
      measured using non-invasive devices (like a watch) and are aimed at complementing the&#xD;
      traditional clinical scores already in use in current trials (e.g. Aberrant Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale&#xD;
      (OACIS)).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot open label treatment trial with SF (sulforaphane) in 10 individuals&#xD;
      that have completed with moderate to severe autism, age 13-30 years that have completed&#xD;
      participation in ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02677051. This study will measure digital&#xD;
      biomarkers of the nervous systems. Digital biomarkers are obtained by using non-invasive&#xD;
      wireless (wearable, like wearing a watch) biosensors that co-register in tandem multiple&#xD;
      biorhythms self-generated by the person's nervous systems. These sensors gather a very large&#xD;
      amount of data from measures such as EEG (electroencephalogram), EKG (electrocardiogram),&#xD;
      kinematics and others. These measures are done at the same time as the clinical evaluations&#xD;
      and so results can be compared. Because the data are based on the unique fingerprint-like&#xD;
      signatures of the person's nervous systems, it is possible to ascertain the person's&#xD;
      progression in response to treatment and compare it to baseline states. The project will also&#xD;
      compare these self-emerging clusters between subjects, possibly identifying patterns that&#xD;
      correlate with sub-phenotypes or with similarities in response to treatment. Changes in&#xD;
      things such as natural behaviors, an individual's ability or desire to interact socially and&#xD;
      ability or desire to communicate will alter the signature profiles from baseline. Since these&#xD;
      changes are dynamic in nature, trends of the evolving patterns and separate changes that are&#xD;
      a consequence of the treatment vs. changes that are part of the natural neurodevelopment can&#xD;
      be detected. This may be a valuable tool in future studies of underlying etiology. The&#xD;
      technology used to perform these measures and the software to analyze the data are evolving&#xD;
      rapidly. Last, with the characterized signatures and possibly overlapping patterns generated&#xD;
      in this and in other projects it is foreseeable that a clinically relevant tool for measures&#xD;
      in autism will follow.&#xD;
