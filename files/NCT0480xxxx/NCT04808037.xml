    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open label, study designed to assess the safety and clinical activity of&#xD;
      different Belantamab Mafodotin doses in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of two distinct parts: Part 1 will evaluate different doses of&#xD;
      belantamab mafodotin in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in up to 3 cohorts&#xD;
      and will determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) to be further evaluated for safety and&#xD;
      clinical activity in the dose expansion cohort (Part 2). The RP2D dose will be used for&#xD;
      future studies in the transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed MM setting. Part 2 of the study&#xD;
      will also evaluate an alternative dose modification guideline for corneal adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo visits and assessments in accordance with the Schedule of&#xD;
      Assessments (SoA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, approximately 66 participants will be enrolled in the study. Participant follow up&#xD;
      will continue until 5 years after the last participant is randomized. The estimated accrual&#xD;
      period will be 12 months corresponding to an approximate total study duration of 6 years.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Female participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations&#xD;
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or&#xD;
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is a WOCBP and using two methods of reliable birth control (one method that is&#xD;
                  highly effective and one additional effective [barrier] method), beginning 4&#xD;
                  weeks prior to initiating treatment with lenalidomide, during therapy, during&#xD;
                  dose interruptions and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of&#xD;
                  lenalidomide treatment. Thereafter, WOCBP participants must use one method of&#xD;
                  reliable birth control that is highly effective for a further 3 months following&#xD;
                  discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin. WOCBP must also agree not to donate eggs&#xD;
                  (ova, oocytes) for the purpose of reproduction during treatment, during dose&#xD;
                  interruptions and for 28-days following the last dose of lenalidomide or 4 months&#xD;
                  following discontinuation of belantamab mafodotin treatment whichever is longer.&#xD;
                  For contraception guidance please refer to Appendix 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A WOCBP must have two negative pregnancy tests prior to initiating therapy. The first&#xD;
             test should be performed within 10-14 days and the second test within 24 hours prior&#xD;
             to the start of lenalidomide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The participant should not receive lenalidomide until the investigator has verified&#xD;
             that the results of these pregnancy tests are negative. The investigator should&#xD;
             evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first&#xD;
             dose of study intervention. The investigator is responsible for review of medical&#xD;
             history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for&#xD;
             inclusion of a woman with a nearly undetected pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             WOCBP is a female who:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has achieved menarche at some time point&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  has not been naturally postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does&#xD;
                  not rule out childbearing potential) for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male participants: contraceptive use should be consistent with local regulations&#xD;
             regarding the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during&#xD;
             the intervention period and until 28 days after the last dose of lenalidomide or 6&#xD;
             months after the last dose of belantamab mafodotin, whichever is longer, to allow for&#xD;
             clearance of any altered sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Refrain from donating sperm&#xD;
&#xD;
             PLUS either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                  (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must agree to use contraception/barrier as detailed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Agree to use a male condom, even if they have undergone a successful vasectomy, and&#xD;
             female partner to use an additional highly effective contraceptive method with a&#xD;
             failure rate of &lt;1% per year as when having sexual intercourse with a woman of&#xD;
             childbearing potential (including pregnant females).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants must be able to understand the study procedures and agree to participate&#xD;
             in the study by providing written informed consent.&#xD;
