  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anesthesia alters microcirculation and tissue oxygen saturation (StO2). We sought to examine&#xD;
      changes in StO2 using near-infrared spectroscopy and a vascular occlusion test (VOT) during&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. This prospective observational study was included 51 patients without&#xD;
      comorbidities who underwent elective surgery under spinal anesthesia. We measured the StO2 in&#xD;
      the lower extremity during VOT before and after intrathecal injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vascular occlusion test (VOT) procedure was conducted twice in each patient, before and&#xD;
      15 min after intrathecal injection. An near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) sensor (INVOSTM&#xD;
      5100C Cerebral/Somatic Oximeter; Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was attached to the&#xD;
      patient's gastrocnemius muscle. A tourniquet (A.T.S ® 3000 Automatic Tourniquet System;&#xD;
      Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, IL, USA) was applied to the thigh and inflated to a pressure value 50&#xD;
      mmHg over the patient's baseline systolic blood pressure in the leg and maintained for 5 min.&#xD;
      After a 5-min ischemic period, the tourniquet was rapidly deflated to 0 mmHg. The tissue&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (StO2) data was continuously recorded during the VOT procedure. After&#xD;
      confirmation of spinal anesthesia using cold sensitivity, the VOT procedure was repeated in&#xD;
      the same manner as mentioned above. The occlusion slope and recovery slope were calculated&#xD;
      based on the measured StO2 data. The occlusion slope was defined as the descending slope of&#xD;
      StO2 value until it reached the minimum value. The recovery slope was calculated from the&#xD;
      deflation of the tourniquet until the recovery of StO2 to the maximum value.&#xD;
