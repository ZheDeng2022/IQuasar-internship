      Trial Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Norwegian Tennis Elbow (NOTE) study is a single-centre; three-armed, feasibility&#xD;
      randomised controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to pilot the methods proposed to conduct a definite RCT&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the process of recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure intervention adherence and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure outcome measure retention rate and completeness. The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow&#xD;
           Evaluation (PRTEE) will be used as the primary outcome measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to either: 1) Heavy slow resistance training (HSR), 2) Radial&#xD;
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) or 3) Information and advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will be after 3 and 6 months.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral epicondylalgia, also known as tennis elbow, cause functional disability with high&#xD;
      costs due to productivity loss, healthcare use and sickness absence. Evidence shows that&#xD;
      physiotherapy is the most preferred patient treatment among Norwegian patients. However, the&#xD;
      most efficient treatment for chronic tennis elbow is yet to be acknowledged. Exercises are a&#xD;
      commonly used modality for tennis elbows. However, contradictory to lower limb&#xD;
      tendinopathies, a pragmatic heavy slow resistance (HSR) exercise training protocol for tennis&#xD;
      elbow have not yet been investigated. Radial extracorporeal shock wave therapy (rESWT) is&#xD;
      another widely used modality and evidence is spares and inconsistent, reviews conclude that&#xD;
      more high quality studies are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility study will provide methodological evidence that will play an important role&#xD;
      in the development of future RCT. The project will include 60 patients with lateral&#xD;
      epicondylalgia, these patients will be randomised to either: 1) HSR exercises 2) rESWT or 3)&#xD;
      information and advice. The randomization sequence is computer-generated with blocks of&#xD;
      variable size, which is unknown to the treater and the outcome assessor. A research assistant&#xD;
      will supply the trial physiotherapist with allocations to which group. The investigator&#xD;
      assessing the outcome measures will be blind to group allocation. Statistical analysis will&#xD;
      be conducted on a blinded intention-to-treat basis. Due to the nature of the intervention in&#xD;
      the study, blinding of the trial physiotherapist will not be possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele rehabilitation and welfare technology are rapidly increasing its usability and value. To&#xD;
      investigate if tele rehabilitation is suitable for a RCT, the exercise group will be offered&#xD;
      voluntary tele rehabilitation as an alternative to physical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives that will be evaluate is; 1) the process of recruitment, 2) intervention&#xD;
      adherence and acceptability and 3) the outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The process of recruitment will be measured by descriptive statistics from the&#xD;
           enrolment. If participants redraw after baseline testing or are unwilling to be&#xD;
           randomized, the participant will be asked to describe the reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure adherence to the intervention, participants will be asked to fil out an&#xD;
           exercise diary which will be controlled at follow up consultations and collected at 3&#xD;
           months. Usage of tele rehabilitation and percentage of participants meeting to their&#xD;
           appointments will be measured with descriptive statistics after 3 months. The&#xD;
           acceptability and understanding of the intervention will be measure by a -9/+9 likert&#xD;
           scale for acceptability of treatment the second session after randomization and at 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The retention rate and completeness of data of the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
           measures for a future full power RCT will be measured with explorative outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will focus on descriptive statistics with confidence intervals for the variables&#xD;
      obtained. The characteristics of the patients will be presented as means with SDs, as medians&#xD;
      with IQR or as counts with percentages. Being a feasibility study, our main aim is to&#xD;
      describe the study sample of patients with tennis elbow and to assess our ability to collect&#xD;
      data. Hence, the investigators will not perform any imputation of missing data. Change in the&#xD;
      main outcome from baseline to follow-up (3 and 6 months) will be analysed using generalised&#xD;
      linear mixed models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be performed studies evaluating the validity, reliability, interpretability and&#xD;
      responsiveness of the The Patient-Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation, maximum grip strength and&#xD;
      pain free grip strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included participants will have an ultrasound examination of their elbow by a trained doctor&#xD;
      at baseline.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: Level 1: no problems, Level 2: slight problems, Level 3: moderate problems, Level 4: severe problems and Level 5: extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1 digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension, The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. A total of 3125 possible health states is defined in this way. For example state &quot;12345&quot; indicates no problems with mobility, slight problems with washing or dressing, moderate problems with doing usual activities, severe pain or discomfort and extreme anxiety or depression.</description>

    <description>The 5-level EQ-5D VAS (EQ VAS) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The EQ VAS is scored from 0 - 100 and a lower score indicate poorer health, higher scores indicate a better health. The EQ VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <measure>Pain free grip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will hold a hand grip dynamometer (Jamar) in a standing position with a fully extended elbow in a neutral pronation/supination. The patient will be instructed to squeeze slowly and stop squeezing at the onset of pain; the values in kg will then be registered. The pain free grip strength is measured three times at the asymptomatic side, with a 20-second rest interval between each measurement and then the procedure is repeated at the symptomatic side. After tested in fully extended position the same procedure will be followed with a 90 degrees elbow flexion, and in a neutral pronation/supination.</description>

    <description>Patients will hold a hand grip dynamometer (Jamar) in a standing position with a fully extended elbow in a neutral pronation/supination. The patient will be instructed to squeeze with their maximum effort; the values in kg will then be registered. The maximum grip strength is measured three times at the asymptomatic side, with a 20-second rest interval between each measurement and then the procedure is repeated at the symptomatic side. After tested in fully extended position the same procedure will be followed with a 90 degrees elbow flexion, and in a neutral pronation/supination.</description>
