    <textblock>
      This study will address whether cannabis affects antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug&#xD;
      concentrations, mood, and thinking. The project will have two phases. Phase 1 is an&#xD;
      observational study, in which 120 people will be assessed to evaluate the effects of chronic&#xD;
      cannabis use on ART drug concentrations, mood, and thinking. In Phase 2, the study will&#xD;
      administer cannabis (or placebo) to 40 people to examine its acute effects on ART drug&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) commonly use cannabis but whether cannabis&#xD;
      affects the antiretroviral therapy (ART) that treats HIV is not well known. Cannabis can&#xD;
      inhibit the activity of enzymes that metabolize and eliminate ART drugs from the body, which&#xD;
      could result in higher concentrations of ART drugs in the body. Cannabis may also affect the&#xD;
      distribution of ART drugs into the brain, which could have both beneficial (e.g., better HIV&#xD;
      control) and detrimental (e.g., toxicity) effects. The effects of cannabis may are likely&#xD;
      influenced by factors like how much is used (e.g., light vs. heavy use) and the route of use&#xD;
      (e.g., smoked vs. ingested). This study will address whether cannabis affects ART&#xD;
      concentrations in blood and cerebrospinal fluid as well as mood, and thinking. The project&#xD;
      will have two phases. Phase 1 is an observational study, in which 120 people will be assessed&#xD;
      once to evaluate the effects of chronic cannabis use on ART drug concentrations, mood, and&#xD;
      thinking. In Phase 2, the study will administer cannabis (or placebo) to 40 people to examine&#xD;
      its acute effects on ART drug concentrations.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The interventional component of the project (Phase 2) will have a randomized cross-over design that randomly assigns the order of the administration of the three study products (placebo, cannabis with higher concentration of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and lower concentration of cannabidiol (CBD), or cannabis with higher CBD concentration and lower THC concentration). The cannabis administration phase of this study will compare the study products to: 1) ART concentrations in blood and CSF and 2) measures of uridine 5'-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activity.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Participants will randomly receive one of the study products at each visit. All participants will receive all three of the study products. Allocation assignment of visits will be assigned using a randomization string provided by the statistician.
