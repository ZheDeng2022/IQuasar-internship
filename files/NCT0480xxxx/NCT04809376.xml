  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the change in pain and function with subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections of pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) compared with subcutaneous injections of&#xD;
      placebo in participants with knee osteoarthritis pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study details include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study duration will be up to 28 weeks per participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment duration will be 6 weeks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a 2-stage, adaptive, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study&#xD;
      that will evaluate the dose and treatment effect of PPS in participants with knee OA pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 1 (dose selection), approximately 468 participants will be randomised 1:1:1:1 to&#xD;
      receive 1 of 3 PPS dose regimens or placebo for 6 weeks. A minimum of 96 participants (24&#xD;
      within each dose group) will be assigned to the Pharmacokinetic (PK) subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Stage 1 will be randomly allocated to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 mg/kg calculated for ideal body weight (IBW) PPS twice weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 mg/kg IBW PPS once weekly + placebo once weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  100/150 mg PPS ≤65/&gt;65 kg IBW once weekly + placebo once weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placebo twice weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage 2, approximately 470 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive the selected PPS&#xD;
      dose regimen or placebo for 6 weeks. Approximately 150 participants (75 per group) will be&#xD;
      assigned to the PK subset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Stage 2 will be randomly allocated to receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One of the 3 Stage 1 PPS dose regimens selected by the DMC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  placebo twice weekly&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum duration for each participant is approximately 28 weeks, which includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4-week Screening Period from Day -28 to Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6-week Treatment Period from Day 1 to Day 39&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18-week Follow-up Period from Day 40 to Day 168&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>WOMAC: The WOMAC® NRS 3.1 Index is a validated, self-administered, health status questionnaire that assesses pain, stiffness, and function in patients with hip or knee OA . The WOMAC pain sub-scale is a 5-item questionnaire used to assess the amount of pain experienced due to OA of index joint (knee) during the past 48 hours. It is calculated as the mean of scores from 5 individual questions scored on a numerical rating scale (NRS). Scores for each question and WOMAC Pain sub-scale score on NRS ranged from 0 (no pain) to 10 (extreme pain), where higher scores indicate higher pain.</description>
