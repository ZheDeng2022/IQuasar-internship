  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two types of therapy for caregivers of cancer&#xD;
      patients: Emotion Regulation Therapy for Cancer Caregivers (ERT-C) and Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT-C). The researchers want to see if ERT-C is better than, the same as, or worse&#xD;
      than traditional CBT-C at improving caregiver distress. The researchers will look at how the&#xD;
      two types of therapy affect caregivers' anxiety, depression, and quality of life. The&#xD;
      researchers will also see how ERT-C and CBT-C affect hormone and stress levels in caregivers'&#xD;
      saliva samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this trial will enroll cancer patients in this study to see how their&#xD;
      caregivers' participation in ERT-C or CBT may affect the patients' quality of life, stress,&#xD;
      and use of healthcare services.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CBT-C and ERT-C are each 8-session, individual, caregivers-directed interventions delivered&#xD;
      by a trained study therapist listed on the face page and facilitated by a manualized workbook&#xD;
      with between-session practice exercises. To accommodate caregivers and reduce compliance&#xD;
      issues with attendance of sessions, the 8 sessions are to be completed within 8 to 16 weeks&#xD;
      from initiation of the first session. Each session is 60 minutes in length and will be audio&#xD;
      and video recorded for MSK participants; sessions will only be audio recorded for MGH&#xD;
      participants. Specific modules and intervention components are described below. To&#xD;
      accommodate as many caregivers as possible and in response to the restrictions placed on&#xD;
      caregivers currently in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, sessions will be offered via&#xD;
      telepsychiatry (using WebEx , Zoom, Teams).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training case participants will be identified and consented onto the study for training&#xD;
      purposes only. Participants who are consented as training cases will not be randomized and&#xD;
      will not complete any assessments. Data collected on training cases will be used for training&#xD;
      and supervision purposes on this study only. These records will not be shown outside of the&#xD;
      study supervisors, therapist in training, and staff.&#xD;

    <description>Emotion Regulation Therapy for Cancer Caregivers (ERT-C) is an 8-session intervention that builds upon the foundations of CBT-C and addresses earlier motivational processing components of the caregivers context while targeting earlier and later components of internal distress and resultant maladaptive behavioral coping.</description>

    <description>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT-C) is an evidence-based psychotherapeutic approach that is grounded in the cognitive model that purports that a person's emotional, behavioral, and physiological reactions to a situation is based on their appraisal of that situation. The focus of therapy is on changing cognitions and beliefs about a situation and altering automatic behavioral responses evoked by that perception. CBT-C aims to improve emotion regulation by challenging and changing unhelpful cognitions and behaviors and improving personal coping strategies.</description>
