      the aim of the SERAPHINE study is to gather data stemming from the French research database&#xD;
      BERHLINGO (= Base d'Etude et de Recherche en Hémostase pour Les Investigateurs du&#xD;
      Grand-Ouest, i.e. Database for Research on Hemostasis for the Investigators of Western&#xD;
      France), in order to get a detailed report about the therapeutic management and use of&#xD;
      turoctocog alfa (NovoEight®) in surgery in pwHA (Patient with inherited Hemophilia A).&#xD;

        In order to respect the independence of the physicians, this study is conducted with&#xD;
        patients for whom the decision to prescribe turoctocog alfa (NovoEight®) treatment is not&#xD;
        related to the study. The prescription of turoctocog alfa (NovoEight®) will therefore have&#xD;
        been carried out on the initiative of the physicians of the participating centers, in&#xD;
        collaboration with the patients involved. This study therefore does not lead to any change&#xD;
        in the usual medical care of the people entering the study, nor does it affect the physical&#xD;
        or psychological integrity of the patients.&#xD;
