  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study asks three questions about Persons with Parkinson Disease that use a bicycle for&#xD;
      exercise. 1. Does the use of virtual reality increase the intensity and and enjoyment of the&#xD;
      experience compared to bicycling without virtual reality? 2. Does the way in which the&#xD;
      bicycling (interval compared to continous) is performed affect the experience? 3. How does&#xD;
      the way the virtual reality is delivered (with goggles or projected on a screen) affect the&#xD;
      experience?&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants attend two sessions. They complete movement assessments and questionnaires about&#xD;
      physical activity. During the first session they bicycle in a semi-immersive (projected on a&#xD;
      screen) and an immersive (with googles) virtual environment. After each bout they completed a&#xD;
      questionnaire about the experience. In the second session they bicycle four times with and&#xD;
      without a virtual environment using both a continous and interval mode. Their oxygen&#xD;
      consumption is measured during cycling. They complete questionnaires after each exercise&#xD;
      bout.&#xD;
