    <description>Pain sensation in ice-cold water (4 degree Celsius) was measured by VAS (a scaled ruler which the zero point displays the zone of lack of pain and the 100th point was considered as the zone of maximum pain) at Day 22 after the administration of KH001</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Evaporative Air Sensitivity as Measured by Schiff Sensitivity Score when given as a SAD of KH001</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff sensitivity score was assessed by examiner as subject's response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of each individual tooth. Response of subject was scored using Schiff sensitivity scale range of 0-3; 0=Subject does not respond to air stimulation; 1= Subject responds to air stimulus but does not request discontinuation of stimulus; 2= Subject responds to air stimulus and requests discontinuation or moves from stimulus; 3= Subject responds to stimulus, considers stimulus to be painful, and requests discontinuation of the stimulus. A reduction in Schiff Sensitivity score indicates improvement in sensitivity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Tactile Threshold when given as a SAD of KH001</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Pressure was administered using a constant pressure probe. The constant pressure probe allows the examiner to vary the force applied to the dentine surface from 10 g in increments of 10 g. The pressure setting at which the subject gave two consecutive 'yes' responses was recorded as the tactile threshold.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Dentine Hypersensitivity Experience Questionnaire (DHEQ) when given as a SAD of KH001</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 22</time_frame>
    <description>Total score is an overall summary measure for the impact of dentine hypersensitivity on everyday life. Total score is calculated as the sum of 34 questions (each with a possible score of 1 to 7).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Day 8, 15, 36</time_frame>
    <description>Schiff sensitivity score was assessed by examiner as subject's response to an evaporative (air) stimulus after the stimulation of each individual tooth.
