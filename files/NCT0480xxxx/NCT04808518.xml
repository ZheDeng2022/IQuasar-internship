      Objectives in this study is to compare the change of lung function after 24 months from&#xD;
      baseline between the two groups; one is the patient group who decided to start biologics&#xD;
      treatment, and another is the patient group who decided to start non-biologics treatment. The&#xD;
      target patients are the adult uncontrolled severe asthma patients.&#xD;
