  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes becomes epidemic in worldwide countries. Nine out of ten diabetic patients are type&#xD;
      2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is characterized by insulin resistance and obesity. Uncontrolled&#xD;
      diabetes leads to serious consequences including heart attack, stroke, chronic renal failure,&#xD;
      liver failure, blindness and low limb amputation. Most of hypoglycemic medications have side&#xD;
      effects. Natural foods or nutraceuticals with hypoglycemic potential are expected to provide&#xD;
      a safer management for diabetic patients. Saskatoon berry is a popular fruit in Canadian&#xD;
      Prairie and Northern states in USA. Our recent studies demonstrated Saskatoon berry powder&#xD;
      (SBp) attenuated hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, inflammation, liver&#xD;
      steatosis and gut dysbiosis in diet-induced insulin resistant mice, a model for T2D. The&#xD;
      results in antidiabetic activities of SBp have been supported by other groups in high fat fed&#xD;
      rats. The combination of findings suggest that Saskatoon berry is good candidate of prebiotic&#xD;
      functional food as a supplemental remedy for reducing insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and preventing or managing T2D. The effect of Saskatoon berry and its products on metabolic&#xD;
      disorders have not been studied in human subjects. We propose to examine the effect of oral&#xD;
      administration of freeze-dried Saskatoon berry on glucose metabolism, insulin resistance and&#xD;
      gut microbiota in healthy adults in a pilot trial.&#xD;

      Subject recruitment: Healthy subjects (males and females, 18-75 years of age) in Winnipeg,&#xD;
      who are voluntarily signing an informed consent approved by Research Ethics Board in&#xD;
      University of Manitoba, will be eligible to the study. Exclusion criteria include: 1)&#xD;
      candidates have a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, hypertension, diabetes,&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, chronic kidney disease; 2) participants are taking hypoglycemic,&#xD;
      anti-hypertensives, lipid lowering medications or antibiotics within a month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary product: Freeze dried Saskatoon berry have been obtained from Prairie Berries Inc.&#xD;
      The berries were freshly frozen and no any supplementation was added to the dried berry. The&#xD;
      product has been processed by certified facilities and the batch of dried berry has passed&#xD;
      pathogen analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen: Participants (n=20) will orally administrate 30 g/day of freeze dried Saskatoon&#xD;
      berry during breakfast for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheduled visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Consent and enrollment. A questionnaire for domestic questionnaire including dietary&#xD;
      intake and physical activity will be filled. Measurements of body weight, height and blood&#xD;
      pressure will be taken during the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (&lt;1 week from the visit 1 and before the start of berry administration): 75 g oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test (OGTT) after an overnight fasting. Insulin, liver enzymes (alanine&#xD;
      transaminase or ALT, aspartate transaminase or AST), creatinine, lipid profile and&#xD;
      inflammation markers (e. x. tumor necrosis factor-alpha or TNF-alpha) will be measured as&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be provided with sealed packages of dried Saskatoon berry and instruction&#xD;
      of the administration. Insulin and lipid profile will be tested in blood samples withdrawn at&#xD;
      fast glucose for OGTT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (at 5 weeks after the start of administration of Saskatoon berry): Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to provide feedback on general well-being and the intake of Saskatoon berry. Body&#xD;
      weight, blood pressure and heart rate will be measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4 (at 10 weeks after the start of the dietary regimen): Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      collect stool sample with the collection kit within 1 week before the visit and bring it to&#xD;
      the visit. They will also be asked to have an overnight fasting the night before visit. They&#xD;
      will receive an OGTT. Blood samples for insulin, liver enzymes, creatinine, lipid profile and&#xD;
      inflammation markers will be collected from each participant. During the visit, body weight,&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate of participants will be taken. Questionnaires on participants'&#xD;
      dietary intake, physical activity and feedback to the study will be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive a $50 honorarium gift card for their participation. Sample&#xD;
      collection and analyses: OGTT, ALT, AST, creatinine and lipid profile will be analyzed in&#xD;
      Clinical Chemistry in Health Science Centre, Winnipeg. Inflammation mediators will be&#xD;
      analyzed in the Dr. G. Shen's laboratory. Homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance or&#xD;
      homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be calculated based on&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose and insulin. Stool samples will be aliquoted and stored under -80Â°C&#xD;
      before submission. Microbiome analysis will be conducted in Integrate Microbiome Resource at&#xD;
      Dalhousie University.&#xD;
