  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For decades, chronic low back pain has been one of the major health complaints in Hong Kong.&#xD;
      Without proper management, low back pain is associated with functional disability and&#xD;
      decreased quality of life. However, currently, there is still no &quot;gold standard&quot; treatment&#xD;
      for cure of the problem.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral nerve field stimulation (PNFS) is a neuromodulation therapy which provides pain&#xD;
      relief through electrical stimulation of the painful area at the lower back. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that the use of PNFS is effective in reducing pain intensity and improving&#xD;
      physical functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral stimulation of acupuncture points (PSAP) is a novel therapeutic strategy which&#xD;
      involves the combination of PNFS and acupuncture from traditional Chinese medicine. Through&#xD;
      electrical stimulation of specific acupuncture points, synergistic effect and additional&#xD;
      benefits such as relief of sciatica might be observed. As such, the intervention is of our&#xD;
      interest in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 50 subjects. After signing the consent form, subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of the two groups, either PSAP or PNFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group PSAP, two electrode leads will be implanted and connected to an external&#xD;
      neurostimulator for electrical stimulation of acupuncture points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For group PNFS, two electrode leads will be implanted and connected to an external&#xD;
      neurostimulator for electrical stimulation of the painful area.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The randomization sequence will be generated by Microsoft Excel software. Blocked randomization will be done with an allocation ratio of 1:1 under block randomization (patients with lower back pain only or patient having low back pain with radicular pain). The assigned intervention group is stated in sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes, which will be opened by the attending therapist treating the patient. The investigator who is involved in sequence generation or allocation concealment will not be involved in enrolling participants or administering the intervention.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Investigator, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>The participants, outcome assessors and data analysts will be kept blinded to the allocation status to avoid information bias. Patients who have no knowledge in acupuncture are told that the leads would be implanted at the acupuncture points that can be at or outside the painful sites. Only the pain physician administering the allocated intervention is unblinded, whereas he/she is not involved in data collection or analysis.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has signed the Subject Informed Consent/Subject Information Sheet prior to&#xD;
             randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is aged 18 or above at the time of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient presents with chronic intractable non-specific, axial or radicular Low Back&#xD;
             Pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has had chronic pain for at least 6 months.&#xD;
