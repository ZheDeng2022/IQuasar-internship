  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women over the age of 60 years have an estimated 10 to 15 % risk of recurrent urinary tract&#xD;
      infections (UTI). This is believed to be due to hormonally induced changes in the vaginal&#xD;
      flora associated with menopause. After menopause, there is a chemical changes in the vagina&#xD;
      that may predispose to bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of vaginal estrogen creams to restore vaginal atrophy and prevent urinary tract&#xD;
      infections has been well characterized. Vaginal testosterone (VT) application use in&#xD;
      postmenopausal breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors have been shown to improve&#xD;
      vaginal pH, vaginal atrophy symptom scores, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness. Although&#xD;
      testosterone has been used to improve sexual function in postmenopausal women, the effects of&#xD;
      VT on vaginal flora and recurrent UTIs are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topically applied vaginal testosterone&#xD;
      cream is more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections and to ascertain the effects of&#xD;
      topical estrogen on the vaginal pH and flora.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women over the age of 60 years have an estimated 10 to 15 % risk of recurrent urinary tract&#xD;
      infections (UTI). This is believed to be due to hormonally induced changes in the vaginal&#xD;
      flora associated with menopause. After menopause, there is a chemical changes in the vagina&#xD;
      that may predispose to bacterial infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of vaginal estrogen creams to restore vaginal atrophy and prevent urinary tract&#xD;
      infections has been well characterized. Vaginal testosterone (VT) application use in&#xD;
      postmenopausal breast cancer patients on aromatase inhibitors have been shown to improve&#xD;
      vaginal pH, vaginal atrophy symptom scores, dyspareunia, and vaginal dryness. Although&#xD;
      testosterone has been used to improve sexual function in postmenopausal women, the effects of&#xD;
      VT on vaginal flora and recurrent UTIs are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether topically applied vaginal testosterone&#xD;
      cream is more effective than placebo in reducing the incidence of urinary tract infections in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with recurrent urinary tract infections and to ascertain the effects of&#xD;
      topical estrogen on the vaginal pH and flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-center randomized, double- blind placebo-controlled study. Participating&#xD;
      clinic sites include Maimonides Medical Center and Northwell Health. Subjects will be one&#xD;
      hundred postmenopausal women presenting to a gynecology, urogynecology or female urology&#xD;
      clinic with a history of three or more microbiologically confirmed symptomatic episodes of&#xD;
      urinary tract infection during the either the previous year or two or more within six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will randomly assigned to one of two regimens: one group will receive VT cream to be&#xD;
      used once each night for two weeks followed by twice-weekly applications for eight months,&#xD;
      and the other group will receive a placebo cream to be used in the same manner. Demographic&#xD;
      data, vaginal exam including vaginal swab to assess vaginal flora, vaginal pH measurement and&#xD;
      vaginal atrophy index measurement will be collected at the initial study visit, again at a&#xD;
      study visit at 4.5 months and another at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated Results and Conclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that vaginal testosterone cream will reduce the incidence of urinary tract&#xD;
      infections in postmenopausal women when compared to placebo. It is expected that vaginal&#xD;
      testosterone will improve vaginal atrophy and flora, thus, decreasing the frequency of&#xD;
      urinary tract infections. Future aims of the study will focus on immune-dynamics associated&#xD;
      with vaginal testosterone administration.&#xD;

    <description>Vaginal testosterone 300-μg dose will be compounded with 13.5 mg of testosterone propionate in 0.45 mL of polysorbate National Formulary liquid and sufficient emollient cream base to make 45 g total. A calibrated vaginal applicator will be supplied to measure out doses of 1 g each. All study medications will be compounded by a single pharmacy so as to avoid variation in compounding between pharmacies and allow for control of compounding. Randomization will be conducted by the compounding pharmacy to allow for double-blinding of patients and clinicians.</description>
