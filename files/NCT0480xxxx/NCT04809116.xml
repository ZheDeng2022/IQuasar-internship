  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept, open-label trial of pimavanserin 34mg at bedtime for 6 weeks in&#xD;
      Veterans with insomnia and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More treatments are needed to target insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest that pimavanserin, a medication approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for the treatment of psychosis in Parkinson's disease, may improve deep sleep&#xD;
      and insomnia. This proof-of-concept study preliminarily assesses the feasibility of&#xD;
      open-label, fixed-dose pimavanserin 34mg at bedtime for 6 weeks for the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      insomnia in Veterans with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.&#xD;

             dose of study drug). The two methods should include: 1) A barrier method (e.g., condom&#xD;
             with spermicidal gel, diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine devices, cervical cap),&#xD;
             and 2) One other method, including hormonal contraceptives (e.g., oral contraceptives,&#xD;

             opinion of the investigators (i.e. caffeinated beverages consumed after 18:00 3&#xD;
             times/week or more and/or that correlates with the timing of the insomnia complaints)&#xD;
