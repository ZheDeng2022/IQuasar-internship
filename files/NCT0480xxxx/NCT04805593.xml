  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect efficacy and safety data on the WaveLight EX500&#xD;
      excimer laser system for the correction of hyperopia with and without astigmatism by laser in&#xD;
      situ keratomileusis (LASIK) treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualified subjects will receive LASIK treatment in both eyes and be followed for 1 year.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to attend a total of 9 visits (Screening, Surgery, Day 1, Week 1,&#xD;
      Month 1, Month 3, Month 6, Month 9, and Year 1). Total expected duration of subject&#xD;
      participation is approximately 1 year.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of eyes with manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE) within ±0.50 diopter (D) at refractive stability</measure>
    <time_frame>Preoperative, up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>A manifest refraction (manual refraction) will be performed using a phoropter. The spherical equivalent will be calculated by adding the sum of the sphere power with half of the cylinder power. Refractive stability is defined as the latter of two postoperative manifest refractions performed at least 3 months apart (or at 3 months after surgery when compared with the 1-month visit) that meets all the protocol-specified stability requirements.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of eyes experiencing ocular adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury, or untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory findings) in subjects, users, or other persons, whether or not related to the investigational medical device (test product). Ocular adverse events will be collected for this outcome measure.</description>

    <description>FDA approved stationary scanning-spot excimer laser system used during refractive surgery for the treatment of myopia, myopic astigmatism, hyperopia, hyperopic astigmatism, and mixed astigmatism. For this clinical study, the Wavefront Optimized (WFO) Ablation profile of the WaveLight EX500 excimer laser system will be used for bilateral LASIK treatment of hyperopia with and without astigmatism.</description>
