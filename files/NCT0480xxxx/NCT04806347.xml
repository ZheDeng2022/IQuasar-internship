  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single institution, phase I clinical trial will determine the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      employing T-cell receptor (TCR) αβ+ and CD19+ (Cluster of Differentiation ) depleted&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using peripheral blood stem cells (PBMC) from&#xD;
      closely matched unrelated donors or haploidentical donors to treat non-malignant hematologic&#xD;
      diseases in children and young adults. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has&#xD;
      become a curative option for children and adolescents with a variety of otherwise fatal&#xD;
      conditions. To reduce the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)&#xD;
      associated with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, donor grafts are depleted&#xD;
      of T cells, either using CD34+ selection or CD3+/CD19+ depletion of grafts. However, these&#xD;
      selection processes also deplete the graft of protective cell subsets, such as γδ T cells,&#xD;
      natural killer(NK) cells, monocytes and dendritic cells, which play important roles in the&#xD;
      immune response to infectious agents. Moreover, the presence of NK cells and γδ T in donor&#xD;
      grafts is associated with more rapid immune reconstitution after HSCT transplantation. In&#xD;
      order to retain these protective immune cell subsets, this trial will use a novel, highly&#xD;
      selective graft engineering process using the Miltenyi CliniMACS system that selectively&#xD;
      depletes αβ-T cells and B cells which are responsible for GVHD and Epstein Barr Virus&#xD;
      (EBV)-related post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder, respectively. Prior to&#xD;
      transplantation, patients will be treated with a conditioning regimen, specific for the&#xD;
      original disorder. The primary objective of this study is evaluation of the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of HSCT using TCRαβ+/CD19+ depleted hematopoietic stem cells to treat&#xD;
      non-malignant hematologic diseases. This will be assessed by evaluating the incidence of&#xD;
      graft failure, grade III-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD and TRM. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      the evaluation of immune reconstitution and incidence of post-transplant infections, adverse&#xD;
      events, serious adverse events, overall and disease-free survival and the efficiency of graft&#xD;
      processing by the CliniMACS System.&#xD;
