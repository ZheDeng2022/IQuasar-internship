      Central venous catheterization technology is a compulsory clinical skill for resident&#xD;
      physicians. Because of its difficulty in operation and the possibility of serious&#xD;
      complications, teaching this skill is a key and difficult point in clinical teaching in&#xD;
      anesthesiology. This skill training has gone through the traditional &quot;apprentice mode&quot;&#xD;
      teaching to the current video demonstration teaching, bedside feedback teaching, etc.. The&#xD;
      attempts of multiple teaching modes are to help low-age resident doctors master the&#xD;
      technology as soon as possible, improve the operation success rate, and reduce the incidence&#xD;
      of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Anesthesiology in our hospital is a key base for the standardized training&#xD;
      of anesthesiologists in China. In recent years, the introduction of video demonstration&#xD;
      methods for the central venous catheterization technology of low-age residents has achieved&#xD;
      some results. Residents watch the demonstration operation videos specially recorded by the&#xD;
      department, and perform operation exercises after passing the pre-operation assessment. The&#xD;
      trainees self-reported that the teaching mode increased their confidence in learning this&#xD;
      skill. However,in the actual training process, bedside comments (feedback teaching) were also&#xD;
      involved, and it was discovered that it could cause panic and dissatisfaction of the patient,&#xD;
      which was later improved into the paper-based feedback of the teacher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video demonstration teaching method was first applied to athletes' competitive training&#xD;
      and was found to be effective in improving athletes' competitive skills.It was also used in&#xD;
      medical education for surgical operation training, such as laparoscopic operation, which also&#xD;
      obtained significant results. Feedback, as a method of attracting learners, has long been&#xD;
      regarded as an important part of learning in medical education. We used bedside feedback&#xD;
      teaching in the early stage, which was criticized by patients. Research has shown that video&#xD;
      feedback may not only be superior to traditional verbal feedback methods alone, but it can&#xD;
      also avoid problems from patients. When learners watch their own operation videos, video&#xD;
      feedback will occur regardless of whether there is guidance from the instructor. Learners can&#xD;
      watch these videos individually or with the teacher who can provide guidance at the same&#xD;
      time. This teaching method is believed to be helpful for the assessment of skills. The use of&#xD;
      video feedback originated from track and field sports learning. A large number of studies&#xD;
      have found that video feedback teaching can be used as an effective means of medical&#xD;
      communication skills training. Recently, it has also be used in clinical skills teaching.&#xD;
      Current studies have confirmed that this teaching method can improve students' confidence in&#xD;
      learning skills, but there is still relatively little research on skill acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, video demonstration teaching and video feedback teaching are both useful in&#xD;
      deliberate practice teaching (such as skill operation training). Skills operation training&#xD;
      involves targeted repetitive exercises to improve skills, and feedback is the key to&#xD;
      strengthening clinical learning. By video demonstrations, learners can observe and analyze&#xD;
      the performance of experts (demonstrators) at key decision points under the guidance of the&#xD;
      teacher. And video feedback can help promote self-assessment. It shows that the combination&#xD;
      of the two may be more conducive to the integration of observational learning, imitation and&#xD;
      self-evaluation, and speed up the progress of skill training. This joint teaching has been&#xD;
      studied in sports research, while there are few studies in medical education. At present, a&#xD;
      small study found that compared with oral feedback, the combined method can achieve better&#xD;
      hernia repair skills, and there are recent research reports in peripheral vein indwelling&#xD;
      operation training. But whether it is also suitable for the operation training of high-risk&#xD;
      skills with greater difficulty coefficient, it needs to be confirmed by further research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project intends to observe the impact of video demonstration combined with video&#xD;
      feedback teaching on the central venous catheterization time of low-age resident physicians,&#xD;
      aiming to obtain a better method of central venous catheterization skills training, and to&#xD;
      improve the learning confidence of students to better master this skill, improve the success&#xD;
      rate of operation, reduce complications, and promote the application.&#xD;

And trainees should complete at least one central venipuncture model training and one actual operation under the personal guidance of the instructor before allocation.They will then be assigned to review a video of an expert performing central vein operation (VD alone), or both the expert video and a video of their own most recent operation(VD+VF), before returning to do another central vein operation. This will be repeated for a total of 5 central vein operation encounters and 5 video reviews.In the second week, each trainee completed at least 5 independent operations under the supervision of the instructor.</intervention_model_description>
