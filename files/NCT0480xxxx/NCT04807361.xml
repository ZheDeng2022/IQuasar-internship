  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the accommodative behavior in children undergoing myopia control&#xD;
      treatments. A subset of children showing reduced accommodation, known to occur in while&#xD;
      wearing multifocal soft contact lenses (MFCL) from previous studies, will undergo auditory&#xD;
      biofeedback training to improve the accommodative response and possibly improve treatment&#xD;
      efficacy. The results of this study will be used to design a larger clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - The accommodation response in myopic children being treated with MFCL for six months&#xD;
      or longer, will be determined. The accommodative response data will be collected while the&#xD;
      patients are wearing the MFCL and will be compared to the baseline control response when the&#xD;
      subjects wear single vision soft contact lenses (SVCL). Additional comparisons will include&#xD;
      accommodative measures in untreated myopic children wearing spectacle corrections (unttreated&#xD;
      controls), children being treated with ortho-keratology contact lenses, and children treated&#xD;
      with low-dose atropine (0.01%, considered not to affect accommodation). How these additional&#xD;
      myopia treatments affect the accommodation response has yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - Children treated with MFCL who show reduced accommodative responses will undergo a&#xD;
      brief period of auditory biofeedback accommodative training to determine whether the response&#xD;
      in children can be improved and how long it can be sustained. Improving the accommodative&#xD;
      response in these patients may improve the treatment efficacy by increasing the effect of the&#xD;
      positive power addition built into the lenses.&#xD;
