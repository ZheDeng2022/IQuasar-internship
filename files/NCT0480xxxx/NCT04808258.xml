  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is recommended in patients with ischemic stroke when&#xD;
      cardiac etiology is suspected to help plan secondary stroke management. However, discrepancy&#xD;
      for specific clinical recommendation exists between cardiologists and neurologists, and data&#xD;
      evaluating usefulness of TTE in unselected patients with cryptogenic strokes (CS) and embolic&#xD;
      strokes of undetermined source (ESUS) are lacking. The investigators sought to evaluate the&#xD;
      value of routinely performed echocardiography in consecutive CS/ESUS patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will perform TTE as recommended by guidelines including agitated saline&#xD;
      contrast and speckle-tracking to investigate potential implications for secondary stroke&#xD;
      management. In addition, the researchers aim to evaluate the effectiveness of long-term&#xD;
      continuous electrocardiogram (cECG) monitorering with newer Holter monitors to detect cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmia in patients with CS/ESUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, the investigators aim to evaluate 500 consecutive patients,&#xD;
      regardless of age, in sinus rhythm with acute IS and potential cardioembolic stroke (CES) or&#xD;
      cryptogenic stroke (CS/ESUS) according to Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment&#xD;
      (TOAST) criteria. Strokes are determined by magnetic resonance imaging. The researchers will&#xD;
      perform TTE as recommended by guidelines including agitated saline contrast and&#xD;
      speckle-tracking to investigate potential implications for secondary stroke management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to explore underlying heart conditions and comorbidities among CES and&#xD;
      ESUS patients. Data will include left atrium morphology, atrial septal aneurysm, valvular&#xD;
      disease, mural thrombus and patent foramen ovale (PFO). Focus will be analysis of data on&#xD;
      older patients, as some studies indicate that in ESUS patients &gt;60 years of age, there is a&#xD;
      higher prevalence of PFO in patients with low atherosclerosis and cardioembolic risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project can potentially guide cardiologists and neurologists, on common grounds, for&#xD;
      stroke management of potential cardioembolic origin. Implications of referring all-comers&#xD;
      with stroke of potential cardioembolic origin to echocardiography will be illustrated.&#xD;
