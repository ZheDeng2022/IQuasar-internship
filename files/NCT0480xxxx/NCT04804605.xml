  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess long-term safety in a multicenter, open-label, single-arm, 52-week study in subjects with atopic dermatitis treated with ARQ-151 cream: AEs and SAEs</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Occurrence of AEs and SAEs</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The proportion of subjects with Validated Investigator Global Assessment-Atopic Dermatitis (vIGA-AD) score of 0 or 1 at each assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The vIGA-AD is a static evaluation of qualitative overall AD severity. This global assessment scale is an ordinal scale with five severity grades (reported only in integers of 0 to 4 where 0 is clear).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in WI-NRS score over time</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>WI-NRS is a subject-reported severity of itch at its highest intensity during the previous 24-hour period. The scale is from '0 to 10' (&quot;no itch&quot; to &quot;worst imaginable itch&quot;).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in EASI score over time</measure>
    <time_frame>52 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EASI combines the assessment of the severity of lesions and the area affected into a single total score in the range 0 (no disease) to 72 (maximal disease). To calculate the EASI, the sum of the severity rating (0 to 3 with 3 being the most severe) for four clinical signs are multiplied with the numerical value of the area affected and with the percentage of the four body areas.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. For adult subjects: Participants legally competent to sign and give informed consent.&#xD;
             For pediatric and adolescent subjects: Informed consent of parent(s) or legal&#xD;
             guardian, and, if age appropriate, assent by the subjects, as required by local laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Males and females, ages 2 years and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with atopic dermatitis who met eligibility criteria for and successfully&#xD;
             completed one of three preceding studies through Week 4, and are able and eligible to&#xD;
             enroll into this long-term safety study on the Week 4 visit of the preceding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Females of childbearing potential (FOCBP) must have a negative urine pregnancy test at&#xD;
             all study visits. In addition, sexually active FOCBP must agree to use at least one&#xD;
             form of a highly effective or barrier method of contraception throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females of non-childbearing potential should either be pre-menarchal, or&#xD;
             post-menopausal with spontaneous amenorrhea for at least 12 months (post-menopausal&#xD;
             status would have been confirmed with FSH testing in the preceding study) or have&#xD;
             undergone surgical sterilization (permanent sterilization methods include&#xD;
             hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy, hysteroscopic sterilization, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation or bilateral salpingectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) are considered reliable and capable of&#xD;
             adhering to the Protocol and visit schedule, according to the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who experienced a treatment-related AE or a serious AE (SAE) that precluded&#xD;
             further treatment with ARQ-151 cream in the preceding study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects that use any Excluded Medications and Treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with skin conditions other than AD that would interfere with evaluations of&#xD;
             the effect of the study medication on AD, as determined by the Investigator. Subjects&#xD;
             with any condition on the treatment area which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             could confound efficacy measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with known genetic dermatological conditions that overlap with AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females who are pregnant, wishing to become pregnant during the study, or are&#xD;
             breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects and parent(s)/legal guardian(s) who are unable to communicate, read or&#xD;
             understand the local language(s), or who display another condition, which in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion, makes them unsuitable for clinical study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are family members of the clinical study site, clinical study staff, or&#xD;
             sponsor, or family members of enrolled subjects (subjects enrolled in other studies of&#xD;
             ARQ-151 cream) living in the same house.&#xD;
