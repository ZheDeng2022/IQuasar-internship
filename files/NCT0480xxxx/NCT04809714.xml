  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to study the use of blood flow restriction therapy (BFR) to augment&#xD;
      routine post-operative physical therapy in elderly patients (age &gt;= 65) after recovering from&#xD;
      surgical treatment of hip fractures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For elderly patients, a hip fracture is a life-altering event associated with poor overall&#xD;
      outcomes despite early surgical treatment. The elderly population and those with significant&#xD;
      osteopenia is growing exponentially and thus the optimal treatment and rehabilitation of hip&#xD;
      fractures warrants increased investigation. Despite numerous interventions, falls plague the&#xD;
      elderly population and hip fractures remain a very common problem for this population that&#xD;
      needs to be addressed. Rapid deconditioning plays a significant role in patient morbidity&#xD;
      following hip surgery. Recently, blood flow restriction (BFR) treatment has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective in improving muscle strength when combined with low load resistance training&#xD;
      physical therapy programs in elderly patients. Few studies have examined BFR in&#xD;
      post-operative orthopedic trauma patients. The investigators aim to study the use of BFR to&#xD;
      augment post-operative physical therapy in elderly patients (age &gt;= 65) in the first 2-weeks&#xD;
      after recovering from surgical treatment of hip fractures. Due to the profound muscle atrophy&#xD;
      that occurs in the immediate postoperative period because of immobility and disuse, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that BFR may provide an anabolic effect and conserve muscle&#xD;
      strength. The investigators hypothesis was inspired by the findings of the Nobel Prize in&#xD;
      Physiology 2019 which describes how varying levels of oxygen shape both physiology and&#xD;
      pathology. This is a prospective, randomized blinded 2-week study of elderly patients&#xD;
      recovering from surgical treatment of hip fractures with two arms: 1) routine post-op&#xD;
      physical therapy 2) routine physical therapy + BFR and neuromuscular electrical stimulation&#xD;
      (NMES) beginning on postoperative day 1 and occurring 5 days per week for 2 weeks. To&#xD;
      optimize safety, the study will be in an inpatient-only setting and supervised by team&#xD;
      members certified in the application of BFR. The investigators plan to apply lessons learned&#xD;
      to a larger 8-week intervention upon completion of this short-term pilot study. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, this is the first study to use BFR in postoperative geriatric patients. Main&#xD;
      outcomes will include thigh leg circumference on postoperative day 1 and at the end of week&#xD;
      2, adverse event log for complications, knee extension strength via handheld dynamometry&#xD;
      (HHD) at post-op day 1 and week 2, gait speed, functional tests including timed up and go,&#xD;
      opioid MME (morphine milligram equivalent) consumption and patient perceived pain and quality&#xD;
      of life measures. The investigators anticipate BFR therapy will be tolerated well, improve&#xD;
      global patient health and satisfaction, lead to lower extremity muscle hypertrophy, and&#xD;
      enhance functional recovery after geriatric hip fracture carrying tremendous potential for&#xD;
      extramural funding and scientific advancement.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The control group will undergo a graduated therapy protocol that mirrors that of the intervention group except that they will use a Delfi tourniquet system blood pressure cuff with a limb occlusion pressure (LOP) of only 10%. This is compared to the intervention group that will have a therapeutic LOP of 60-100%. This means that patients will have a cuff on their limb and are thus blinded to their group allocation but the pressure is set to such a low level that no additional effect on muscle hypertrophy is expected based on prior research.</masking_description>
