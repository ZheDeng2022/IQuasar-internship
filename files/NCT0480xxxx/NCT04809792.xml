      This study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of using MR-guided adaptive Head and Neck&#xD;
      stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT) at each fraction on the 1.5T MR-Linac.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (OCC), stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) (35-&#xD;
      50 Gy in 5 fractions delivered 2x/week) has been employed in a subgroup of palliative Head&#xD;
      and Neck cancer (HNC) patients, as part of an institutional protocol, when greater tumor&#xD;
      response is desirable when compared to more palliative regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MR-Linac has been approved by Health Canada for radiation treatment. With superior soft&#xD;
      tissue contrast and the possibility for daily plan adaptation, it allows for higher treatment&#xD;
      precision delivery, improved target coverage and greater normal tissue sparing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a first step, this study will evaluate the feasibility and safety of using the 1.5T&#xD;
      MR-Linac on patients with HNC who are treated with SBRT.&#xD;
