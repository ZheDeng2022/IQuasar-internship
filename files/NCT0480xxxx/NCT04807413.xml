  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhaled nitric oxide is a widely accepted standard of care for pulmonary hypertension, and&#xD;
      has been studied in the context of cardiac surgery. CPB during cardiac surgery induces&#xD;
      systemic inflammatory response and ischemic-reperfusion injury of many organs. Nitric oxide&#xD;
      added to the bypass circuit may have anti-inflammatory effect and has shown the potential to&#xD;
      ameliorate organs' injury .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that the delivery of nitric oxide to the oxygenator gas flow during&#xD;
      pediatric CPB is accompanied by a reduction in myocardial injury markers' levels in the&#xD;
      postoperative period. In adults, NO supply to the CPB circuit during CABG exerted a&#xD;
      cardioprotective effect and was associated with a lower level of inotropic support and&#xD;
      cardio-specific blood markers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, this is the first trial to assess whether artificial nitric oxide&#xD;
      supplementation to the CPB-system reduces the incidence of hypoxemia after cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      This prospective, single center, double blinded, interventional trial will be conducted at&#xD;
      Rabin Medical Center Beilinson Hospital. Adult patients undergoing CABG and valve&#xD;
      replacement/ repair surgeries will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All The participant will sign an informed consent prior to any procedures being done&#xD;
      specifically for the purpose of the study, in the departmental ward on the day of surgery&#xD;
      when they are not under the influence of sedatives and are not in pain. The study design and&#xD;
      patient requirements will all be explained to the patient by the study investigator&#xD;
      throughout the consent process. Participants will have the opportunity to carefully review&#xD;
      the written consent form and ask questions prior to signing. All consent forms will be&#xD;
      IRB-approved. Each participant will receive a signed copy of the informed consent document&#xD;
      for their record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment allocation will be performed by an independent investigator who will not be&#xD;
      directly involved in the participants' treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All other study investigators will be blinded to a group assignment. All study participants&#xD;
      will be blinded to a treatment arm allocation. Upon consent, all study participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitric oxide balloon will be connected to the CPB machine. Study Arm: The balloon will be&#xD;
      opened to deliver nitric oxide at 40 ppm. Control Arm: The balloon will be closed and no&#xD;
      nitric oxide will be delivered. Following randomization, all study participants will undergo&#xD;
      the surgery according to standard clinical practice. In the surgery room all study&#xD;
      participants will be connected to a standard anesthesia monitor and will be monitored&#xD;
      according to standard clinical practice, which will include monitoring according to ASA&#xD;
      standards, insertion of an arterial line and a CVP catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the study will not affect the anesthetic, surgical and cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass management in any way. The anesthetic protocol administered to the study participant&#xD;
      is at the attending anesthesiologists' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to treatment arm allocation, all study participants will be monitored during&#xD;
      surgery and followed-up throughout their duration of stay in the ICU and at the department&#xD;
      ward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the follow-up, study participants' blood tests and vital signs, as routinely&#xD;
      monitored, will be collected and documented.&#xD;
