  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through this study, a group composed of multiple sclerosis patients will be compared to a&#xD;
      healthy volunteers group to determine if the positive emotions recognitions is preserved in&#xD;
      the first group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Different studies have highlighted the specific deficiency concerning emotions recognition in&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis are reported to have more difficulty&#xD;
      recognising negative emotions, especially anger and fear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, RECODE study has a twofold objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the positive emotions recognition remains preserved by combining&#xD;
           behavioural and neurophysiological measures (electrodermal activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study this disorder's etiology through a comparison between a multiple sclerosis&#xD;
           patient group and a control group (matched in sex, age, and education's level).&#xD;
