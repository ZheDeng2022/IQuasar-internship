      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders of hearing instability (HI) are poorly characterized and ineffectively treated. HI&#xD;
      can cause fluctuations in hearing thresholds and speech understanding. Researchers want to&#xD;
      use a specialized form of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and blood tests to learn more&#xD;
      about HI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize a cohort of people with HI and to correlate HI with other data, including&#xD;
      hearing evaluations, as well as radiologic and immunologic biomarkers of inflammation over&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18-65 who have symptoms consistent with possible HI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical and hearing history and medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have physical exams. Their head and neck will be examined. They will have&#xD;
      blood drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have hearing tests. They will wear headphones or foam earplugs. They will&#xD;
      listen to different tones. They may describe what they hear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have balance tests. They will wear goggles as they watch moving lights or&#xD;
      while cold or warm air is blown into their ears. They will sit in a spinning chair in a&#xD;
      quiet, dark booth. From a reclining position, they will raise their head while clicking&#xD;
      sounds are played into their ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have MRIs of the inner ear and brain. The MRI scanner is a metal cylinder&#xD;
      surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the MRIs, participants will lie on a table that&#xD;
      slides in and out of the scanner. Soft padding or a coil will be placed around their head.&#xD;
      They will get a contrast agent through an intravenous catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 15 months.&#xD;

      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deep Phenotyping of Hearing Instability Disorders: Cohort Establishment, Biomarker&#xD;
      Identification, Development of Novel Phenotyping Measures and Discovery of Therapeutic&#xD;
      Targets&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disorders of hearing instability remain poorly characterized, phenotyped and ineffectively&#xD;
      treated, and may result in sudden changes in hearing. These disorders include, but are not&#xD;
      limited to, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) as well as hearing fluctuation,&#xD;
      including, but not limited to, autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), Meniere s disease (MD)&#xD;
      and enlarged vestibular aqueduct syndrome (EVAS). While this group of disorders is likely to&#xD;
      be clinically and etiologically heterogeneous, a common feature is fluctuation of hearing&#xD;
      thresholds and speech understanding as measured by word recognition scores (WRS). This&#xD;
      protocol seeks to ascertain a cohort of patients with hearing fluctuation to correlate these&#xD;
      main phenotypic features with other phenomic data including audiometric indicators of&#xD;
      endolymphatic hydrops as well as radiologic and immunologic biomarkers of inflammation over&#xD;
      time. The overall hypothesis is that phenomic data will enable stratification of the&#xD;
      phenotype of patients with hearing instability disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To develop a cohort of patients with hearing instability (HI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To correlate evidence of HI with changes in phase-shift distortion product otoacoustic&#xD;
           emissions (DPOAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare phase-shift DPOAEs to existing measures of auditory function including word&#xD;
           recognition score (WRS), standard DPOAEs, and electrocochleography (ECochG) over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare phase-shift DPOAEs to vestibular measures including cervical and ocular&#xD;
           vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMPs) over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To correlate auditory and vestibular indicators of hearing instability and endolymphatic&#xD;
           hydrops (EH) on MRI with quantitative differences in immunologic markers of inflammation&#xD;
           over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To stratify patients with hearing instability (HI) by differences in cytokine levels,&#xD;
           which will inform the identification of clinical subtypes of HI and potentially identify&#xD;
           therapeutic targets for future treatment with targeted agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To perform transcriptional and immunoprofiling of PBMCs at time points associated with&#xD;
           hearing fluctuation from phenotyped patient cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Identification of phenomic features associated with HI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) Identification of a variety of phenomic features of patients with HI that allow&#xD;
      assignment to clinical subdivisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of potential targets for therapeutics based on longitudinal&#xD;
           immune/transcriptional profiling of patients with hearing instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of subtype-specific immune cell distributions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of immune profiles as well as immune cell transcriptional profiles&#xD;
           related to hearing fluctuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will ascertain patients who reside within the United States and exhibit HI.&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo an informed consent process . Patients of all genders and all&#xD;

        This study will enroll up to a total of 150 patients with HI. The enrollment target is&#xD;
        between 10-30 patients per clinical subtype for at least 2 clinical subtypes of HI (i.e.,&#xD;
        without or with EH, without or with significant immune cell, cytokine or FLAIR positivity).&#xD;
        20 cytokines/chemokines in patients with Meniere s disease that revealed statistically&#xD;
        higher levels of IL-1Beta compared to healthy controls (Flook et al., 2019), a sample size&#xD;
        of 40-50 patients would be required for 80% power to detect an immune subtype associated&#xD;
        with IL-1Beta.&#xD;
