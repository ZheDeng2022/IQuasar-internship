  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to find out more about how corneal sensory fibres react to different types of&#xD;
      stimuli (liquid / tactile / nylon thread) and how this can be consciously perceived by the&#xD;
      individual. Is it possible to generate a stimulus that delivers a repeatable and reliable&#xD;
      response within a useful stimulus force range which allows an interpretation / evaluation of&#xD;
      normal / expected activity of superficial nerve fibres in the cornea? The study group will be&#xD;
      divided into three groups of individuals: two groups with different types of contact lenses&#xD;
      (CL) and one without CL, as sensitivity changes are thought to occur with CL wear. A very&#xD;
      interesting research question is to find out, if such sensitivity differences can be detected&#xD;
      with the nature of the stimuli applied in this study.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to gain more physiological knowledge about ocular surface sensation&#xD;
      (corneal sensitivity), with application of three different concepts employing different types&#xD;
      of stimuli for triggering a response from the pain sensitive nerve endings in the superficial&#xD;
      cornea: 1) tactile method: a round plastic nozzle (2 mm diameter) is applied to the ocular&#xD;
      surface with a defined, low force for a duration of 100ms. 2) liquid jet method: a liquid jet&#xD;
      (isotonic saline) of a temperature to match ocular surface temperature is applied to the&#xD;
      ocular surface with low pressure and low volume, from a distance of 15 mm.3) commercially&#xD;
      available Cochet Bonnet esthesiometer (nylon thread). The study group will be divided into&#xD;
      three groups of individuals: two groups with different types of contact lenses (CL) and one&#xD;
      without CL, as sensitivity changes are thought to occur with CL wear. A very interesting&#xD;
      research question is to find out, if such sensitivity differences can be detected with the&#xD;
      nature of the stimuli applied in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge about human corneal sensitivity is limited, as applied methods for ocular&#xD;
      surface sensation measurement are limited with regards to reproducibility / accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corneal sensitivity represents a neurological response from the free nerve endings within the&#xD;
      epithelium. They are sensitive to mechanical, electrical, chemical or thermal stimuli and&#xD;
      hence have a protective function for the cornea. Corneal nerves play an important role in&#xD;
      cell growth and proliferation of epithelial cells, wound healing and repair. In experimental&#xD;
      studies, corneal denervation has been reported to result in epithelial changes: increased&#xD;
      permeability, decreased proliferation, changed appearance and delayed wound healing.&#xD;
      Therefore, intact corneal innervation is required to maintain the integrity of a normal&#xD;
      corneal epithelium. Corneal sensory nerves are believed to play an important role in&#xD;
      maintaining the resting tear flow, as their afferent impulses from the ocular surface lead to&#xD;
      a reflex response, best described by the lacrimal functional unit: an integrated system&#xD;
      comprising the ocular surface tissues (cornea, corneal limbus, conjunctiva, conjunctival&#xD;
      blood vessels, and eyelids), the tear secreting components (main and accessory lacrimal&#xD;
      glands, meibomian glands, conjunctival goblet, and epithelial cells), and the sensory and&#xD;
      motor nerves that connect them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current knowledge about ocular surface sensitivity is insufficient, as currently available&#xD;
      measurement possibilities lack repeatability and accuracy. Before a new instrument can be&#xD;
      developed, more research is required, in order to find a suitable concept for precise&#xD;
      sensitivity measurement. For this purpose, two new different concepts with different / new&#xD;
      stimulus types will be applied repeatably on healthy eyes in this study. The aim is to find&#xD;
      out more about how corneal sensory fibres react to different types of stimuli (liquid /&#xD;
      tactile / nylon thread) and how this can be consciously perceived by the individual. Is it&#xD;
      possible to generate a stimulus that delivers a repeatable and reliable response within a&#xD;
      useful stimulus force range which allows an interpretation / evaluation of normal / expected&#xD;
      activity of superficial nerve fibres in the cornea? The study group will be divided into&#xD;
      three groups of individuals: two groups with different types of contact lenses (CL) and one&#xD;
      without CL, as sensitivity changes are thought to occur with CL wear.&#xD;
