  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) effects on patients suffering from traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      have received little attention. Moreover, there is limited evidence that serum levels of&#xD;
      thyroid-related hormones might influence functional outcome in the acute phase of brain&#xD;
      damage. However, the relationship is complex, and the relevance for functional outcome and&#xD;
      the question of therapeutic interventions remain the subject of ongoing researches .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, a wide range of brain damage markers have been examined in TBI patients.&#xD;
      However, owing to the limited tissue specificity and other concerns, most markers, including&#xD;
      neuro-specific enolase and S100B protein, were compromised in routine clinical use .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was recently reported to have greater prognostic value&#xD;
      than other biomarkers in TBI patients as a monomeric intermediate filament protein&#xD;
      concentrated in the astroglial cytoskeleton; GFAP is specific to brain tissue and is not&#xD;
      routinely found in peripheral blood circulation. However, GFAP is released after astrocyte&#xD;
      death, making it an ideal candidate marker for brain injury patients . Several studies have&#xD;
      found that the serum levels of GFAP on admission were significantly increased in TBI&#xD;
      patients, also a correlation between serum concentrations and the pathological types of brain&#xD;
      damage and clinical outcomes were also reported . However, the changes in serum GFAP over&#xD;
      time and the associated predictive utility over the acute days post injury are largely&#xD;
      unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the hypothesis of euthyroid sick syndrome (ESS) traumatic brain injury patients and&#xD;
      its relation with GFAP.&#xD;

      After obtaining the approval of research ethical committee of faculty of medicine ,El-Minia&#xD;
      university and taking informed written consent from the participants or their relatives, this&#xD;
      prospective cross sectional non randomized observational study will be conducted in emergency&#xD;
      ICU of anesthesiology and intensive care department in El-Minia university hospital ,on&#xD;
      Patients suffering from isolated moderate to severe traumatic brain injury GCS (12-3) during&#xD;
      the period from January2021 to December 2021. Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      patients who met eligibility criteria, the prognosis and outcome of traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      will be observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history Glasgow coma scale (GCS) on admission and daily Brain computerized tomography&#xD;
      (CT) on admission ,3rd and 5th days Thyroid functions fT3, fT4, TSH and rT3.will be assessed&#xD;
      on admission, after24h, 3rd and 7th days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APACHE II score (&quot;Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II &quot;) Which will be assessed&#xD;
      in admission day&#xD;
&#xD;
      SOFA score The sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA score), Which will be assessed&#xD;
      every day. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). On admission ,1st,3rd and 7th days&#xD;
      Mechanical ventilation. Length of ICU Stay. Short term outcome after 28 days.&#xD;
