      Evaluation of the physiological and clinical effects of the biofeedback training with&#xD;
      patients suffering from somatoform disorders, depending on their neurovegetative profile&#xD;
      related to a visceral-brain decoupling.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Somatoform disorders [SD] are defined as physiological function or organ disturbances&#xD;
      unexplained by a specific diagnosis criterion. Some approaches have recently defended the&#xD;
      idea of common factors of vulnerability behind the large variability of the clinical symptoms&#xD;
      regarding the SD. In this context, the lead of the neurovegetative disturbances started&#xD;
      receiving attention following some studies that suggested the autonomic nervous system [ANS]&#xD;
      disturbances concerning a somatoform disorder, independently of its form. Two different&#xD;
      neurovegetative endophenotypes (individual autonomic profiles) were highlighted: a functional&#xD;
      neurovegetative profile (high vagal tone) and a dysfunctional neurovegetative profile (low&#xD;
      vagal tone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A dysfunctional neurovegetative profile could be accompanied by a chronic decoupling in the&#xD;
      brain-visceral axis according as the ANS is considered as a bidirectional communication&#xD;
      system linked the central nervous system [CNS] and the viscera. Depending on the types of the&#xD;
      neurovegetative profiles, different degrees of cognitive-emotional vulnerability and a higher&#xD;
      or a lower level of acceptance of the illness could be supposed. Finally, recent findings&#xD;
      defend the idea of the traumatic experiences as a determining factor to develop a SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance to the last notions regarding the SD, some therapeutic approaches could be&#xD;
      interesting specifically techniques focusing on the vagal nerve. In this context, biofeedback&#xD;
      [BFB] could provide a powerful method to restore the clinical and physiological impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, the main objective is to evaluate the physiological and clinical effects of&#xD;
      the BFB training with patients suffering from SD: Irritable Bowel Syndrome [IBS] or&#xD;
      Psychogenic Non Epileptic Seizure [PNES]. The investigators make the prediction that the&#xD;
      patients will be more or less responding to the biofeedback depending on their&#xD;
      neurovegetative profile. A clustering will be performed in advance to identify the patients&#xD;
      having a dysfunctional neurovegetative profile and patients having a functional&#xD;
      neurovegetative profile. It will also permit to the investigators to confirm the hypothesis&#xD;
      about the existence of two neurovegetative profiles related to a visceral-brain decoupling&#xD;
      concerning the SD, independently of its form. To attest to it, 2 types of somatoform&#xD;
      disorders will be analyzed: the irritable bowel syndrome manifesting by peripheral symptoms&#xD;
      and the psychogenic non-epileptic seizures manifesting by central symptoms. Then the&#xD;
      investigators will carry out a psycho-social exploration to demonstrate a higher&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional vulnerability and a higher traumatic event incidence in this particular&#xD;
      population, depending on their autonomic profiles.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study requires 3 sessions (T1 / T2 / T3) with at least 24 days between each. The period (24 days) between the first session and the second session (T1-T2) will be considered as the control period. During the period, the participants will practice none exercise. The period (24 days) between the second session and the third session (T2-T3) will be considered as the intervention period. At the end of the second session (T2), the participants will be separated into two inter-subject groups: an experimental group performing BFB technique (3X5 min per day) in the intervention period (T2-T3) and a control group not performing a specific exercise in the intervention period (T2-T3).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>BFB consists of a physiological recording used as a visual physiological feedback that can teach us how to control our physiology, which is naturally unconscious and uncontrollable. The BFB focused on the heart rate variability (HRV-BFB) could regulate the autonomic nervous system (vagal tone and sympathetic-parasympathetic balance) and the emotional state. The HRV BFB has received several clinical and experimental confirmations as a physiological remediation method. It is an innovative and non-pharmacological therapy frequently used to relieve stress.</description>
