  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain metastases are the most common brain tumors in adults. It is estimated that around&#xD;
      10-30% of cancer patients would develop brain metastases during the course of their illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with&#xD;
      brain metastases. WBRT yields high radiologic response rate (27~56%) and is effective in&#xD;
      rapid palliation of neurologic symptoms as well as prolongs time to neurocognitive function&#xD;
      decline caused by intracranial lesions. By using conventional fractionation, more than one-&#xD;
      third of patients developed late neurocognitive toxicity while memory impairment was the most&#xD;
      common symptom. The incidence is even higher when a formal and sensitive neurocognitive&#xD;
      assessment was prospectively evaluated. With more long-term survivors nowadays, it has become&#xD;
      increasingly important to minimize neurocognitive function decline and maintain quality of&#xD;
      life in patients with brain metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The function of hippocampus is cooperation in learning, consolidation and retrieval of&#xD;
      information and essential for formation of new memories. Bilateral and unilateral radiation&#xD;
      injury of the hippocampus is known to alter learning and memory formation. Several&#xD;
      preclinical studies support the hypothesis of hippocampus-mediated cognitive dysfunction by&#xD;
      ionizing radiation. Clinical studies show increase in radiation dose to hippocampus is&#xD;
      associated with subsequent neurocognitive function impairment in adult and pediatric&#xD;
      patients. Furthermore, the result of phase III randomized trials suggested hippocampal&#xD;
      avoidance plus Memantine significantly reduce the risk of neurocognitive impairment at 6&#xD;
      months from 68.2% in control arm with standard WBRT to 59.5% in experimental arm. In the&#xD;
      investigator's prior investigation, patients received conformal WBRT with bilateral&#xD;
      hippocampal avoidance also had significant less declines in verbal memory at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies showed the right and left hippocampus exert different neurocognitive&#xD;
      functions. Several retrospective studies also demonstrated that the radiation dose to the&#xD;
      left hippocampus is more related to neurocognitive impairment. Planning study and&#xD;
      investigation showed that by avoiding the left hippocampus alone, the radiation dose to the&#xD;
      spared unilateral hippocampus is further decreased. In present study, a single blind&#xD;
      randomized phase II trial is designed to investigate the effectiveness of neurocognitive&#xD;
      function preservation using conformal WBRT with bilateral or unilateral hippocampal avoidance&#xD;
      and memantine.&#xD;
