  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune metabolic disease characterised by impaired lack of&#xD;
      endogenous insulin causing elevated plasma glucose levels and increased risk of microvascular&#xD;
      and macrovascular complications. With respect to the cardiovascular system, patients with T1D&#xD;
      have an up to 10-fold increased risk of sudden cardiac death compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
      Furthermore, diabetes constitutes a hypercoagulable state, which to some extent may explain&#xD;
      why cardiovascular disease still is a major cause of mortality in patients with T1D. Due to&#xD;
      treatment with exogenously delivered insulin, glycaemic variability with intra-day and&#xD;
      inter-day plasma glucose concentrations fluctuating between high levels (peaks) and low&#xD;
      levels (nadirs), are inevitable in patients with T1D. A potentially important factor in&#xD;
      development of cardiovascular disease, associated with glycaemic variability, is the rate of&#xD;
      increase and/or decline of plasma glucose. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that a rapid plasma glucose decline from a hyperglycaemic level to an euglycaemic level can&#xD;
      induce changes in QT-interval and blood coagulation in a proarrhythmogenic and prothrombotic&#xD;
      way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty patients with T1D with a 1:1 distribution with chronic hyperglycaemia (HbA1C ≥63&#xD;
      mmol/mol) and with well-controlled diabetes (HbA1C ≤53 mmol/mol) will be recruited for a&#xD;
      crossover study including two test days (protocols), P-rapid, a combined hyperglycaemic and&#xD;
      euglycaemic clamp with rapidly declining plasma glucose and P-slow, a combined hyperglycaemic&#xD;
      and euglycaemic clamp with slowly declining plasma glucose. Patients will be randomised 1:1&#xD;
      to start with P-rapid or P-slow. The cardiovascular effects will be investigated using&#xD;
      Holter-ECG, Thrombelastography, Echocardiography and blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in patients with T1D and that&#xD;
      patients with diabetes may be more susceptible for cardiac arrhythmias and thrombotic events&#xD;
      compared to healthy individuals, it is important to identify cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
      related to acute changes in plasma glucose in order to improve prevention strategies and&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
