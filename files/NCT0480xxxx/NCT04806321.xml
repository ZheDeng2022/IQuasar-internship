  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this trial is to examine the effectiveness of a universal, self-guided, digital&#xD;
      single-session intervention focusing on problem-solving skills in improving adolescent mental&#xD;
      health and well-being, relative to an active control intervention focusing on study skills,&#xD;
      within the context of school settings during the coronavirus disease pandemic.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 20% of adolescents will experience at least one mental health disorder or problem&#xD;
      before adulthood that warrants treatment, yet 80% of these adolescents will never receive&#xD;
      care. This need-to-access gap appears to be heightened during the current coronavirus disease&#xD;
      pandemic and its resulting disruptions to healthcare and education systems. Both within and&#xD;
      beyond the context of the pandemic, preventive mental health interventions are positioned to&#xD;
      help adolescents build and strengthen coping strategies that can preclude the emergence of&#xD;
      mental health difficulties that require more resource-intensive levels of clinical care.&#xD;
      Preventive mental health interventions delivered via digital platforms and within&#xD;
      school-based settings might be especially scalable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current school-based trial is designed to test one such strategy that harnesses&#xD;
      technology to boost the scalability of adolescent mental health interventions: a brief (one&#xD;
      30 minute session) digital program designed to empower adolescents (10-14 years old) to&#xD;
      solve, rather than be overwhelmed by, everyday problems (Project SOLVE). Single-session&#xD;
      interventions designed to help adolescents cultivate adaptive mindsets have reduced anxiety&#xD;
      and depression among adolescents with and without elevated symptoms of these disorders.&#xD;
      Building on this strong foundation, Project SOLVE targets these mental health challenges with&#xD;
      problem solving skills-one of the most versatile, commonly used, and potent therapeutic&#xD;
      techniques for adolescents.&#xD;
