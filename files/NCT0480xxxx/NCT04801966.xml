  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is looking at outcomes in people with advanced cancers who have exhausted standard&#xD;
      treatment options and are accessing off indication or unregistered drugs or combinations of&#xD;
      drugs through compassionate access from the manufacturer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some advanced cancers have numerous standard treatment options that have proven efficacy in&#xD;
      clinical trials. However, in other cancers, there may be few or no standard treatment options&#xD;
      with proven efficacy as determined in a large clinical trial. This may be particularly the&#xD;
      case for rare cancers in which there is a lack of clinical research. When seriously ill&#xD;
      patients run out of standard treatment options, they will often consider non-standard&#xD;
      treatment options (such as treatments that are currently unapproved by the regulatory agency&#xD;
      for the given indication). The majority of clinicians and researchers agree that this is best&#xD;
      received in a clinical trial setting as this provides ethical and clinical oversight, as well&#xD;
      as addresses prospectively defined research questions which can be publicly reported. This&#xD;
      allows the conclusions of the research to be available to the entire clinical and research&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, an access program enables patient access to a non-reimbursed therapeutic agent,&#xD;
      outside of a clinical trial setting. Compassionate access is typically for therapeutics that&#xD;
      are not yet approved or TGA registered, and are still considered investigational. In general,&#xD;
      there is a negotiation between the pharmaceutical company and the clinician and patient&#xD;
      regarding access to the therapeutic agent, as well as whether the medicine will be provided&#xD;
      free of charge, or on some form of cost-sharing arrangement. In Australia, access to TGA&#xD;
      non-registered medicines also requires an application via the &quot;Special Access Scheme&quot;. For&#xD;
      most cancer patients, the use falls under category A, for a patient defined as seriously ill.&#xD;
      This sub-study generally pertains to compassionate access to therapeutic agents. Given the ad&#xD;
      hoc nature of compassionate access for patients, there is relatively little reported data on&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compassionate access is an established process with increasing demands. This study is&#xD;
      designed to provide a framework for which patients treated with compassionate access&#xD;
      therapeutics can register, so that some of the limitations of ad hoc compassionate access&#xD;
      programs can be overcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study committee will prospectively assess each individual patient's detailed treatment&#xD;
      approach in an objective and time-efficient manner. If approved, the patient may be eligible&#xD;
      to register into the treatment phase of the study. The study committee is essential to&#xD;
      provide a balanced approach to understanding the rationale for the study treatment, as well&#xD;
      as potential safety issues that may arise. As previously reported, this is an essential&#xD;
      component to improving patient oversight as well as equity&#xD;

             Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 must be present outside the CNS Metastases are&#xD;
             limited to the cerebellum or the supratentorial region (i.e. no metastases to the&#xD;
             midbrain, pons, medulla, or spinal cord) There is no clinical evidence of interim&#xD;
             progression between completion of CNS-directed therapy and registration on the study&#xD;
             (radiological re-assessment is not required) The patient has not received radiotherapy&#xD;
             within 14 days prior to registration Anticonvulsant therapy at a stable dose is&#xD;
             permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of leptomeningeal disease unless a primary brain tumour&#xD;

&#xD;
        Additional inclusion and/or exclusion criteria for the main study will be stipulated in the&#xD;
