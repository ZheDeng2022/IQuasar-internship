  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent EMA and FDA approvals have made immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) a standard of care&#xD;
      in cancer treatment. ICI, used alone or as a combination are now the backbone of renal cell&#xD;
      and lung carcinoma treatment. However, a significant proportion of patients does not respond&#xD;
      to ICI. Thus the identification of predictive response factor is a major issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While factors associated with the tumour and its micro environment have been widely studied,&#xD;
      factors associated with the patient such as metabolism could also affect the response to ICI&#xD;
      and remain poorly studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that dysmetabolims, via the induction of a chronic&#xD;
      inflammatory state could induce a defect of lymphocyte production and activation as well as a&#xD;
      modification of the immunogenicity of tumor cells and immune cells infiltration. The&#xD;
      consequences could be a decrease in ICI response rate as well as an increase in immune&#xD;
      related adverse events (irAEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, the investigators propose a prospective bi-centric exploratory study&#xD;
      including 60 patients treated with ICI for advanced lung or renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will be :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical (calorimetry, impedancemetry, survey of eating habits, tumour characteristics,&#xD;
           epidemiological data),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biologics (baseline and 3-months plasma bio banking for standard biology, inflammation&#xD;
           markers TNF- α, IL1-6-8-11-17, TGF-ß, TWEAK, complement study C3, C4, C4d, CH50, C1q,&#xD;
           CD46)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective is to assess the response to ICI depending on metabolic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to study the relationships between metabolism / cytokines profile/&#xD;
      complement profile and ICI response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to generate hypotheses and to obtain exploratory data before&#xD;
      submission of a Hospital Clinical Research Program whose objective will be to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of dysmetabolism on overall survival and to characterize immune and&#xD;
      anatomopathological profiles (using DNA microarrays and flow cytometry techinques) of&#xD;
      patients treated with ICI for renal cell or lung carcinoma.&#xD;
