      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients or their legal&#xD;
      guardians giving written informed consent will be screened for study eligibility. Patients&#xD;
      who meet the eligibility requirements will participate in a 16-week, flexibly-dosed,&#xD;
      open-label trial of buspirone. The dose of buspirone will be adjusted over the first 12 weeks&#xD;
      of the study and a stable dose will be maintained for the final four weeks of the trial.&#xD;
      Adverse effects will be reviewed at each visit and standardized measures of anxiety will be&#xD;
      conducted at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16.&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of Participants Who Responded to Treatment at 16 Weeks According to the Improvement Item of the Clinical Global Impression-Scale (Response Defined as CGI-I=1 or CGI-I=2)</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinical Global Impressions Global Improvement (CGI-I) is designed to take into account all factors to arrive at an assessment of response to treatment. The CGI-I scale ranges from 1 to 7 (1=very much improved; 2=much improved; 3=minimally improved; 4=no change; 5=minimally worse; 6=much worse; 7=very much worse), with lower scales indicating improvement (1=very much improved; 2=much improved). In this study, the CGI-I will be focused on the target symptom of anxiety. Participants with a CGI-I score of 1 or 2 will be classified as responders. The CGI-I will be administered at weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16.</description>

    <measure>Mean 16-Week Change in Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Screen for Childhood Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders (SCARED) includes both a child/self-report and parent-report form, each containing 41-items. It is used to screen for symptoms of panic disorder, separation anxiety disorder, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and school phobia. Total score ranges from 0-82 and a total score of 25 or greater may indicate the presence of an anxiety disorder.</description>

    <measure>Mean 16-Week Change in Each Subscale of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC-2) is a caregiver rated instrument that measures psychiatric symptoms and behavioral disturbance in subjects with developmental disability with 5 subscales: Irritability, Social Withdrawal/Lethargy, Stereotypy, Hyperactivity, and Inappropriate Speech. Each item of the 58-item scale is scored on a 4-point scale (0=never a problem to 3=severe problem). The interpretation of the tool and its sub-scales is that a greater number of items indicates greater severity. The range of scores per subscale are: Irritability 0-45; Social Withdrawal/Lethargy 0-48; Stereotypy 0-21; Hyperactivity 0-48; Inappropriate Speech 0-12.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive buspirone 2.5 mg each morning at the start of the trial. The dose will be increased by 2.5 mg per week in two divided doses daily depending on effectiveness and tolerability. The optimal dose will be reached by week 12 of treatment. The minimum starting dose will be 2.5 mg and the maximum total daily dose will be 30 mg. Medication will be dosed twice daily due to the short half-life (2-3 hours) of this medication.</description>

    <description>All participants in the study will receive open-label treatment with orally administered buspirone for the full duration of the 16-week trial. Buspirone has high affinity for serotonin 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D2 receptors. It is approved for the management of generalized anxiety disorder in adults.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 5 to 65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of WS confirmed via genetic testing or a clinical diagnosis made by a&#xD;
             clinician with significant experience treating patients with WS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically significant anxiety as evidenced by a Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS)&#xD;
             score of 10 or greater (5-item scale). The PARS (&quot;The Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale&#xD;
             (PARS): Development and psychometric properties.&quot; 2002) was chosen as an inclusion&#xD;
             criterion (and outcome measure) since it assesses severity across common anxiety&#xD;
             disorders in children including generalized anxiety, social anxiety, separation&#xD;
             anxiety, and transition-associated anxiety. In addition, it is an instrument that&#xD;
             allows the clinician to incorporate both child and parent report into a final&#xD;
             clinician-rated score for each item.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Abbreviated IQ ≥ 50 on the Stanford Binet 5th Edition or WASI-II, depending on&#xD;
             participant age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. A Clinical Global Impression Severity Item score ≥ 4 (moderate) for anxiety symptoms&#xD;
             at Screen and Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis of OCD, posttraumatic stress disorder, major mood disorder, psychotic&#xD;
             disorder, or substance use disorder. These disorders are exclusionary since the&#xD;
             primary treatment of these disorders may require acute psychosocial treatments or&#xD;
             other medications that would confound the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of any past or present conditions that would make treatment with buspirone&#xD;
             unsafe. This includes allergy to buspirone, liver or kidney disease, and pregnancy (or&#xD;
             being sexually active without using acceptable methods to prevent pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine&#xD;
             reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), benzodiazepines, antihistamines, or antipsychotics.&#xD;
             Subjects will need to be off medications from these classes for at least 5 elimination&#xD;
             half-lives prior to beginning the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of other psychotropic medications which are ineffective, poorly tolerated, or&#xD;
             sub-optimal in terms of dose. A board-certified child and adolescent psychiatrist will&#xD;
             assess any other psychotropic medications being used and determine whether they are&#xD;
             effective, tolerated, and optimal in terms of dose. Concurrent use of a psychotropic&#xD;
             medication (other than SSRIs, SNRIs, benzodiazepines, antihistamines, or&#xD;
             antipsychotics) will be allowed if the dose has been stable for 30 days and if they&#xD;
             meet the criteria of effectiveness, tolerability, and dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous adequate trial of buspirone. An adequate trial will be defined as a total&#xD;
             daily dose of ≥20 mg for at least 4 weeks. In addition, subjects who developed&#xD;
             significant adverse effects during a trial of buspirone at any dose or duration will&#xD;
             be excluded.&#xD;
