  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of fiber supplementation on the fecal&#xD;
      metagenome and metabolome in relation to symptoms and anorectal physiology in post-menopausal&#xD;
      women with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea suffering from liquid stool fecal&#xD;
      incontinence (FI.)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study at Massachusetts General Hospital that aims to&#xD;
      recruit post-menopausal female patients with solid stool fecal incontinence. The&#xD;
      investigators hope that subjects taking a daily fiber supplement will experience reduced&#xD;
      episodes and symptoms of fecal incontinence, measured through quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
      and daily stool and food diaries. Subjects will undergo 2 anorectal manometry procedures.&#xD;
      Stool samples will also be collected for metabolomic and metagenomic analysis.&#xD;

    <description>Stool samples will be shipped to Metabolon Inc, for metabolomics profiling on a well-validated high-throughput metabolomics platform. Sample prep and global metabolomics profiling will be conducted using four liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry methods that measure four complementary sets of metabolite classes. Metabolite peaks are quantified using area-under-the curve. Raw area counts for each metabolite in each sample are normalized to correct for variation resulting from inter-day tuning differences by setting the medians to 1.0 for each run. Metabolites are identified by automated comparison of the ion features in the experimental samples to a reference library of ~8,000 chemical standard entries that are curated for quality control using Metabolon software. Coefficients of variations (CVs) will be measured in blinded quality control samples randomly distributed among study samples, and we will analyze and control for batch variation.</description>
