  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective multicenter study of the duration of treatment, the success rate,&#xD;
      the frequency of complications, and the local recurrence rate of 12 months when&#xD;
      Radio-frequency ablation therapy is performed for the treatment of HCC using the 'No touch'&#xD;
      technique as a combined high-frequency transmission mode with Octopus electrodes. It aims to&#xD;
      evaluate through. In addition, the results obtained from this prospective study were as&#xD;
      follows: 1) Patients who underwent Radio-frequency ablation therapy by puncturing an existing&#xD;
      tumor, and 2) Patients who underwent microwave ablation during the study period. The&#xD;
      secondary goal is to evaluate which method is more effective in reducing the treatment time&#xD;
      and recurrence rate compared to.&#xD;

      1. Pre-treatment planning:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The detailed plan of radio frequency ablation (RFA) will be implemented in accordance&#xD;
           with the routine procedure of image evaluation prior to RFA. That is, after confirming&#xD;
           the location of the tumor in the Multiphasic CT or MRI and evaluating the volume of the&#xD;
           tumor and the relationship with adjacent blood vessels before RFA procedure, planning&#xD;
           the insertion path and the number of ablation of the electrode for RFA, the recently&#xD;
           used US- The CT-MR fusion tool is used to fuse the pre-treatment image and the&#xD;
           ultrasound image to evaluate whether the tumor location on the ultrasound image matches&#xD;
           the tumor found on the pre-treatment image. The location will be evaluated in real time.&#xD;
           The end of the procedure is when an echo bubble of 5 mm to 10 mm or more is generated&#xD;
           around the treated tumor, and it is confirmed that the enhancement of HCC disappears&#xD;
           completely after RFA in immediate post procedure CT. In addition, if the boundary of the&#xD;
           tumor is not well drawn on ultrasound, CEUS will be additionally used to confirm the&#xD;
           location of the tumor. At this time, the ultrasonic fusion device to be used will be one&#xD;
           of Phillips, GE, Samsung or Siemens' navigation systems available herein. The fused&#xD;
           image guides the location of the electrodes to be installed in the tumor, the number of&#xD;
           electrodes, and a safe access route.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. RFA procedure As a device for RFA, a multi-viva generator and a separable clustered&#xD;
           electrode (product name: Octopus electrode, Starmed Ltd), which are used herein, will be&#xD;
           used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The procedure is to place the octopus high-frequency electrode in the periphery of the&#xD;
           tumor (5 ± 2mm) using no touch technique under fusion ultrasound guidance, and then&#xD;
           simultaneously apply high frequency to two electrodes up to 200W using the combined&#xD;
           monopolar-bipolar mode with keeping the temperature at 90-100 degrees Celsius for about&#xD;
           5 to 30 minutes until the tumor and 5-10 mm echo band form around the tumor. During the&#xD;
           RFA procedure, the US-CT-MR fusion tool (Navigator- GE &amp; Siemens, Samsung) is used to&#xD;
           fuse the pre-treatment image and the ultrasound image to match the echo bubble&#xD;
           distribution and tumor location. It will be evaluated in real time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the boundary of the tumor is unclear, it is difficult to grasp the boundary of the&#xD;
           tumor 360 degrees as a whole, or if there is little normal tissue to install electrodes&#xD;
           around the tumor, it is difficult to apply the No-touch technique. Therefore, in this&#xD;
           study, the application rate of the No-touch technique will be evaluated among all&#xD;
           recruited patients, and when evaluating the presence or absence of recurrence after the&#xD;
           procedure, it is analyzed (intention to treat analysis) including puncture of the tumor,&#xD;
           and treated with actual No-touch. It will be analyzed further.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CT (MRI if CT is contraindicated) will be performed immediately after RFA therapy&#xD;
                as previously performed as a clinical routine, and it will be evaluated whether&#xD;
                complete necrosis of the treated tumor has been achieved. If residual masses are&#xD;
                identified or insufficient safety margins are not secured, additional procedures&#xD;
                are performed and evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alternatively, AFP or CEA, CBC, LFT and CT or MRI are performed 1 to 3 months after&#xD;
                RFA procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The follow up method is the same as the existing method, and blood tests and CT or&#xD;
                MRI tests are performed every 3 to 4 months for 3 to 4 times during 12 months. This&#xD;
                is due to the fact that most local recurrence occurs within 12 months, and the&#xD;
                local recurrence rate will be evaluated based on this.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The final point of time for this study is based on the follow-up findings obtained&#xD;
                at 12 ± 1 month after the procedure (short-term relapse rate evaluation).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  However, after that, the patient will continue to perform CT or MR follow-up every&#xD;
                3 to 6 months until 2 years according to the routine follow-up protocol of the&#xD;
                patient who has undergone existing RFA therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Control group Of the patients who underwent RFA therapy for the treatment of HCC for a&#xD;
           period of 2 years from 2018 to 2020, the patient group had been treated with&#xD;
           conventional RFA and microwave ablation were enrolled. After performing the propensity&#xD;
           score matching analysis using variables of age, gender, tumor size, tumor location, and&#xD;
           liver function values, the same number of controls are selected and set.&#xD;
