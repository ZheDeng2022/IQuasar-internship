      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the long-term safety and tolerability in patients with cold agglutinin disease&#xD;
      (CAD), after multiple doses of BIVV020&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess, in patients with cold agglutinin disease (CAD), after multiple doses of BIVV020:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The long-term effect of BIVV020 on complement mediated hemolysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The long-term pharmacodynamics (PD) effect of BIVV020 relating to complement inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The pharmacokinetic profile (PK) after repeated administration of BIVV020&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The long-term immunogenicity of BIVV020&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The screening period for this study is up to six weeks. The treatment period for this study&#xD;
      will continue for up to five years, until BIVV020 is approved in the respective country, or&#xD;
      if BIVV020 development is discontinued, whichever comes first.&#xD;
