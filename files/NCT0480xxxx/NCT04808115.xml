  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open label, non-randomized, prospective phase I study is designed to evaluate if the&#xD;
      addition of natural killer cell therapy (KDS-1001) to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for&#xD;
      chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with persistent or recurrent molecular residual&#xD;
      disease (MRD) after at least one year of TKI therapy will allow patients to achieve RT-PCR&#xD;
      negativity (MRD negative). This may have implications for future TKI cessation studies.&#xD;

             for enrollment although documentation of current chronic phase disease is required.&#xD;

&#xD;
             Imatinib 300mg PO daily Dasatinib 70mg PO daily Nilotinib 200mg PO BID Bosutinib 300mg&#xD;
             PO daily Ponatinib 30mg PO daily Lower than goal doses are allowed IF documented by&#xD;
             the treating physician that the goal dose was not tolerable due to toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must have been on their most recent TKI consistently for at least 6 months&#xD;

             The chosen RT-PCR test must be sensitive enough to detect a 4.5 log reduction in&#xD;
             BCR/ABL transcripts measured in peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Performance status must be ECOG PS 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
