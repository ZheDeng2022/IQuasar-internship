  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors for Type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been&#xD;
      shown to improve glycemic control while also decreasing the risk for acute and chronic&#xD;
      complications. Unfortunately, there are vast disparities in access to this technology;&#xD;
      non-Hispanic black youth with public healthcare insurance are the least likely to have access&#xD;
      to these technologies. We propose to conduct a non-randomized interrupted time series study&#xD;
      to assess the impact of hybrid closed loop (HCL) insulin delivery in underserved youths with&#xD;
      poorly controlled T1D. Patients will complete standard diabetes education before beginning to&#xD;
      use this technology and will be followed for 6-months after starting HCL to assess its impact&#xD;
      on glycemic control and health-related quality of life.&#xD;
