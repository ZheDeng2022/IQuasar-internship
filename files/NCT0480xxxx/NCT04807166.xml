  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that antiangiogenic drugs combined with chemotherapy as first-line&#xD;
      treatment, and subsequent antiangiogenic drugs as maintenance therapy for ovarian cancer can&#xD;
      achieve better clinical benefits. Therefore, this study is expected to investigate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of anlotinib combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel as first-line treatment&#xD;
      in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      This study is a single-arm, multicenter, exploratory phase II study to observe the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of anlotinib combined with carboplatin/paclitaxel as first-line treatment in&#xD;
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The primary end point are progression free survival;&#xD;
      the secondary end points include objective response rate, disease control rate, overall&#xD;
      survival and safety. The subjects in this study: patients with newly diagnosed advanced (FIGO&#xD;
      stage III-IV) ovarian cancer, including histologically or pathologically confirmed high-grade&#xD;
      serous ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer or primary peritoneal carcinoma&#xD;
