  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a serious health problem which increases the likelihood of developing other&#xD;
      life-changing medical conditions. Despite increasing knowledge about the neural and metabolic&#xD;
      basis of obesity, the development of effective anti-obesity treatment strategies has been a&#xD;
      challenge. Evidence shows an association between cannabis consumption and body weight.&#xD;
      However, to date, no human trials have assessed the potential of cannabis-like compounds to&#xD;
      reduce body weight in individuals who are obese. This pilot trial aims to determine the&#xD;
      safety and feasibility of administering nabilone (a cannabinoid drug similar to the active&#xD;
      component of cannabis) to patients who are obese. Our secondary aims are to determine if&#xD;
      nabilone is effective in reducing weight in this population, and to probe potential&#xD;
      mechanisms of the weight-loss-promoting effects of nabilone, such as neural reactivity to&#xD;
      food stimuli, changes in gut bacteria, and changes in metabolic biomarkers.&#xD;
