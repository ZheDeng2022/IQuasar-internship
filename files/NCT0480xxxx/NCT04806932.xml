  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radial artery cannulation can be performed under short-axis ultrasound guidance. However, the&#xD;
      first puncture success rate was low in patients with hypotensive patients. Compared with the&#xD;
      conventional approach, the modified approach combined the ultrasonic location system with a&#xD;
      dynamic needle tip positioning technique. The aim of our study is to compare the first&#xD;
      puncture success rate and safety between the two approaches of ultrasound-guided radial&#xD;
      artery cannulation in hypotensive ICU patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypotensive patients in the intensive care unit may have extremely unstable hemodynamics.&#xD;
      Blood pressure is the most important outcome in the diagnosis and treatment of shock.&#xD;
      Vasopressor drugs are often required to maintain blood pressure in addition to fluid&#xD;
      infusion. Noninvasive blood pressure measurement is unable to meet the clinical requirements.&#xD;
      It is necessary to establish an invasive blood pressure monitoring method as soon as possible&#xD;
      that can observe the real-time pressure. Radial artery cannulation has become the most&#xD;
      commonly used due to its superficial location and less severe complication. However, radial&#xD;
      artery cannulation is difficult to achieve in hypotensive patients due to weak radial artery&#xD;
      pulsation, small arterial diameter, and peripheral vasospasm as blood flow is directed toward&#xD;
      central vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have shown that ultrasound-guided cannulation is more successful than the&#xD;
      palpation technique. However, the success rate is largely dependent on the ultrasound&#xD;
      operator's experience and skills. The operator requires good hand-eye coordination, technical&#xD;
      skills, and some experience to overcome this shortcoming of ultrasound, which limits the&#xD;
      advantages of ultrasound-guided vascular puncture, especially for operators with insufficient&#xD;
      experience. There are 2 basic approaches in needling techniques: short-axis&#xD;
      out-of-plane(SA-OOP) and long-axis in-plane(LA-IP) techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-plane technology requires the operator to be very skilled at ultrasound technology, which&#xD;
      is more dependent on experience and can be difficult for novices to master; on the other&#xD;
      hand, given that the long axis is subject to slice-thickness artifacts, due to the measurable&#xD;
      thickness of the ultrasound beam itself, the cannula in the long axis appears to be in the&#xD;
      same plane as the extremely small radial artery, even when the cannula has not been&#xD;
      successfully inserted into the artery. Therefore, we prefer the out-of-plane technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The short-axis view has the advantages of providing better visualization of the surrounding&#xD;
      structures and easier imaging which is convenient for novices to master. The procedure of&#xD;
      radial artery puncture can be divided into 3 steps. The first step is to locate the puncture&#xD;
      site, the second step is the puncture, and the last step entails the insertion of the cannula&#xD;
      into the radial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first step is particularly important because appropriate localization facilitates the&#xD;
      success of the puncture and insertion. The first difficulty encountered during radial artery&#xD;
      puncture is the exact positioning of the puncture point. Ultrasound with developing lines&#xD;
      guided by dynamic ultrasound has achieved a good effect in patients without hypotension. In&#xD;
      the group with the modified technique, we use the developing line to locate the puncture&#xD;
      site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second difficulty encountered during radial artery puncture is the risk of posterior wall&#xD;
      penetration. With the dynamic needle tip positioning(DNTP) technique, the operator keeps&#xD;
      real-time track of the position of the needle tip at all times which significantly reduces&#xD;
      the chance of posterior wall perforation. We combined the developing line and DNTP technique&#xD;
      in the modified group and assume that the technique theoretically increases the success rate&#xD;
      and decreases the complication rate of radial artery puncture. Therefore, in this trial, we&#xD;
      compared the success rate of radial artery puncture using the traditional method and modified&#xD;
      technique in hypotensive ICU patients.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Patients were randomized to the conventional Approach (CA) or modified Approach (MA) group in a 1:1 ratio using a computerized system. The allocation process was intensively managed by an allocation group using sequentially numbered containers and the allocation result was concealed until it was implemented. When a patient was eligible, the investigator informed the allocation group to get intervention group allocated to the patient: CA orMA group. Because of feasibility issues, operators were not blinded to the assignment.</masking_description>
