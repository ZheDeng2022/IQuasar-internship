      Female genital mutilation /cutting (FGMC) includes all procedures that involve partial or&#xD;
      total removal of the external female genitalia, or another injury to the female genital&#xD;
      organs for non-medical reasons&quot;. It constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against&#xD;
      women due to the health consequences, pain, and risks involved. Regardless of its prevalence,&#xD;
      the physical and psychological complications of FGM in Egypt were shown to be enormous. These&#xD;
      complications are usually categorized into primary or acute complications and secondary or&#xD;
      long-term complications. The primary complications include pain, bleeding, and psychiatric&#xD;
      trauma while the secondary complications include several emotional, menstrual, and sexual&#xD;
      disorders&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite being internationally recognized as a human rights violation of girls and women, FGM&#xD;
      has been performed on at least 200 million girls and women in 31 countries. According to the&#xD;
      2015 Egypt Health Issues Survey (EHIS), 87% of all women aged 15-49 years in Egypt had&#xD;
      undergone FGM. Social norms, religion, ensuring premarital virginity and marital fidelity,&#xD;
      increasing marriageability, and cultural ideals of femininity and modesty were among the most&#xD;
      commonly cited reasons for performing FGM. A survey conducted among Egyptians aged 10-29&#xD;
      years in 2014 indicated that the reasons given for practicing FGM were customs and traditions&#xD;
      (56.7%) and religion (35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      FGM has many types ranging from excision of the prepuce with/out clitoris (Type I or&#xD;
      Clitoridectomy) and excision of the clitoris and labia minora (Type II or Excision) to&#xD;
      profound excision of the external genitalia with stitching and tightening the vaginal opening&#xD;
      (Type III or Infibulation). Type IV describes pricking, piercing, scraping, and cauterization&#xD;
      of the external genitalia without flesh removal. In societies with Muslim majorities, type I:&#xD;
      is known as &quot;Sunna Circumcision&quot;; a religious term linking the practice to the commands of&#xD;
      the Prophet of Islam or &quot;Khifad&quot; the Arabic synonym of &quot;reduction&quot;; a term claiming that the&#xD;
      Prophet of Islam endorsed partial rather than complete excision of the external genitalia. In&#xD;
      Egypt, types I and II are also called &quot;Ta-hara&quot;; the Arabic synonym of &quot;purification&quot; which&#xD;
      points to the hygienic drive of the practice.&#xD;
