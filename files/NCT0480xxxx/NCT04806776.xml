  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is non-inferiority trial design.The relationship between whether dressing change&#xD;
      24hrs after CVC (central venous catheter) catheterization and bacterial colonization of the&#xD;
      skin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Central venous catheter (CVC) was punctured directly through jugular vein, subclavian vein&#xD;
      and femoral vein, and its tip is located in superior vena cava or inferior vena cava. CVC is&#xD;
      widely used in ICU because of its kinds of advantages. However, CVC, as an invasive puncture&#xD;
      method, may bring more complications. The incidence of central line associated bloodstream&#xD;
      infection (CLABSI) was 1.33-31.6/1000 catheterization day , and the death rate due to CVC&#xD;
      associated bloodstream infection is 3-5% . Therefore, various organizations have formulated&#xD;
      guidelines for the prevention of CLABSI and best evidence summary . From October 2019 to&#xD;
      April 2020, taking the children's hospital of Fudan University as the leading unit, PICU of&#xD;
      children's Hospital Affiliated to Zhejiang University, Anhui children's Hospital, Xiamen&#xD;
      children's Hospital, Shenzhen Children's Hospital and Guangzhou Women's and Children's&#xD;
      medical center as the cooperation units, carried out children's central venous&#xD;
      catheterization Multi center research on best practices of management and maintenance. It was&#xD;
      found that changing dressings 24 hours after catheterization may increase the incidence of&#xD;
      MARSI, and repeatedly exposing dressings may also increase the incidence of CLABSI. The&#xD;
      research team returned to the original evidence and consulted the guidelines. It was found&#xD;
      that: under the premise of achieving the maximum aseptic catheterization, the guidelines&#xD;
      issued by various institutions did not mention that the application should be replaced 24&#xD;
      hours after catheterization; however, the evidence was mentioned in the evidence summary, but&#xD;
      there was no support from the relevant original literature. Therefore, it is worth discussing&#xD;
      whether children need to change dressings 24 hours after catheterization. This study is&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial design.&#xD;

    <description>incidence of bacterial colonization in the skin under dressing :7days or 8days after insertion,when nurse change the CVC dressing,The researchers used 4 normal saline cotton swabs to wipe the skin under the dressing. Taking the puncture point as the center, 4 cotton swabs wipes 4 points in the northwest, northeast, Southeast and northeast direction 1cm away from the puncture point,separately. Samples were inoculated on Petri dishes respectively.The type and quantity of bacteria will be reported by the Laboratory. The colony number above 20 CFU(colony-forming units) / cm2 means Bacterial colonization occurred.</description>
