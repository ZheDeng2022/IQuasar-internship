  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The duration of diabetes is directly related to eye complications. Diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
      affects 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. At least 90% of new&#xD;
      cases can be reduced with proper treatment and monitoring of the eyes. The longer a person&#xD;
      has diabetes, the more likely it is to develop diabetic retinopathy. Each year in the United&#xD;
      States, diabetic retinopathy accounts for 12% of all new cases of blindness. It is also the&#xD;
      leading cause of blindness in people between the ages of 20 and 64. The most important&#xD;
      complication of diabetes leading to vision loss is diabetic retinopathy. Depending on this,&#xD;
      macular edema, bleeding into the retina and vitreous,neovascular glaucoma can cause&#xD;
      blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision-loss globally. Of an estimated 285&#xD;
      million people with diabetes mellitus worldwide, approximately one third have signs of DR and&#xD;
      of these, a further one third of DR is vision-threatening DR, including diabetic macular&#xD;
      edema (DME). Diabetic retinopathy is a retinal disease that can often be stopped with early&#xD;
      diagnosis, but if neglected, it can lead to severe vision loss, including permanent&#xD;
      blindness. Diabetes has high morbidity and there are millions of people who should be&#xD;
      screened for diabetic retinopathy (DR). Annual eye screening is recommended for all diabetic&#xD;
      patients since vision loss can be prevented if DR is diagnosed in its early stages.&#xD;
      Currently, the number of clinical personnel trained for DR screening is less than that needed&#xD;
      to screen a growing diabetic population. Therefore, the automatic DR screening system will be&#xD;
      able to screen more diabetic patients and diagnose them early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EyeCheckup is an automated retinal screening device designed automatically analyze color&#xD;
      fundus photographs of diabetic patients to identify patients with referable or vision&#xD;
      threatening DR. This study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of EyeCheckup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a single center study to determine the sensitivity and specificity of EyeCheckup&#xD;
      to diabetic retinopathy. EyeCheckup is an automated software device that is designed to&#xD;
      analyze ocular fundus digital color photographs taken in frontline primary care settings in&#xD;
      order to quickly screen for diabetic retinopathy (DR).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study to assess the safety and efficacy of EyeCheckup in screening for&#xD;
      DR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in a single center at Akdeniz University Faculty of Medicine&#xD;
      with primary endpoints to determine the sensitivity and specificity of EyeCheckup to diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy in the primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and tools to be used in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photography with non-mydriatic camera and classification of diabetic retinopathy&#xD;
           with artificial intelligence algorithm,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of images by retina specialists and comparison of results for clinical&#xD;
           validation of the system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and laboratory tests to be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fundus photography with a non-mydriatic camera. In this study, no invasive procedure is&#xD;
           applied to the patient, the retinal photograph will be taken with a special digital&#xD;
           camera called a fundus camera. In patients whose non-mydriatic image cannot be obtained,&#xD;
           tropicamide drops will be instilled to dilate the pupil, and then photographs will be&#xD;
           taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pupil dilation will be achieved by instilling Tropicamide drops in both eyes of the&#xD;
           patient, and then 4 quadrant photographs of both eyes will be taken with a mydriatic&#xD;
           fundus camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After exclusions, this study will enroll up to 900 subjects who are diagnosed with diabetes&#xD;
      by the endocrinology polyclinic and meet the eligibility criteria. Participants who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be recruited after obtaining written informed consent from primary&#xD;
      health care providers. Subjects will undergo fundus photography per, Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) cleared, ophthalmic cameras (product code: HKI). Images will be taken&#xD;
      according to a specific EyeCheckup imaging protocol provided to the ophthalmic camera&#xD;
      operator and then analyzed by the EyeCheckup device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photography protocol consists of two images of the ocular fundus (one optic disc nerve&#xD;
      centered, one macula centered), obtained from both eyes of enrolled participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the retinal images taken from ophthalmic cameras (product code: HKI), images are&#xD;
      analyzed with EyeCheckup and a scan report is prepared. If it is necessary to enlarge the&#xD;
      pupils, eye enlarging eye drops are applied and wait 15-30 minutes. This information is&#xD;
      noted. DR is diagnosed by examination by a retina specialist with the captured images.&#xD;
      EyeCheckup success rate is calculated by comparing both reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purposes of the study are to prove that our product detects the presence of&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
