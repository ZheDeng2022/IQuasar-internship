  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonectomy is a high-risk surgical procedure, causing impaired respiratory functions and&#xD;
      exercise intolerance. It is associated with decreased physical activity, quality of life and&#xD;
      increased fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study is to compare the exercise capacity and respiratory functions of&#xD;
      lung cancer patients undergoing pneumonectomy and healthy individuals. The secondary aim of&#xD;
      the study is to compare peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      endurance, physical activity level, shortness of breath, fatigue and quality of life of lung&#xD;
      cancer patients undergoing pneumonectomy and healthy individuals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumonectomy is a high risk surgical procedure compared to lobectomy, segmentectomy and&#xD;
      non-anatomical resection. Pneumonectomy causes impairment of respiratory functions and&#xD;
      exercise intolerance. Assessment of exercise capacity in pneumonectomy is prognostically&#xD;
      important. Exercise intolerance can also occur with daily activities using the upper&#xD;
      extremity. There is no study investigated upper extremity exercise capacity in this patient&#xD;
      population. Postoperative pulmonary functions are determinant for early postoperative results&#xD;
      as well as long-term postoperative quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate&#xD;
      respiratory functions in patients after surgery. Respiratory muscle functions are impaired&#xD;
      due to changes in chest wall mechanics and incisions applied to respiratory muscles after&#xD;
      surgery. There is no study investigated respiratory muscle endurance in this patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pneumonectomy is associated with decreased physical activity and quality of life. The number&#xD;
      of studies investigating physical activity level in lung cancer patients undergoing&#xD;
      pneumonectomy is limited. In this study, physical activity level will be evaluated by&#xD;
      metabolic holter. Pneumonectomy has been shown as a predictor of deterioration in quality of&#xD;
      life after surgery. In this study, the quality of life will be evaluated using a&#xD;
      questionnaire specific to the disease. Fatigue is a common symptom in patients after lung&#xD;
      cancer surgery. It negatively affects the patients quality of life and long-term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung cancer patients undergoing pneumonectomy by the physicians of Gazi University Thoracic&#xD;
      Surgery Department and healthy individuals will be included in this study. Patients and&#xD;
      healthy individuals will be evaluated and the evaluation results will be compared. According&#xD;
      to the sample size analysis 17 patients and 17 healthy individuals with similar demographic&#xD;
      characteristics will be included the study. Patients and healthy individuals will be selected&#xD;
      according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The assessments will be&#xD;
      completed in two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional exercise capacity (6 minutes walk test), upper extremity exercise capacity (6&#xD;
      minutes Pegboard and Ring Test), respiratory functions (spirometer), respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength (mouth pressure measurement), peripheral muscle strength (dynamometer), respiratory&#xD;
      muscle endurance (incremental threshold loading test), physical activity level (multi-sensor&#xD;
      activity monitor), quality of life (European Cancer Research and Treatment Organization&#xD;
      Quality of Life Scale (EORTC QOL C-30)), fatigue (Fatigue Severity Scale) and shortness of&#xD;
      breath (Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC)) will be evaluated.&#xD;

The cancer-specific questionnaire has 30 questions and incorporates five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status and several single items. All item scores are transformed to 0-100. Higher values indicate higher functional/health level in functional scales, a higher quality of life level in global health status and increased symptoms in symptom scales.</description>

    <time_frame>Second Day</time_frame>
    <description>Fatigue will be evaluated using Turkish version of Fatigue Severity Scale. This questionnaire includes 9 items and score range for each item from 1 to 7 point (7-point Likert scale). Fatigue Severity Scale score is calculates by deriving an arithmetic mean. Cut-scores of over 4 are indicative of significant fatigue (higher scores show more severe fatigue).</description>

    <time_frame>First Day</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Medical Research Council (MMRC) dyspnea scale will be used to determine the perception of dyspnea during activities of daily living.&#xD;
Dyspnea is graded as: zero (shortness of breath with strenuous exercise only); one (shortness of breath when rushing or walking up a slight uphill); two (because of shortness of breath they walk slower than people of the same age or have to stop to breathe while walking at their own pace); three (stops to breathe after walking 100 meters or after a few minutes); and four (too short of breath to leave the house or shortness of breath when getting dressed).</description>
