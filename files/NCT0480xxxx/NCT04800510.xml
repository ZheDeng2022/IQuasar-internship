  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study evaluates the effect of carbon fiber brace design on forces across the&#xD;
      ankle joint. It is expected that carbon fiber braces can be designed to reduce forces in the&#xD;
      ankle. In this study, brace geometry will be varied to determine how these changes influence&#xD;
      the forces experienced by ankle cartilage. The purpose of this study is to refine a&#xD;
      pre-existing musculoskeletal model and finalize the procedures for inputting multiple data&#xD;
      sources into the model to evaluate ankle articular contact stresses.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to refine a pre-existing musculoskeletal model and finalize the&#xD;
      procedures for inputting multiple data sources into the model to evaluate ankle articular&#xD;
      contact stresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy adult participants will complete testing using three generic sized carbon fiber&#xD;
      custom dynamic orthoses (CDOs) and with no CDO. Participants will be blinded to the design&#xD;
      variation of each device and will only know them as CDO-A, CDO-B, or CDO-C. Testing will be&#xD;
      completed under 4 conditions: No-CDO, CDO-A, CDO-B, CDO-C, with each bracing condition&#xD;
      (A/B/C) representing a CDO design variant. Physical performance measures will incorporate&#xD;
      tests of agility, speed, and lower limb power to ensure that changes to device design do not&#xD;
      negatively affect physical function. Questionnaires will be used to evaluate participants'&#xD;
      current and desired activity level, pain with and without CDO use, satisfaction with the&#xD;
      devices, perception of comfort and smoothness between devices, and preference between CDOs.&#xD;
      Semi-structured interviews will be completed to fully capture the participant's perspective.&#xD;
      Lower limb forces and motion will be assessed using a computerized motion capture system and&#xD;
      force plates in the floor. Forces between the foot and CDO will be measured using force&#xD;
      sensing insoles, and muscle activity data will be collected using surface electromyography.&#xD;
      Devices will be mechanically tested, and participant demographic and anthropometric data will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information obtained from this study will help refine the musculoskeletal model data&#xD;
      input methods to be used in future studies. The knowledge that will be gained from this&#xD;
      investigation has the potential to substantially improve the long-term efficacy and&#xD;
      efficiency of the musculoskeletal model and help improve ankle foot orthosis&#xD;
