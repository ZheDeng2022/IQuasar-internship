  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare a 12-month adjustable balloon over a 6-month&#xD;
      non-adjustable balloon with 6-month dietician follow-up. The endpoint is %TBL at 12 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be studied in a randomized open label single center study that will run 52&#xD;
      weeks. Subjects will be randomized to two treatment groups: Group 1- Spatz3 adjustable&#xD;
      balloon 12-month implantation; and Group 2 - non adjustable 6-month implantation with&#xD;
      additional 6 months of dietician follow-up after balloon extraction. Fourth four eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be randomized to treatment groups 1 and 2 and will undergo endoscopy and&#xD;
      implantation of either the Spatz3 Adjustable Balloon or the 6-month non adjustable Balloon.&#xD;
      All subjects will follow a calorie restricted diet designed by the dietician. The initial&#xD;
      diet will be liquid and will be advanced as per the dietician's recommendations. Changes in&#xD;
      diet will depend on subject tolerance to the balloon and specific food intolerances and will&#xD;
      be adjusted frequently by the dietician. The initial balloon volume will be 500 ml of 0.9%&#xD;
      normal saline with 2 ml of a 1% solution of methylene blue. An adjustment will be performed&#xD;
      for treatment Group 1 at Week 24 (±6 weeks) with the addition of 200-300 ml of 0.9% normal&#xD;
      saline, as per section 1.6.2.1.3.3. The balloon adjustment procedure is done with an&#xD;
      endoscopy procedure under the same sedation as the implantation procedure. The subjects will&#xD;
      have follow up by the PI/Nurse Practitioner and the Dietician/Nutritionist periodically as&#xD;
      per section 1.7.3. until extraction at 52 weeks. The 6-month non adjustable balloon treatment&#xD;
      group will undergo balloon extraction at 6 months followed by monthly dietician vists for an&#xD;
      additional 6 months. The study will terminate at the end of 12 months.&#xD;
