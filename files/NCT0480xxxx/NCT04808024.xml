  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the impact of SMR intervention in the hamstring muscles on&#xD;
      the activity of the biceps and gluteus muscles.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will cover 40 men, players of amateur football leagues, aged 18 - 40. The test will&#xD;
      include the measurement of sEMG of the biceps and gluteal muscles during the exercise,&#xD;
      followed by myofascial self-release (SMR). Muscle sEMG was re-measured immediately after&#xD;
      roller therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Myofascial auto-release consisted of rolling the roller on a group of knee flexors for 3.5 minutes between the sciatic tumor and the knee joint in both directions, omitting the popliteal fossa. Before and after the intervention, sEMG of the biceps and gluteal muscles will be performed.</description>
