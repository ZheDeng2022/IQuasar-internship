  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect blood glucose values and activity data in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes for approximately 12 weeks using electronic devices in a full virtual&#xD;
      clinical setting. Virtual clinical setting means that all data are collected by use of&#xD;
      participants' personal smartphone and study-related apps. In other words, everything will be&#xD;
      handled without any visits to a hospital or doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For collection of participants' blood glucose values participants will receive two different&#xD;
      blood glucose monitors. One where participants cannot see the blood glucose values and one&#xD;
      where participants can see the blood glucose values. Participants must wear them&#xD;
      consecutively for 2 and 10 weeks, respectively. Further, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      self-apply the monitors on their upper arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For collection of participants' activity data participants will receive an activity tracker,&#xD;
      which participants will wear on the wrist throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask participants to keep an electronic diary of the timing of the meal- and&#xD;
      medication intake through two shorter periods of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a voluntary basis, participants can choose to donate a saliva sample for the purpose of&#xD;
      genetic research in diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study does not include any study medication and participants will continue the current&#xD;
      antidiabetic treatment as prescribed to participants by their own physician. If any questions&#xD;
      about the treatment and/or health condition while participating in the trial, participants&#xD;
      should consult your own physician If participants are in doubt about what the blood glucose&#xD;
      values mean or whether participants should react to the blood glucose values, participants&#xD;
      need to contact the research staff or their general practitioner.&#xD;
