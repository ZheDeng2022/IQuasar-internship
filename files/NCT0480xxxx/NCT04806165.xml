  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses associated with high morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality, clinical impairment, and comorbid psychopathology. Although evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments for EDs have been established, the treatment gap is wide. Indeed, &lt;20% of&#xD;
      individuals with EDs receive treatment. There is need for a novel solution not only to&#xD;
      identify individuals with EDs but also to encourage mental health services use and to address&#xD;
      treatment barriers. This study aims to implement a conversational agent or &quot;chatbot&quot; that is&#xD;
      optimized to increase mental health services use among individuals with EDs through such&#xD;
      features as: 1) education on the seriousness and consequences of EDs; 2) engaging the user in&#xD;
      motivational interviewing to overcome barriers to care; 3) providing a personalized&#xD;
      recommendation for seeking intervention; 4) repeated check-ins with the user to encourage&#xD;
      follow-up with care. This study will utilize a randomized optimization trial with adults who&#xD;
      have completed screening on the National Eating Disorders Association (NEDA) website and&#xD;
      screen positive for an ED but are not in treatment to determine chatbot feasibility and to&#xD;
      generate data on the effect of the chatbot on motivation for treatment and mental health&#xD;
      services use. This trial will employ the Multiphase Optimization Strategy framework, using a&#xD;
      2^4 full factorial design, to randomly assign participants to a combination of the four&#xD;
      proposed intervention components (n=16 conditions) to isolate the active ingredients.&#xD;
