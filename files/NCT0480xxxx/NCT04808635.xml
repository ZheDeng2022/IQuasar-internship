      This is a questionnaire based cross-sectional study conducted in Kuwait from jan 2021-&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptoms of depression were assessed using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>(PHQ-9) score, a self-report questionnaire that is commonly used as a screening tool for depression. It is composed of 9 questions assessing the frequency of depressive symptoms on a 4-point Liker-scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score was calculated for each patient and was interpreted as follows: minimal (1-4), mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-21), severe (20-27). A standard cutoff of score of 10 was used, indicating a diagnosis of depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Burnout symptoms were assessed using 9-item form of the Maslach Burnout Inventory - Human Services Survey (aMBI-HSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The aMBI is a 9-item questionnaire each question is rated on a 7-point Liker scale ranging from 0 to 6, which indicates the frequency of symptoms in question. Response options include; Every day, A few times a week, Once a week, A few times a month, Once a month, A few times a year, or Never. The questions grouped into 3 subscales (emotional exhaustion EE, depersonalization D and personal accomplishment PA) are evaluated and scored separately with each score ranging from 0 to 18. We used the cut off points set by Lebares et al. for EE and D. The cut off points for high burnout among U.S. surgery residents were: EE score ≥ 9 and D score ≥ 6. A PA score ≤ 12 was chosen as a cut-off for high burnout.</description>
