      Study Rationale: There are limited studies evaluating real-time adaptive radiation therapy&#xD;
      for locally advanced (Stage I-III) rectal adenocarcinoma with the goal of accomplishing organ&#xD;
      preservation. We are testing higher doses of radiation therapy, using a novel method of&#xD;
      real-time adaptive MRI-based radiation therapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We hypothesize that adaptive magnetic resonance (MR) -guided radiation therapy&#xD;
      will result in acceptable toxicity and that a maximum-tolerated dose can be determined in a&#xD;
      phase I setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Description: The intervention in this circumstance is higher doses of radiation&#xD;
      therapy focused within the tumor given using adaptive MR guidance. Radiation Doses being&#xD;
      applied in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A- 64 Gy over 32 fractions, prophylactic nodes treated to 50 Gy over 25 fractions,&#xD;
      boost to tumor and radiologically positive nodes to total dose of 64 Gy over 32 total&#xD;
      fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B- 68 Gy over approximately 34 fractions, prophylactic nodes treated to 50 Gy over 25&#xD;
      fractions, boost to tumor and radiologically positive nodes to 68 Gy over 34 total fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C- 72 Gy over 36 total fractions, prophylactic nodes treated to 50 Gy over 25&#xD;
      fractions, boost to tumor and radiologically positive nodes to 72 Gy over 36 total fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose-Limiting Toxicity from Radiation Therapy: A dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) as per NCI&#xD;
      CTCAE version 5. Specifically, this encompasses the need for additional treatments including&#xD;
      the following: transfusion, invasive intervention, or hospitalization indicated. The presence&#xD;
      of such a DLT would result in the halting of radiation therapy and impact on the dose levels&#xD;
      of radiation therapy applied in the trial.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in the EQ-5D-SL quality of life questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12.1 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems (coded as 1), slight problems (coded as 2), moderate problems (coded as 3), severe problems (coded as 4) and extreme problems (coded as 5). The score is expressed as a five-digit number. The second part of the instrument (EQ VAS) records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' (score of 100) and 'The worst health you can imagine' (score of 0).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the Memorial Sloan Kettering Bowel Function Index (MSKCC BFI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12.1 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The MSKCC BFI comprises 18 items covering the frequency of various symptoms and is divided into three sub-scales and four single items. It is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;always&quot; to &quot;never&quot;. The sub-scales scores are summarised as: A 6-item frequency sub-scale (6-30), a four-item dietary sub-scale (4-20), and a four-item urgency sub-scale (4-20). A global score can be calculated as the sum of the sub-scale scores. A total score (possible score range 18-90) can be calculated by adding all the item scores (sub-scale scores plus single item scores). A higher score indicates better bowel function.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and up to 12.1 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>This scoring system cross-tabulates frequencies and different anal incontinence presentations (Gas/Liquid/Solid/Pad use/Need for lifestyle alterations) and sums the returned score to a total of 0-20 (where 0 = perfect continence and 20 = complete incontinence). Each of the incontinence presentations is graded equally.</description>

&#xD;
          3. Prior radiotherapy to the region of the study cancer that would result in overlap of&#xD;
             radiation therapy fields.&#xD;

&#xD;
               3. Acute bacterial or fungal infection requiring intravenous antibiotics at the time&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Uncontrolled malabsorption syndrome significantly affecting gastrointestinal&#xD;

&#xD;
               6. Any unresolved intestinal obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), based upon current Centers for&#xD;
                  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) definition. Note, however, that HIV testing&#xD;
                  is not required for entry into this protocol. The need to exclude patients with&#xD;
                  AIDS from this protocol is necessary because patients receiving antiretroviral&#xD;
                  therapy may experience possible pharmacokinetic interactions with required&#xD;
                  treatment medications, such as capecitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. Absence of any significant medical comorbidity which would preclude the&#xD;
                  consideration of major intestinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually active and not&#xD;
             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during the course of&#xD;
             the study and for women three months after study therapy is completed and for men six&#xD;
             months after study therapy is completed. This exclusion is necessary because the&#xD;
             treatment involved in this study may be significantly teratogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Participation in another interventional clinical treatment trial while on study&#xD;
             (observational trials are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients taking nonprotocol-specified chemotherapy agents or immune-modulating agents&#xD;
             for other medical conditions are not permitted to participate in this trial. Any&#xD;
             medication questions should be reviewed by the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Poor functional status such that patients are not able to be positioned for radiation&#xD;
             treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Gadolium allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If age over 60, history of hypertension, diabetes or liver transplant, and glomerular&#xD;
             filtration rate (GFR) at enrollment is &lt; 30.&#xD;
