      The objective of this study is to increase the understanding surrounding the choices&#xD;
      presented to patients and families impacted by Fabry disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a cross-sectional study conducted in approximately 130 individuals (or&#xD;
      representative parents/caregivers of patients) living with Fabry disease. All study&#xD;
      participants will complete the RSVP followed by a structured interview conducted by trained&#xD;
      interviewers. It is estimated that each respondent will need up to 60 minutes for the entire&#xD;
      process; 10 minutes to complete the RSVP including uploading the proof of Fabry disease&#xD;
      diagnosis or verifying membership with Fabry groups, including but not limited to: Fabry&#xD;
      Support and Information Group, National Fabry Disease Foundation, MPS Society UK, Morbus&#xD;
      Fabry Selbsthilfergruppe, Fabry International Network, or others, and approximately 50&#xD;
      minutes to complete the interview.&#xD;

        Purposive sampling techniques will be used which will seek to initially recruit 30&#xD;
        participants (person with Fabry or their parent/legal guardian) from each of four groups&#xD;
        noted below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ERT users with an amenable mutation, who did not switch&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ERT users with an amenable mutation, who switched to Galafold and stayed on&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those naïve to therapy with an amenable mutation, who went on Galafold and stayed on&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Those naïve to therapy with an amenable mutation, who have never been on any therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will also be an attempt to recruit 5 patients from each of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. ERT users with an amenable mutation, who switched and discontinued Galafold, and&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Those naïve to therapy, with an amenable mutation, who went on Galafold and&#xD;
             discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to get a geographic sampling, the first four groups will attempt to recruit 30&#xD;
        patients/parents or caregivers of patients with representation from Germany, the UK, and&#xD;
        the US.&#xD;
