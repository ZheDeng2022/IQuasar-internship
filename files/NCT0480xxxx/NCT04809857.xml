      It was aimed to examine the effects of plyometric exercises on muscle strength in this study.&#xD;
      26 premenopausal women assigned to one of the three groups: Control Group (n=8), Plyometric&#xD;
      Exercise Group (n=10) and Isokinetic Exercise Group (n=8). Muscle strength assessments,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety inventories were performed baseline and after 6 weeks.&#xD;

      Depending on various factors, bone mass begins to decrease with aging and this may lead to&#xD;
      the osteoporosis. Physical activity and regular exercise provides an increase in bone mineral&#xD;
      density (BMD). It is mentioned that there are relationships between muscle strength and BMD&#xD;
      and also muscle strength has positive effects on BMD. In the literature it is showed that&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with weaker trunk muscle strength could have risk of osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plyometric exercises are used to increase muscle strength. Physiological basis of plyometric&#xD;
      exercise consist of stretch-shortening cycle and thus it is effective in increasing the&#xD;
      force. At the same time, plyometric exercises have positive effects on BMD because of weight&#xD;
      bearing exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of plyometric exercises on hip and trunk&#xD;
      muscle strength in premenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Study Design: Twenty six sedentary premenopausal women aged 35-50 years&#xD;
      participated this study. Participants were assigned into three groups: Plyometric Exercise&#xD;
      Group (PG; n=10), Isokinetic Exercise Group (IG; n=8), Control Group (CG; n=8). Participants&#xD;
      were informed about the procedures of the study and signed a written voluntary consent form&#xD;
      in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol was approved by the&#xD;
      Ethical Committee of the Istanbul University Medical Faculty. Measurements and training&#xD;
      sessions were performed in the Istanbul University Medical Faculty Sport Medicine&#xD;
      Department's Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements: Muscle strength was determined by using a Cybex Norm isokinetic dynamometer&#xD;
      (Cybex Humac Norm, USA). Range of motion was set from 10 degree extension to 40 degree&#xD;
      flexion. Isokinetic concentric contraction strength was measured at angular velocity of 60&#xD;
      degree per second and 90 degree per second. Subjects performed 3 trials trunk flexion and&#xD;
      extension contractions at minimal exertion and 4 test repetitions at maximal trunk flexion&#xD;
      and extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hip abduction adduction isokinetic testing was performed in side lying position. Hip&#xD;
      muscle strength was measured at angular velocity of 30 degree per second. Range of motion was&#xD;
      set from 10 degree adduction to 40 degree abduction. Subjects performed 4 trials at minimal&#xD;
      exertion and 4 test repetitions. Dominant leg values were analyzed for hip. All subjects&#xD;
      performed warm-up and stretching exercises before testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to asses&#xD;
      depression and anxiety conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: The training sessions were performed three days a week for six weeks. All&#xD;
      exercise sessions were supervised by a physiotherapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each session was consisted of warm-up, plyometric exercises and cool-down periods in PG. The&#xD;
      warm-up and cool-down periods were performed by walking on the treadmill and lower extremity&#xD;
      stretching exercises. The plyometric exercise training period involved vertical jumping,&#xD;
      forward and back jumping and lateral jumping. After fifth session the number of repetitions&#xD;
      were increased depending of toleration of participants. After tenth session step bench&#xD;
      jumping exercise and after fifteenth session diagonal jumping exercise were added and study&#xD;
      was completed in eighteen session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In IG, isokinetic exercises were performed by using a Cybex Norm isokinetic dynamometer with&#xD;
      an incorporated trunk flexion/extension unit in a standing position. Range of motion was set&#xD;
      from 10 degree extension to 40 degree flexion. Each session was consisted warm-up, isokinetic&#xD;
      exercises and cool-down periods. Warm-up and cool-down periods were consisted trunk exercise&#xD;
      and stretching. Isokinetic exercises were performed 7 repetitions at angular velocity of 90&#xD;
      degree per second , 6 repetitions at angular velocity of 75 degree per second and 5&#xD;
      repetitions at angular velocity of 60 degree per second.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in CG were assessed baseline and at sixth week.&#xD;
