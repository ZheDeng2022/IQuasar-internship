  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the Alusti Test, which is created by Josu Alustiza Navarro considering the existing&#xD;
      tests, the physical performances of geriatricians with different levels and cognitive&#xD;
      capacity are evaluated in a very short time and without tiring the patient. There are 2&#xD;
      versions, short and full. The short version is applicable to 100% of the large population,&#xD;
      including &quot;and cases of cognitive impairment. With the full version, it has nearly 85-90%&#xD;
      applicability.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no study regarding the English version and validity reliability of the&#xD;
      'Alusti Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, it is to investigate the English validity and reliability of the functional&#xD;
      assessment scale of physical performance (Alusti Test) for the geriatric population and to&#xD;
      provide a measurement tool to be used in the English literature to the sciences who want to&#xD;
      work in this field.&#xD;

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB).</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minute</time_frame>
    <description>Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is an assessment test used to examine gait, balance, strength, and endurance in elderly epidemiological studies and outpatient clinics. Its performance is divided into three subtests: a hierarchical balance assessment, a short usual gait speed test, and 5 Time Sit to Stand (5TSTS) test</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>TimedUp and Go (TUG).</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It is a clinical assessment test widely used to assess balance and walking ability in elderly populations [19-21]. To perform this test, participants are observed and timed in seconds, while they rise from an armed chair of approximately 46cm seat height and 65 cm arm height, walk at their usual pace a distance of 3 meters towards a line marked on the floor, turn 180 degrees, walk back to the chair, and sit down</description>

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive status was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); MMSE scores were categorized into three levels (0-17, 18-23, and 24-30, indicating severe, mild, and no impairment, respectively).</description>

    <measure>Rivermead Mobility Index</measure>
    <time_frame>10 minute</time_frame>
    <description>The Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) is a hierarchical mobility scale used in neurological rehabilitation. It includes 15 items related to bed mobility, transfers, walking, stair use, and running. The RMI is presented in a questionnaire format with the examiner required to make one observation (standing unsupported &gt;10 s). All items are rated in a yes/no format with positive responses scoring a 1 for a maximal RMI score of 15.</description>
