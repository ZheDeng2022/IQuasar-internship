             of an out-of-range result, 1 repeat test will be allowed. If the readings are&#xD;
             out-of-range again, the study participant will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;

             by various sources of medical information including, but not limited to, the&#xD;
             participant's medical record, prescriptions of asthma treatments, and/or previous&#xD;
             spirometry assessments (including FEV1 reversibility after short-acting beta2-agonist&#xD;
             (SABA) administration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has been on a stable asthma drug regimen (as needed short-acting&#xD;
             beta2-agonist (SABA)s or combination low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)-formoterol&#xD;
             and maintenance treatment with daily low dose ICS or daily leukotriene receptor&#xD;
             antagonists) for at least 4 weeks before the Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has normal breathing sounds during normal tidal breathing on lung&#xD;
             auscultation&#xD;

             ICS-formoterol. In case of an out-of-range result, 1 repeat test will be allowed. If&#xD;
             the readings are out of range again, the study participant will be excluded&#xD;
