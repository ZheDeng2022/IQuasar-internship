      This study will demonstrate Short-, mid-, and long-term safety in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      Parenteral Nutrition-Associated Cholestasis treated with Omegaven®, which is indicated as a&#xD;
      source of calories and fatty acids in this patient population&#xD;

      Prospective, controlled, longitudinal-cohort phase IV study to assess safety of Omegaven in&#xD;
      Pediatric Patients with PNAC, in order to demonstrate short-, mid-, and long-term safety with&#xD;
      respect to EFAD, serious bleeding events, life-threatening pleural and pericardial effusions,&#xD;
      and neurocognitive development. Pediatric patients with PNAC receiving Omegaven as part of&#xD;
      their routine nutritional management will be compared to those treated with another&#xD;
      FDA-approved ILE for pediatric patients. Patients who are switched to a non-FDA-approved ILE&#xD;
      or to Omegaven will be analyzed separately. Use of ILE will be as indicated by their treating&#xD;
      physician, ideally for ≥ 1 year. Dosing modalities are to be taken from the pertinent&#xD;
      prescribing information.&#xD;

        Male and female pediatric patients &lt; 6 months old (corrected age) with new-onset PNAC&#xD;
        (diagnosed within the past 21 days) will be enrolled at multiple sites; PNAC is defined as&#xD;
        being PN-dependent with a DBil level ≥ 2.0 mg/dL and no other known cause of liver&#xD;
        dysfunction.&#xD;

          2. Patient is PN-dependent and within the past 21 days has been diagnosed with PNAC,&#xD;
             defined as direct or conjugated bilirubin (DBil) ≥ 2.0 mg/dL with no other known cause&#xD;
             of liver dysfunction at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
