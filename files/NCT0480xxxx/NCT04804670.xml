  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to evaluate the clinical changes in gingival health by measuring the&#xD;
      reduction of gingival bleeding and inflammation over 4 weeks. Additionally, plaque removal&#xD;
      will be evaluated after a single use (part 1) and over 4 weeks (part 2).&#xD;

      Data will be analyzed and reported as mean. The target population is approximately 105&#xD;
      healthy adult volunteers. there will be three groups with 35 subjects per group. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized using a simple random sample. A computer-generated randomization schedule&#xD;
      will be prepared by the study statistician. Based on the randomization schedule, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With 35 subjects per group, the study will have 90% power to detect an average reduction in&#xD;
      the percent of sites with BOP of 25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the reduction in the percentage of sites with bleeding on probing&#xD;
      (BOP) after 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction in the percentage of sites with BOP after 2 weeks (+/- 2 days). Reduction in the&#xD;
      Modified Gingival index after 2 (+/- 2 days) and 4 weeks (+/- 2 days). Reduction in Rustogi&#xD;
      Modification of Navy Plaque Index pre &amp; Post, 2 weeks (+/- 2 days) and 4 weeks (+/- 2 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will include whole mouth, approximal, marginal, facial, and lingual analysis for all&#xD;
      indices. Intraoral examination will be performed and any adverse events will be reported and&#xD;
      followed-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a questionnaure at the completion of the study.&#xD;
