      The Aim of this study is to describe the baseline characteristics, procedural and&#xD;
      post-operative clinical characteristics of anaesthetic care delivered to consecutive adult&#xD;
      patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy as part of their routine clinical care between&#xD;
      01/01/2016 and 01/10/2020 at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust (sample size&#xD;
      approximately 250).&#xD;

    <description>This retrospective study will identify the anaesthetic care delivered to a group of patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy for the management of acute ischaemic stroke. The data collected will be from all patients that received this treatment between 01/01/2016 and 01/10/2020 at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. This data written up and of interest both to our organisation and to comparable neuroscience centres in the UK and internationally.&#xD;

        Participants will be identified by existing clinical records of mechanical thrombectomy&#xD;
        procedures undertaken at Nottingham University Hospitals and already collated as part of&#xD;
        routine service evaluation and clinical care. Sampling will be consecutive. The sampling&#xD;
        window (01/01/2016-01/10/2020) has been chosen because mechanical thrombectomy is a new&#xD;
        therapy that was not undertaken in current form before 2016.&#xD;
