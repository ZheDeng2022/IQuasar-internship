  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of an expressive writing intervention on a&#xD;
      sample of new mothers after the childbirth on the psychological health and on the healthcare&#xD;
      costs. The mothers were evaluated also in a follow-up one month after the end of the&#xD;
      expressive writing intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Women are recruited starting from the sixth month of pregnancy; forty-one eventually agreed&#xD;
      to participate and they were randomly assigned to two groups: an Experimental group (treated&#xD;
      with the expressive writing task, one weeks-three months after childbirth) and a Control&#xD;
      group (no intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological health is measured at three stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      before intervention, at 8-9 months pregnant (T0); after intervention, from 1 week to 3 months&#xD;
      after delivery (T1); and a follow-up after 1 to 3 months (T2). The assessment protocol&#xD;
      consists of the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ), the Prenatal Attachment Inventory&#xD;
      (PAI), the Toronto Alexythimia Scale-20 (TAS-20), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-13), the&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), the Rating Scale For Rapid Stress Assessment (VRS)&#xD;
      and the 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12). The healthcare costs are collected at baseline&#xD;
      (T0) and follow-up (T2) with a survey created ad hoc, in which participants reported the&#xD;
      number and the type of the medical examinations, hospitalisations, prescribed drugs etc.&#xD;
      Social and personal data are collected from the first survey.&#xD;

    <description>In order to evaluate the Health-related quality of life, the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey was used. This standardized questionnaire is composed by 12 items selected from SF-36 and produces two summaries, physical (PCS) and mental (MCS) scale (Brazier and Roberts, 2004).</description>

    <description>In order to evaluate the levels of anxiety, the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, STAI-Y, (Spielberger, 1983; Spielberger et al., 1970) was used. It is a self-report questionnaire developed to evaluate both state and trait anxiety, respectively a transitory emotional state and a personality trait considered relatively stable.</description>

    <measure>Healthcare spending</measure>
    <time_frame>Before (T0) and after the writing intervention (T1) and at the follow-up (T2). The outcome assessment lasts about 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>In order to test the healthcare spending to all participants were asked (through a specific questionnaire built ad hoc for the specific situation) the number of medical visits, the number of hospitalizations, the number of admissions to emergency room for acute episodes, the number of hospitalizations stay days in the last year. The study hypothesized a lower number of medical visits, hospitalization's days and admissions to emergency room for those mothers who performed the expressive writing task.</description>

    <measure>Stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Before (T0) and after the writing intervention (T1) and at the follow-up (T2). The outcome assessment lasts about 1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>In order to test the stress levels, the Valutazione Rapida dello stress (VRS) was used. The VRS is rapid self-assessment rating scale for measure of percieved stress. This scale is composed of 15 items and five areas: anxiety, depression, somatization, aggressiveness, and social support. The social support scale measures the percieved lack of social support (Tarsitani and Biondi, 1999).</description>
