      Study the device feasibility of non-surgical treatment for blepharoptosis (inability to open&#xD;
      the eyelid) consisting of a biocompatible magnetic element adhered to the upper eyelid and a&#xD;
      second magnet above the eye on a custom 3D-printed eyeglasses frame with a dial to provide&#xD;
      adjustable magnetic force to open the eye while still allowing eye closure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Extensive description of the study protocol is provided in the Research Strategy (R), but key&#xD;
      components are summarized and justified here. This is a prospective, interventional,&#xD;
      single-arm, single-group open label study. Because the primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      perform prototyping in the interest of developing and determining the feasibility of our&#xD;
      novel approach, randomization to treatment or control is not necessary or appropriate at this&#xD;
      stage. All participants will have ptosis and will be fitted with the experimental custom&#xD;
      adjustable force MLP. Determining if the custom MLP is superior to the non-custom MLP is&#xD;
      beyond the scope of this phase I SBIR project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is custom MLP fitting success defined as 8mm interpalpebral fissure size&#xD;
      or greater, patient desire to engage in a 20-min trial, and comfort rated greater than 5 out&#xD;
      of 10 after the 20 minute trial (all criteria must be met). These criteria may be met at any&#xD;
      one visit in the prototyping process. Therefore, one prototype may fail but if subsequent&#xD;
      prototypes succeed, the case will be rated as a success. Selection of the criteria was based&#xD;
      on a desire to have both objective and subjective metrics. Eye opening of 8mm was selected&#xD;
      because it is a functional amount of eye opening found to be useful to patients in prior&#xD;
      studies (note that these patients do not have inferior lid malposition). We have used&#xD;
      interpalpebral fissure as a primary outcome as opposed to Marginal Reflex Distance (distance&#xD;
      from the corneal reflection to upper lid) in order to allow enrollment of bilateral and&#xD;
      severe cases, and to provide a common outcome for both eye opening and closing on the blink.&#xD;
      Desire to engage in a 20-minute trial was selected as a criteria because it provides some&#xD;
      information on the patient's opinion of the device. Comfort greater than 5 out of 10&#xD;
      indicates better than neutral, and was selected as a minimum goal for success (median comfort&#xD;
      in our prior study was 8 out of 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis method for the primary outcome will be an exact binomial test of one&#xD;
      proportion to determine which condition is met for more than half of patients. If the&#xD;
      prototype approach is successful for greater than half of patients after 20 minutes of wear&#xD;
      there will be a large enough sample for a phase II study to warrant continued development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation for primary outcome: With 10 subjects we will have 80% power to show&#xD;
      that the success rate significantly exceeds 50% with a one-sided alpha=0.05 exact binomial&#xD;
      test of one proportion when the success rate is 8/10 or greater, meaning 8 would have to&#xD;
      succeed to reach significance. With 15 subjects the success rate would need to be 11 to reach&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
