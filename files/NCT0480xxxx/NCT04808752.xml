             lesions that have not undergone local treatment such as irradiation or have clearly&#xD;
             progressed after local treatment, with the longest diameter at baseline ≥10 mm (if it&#xD;
             is a lymph node, the maximum short diameter is required to be ≥15 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The brain condition is stable for at least 2 weeks before the study drug treatment,&#xD;
             without any systemic (oral or parenteral) corticosteroid or anticonvulsant drug&#xD;

             measures and should not breastfeed from signing the informed consent to 6 months after&#xD;
             the last study drug treatment; male patients are willing to take appropriate&#xD;
             contraceptive measures from signing the informed consent to 6 months after the last&#xD;
