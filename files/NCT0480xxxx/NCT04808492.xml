  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of CureWave laser on paraspinal muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation, pressure pain thresholds, muscle edema, and quality, and perceived outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with chronic low back pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) contributes to disability and has a significant economic impact. High&#xD;
      intensity laser devices are class 4 producing &gt; 40 W of power at longer wavelengths, thereby&#xD;
      allowing deeper tissue penetration. Currently, there is little evidence to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of high intensity laser treatment in those with chronic LBP. Optimal dosing&#xD;
      strategies are still unknown as well as patient response based on chronicity of symptoms.&#xD;
      Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the effectives of high intensity laser therapy using&#xD;
      CureWave in those with LBP of a duration longer than 3 months and with a dosing strategy of&#xD;
      two times/week for three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CureWave laser therapy will increase total oxygenated hemoglobin and muscle blood flow&#xD;
           in patients with chronic LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CureWave laser therapy will reduce inflammation as assessed by muscle edema in patients&#xD;
           with chronic LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CureWave laser therapy will improve paraspinal echogenicity (muscle quality) following&#xD;
           treatment in patients with chronic LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. CureWave laser therapy will decrease muscle sensitivity in patients with chronic LBP&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. CureWave laser therapy will demonstrate improve patient reported outcomes, including&#xD;
           decreased pain, reduced disability and improved function in patients with chronic LBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. CureWave laser therapy will increase muscle activation during maximal strength testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. CureWave laser therapy will decrease performance fatigability as assessed by maximal&#xD;
           muscle activation and force production.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>CHANGE in EMG activity of the lumbar paraspinal muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 24-48 hours after baseline; 4 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>EMG will be recorded during all submaximal and maximal strength testing. EMG will be assessed using wireless Bluetooth electrodes that will be attached using double-sided adhesive stickers. All submaximal and maximal strength testing will be performed using a hand-held dynamometer (Microfet 2 Manual Muscle Tester). Subjects will be stabilized using a nylon strap, the same material and mechanism as a seat belt, when necessary to eliminate accessory or compensatory motion during strength testing. This will be placed on their anterior and/or medial thigh with padding to eliminate any discomfort where the strap contacts the skin.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; 24-48 hours after baseline; 4 weeks after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Muscle edema will be assessed via ultrasound using the echo intensity function. Ultrasound images will be obtained using a portable brightness mode (B-mode) ultrasound-imaging device (GE Logiqe, USA) and a multi-frequency linear-array probe (12L-Rs; 5-13MHz; 38.4 mm field-of-view). Ultrasound images will be analyzed using ImageJ software (Version 1.47v., National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). Echo intensity, as assessed by gray-scale analysis (0 arbitrary units [AU], corresponds to black image, 255 AU corresponds to white image) will be performed using the histogram function and will be determined from the same region of interest as muscle thickness.</description>

    <description>The participant will lie prone and the HILT will be administered in two preliminary test locations. In order to evaluate any possible adverse reactions, the initial treatment location will be delivered at a decreased intensity at two separate locations above the target treatment areas. The Power for these two locations will be at a half dose (22 W) for one minute each. The initial, half dose treatment area is indicated by the Blue circles in the image below. Upon conclusion of the initial test treatments (at half dose), the skin with be evaluated for excessive redness or any other changes in skin appearance. Also, the participant will be asked about any discomfort. Should no unanticipated changes in skin appearance occur and the participant reports no discomfort, the treatment will be administered. The process of applying the laser at half dosage will occur prior to each treatment.</description>
