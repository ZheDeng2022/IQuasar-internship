      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 2 basket study to investigate the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of STI-3031, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with&#xD;
      selected RRSTs. All participants will receive STI-3031 20 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Q2W) via IV&#xD;
      infusion over approximately 60 minutes.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has at least one measurable disease per RECIST 1.1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May have been treated with radiation therapy (RT) provided there is measurable disease&#xD;

             least 2 weeks before the first dose of study intervention. No radiopharmaceuticals are&#xD;
             permitted within 8 weeks before the first dose of study intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 16 weeks per investigator assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function as assessed by specific&#xD;
