  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regaining basis mobility after a hip fracture surgery is an important in-hospital&#xD;
      rehabilitation goal because patients who have regained basis mobility at pre-fracture level&#xD;
      at discharge have lower 30-day mortality and readmission rate and are more likely to be&#xD;
      discharged to their own home. However, at discharge only half of the patients have regained&#xD;
      their pre-fracture basis mobility level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensified acute in-hospital physiotherapy (e.g. more than once daily) highlighting&#xD;
      weight-bearing activities and ambulation could have a positive effect on the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who regain their pre-facture basic mobility at discharge. However, data from daily&#xD;
      clinical practice suggest that only half of the patients are able to complete physiotherapy&#xD;
      on the first postoperative day and that fatigue, hip fracture-related pain and habitual&#xD;
      cognitive status are the most frequent reasons for not completing planned physiotherapy (once&#xD;
      daily) during the first three postoperative days. Thus to undertake an RCT investigating the&#xD;
      effect of intensified acute in-hospital physiotherapy i.e. two daily sessions of&#xD;
      physiotherapy compared to usual care i.e. one daily session, on regained pre-facture basic&#xD;
      mobility at discharge in patients with hip fracture raises important practical concerns&#xD;
      regarding e.g. completion rate of planned physiotherapy. The potential positive effects of&#xD;
      intensified physiotherapy will be hampered if too many patients are unable to complete&#xD;
      planned physiotherapy e.g. because of fatigue or pain. Feasibility studies ask whether&#xD;
      something can be done and are preliminary studies conducted specifically for the purposes of&#xD;
      establishing whether or not a full trial will be feasible to conduct. Thus, the main aim of&#xD;
      the trial is to assess the feasibility of conducting a definitive pragmatic RCT in terms of&#xD;
      implementation, practicality and acceptability of intensified acute in-hospital physiotherapy&#xD;
      i.e. two daily sessions of physiotherapy highlighting weight-bearing activities and&#xD;
      ambulation on weekdays among patients with hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main predefined feasibility criterium is that about twice as many physiotherapy sessions&#xD;
      are completed in the intensified physiotherapy group compared to in the usual care&#xD;
      physiotherapy group.&#xD;

    <description>Basic mobility measured by using the Cumulated Ambulation Score (CAS) will be assessed in conjunction with every physiotherapy session on weekdays from the first postoperative day to discharge. The CAS is a tester administered score which describes the patient's independency in (1) getting in and out of bed, (2) sit to stand from a chair, and (3) walking ability (with and without walking aid). Each activity is assessed on a three-point ordinal scale from 0 to 2 (0: Not able to with human assistance and verbal cueing, 1: able to with human assistance or verbal cueing 2: Able to safely without human assistance or verbal cueing) resulting in a total CAS score between 0 and 6 (6 indicating independent ambulation).</description>

    <description>In addition to usual care physiotherapy patients in the intensified physiotherapy group will receive an extra physiotherapy session of up to 30 minutes on every weekday starting on the first postoperative day. The session will include progressive functional training of basic mobility and walking in the ward delivered by an experienced physiotherapist affiliated with the trial. The aim of this additional session is to improve the functional advances achieved during the earlier physiotherapy session.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive approximately 30 minutes physiotherapy once daily in the ward delivered by the ward's usual physiotherapists i.e. starting on the first postoperative day and thereafter primarily on weekdays until discharge (a mean of 8.82 days after admission). Usual care physiotherapy is individualized taking the patients ability and previous level of functioning into account and includes 1) progressive functional training of basic mobility e.g. in-out of bed, sit-to-stand and walking including progression in walking aid, stair training if possible, and advices toward better physical functional level, 2) basic bed exercises with progression to standing exercises according to a hand-out training program and recommendations on doing exercises daily and being as physical active as possible during the day.</description>
