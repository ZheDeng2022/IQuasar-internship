    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine changes in adaptive functioning, quality of life, and&#xD;
      prospective memory among adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) who complete&#xD;
      Strengthening Skills, a multi-faceted, behavioral intervention that combines the PEERS Social&#xD;
      Skills program with cognitive compensation training, mindfulness-based emotional regulation,&#xD;
      and support group components. Participants and their study partners (e.g., spouse, parent,&#xD;
      friend) will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Strengthening Skills, PEERS only,&#xD;
      or a delayed treatment control group. The Strengthening Skills group will meet weekly for 3&#xD;
      hours for 16 weeks and will learn strategies for gaining and maintaining independence and&#xD;
      emotion regulation. Participants will also learn strategies from the PEERS Social Skills&#xD;
      Program. The PEERS only group will meet weekly for 1.5 hours for 16 weeks and will only learn&#xD;
      strategies from the PEERS Social Skills Program. The delayed treatment control group will&#xD;
      participant in data collection at four time points over a 10-month wait period, after which,&#xD;
      they will be enrolled into the Strengthening Skills Program. Behavioral self-report data will&#xD;
      be collected and a prospective memory assessment will be conducted before and after&#xD;
      participation in the 16-week programs. Behavioral self-report data will also be collected at&#xD;
      remote 3- and 6-month follow-up visits.&#xD;

    <description>The ABAS-3 Adult Form is a self and other-report questionnaire designed specifically for adult participants (ages 16 to 89), which yields standard scores (Mean = 100, Standard Deviation = 15) in three adaptive domains (i.e., Conceptual, Social, and Practical) and a General Adaptive Composite (GAC).</description>

    <description>Adults with ASD and their study partners (i.e., spouse, parent, other family member, or friend) will attend weekly 3 hour meetings for 16 weeks, during which, behavioral intervention strategies will be used to teach cognitive compensation and mindfulness-based emotion regulation skills. Strategies from the PEERS Social Skills Program will also be taught. Participants will be assigned homework assignments each week to practice skills they are learning in a real-world setting.</description>

    <description>The Strengthening Skills Program is a new, multi-component intervention. It includes three components: (1) Forming habits to compensate for the difficulties many adults with ASD have with thinking flexibly, planning, and time management. It will emphasize habit-forming behaviors to compensate for weaknesses in functional skills by training on practical techniques; (2) Content from the PEERS Social Skills program to target social challenges, and (3) strategies derived from Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction to target emotion regulation.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Must be able to attend at least 14 of the 16 weekly intervention sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English speaking: Participants must be English-speaking because the screening and&#xD;
             behavioral measures are in English (including the intelligence estimate), as well as&#xD;
             the intervention content&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-verbal participants will be excluded to ensure test compliance and increase sample&#xD;
             homogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with IQ (intelligence quotient) scores lower than 70 will be excluded&#xD;
             because the interventions were developed for individuals without intellectual&#xD;
             disability.&#xD;
