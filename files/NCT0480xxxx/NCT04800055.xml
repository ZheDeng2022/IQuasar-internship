  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will evaluate the efficacy of ATSB deployment plus universal coverage of a WHO core&#xD;
      vector control (VC) interventions over two transmission seasons on a minimum 30% reduction in&#xD;
      cohort clinical disease incidence, confirmed case incidence, and parasite prevalence, as&#xD;
      compared with VC alone. Measurement of entomological outcomes, assessment of acceptability&#xD;
      and barriers to uptake and consistent use of ATSB, safety and adverse event monitoring and&#xD;
      estimation of the cost and cost-effectiveness of ATSB will also occur.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT) design will be used&#xD;
      comparing ATSB + LLINS vs LLINS alone (standard of care). A cluster trial design is indicated&#xD;
      given the intended community-level effect of ATSBs on malaria transmission. Universal LLIN&#xD;
      coverage will be ensured in both arms prior to start of the study and will serve as the&#xD;
      standard of care. Arm 1 will receive ATSBs for two years. Arm 2 will receive the standard of&#xD;
      care of universal LLIN coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty clusters will be used for the trial per site, with 30 clusters allocated to the ATSB&#xD;
      intervention plus universal LLIN coverage arm, and 30 clusters allocated to the control with&#xD;
      standard of care arm, universal LLIN coverage. Restricted randomization will be used to&#xD;
      randomize the 60 clusters to intervention and control arms. The incidence cohort and&#xD;
      cross-sectional household surveys will each be powered to detect a 30% reduction in the&#xD;
      malaria outcome over two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quantify the efficacy of ATSBs for reducing P. falciparum clinical case incidence, parasite&#xD;
      prevalence, community infection incidence, and health facility confirmed malaria case&#xD;
      incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantify the efficacy of ATSBs for reducing target malaria vector density, altering the&#xD;
           population age structure by reducing longevity, and reducing sporozoite and&#xD;
           entomological inoculation rates (EIR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the durability of the ATSB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess community acceptance of ATSB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify barriers to high and effective ATSB coverage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Understand the impact of ATSB deployment on LLIN use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Document cost and cost-effectiveness of ATSB deployment.&#xD;

    <description>ATSBs will be installed on all structures of consenting households in intervention areas for six months according to instructions from the manufacturer. Monitoring assistants will be responsible for providing individual level household orientation for the ATSB and seeking informed consent. Prior to ATSB deployment, community sensitization activities will be conducted to prepare communities for the intervention and research activities. Where appropriate, local media may be used to disseminate messages to sensitize the community to the intervention and the research.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Residence within the buffer zone&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &lt;12 months or ≥15 years of age at the time of cohort enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Household contained a participant in the first cohort (for participation in the second&#xD;
             cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant at the time of cohort enrollment. Pregnant adolescents are excluded because&#xD;
             they are eligible for protection from infection through pregnancy standard of care -&#xD;

             pregnancy status during each cohort visit. When an adolescent indicates that she is&#xD;
             pregnant or is unsure of her pregnancy status, she will no longer be followed for&#xD;
             ongoing blood testing for the reasons noted above and will be censored in the&#xD;
             analysis.&#xD;
