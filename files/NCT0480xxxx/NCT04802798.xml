    <textblock>
      This study is an exploratory study aimed at gaining a greater understanding of the cause of&#xD;
      abdominal bloating in response to two distinct fibre types. This is a single-center,&#xD;
      interventional double blinded randomized cross-over study. Each participant will consume each&#xD;
      of the study products (placebo, fibre 1 and fibre 2) for a 7-day period with a 3-week washout&#xD;
      period in between. Outcomes will be measured before and after each intervention period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators have 4 hypotheses linked to 4 research questions that will be answered by&#xD;
      this research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: participants with self-reported functional bloating in response to either&#xD;
      fibre-1 or fibre-2, but not both, will respond symptomatically to fibre-1 or fibre-2, defined&#xD;
      as 'fibre-1 responders' and 'fibre-2 responders'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: participants with functional bloating who are 'fibre-1 responders' will be&#xD;
      distinguishable from 'fibre-1 non-responders', and 'fibre-2 responders' will be&#xD;
      distinguishable from 'fibre-2 non-responders', based upon faecal microbial profiles&#xD;
      identified using faecal metagenomics, transcriptomics and metabolites at baseline and&#xD;
      following the fibre-1 and fibre-2 interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: the microbiota, clinical and nutritional profiles of participants with&#xD;
      functional bloating will be interrelated and these relationships will be distinguishable&#xD;
      between 'fibre-1 responders', 'fibre-1 non-responders', and 'fibre-2 responders' and 'fibre-2&#xD;
      non-responders'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: participants with visceral hypersensitivity will have different faecal&#xD;
      microbiota and will be more likely to be a 'fibre-1 responders' or 'fibre-2 responders' than&#xD;
      'non-responders'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the trial will take three different dietary substances, each at a dose of 8&#xD;
      grams per day (split into two serves of 4 gram doses) for 7-days in a double-blinded&#xD;
      randomised order with a 3-week washout period in between each intervention. The products are&#xD;
      provided in powdered format and will be mixed with water before drinking. The products being&#xD;
      provided are glucose, and fibre-1 or fibre-2 (all extracts of commonly consumed food&#xD;
      products).&#xD;

    <measure>Bloating as measured by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) (Primary clinical response): end of first intervention period (day 7)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>As this is an exploratory study to determine the underlying mechanisms of bloating the investigators have identified a primary and secondary symptom responder definition (those that become bloated in response to the intervention) that will be used to examine and compare the research outcome measures.&#xD;
The primary responder definition is: reporting moderate or severe bloating (a score of 2 or 3) on at least two of the final three days of the fibre-1 or fibre-2 challenge, measured using the Gastrointestinal Symptoms Rating Scale (GSRS), which rates individual gastrointestinal symptoms on a 4-point Likert scale (0-3). The primary responder definition of response will also be measured at the end of the placebo period.</description>

             screening phone call).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals willing to provide consent and follow the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals who report that due to perceived trigger food avoidance, symptoms are well&#xD;
