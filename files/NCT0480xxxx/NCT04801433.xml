    <time_frame>Change of success rate from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The overall criteria for assessing the severity of disease for researchers are a static skin scoring system consisting of six levels (score of 0-5) of change from &quot;disappearance&quot; to &quot;very serious&quot; diseases.&#xD;
The main endpoint of the overall assessment criteria for disease severity according to the researchers will be &quot;disease control&quot;, defined as &quot;disappearance (score of 0) &quot; or &quot;extreme mild (score of 1) &quot; disease grade at the end of treatment.&#xD;
At the end of treatment, the proportion of the subjects who are evaluated as disease under control (signs disappeared and extremely mild) by &quot;the overall assessment of the severity of disease by researchers&quot; base on observation. Comparing the disease control rates among the groups can reflect the differentiation treatment efficacy.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The clinical signs of psoriasis (erythema, infiltration, and scaly) (The Total sign score (TSS))</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of sclinical signs of psoriasis from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Scoring each symptom once on the basis of the five-point system given below can assess the average severity of all scalp lesions.&#xD;
0 = no sign&#xD;
= Mild&#xD;
= Medium&#xD;
= Severity&#xD;
= Extremely severe&#xD;
At the end of treatment, researchers need to evaluate scalp psoriasis in all subjects from three aspects: erythema, infiltration and scales. The percentage of remission per clinical sign (erythema, infiltration, scales) in each group (percentage of patients with clinical score = 0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation criteria of pruritus symptoms in the subjects</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of spruritus symptoms from baseline at 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>At the end of treatment, the subject are assessed for the severity of the disease according to the four-level system presented below. Researchers should explain the grading criteria to patients, and the subjects should judge the grading and tick it.&#xD;
Asymptomatic: no itching;&#xD;
Mild: mild itching, no irritation;&#xD;
Moderate: markedly itchy, somewhat irritable, but no insomnia;&#xD;
Severe: Strong itching causes significant irritability, affects sleep, and scratches are visible.</description>
