  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, pragmatic, direct-to-participant trial designed&#xD;
      for infants. The study will be conducted using a mobile application platform to engage&#xD;
      parents with healthy infants and parents with infants with eczema in introducing&#xD;
      complementary feeding in line with new feeding guidelines for diet diversity, gather parental&#xD;
      experiences of feeding, support early introduction of different food proteins and support&#xD;
      feeding of SpoonfulONE.&#xD;
