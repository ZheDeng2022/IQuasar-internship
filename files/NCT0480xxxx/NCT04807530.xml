  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial in healthy controls (HC) and patients with schizophrenia&#xD;
      (SZ) aims to examine 1) the underlying cognitive and neural cause of self-agency deficits in&#xD;
      SZ; 2) the responsiveness to a novel navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (nrTMS) target in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC); and 3) how modulation of mPFC activity&#xD;
      impacts the larger self-agency network to mediate changes in self-agency judgments. Our&#xD;
      overall hypothesis is that increased mPFC excitability by active high-frequency nrTMS in HC&#xD;
      and SZ will induce behavioral improvements in self-agency and neural changes in the larger&#xD;
      self-agency network that will generalize to improvements in overall cognition, symptoms and&#xD;
      daily functioning, and will likely lead to the development of new effective neuromodulation&#xD;
      therapies in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This longitudinal mechanistic randomized controlled trial in patients with schizophrenia (SZ)&#xD;
      and matched healthy controls (HC) examines the underlying cause of self-agency deficits in SZ&#xD;
      and their responsiveness to navigated repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) of&#xD;
      the medial prefrontal cortex. Using a multimodal neuroimaging approach that combines&#xD;
      structural MRI with functional magnetoencephalography imaging (MEGI) and nrTMS that is&#xD;
      integrated with cognitive and clinical assessments, this research provides an unprecedented&#xD;
      rigorous assessment of the neural and cognitive basis of self-agency and its modulation by&#xD;
      nrTMS, using two distinct and validated paradigms involving speech monitoring (pitch&#xD;
      perturbation) and reality monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will first be assessed for 1 week for diagnostic inclusion criteria and eligibility&#xD;
      assessment. They will complete baseline assessments (i.e., cognitive, clinical and daily&#xD;
      functioning assessments, structural MRI, and MEGI scans while they perform reality and speech&#xD;
      monitoring tasks). After baseline assessments, 80 SZ and 80 age, gender, and&#xD;
      education-matched HC will be randomly assigned to 5 daily sessions of either active 10Hz&#xD;
      nrTMS targeting mPFC (40HC and 40SZ) or nrTMS targeting a control posterior superior temporal&#xD;
      site (pSTS) (40HC and 40SZ). For the pSTS site, the investigators will use the same TMS&#xD;
      protocol parameters as the active nrTMS condition. Between and within group analyses will&#xD;
      utilize repeated measures mixed-effects models to examine durability and generalizability of&#xD;
      behavioral, cognitive, clinical and whole-brain neural oscillatory network changes (with&#xD;
      focus on mPFC) after neuromodulation by active nrTMS at proximal, and distal post-nrTMS&#xD;
      time-points, compared to control nrTMS of pSTS and baseline. Whole-brain correlations will be&#xD;
      computed between neural activity (e.g., with focus on mPFC) related to self-agency during&#xD;
      reality and speech monitoring tasks and behavior (e.g., self-generated retrieval accuracy and&#xD;
      corrective response magnitude), and between neural activity with cognition, clinical symptoms&#xD;
      and daily functioning).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The investigators propose a longitudinal randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which 80 SZ and 80 HC are randomly assigned to either active high-frequency 10Hz nrTMS to increase activity in mPFC or a control posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus (pSTS) site. The investigators assess durability and generalizability of how active 10Hz nrTMS modulation of mPFC activity in HC and SZ causally induces neural network changes that mediate behavioral changes in self-agency to impact overall cognition, clinical and daily functioning, compared to the control pSTS site and baseline.</intervention_model_description>
