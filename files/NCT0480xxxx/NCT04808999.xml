    <textblock>
      This phase II single-arm two-stage neoadjuvant study of pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1&#xD;
      naïve high-risk resectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) will be conducted over a&#xD;
      52-week period. The study will include patients who have not undergone surgery to remove&#xD;
      disease, to formally evaluate whether both biologically and clinically high-risk disease may&#xD;
      benefit from neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy. Response to neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy will be&#xD;
      evaluated for association with improved landmark Relapse-free Survival (RFS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with high-risk resectable cSCC who have yet to undergo definitive surgery will be&#xD;
      eligible to enroll. Patients with nodal and/or in-transit relapse including those who have&#xD;
      received prior adjuvant RT are eligible to enroll. This trial excludes patients who have&#xD;
      received either nivolumab or pembrolizumab or other anti-PD-(L)1 therapy. Suitable patients&#xD;
      will be identified pre-operatively. Patients will undergo a 28-day screening evaluation&#xD;
      consisting of systemic staging scans, tumor biopsy, and blood studies to confirm suitability.&#xD;
      Once enrolled, patients will receive pembrolizumab peri-operatively for 6 weeks (200mg Q3Wq3;&#xD;
      2 cycles) prior to definitive surgery (Neoadjuvant Phase). Following peri-operative therapy,&#xD;
      patients will undergo restaging scans and surgical evaluation followed by definitive surgical&#xD;
      resection (Surgical Phase). Post-operatively, patients will receive 15 further cycles of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab over a 45-week period (200mg q3Q3W) (Adjuvant Phase). In the post-operative&#xD;
      period, if patients are deemed eligible for RT, this will be administered concurrently with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. The total duration of pembrolizumab therapy is 1 year (52 weeks).&#xD;
