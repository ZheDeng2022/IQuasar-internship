    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of duvelisib or CC-486 and usual chemotherapy&#xD;
      consisting of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide, and prednisone in&#xD;
      treating patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Duvelisib may stop the growth of cancer&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      CC-486, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, etoposide and prednisone, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial may help find out if this&#xD;
      approach is better or worse than the usual approach for treating peripheral T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the complete remission (CR) rates by positron emission tomography&#xD;
      (PET)/computed tomography (CT) following completion of treatment with&#xD;
      duvelisib-cyclophosphamide (C) doxorubicin (H) vincristine (O) (etoposide [E]) prednisone (P)&#xD;
      versus (vs) CHO(E)P and with oral azacitidine (CC-486)-CHO(E)P vs CHO(E)P in previously&#xD;
      untreated peripheral T-cell lymphomas that have &lt; 10% expression of CD30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the toxicity and tolerability of the treatment regimens. II. To determine the&#xD;
      overall response rate (ORR), duration of response, progression free survival (PFS), event&#xD;
      free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) of each treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine whether designation of follicular helper T-cell phenotype is correlated&#xD;
      with response to therapy, PFS, EFS, and OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the toxicity profile of the experimental regimens in untreated CD30 negative&#xD;
      peripheral T-cell lymphomas using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on day 1, doxorubicin IV on day&#xD;
      1, vincristine IV on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3 or etoposide IV on day 1 and orally (PO)&#xD;
      once daily (QD) on days 2-3 for patients &lt;=60 years old, and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5.&#xD;
      Patients also receive duvelisib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 1, doxorubicin IV on day 1, vincristine IV&#xD;
      on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3 or etoposide IV on day 1 and orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 2-3 for patients &lt;=60 years old, and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5. Patients also&#xD;
      receive CC-486 PO QD on days -6 to 0 of cycle -1 and days 8-21 of cycles 1-5. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on day 1, doxorubicin IV on day 1, vincristine IV&#xD;
      on day 1, etoposide IV on days 1-3 or etoposide IV on day 1 and orally (PO) once daily (QD)&#xD;
      on days 2-3 for patients &lt;=60 years old, and prednisone PO QD on days 1-5. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks after cycle 6 day 1,&#xD;
      then every 12 weeks for 2 years, then every 24 weeks until 5 years from end of treatment or&#xD;
      until documented progression of lymphoma. After documented progression of lymphoma, patients&#xD;
      are followed up every 6 months until 5 years from end of treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Complete remission (CR) rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the number of patients with complete remission (CR) divided by the total number of patients randomized. Will be measured by fludeoxyglucose F-18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) at the completion of treatment (at end of treatment) and will be compared between each experimental arm and control arm. Final analyses will use z-scores obtained from a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test to compare the CR rates between each experimental arm and control arm. For each treatment arm, CR rates will be estimated with their 95% confidence intervals.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be collected and graded according to the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0 criteria.

    <time_frame>From randomization date until death from any cause, censoring patients alive at the date of last contact, assessed up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate overall survival (OS) for each treatment arm, with 2-year OS estimates and OS medians along with their 95% confidence intervals.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Correlation of follicular helper T-cell phenotype with response, PFS, EFS and OS</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>CR rates and ORRs will be estimated with 95% confidence intervals for patients with and without the follicular helper T-cell phenotype, as well for patients with the peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) genotype.</description>
