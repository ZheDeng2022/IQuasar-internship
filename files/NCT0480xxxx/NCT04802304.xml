  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beyond Bias will evaluate the impact of an intervention designed to reduce family planning&#xD;
      provider bias towards young, unmarried, and nulliparous women in Tanzania, Burkina Faso, and&#xD;
      Pakistan. The intervention has three components: 1) a summit that includes impactful stories&#xD;
      told to and by family planning providers that highlight the consequences of provider bias, 2)&#xD;
      a forum for continued communication between providers, and 3) a rewards program where clinics&#xD;
      in which providers exhibit less biased client interactions or who have improved the most&#xD;
      towards this end will be rewarded with social recognition and a ceremony.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half of the eligible clinics in each country (233 in total) are randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      the intervention, while the remaining half serves as control. The objective of the evaluation&#xD;
      is to estimate the impact of the intervention on a range of outcomes related to quality of&#xD;
      family planning care among young, unmarried, and nulliparous women. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that the intervention will increase the share of young, unmarried, and&#xD;
      nulliparous women who received counseling on a range of methods, counseling on long acting&#xD;
      methods, and who received their preferred method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect four types of data to evaluate the intervention: 1) provider&#xD;
      surveys, 2) mystery clients' visits, 3) direct observations of client-provider interactions,&#xD;
      and 4) qualitative interviews with clients, providers, and implementors.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Whether client was able to receive services</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of whether the client received family planning services on the day they came into the clinic. This will be measured from real clients using client exit surveys and using mystery clients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Optimal Counseling</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of whether the client was counseled on all methods that were good options for the client given her background and preferences. This will be coded as 1 if client was counseled on the full set of optimal family planning methods and zero if the client was not counseled on the full set of optimal family planning methods. This will be collected in the client exit survey and in by mystery clients.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Received modern method</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of whether the client received a modern family planning method during her visit. This will be collected in the client exit survey only.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived patient centeredness</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite scale (ranging from 0 to 1) that measures the extent to which the client perceived the her interaction with family provider as patient centered. The questions included in the scale will be chosen based on data driven factor analysis methods. Higher scores will indicate better patient centeredness. This will be collected in the client exit survey and in by mystery clients.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider biased attitudes</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after the intervention starts</time_frame>
    <description>This is a composite scale (ranging from 0 to 1) that measures the extent to which providers have biased attitudes towards young, unmarried, and adolescent women. The questions included in the scale will be chosen based on data driven factor analysis methods. Higher scores will indicate better patient centeredness. This will be collected through a provider survey.</description>
