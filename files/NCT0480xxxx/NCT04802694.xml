  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study was planned to compare the effect of products, used in the fixation of&#xD;
      nasogastric tube, on skin integrity of 4-6 weeks infants hospitalized at neonatal and infant&#xD;
      units. The hypothesis of the study is &quot;Water-based barrier tape is more effective to protect&#xD;
      skin integrity than hydrocolloid barrier tape.&quot;&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned as randomized controlled and experimental design to compare the&#xD;
      efficiency of three different methods protecting skin deficiencies using adhesive products&#xD;
      for 4-6 weeks infants. The universe of the study consisted of 4-6 weeks infants in neonatal&#xD;
      and infants clinics of Giresun Women's and Children's Hospital between the dates of October&#xD;
      2020-2021. Power analysis was performed through G*Power (v3.1.7) programme in order to&#xD;
      determine the number of the sample. At the beginning of the study, a pilot study was carried&#xD;
      out with 15 participants from each of the groups and the effect size was calculated as&#xD;
      d=0.672 regarding the assessment of skin condition scores and 108 participants in total&#xD;
      should be included in the study as 36 participants for each groups in order to obtain 80%&#xD;
      power in the level of α=0.05. Block randomization technique is applied in the study as a&#xD;
      randomization method. &quot;As for data collection &quot;Infant desciption form&quot; and &quot;Neonatal Skin&#xD;
      Condition Score Scale&quot; is used. The scale is filled by two independent observer via&#xD;
      double-blind method.&#xD;

    <description>The infants in experiment 1 group will be applied water-based barrier tape. The area will be covered by water-based barrier tape to fix nasogastric tube and after waiting 1 minute for drying up it will be fastened by silk tape used in clinic. The silk tape will be 5 cm long and it will be changed in every 24 hours. Following the removal of silk tape on the water-based barrier tape, the skin integrity of the infants will be evaluated through &quot;Neonatal Skin Condition Score Scale&quot; and the score will be recorded in the chart. Water-based barrier tape will be applied to the area every time the plaster will be changed and current skin condition score will be noted to the chart.</description>

    <description>As for experiment 2 group, hydrocolloid barrier tape will be used to fix the nasogastric tube. The hydrocolloid barrier tape, which was cut and shaped appropriately beforehand, will be applied to the area in order to stabilize the nasogastric tube and the tube will be stabilized with silk tape used in clinic. The silk tape will be 5 cm long and it will be changed in every 24 hours. Following the removal of silk tape on the hydrocolloid barrier tape, the skin integrity of the infants will be evaluated through &quot;Neonatal Skin Condition Score Scale&quot; . Since the hydrocolloid barrier tape can stay on the skin for 7 days and be transparent, the assessment of skin condition will be realized for 7 days and noted down to the chart.</description>
