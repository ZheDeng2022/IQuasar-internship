    <description>A baseline survey will be administered prior to the session.Sessions will be initiated by exploring working conditions and psychosocial factors that may influence risk for work related injuries. If the LDL is motivated to change the target behavior, a 'change plan' will be developed which involves identifying reasons for change, goals in making change, specific actions and timelines, and others who may help the person change. The final step will be the development of a personal safety plan to reduce work place risks and a discussion of the following topics: (a) how they will know if their plan is successful, (b) potential obstacles, and (c) what the worker can do if the plan does not work. Finally,each worker will be asked to write and sign a personal pledge (&quot;Mi Promesa&quot;) to implement his own safety plan.Follow-up surveys will be conducted 4 weeks after the baseline survey.</description>

    <description>Participant will be administered a baseline survey prior to the session.The group activity intervention will consist of a discussion between 3-4 LDL and a promotor (a peer LDL) trained as a group facilitator. The sessions are expected to last 20-30 minutes and are intended to provide an opportunity for the participants to work on a safety problem together, get to know each other, and enhance their mutual safety through mutual support.Follow-up surveys will be conducted 4 weeks after the baseline survey. Oral informed consent will be obtained prior to each follow-up survey. The follow-up surveys will reassess participants' work and injury experiences and experiences with the safety intervention they were provided - safety cards, change plan, or safety plan.</description>

    <description>Participant will be administered a baseline survey prior to the session.Participants in this standard of care control group will receive four wallet size cards with information about risk reduction strategies to deal with the four hazards responsible for most workplace fatalities in Texas: falls, struck by, heat exposure and cuts. The laminated cards are adapted from OSHA's website publicly available materials in Spanish for workers with limited literacy.</description>
