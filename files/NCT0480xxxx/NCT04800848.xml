  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this multicenter randomized crossover design study is to evaluate a sample of 500&#xD;
      boys and girls from public and private schools in the Principality of Asturias, aged between&#xD;
      6 and 12 years, with the objective of determining the level of physical condition, as well as&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of the use of FFP2/N95 face masks during the execution of the ALPHA&#xD;
      Fitness battery, and the emotional effects caused by the use of these masks. This is a sample&#xD;
      obtained by accessibility, in which the sampling will be stratified by age and academic year.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The Physical Activity Questionnaire for Children (PAQ-C) will be administered to determine the amount and intensity of physical activity that children perform during a week. It consists of ten items, nine of which are used to calculate the activity level and the other item assesses whether any illness or other event prevented the child from doing regular activities in the last week. The overall result of the test is a score from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating a higher level of activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Sedentarism</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>In order to know the sedentary behaviors of schoolchildren, a questionnaire will be passed to them that seeks to know the time they habitually dedicate to various sedentary behaviors. The questionnaire assess the amount of time spent doing 6 behaviors (watching television, playing computer, playing video games, surfing the Internet for hobby, surfing the Internet by study, sitting and studying). The 6 items were completed separately for weekdays and weekend days. With a scale from 1 to 7, such that higher scores indicate a higher level of sedentary lifestyle.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional states</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the emotional state, the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) questionnaire will be implemented, which consists of two scales: dysphoria (depressive mood, sadness, worry, etc.) and negative self-esteem (judgments of inefficiency, ugliness, badness, etc.) with which to measure the effects of the pandemic on the child population and the situation of anxiety that it produces. The questionnaire will be answered directly by the children, as a self-report.&#xD;
The original version has 27 items, with five subscales within the assessment that measure different components of depression, with three response options for each item.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip strength</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The isometric strength of the upper body (manual grip) using a manual dynamometer with adjustable grip (Takei TKK-5401) and for this purpose there is a table-rule to adjust the grip according to the length of the subject's palm. The test will be performed twice, alternately with both hands, and the best result obtained will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Horizontal Jump</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The test will be carried out with or without face mask depending on the cross design.&#xD;
The horizontal jump with feet together measures the explosive strength of the lower body. Each student will perform the test twice and the best result obtained will be recorded. If in either of the two attempts the child falls backwards or contacts the surface with a part of the body other than the feet, a new jump will be allowed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Horizontal Jump</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 2 (two weeks later)</time_frame>
    <description>Those who performed the first measurement with a face mask, in the second measurement will perform the test without a face mask, and vice versa.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Speed and agility</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The test will be carried out with or without face mask depending on the cross design.&#xD;
The 4 x 10m speed and agility test measures speed of movement, agility and coordination. Participants will perform the test twice, with the best result being recorded in seconds to one decimal place. The test will be performed on a non-slip surface so that there is no possibility of slipping.</description>

    <measure>Aerobic capacity</measure>
    <time_frame>at the beginning of the study (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>The test will be carried out with or without face mask depending on the cross design.&#xD;
The 20m shuttle run test also known as 'Course Navette' is a maximal effort test that measures the maximum aerobic capacity, allowing to know the current and future cardiovascular health profile of the children who perform the study. The test will be performed once, over a uniform surface of 30 meters, 20 meters of which will be used for the test. When the child stops, the last stage or number announced by a CD with the test protocol will be recorded, which will set the pace to be followed throughout the test. The test will be executed individually as a preventive measure.</description>
