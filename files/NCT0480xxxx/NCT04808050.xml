  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multicentre, retrospective study designed to&#xD;
      determine the treatment patterns and associated survival rate in patients with primary stage&#xD;
      IA to IIIB resectable NSCLC diagnosed between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 and&#xD;
      followed until at least 31 December 2020 The main objective of this study is to describe the&#xD;
      treatment patterns and determine their associated 3-year survival rate according to clinical&#xD;
      and pathologic staging in patients with resectable early-stage (IA to IIIB as per AJCC&#xD;
      seventh edition) NSCLC.&#xD;

      This is a non-interventional, multi-country, multicentre, retrospective study designed to&#xD;
      determine the treatment patterns and associated survival rate in patients with primary stage&#xD;
      IA to IIIB resectable NSCLC diagnosed between 01 January 2013 and 31 December 2017 and&#xD;
      followed until at least 31 December 2020. This study will also determine the prevalence of&#xD;
      EGFR mutations and PD-L1 expression, and the clinical outcomes as per the treatment patterns&#xD;
      and clinico-pathological staging. Data will be collected retrospectively from the patients'&#xD;
      medical records from the date of initial diagnosis of early-stage NSCLC (index date) to the&#xD;
      end of follow up ie, until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction,&#xD;
      whichever is the earliest. The data on treatment modalities, sociodemographic,&#xD;
      clinico-pathological characteristics, and exposure and outcome variables (ie, medical and&#xD;
      treatment history, disease staging, biomarker assessments, radiological findings, concomitant&#xD;
      medications, survival), factor(s) for prescribing neo-adjuvant and/or adjuvant treatment and&#xD;
      reason(s) for discontinuation will be extracted from patients' medical records.&#xD;
