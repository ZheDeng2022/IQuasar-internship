    <textblock>
      The objective of this single-blind, parallel-arm, randomized clinical trial is to evaluate&#xD;
      changes in body weight and composition, assess determinants of energy balance, and measure&#xD;
      modulators of energy intake and expenditure, following 8 wk of calorie restriction (CR, -500&#xD;
      kcal/d) in combination with either overnight exposure (8 h/night) to normobaric hypoxia (NH;&#xD;
      15% oxygen, ~8500 ft elevation) or normoxia (NN; 21% oxygen, sea level), using a commercially&#xD;
      available, in-home tent system, in adults who are overweight or obese.&#xD;

      The current research study will evaluate changes in body weight and composition, assess&#xD;
      determinants of energy balance, and measure modulators of energy intake and expenditure,&#xD;
      following 8 wk of calorie restriction (CR, -500 kcal/d) in combination with either overnight&#xD;
      exposure to normobaric hypoxia (NH) or normoxia (NN). Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      follow their normal diet but with a 500 kcal/day deficit as advised by a Registered&#xD;
      Dietitian. Participants will spend 8 hours/night in a tent, set-up around their bed, in their&#xD;
      home, for 8 weeks. Participants sleeping in the hypoxic tent (Hypoxico Inc., New York, NY,&#xD;
      commercially available tents: https://hypoxico.com/) will breath ~15% oxygen (achieved with&#xD;
      nitrogen dilution, equivalent to ~8500 ft elevation), whereas those in the control tent&#xD;
      (Hypoxico Inc.) will breath ~21% oxygen (achieved with nitrogen dilution, equivalent to sea&#xD;
      level elevation). Trained research staff will set-up the hypoxic or control tent system in&#xD;
      each participant's home on day 0 and will visit the participant's home on days 1, 2, and 3 to&#xD;
      check and/or adjust the tent settings. After day 3, research staff will visit the&#xD;
      participant's home weekly to check and/or adjust the tent settings. participants will be&#xD;
      weighed each morning following an overnight fast and morning void. Participants will come to&#xD;
      the laboratory on two separate days for baseline testing (days -1 and 0) and again on two&#xD;
      separate days at the end of the study (days 55 and 56) for endpoint testing.&#xD;

    <description>Body weight will be measured during baseline (days -7 to 0) and each morning during the study (days 1 to 56) following an overnight fast and morning void, using a calibrated digital scale provided to participants to use at home (A&amp;D Medical wireless weight scale UC-352BLE, San Jose, CA). Percent change in body weight will be calculated as:&#xD;
[Body weight - baseline body weight (average of days -7 to 0)]/ baseline body weight * 100</description>

    <measure>4-compartment body composition using DEXA and deuterium dilution</measure>
    <time_frame>Days -1 and 55</time_frame>
    <description>Body composition will be determined following a 12 hour fast and morning void on day -1 and 55 using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA, Discovery W, Hologic Inc., Bedford, MA or equivalent). The volunteer will remove all metal-containing objects from their body, lay face-up on the DEXA densitometer table in light clothing (t-shirt, shorts, socks), and be asked to remain motionless for the 8-10 min scan. A scanner emitting low energy x-rays and a detector will pass over the participant. These data will be used to calculate total body mass, fat-free mass, fat mass, and bone mass. Total body water will be measured following a 12 hour fast and 1 hour without water intake using the deuterium dilution method on days -1 and 55.</description>

    <time_frame>Days -1 and 55</time_frame>
    <description>Blood volume will be determined using the optimized carbon monoxide rebreathing method on days -1 and 55. In this method, a capillary blood sample is taken, and basal carboxyhemoglobin concentrations will be determined using a blood gas analyzer. Carbon monoxide is then inhaled via a spirometer (SpiCo, Blood Tec.) for 2 minutes. Seven minutes after inhaling the carbon monoxide bolus, a second capillary blood sample is taken to determine the increase in carboxyhemoglobin concentration. The change in percentage of carboxyhemoglobin between the basal and second measurements can be used to calculate hemoglobin mass and blood volume.</description>
