  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of multimorbidities is very common among the elderly, which become major&#xD;
      consumers of medicines. The process of prescribing medicines for the elderly should be done&#xD;
      with caution, as the use of some medications may present more risks than benefits in this&#xD;
      range age. Potentially inappropriate prescribing for the elderly has become a global concern&#xD;
      for the promotion of an adequate pharmacotherapy, it becomes essential to be aware of the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of medicines and the knowledge of which drugs whose risks of serious&#xD;
      adverse reactions outweigh the benefit of your referral. In this sense, the present study has&#xD;
      aim to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmaceutical interventions in frequency of omission of&#xD;
      drugs with proven efficacy for cardiovascular diseases and promotion of treatment&#xD;
      prescription inappropriate and polypharmacy. A prospective quasi experimental before and&#xD;
      after study will be carried out in elderly patients diagnosed with cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      admitted to the Ana Nery hospital, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil. A convenience sample will be&#xD;
      collected, the data will be released and revised in a database built in the SPSS software and&#xD;
      analyzed in the program statistic R and SPSS. At the end of the study, it is expected a&#xD;
      decrease in the frequency of omission of medications and promotion of prescription drugs&#xD;
      inappropriate.&#xD;
