  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for participants that have been diagnosed with intractable Obsessive&#xD;
      -compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a persistent and oftentimes disabling disorder marked by&#xD;
      unwanted and distressing thoughts (obsessions) and irresistible repetitive behaviors. OCD&#xD;
      affects 2-3% of the US population, and is responsible for substantial functional impairment&#xD;
      and increased risk of early death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only established first-line treatments for OCD are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      with exposure and response prevention and certain medications. About 30-40% of patients fail&#xD;
      to respond and few experience complete symptom resolution. Up to 25% of patients have&#xD;
      difficulty tolerating CBT and the risk of relapse after therapies remains large. For the most&#xD;
      severe cases, neurosurgery (surgery in the brain), has long been the option of last resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want develop an adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) system&#xD;
      to use in subjects with intractable (hard to control) OCD. Deep brain stimulation (DBS)&#xD;
      remains investigational for OCD patients and is not considered standard therapy. DBS involves&#xD;
      the surgical implantation of leads and electrodes into specific areas of the brain, which are&#xD;
      thought to influence the disease. A pack implanted in the chest, called the neurotransmitter,&#xD;
      keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain through a wire that connects the&#xD;
      neurotransmitter and electrodes. It is believed DBS may restore balance to dysfunctional&#xD;
      brain circuitry implicated in OCD. The goal of this study is to enhance current approaches to&#xD;
      DBS targeting in the brain and to use a novel approach to find a better and more reliable&#xD;
      system for OCD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current research protocol will focus on the completion of Phase II which will implant&#xD;
      the RC+S system with ECoG paddles in 5 subjects.&#xD;

      ENROLLMENT: A subject is considered enrolled upon signing informed consent and deemed&#xD;
      eligible to be screened by the investigator. The informed consent process may include&#xD;
      discussions with the patients family and referring clinician. Medical records that can be&#xD;
      obtained will be carefully reviewed to determine adequacy of past treatments including&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject identification number will be assigned to each subject that signs consent. This&#xD;
      number will be used to identify the subject and must be used on all study documentation&#xD;
      related to that subject throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING: Potential subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and willing to participate&#xD;
      in the study as demonstrated by signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and undergo 2 screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) spaced over an approximate 1 month&#xD;
      period. Diagnostic and screening ratings are completed, followed by complete medical,&#xD;
      neurological and neurosurgical evaluations. Final selection of candidates will be made by&#xD;
      consensus of the multi-disciplinary investigator team (Project Advisory Committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Core for Advanced MR Imaging (CAMRI) is a state-of-the-art resource housing 3 cutting&#xD;
      edge MRI systems for the Houston research community, located at BCM Main Campus. CAMRI will&#xD;
      perform the research 3T MRI scans, which will be collected on all subjects (DBS and control)&#xD;
      using the Prisma scanner for consistency. All subjects will be escorted to CAMRI by the study&#xD;
      team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBS implanted subjects will undergo two 3T MRI Scans prior to surgery (1 research MRI at&#xD;
      CAMRI and 1 clinical MRI at Baylor St. Luke's Medical center (BSLMC). DBS implanted subjects&#xD;
      will under 4 Magnetoencephalography (MEG) scans total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will undergo one 3T MRI scan (research MRI scan at CAMRI). Control subjects&#xD;
      will also undergo 4 MEG scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT: Subjects eligible for DBS implantation will also have an additional clinical,&#xD;
      pre-surgical 3T MRI scan performed at baseline. This scan will be performed on a Philips&#xD;
      scanner at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC). This scan is necessary in order to&#xD;
      potentially screen out individuals presenting with brain abnormalities which would not be&#xD;
      compatible with the surgery (e.g., congenital defects, lack of normal anatomic correlates)&#xD;
      and to assist with surgical planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Subjects (DBS and control) will also undergo MEG scans. This is also needed as a baseline&#xD;
      assessment as MEG scans will also be performed post implantation at 2 weeks, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months on a MEG scanner at the Texas Childrens Hospital in the Houston Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray and EKG will also be performed on OCD subjects eligible for DBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age/gender matched non-implanted subjects will serve as controls. They will undergo&#xD;
      1-research 3T MRI and 4 MEG scans using the same imaging protocol and at the same time points&#xD;
      as OCD implant subjects to control for non-DBS effects on rs-fc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unless collected prior to the day of surgery, a head CT will be performed on the morning&#xD;
           of surgery for stereotactic planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Employing local anesthetic (with or without sedation as clinically indicated), a&#xD;
           stereotactic headframe (Leksell Model G, Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA, USA) will be&#xD;
           attached to the subjects skull on the morning of surgery in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A 3D volumetric image (O-Arm 2, Medtronic Inc, Boulder, CO, USA) will be performed for&#xD;
           purposes of defining the volumetric stereotactic headspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The images will be uploaded onto a Computer Workstation (Stealth S7, Medtronic, Inc.,&#xD;
           Boulder, CO, USA) equipped with stereotactic planning software (Cranial 3.0) for the&#xD;
           purpose of planning the surgery. The preoperative 3T MRI obtained prior to the surgical&#xD;
           date, will be fused with the CT scan in the surgical planning station. The initial&#xD;
           target point within the ventral striatum will be chosen based on the subjects specific&#xD;
           anatomy. The surgical trajectory to this point will also be planned in order to avoid&#xD;
           prominent vessels, the sulci, and the ventricles. The computer will generate the X, Y&#xD;
           and Z coordinates to set on the frame as well as the coronal and sagittal angles of&#xD;
           approach required to establish the desired trajectory and target point. This initial&#xD;
           target point will be modified by the subjects specific anatomy as determined by the&#xD;
           preoperative 3T scans. The final target coordinates will be determined during this&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. While the surgeon is planning the procedure, the subject will be positioned supine on&#xD;
           the operating table. A Foley catheter will be inserted. Antibiotics will be administered&#xD;
           intravenously and vital signs will be monitored. The stereotactic head frame will be&#xD;
           fixed to the operating table for subject safety, with the head elevated for subject&#xD;
           comfort. A sterile prep and drape will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The target coordinates will be set on the stereotactic frame bringing the target point&#xD;
           to the center of the operating arc. Additional local anesthetic will be given at the&#xD;
           point of incision. Following incision, a 14 mm burr hole will be made employing a&#xD;
           self-stopping perforator. The burr hole cap provided with the DBS lead will be secured&#xD;
           to the skull with two screws. The dura will be coagulated and incised. The pial surface&#xD;
           will be gently coagulated and a small incision will be made to allow easy entry of the&#xD;
           electrode guides, which will be inserted to the brain according to standard stereotactic&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Once the above adjustments have been made, the DBS quadripolar electrode (model 3387;&#xD;
           Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) will be inserted through the guide tube to the&#xD;
           target point. Reticles will be attached to the frame and intraoperative imaging will be&#xD;
           employed to confirm that the lead tip is positioned at the target and assess for the&#xD;
           presence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Sedation will be withdrawn. An extension cable&#xD;
           will be connected to the lead sterilely and the other end will be passed off the field&#xD;
           to be connected to an external pulse generator so that test stimulation may be&#xD;
           performed. Test stimulation will be performed via each contact to 1) assess for&#xD;
           stimulation-induced side effects and 2) monitor for acute changes in behavior using a&#xD;
           Likert-type scale to assess anxiety, arousal, and mood. Intra operative behavioral&#xD;
           testing of stimulation will be videotaped.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Phase II addition of ECoG. In order to achieve optimal coverage of the orbitofrontal&#xD;
           cortex (OFC) region, the investigators will place a subdural cortical strip electrode&#xD;
           over this region of cortex. There is well-established precedent for using strip&#xD;
           electrodes over the OFC cortical surface, both in sub-acute (&lt;1 month) and chronic&#xD;
           (years/permanent) clinical settings. OFC strip electrodes have been commonly placed via&#xD;
           a burr hole in the inferior frontal region for epilepsy monitoring. The electrodes used&#xD;
           in these applications are usually 4 to 8 contacts, spaced 1 cm apart. These are&#xD;
           typically sub-acute placements lasting days to weeks, and this practice has been common&#xD;
           across the U.S. and world for decades. Strip electrodes covering OFC have also been used&#xD;
           as permanent implants in the responsive neurostimulation (RNS) system, which is FDA&#xD;
           approved and clinical standard of care for the treatment of medically refractory&#xD;
           epilepsy. The strip electrodes used in this case are 4 contacts spaced 1 cm apart. In&#xD;
           communications with the RNS device manufacturer, the investigators estimate that 100s of&#xD;
           such electrodes have been placed in patients in this country. Our placement procedure&#xD;
           will be very similar to that used for RNS OFC strip electrodes. The investigators will&#xD;
           use the 09130 Subdural Quadripolar Paddle Lead, which is also 4 contacts spaced 1 cm&#xD;
           apart. The investigators will create a burr hole in the inferior frontal region. The&#xD;
           investigators will use standard frameless navigation to choose a location of the burr&#xD;
           hole that facilitates a direct line of sight along the horizontal floor of the anterior&#xD;
           cranial fossa within which lies the OFC region. The investigators will make a&#xD;
           cosmetically acceptable incision approximately the same size as that used for the&#xD;
           traditional DBS lead. The investigators will use monopolar cautery to deepen the&#xD;
           incision past the temporalis muscle and create a standard size burr hole. The&#xD;
           investigators will open the dura and visualize the inferior frontal lobe and floor of&#xD;
           the anterior cranial fossa. Under direct vision, the investigators will place the strip&#xD;
           electrode using irrigation to permit smooth placement, paying careful attention not to&#xD;
           damage cortical vasculature. Bridging veins between dura and cortex are extremely rare&#xD;
           in this region, thus increasing the safety profile of the procedure. Once the electrode&#xD;
           is in place, the investigators will suture its tail to the dura in the burr hole to&#xD;
           provide an anchor point. The investigators will then use a small metal plate to affix&#xD;
           the electrode tail to the outer aspect of the skull near the burr hole to further anchor&#xD;
           the electrode. The investigators will use a small length of plastic tubing available in&#xD;
           the electrode kit as a shock absorber around the electrode tail at this fixation point&#xD;
           to avoid chronic mechanical damage to the electrode tail from contact with the plate.&#xD;
           The investigators place fibrin glue within the burr hole to prevent leak of&#xD;
           cerebrospinal fluid. The investigators will close the muscle with dissolvable sutures,&#xD;
           tunnel the tail to the DBS lead burr hole, and close the incision in standard fashion.&#xD;
           From the site of the DBS lead burr hole, the two electrode tails (one for the DBS lead&#xD;
           and the other for the OFC strip electrode) will be tunneled towards the ipsilateral IPG&#xD;
           site in standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Intra-operative X-ray imaging may be performed as needed (up to 4 times per side) to&#xD;
           ensure proper target has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. A post-implantation 3D volumetric scan will be performed to confirm the electrode&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Steps 5-9 above will be performed to insert the second DBS lead and ECoG paddle in the&#xD;
           other hemisphere to complete implantation of all electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. If there are no untenable side effects, the leads will be secured to the skull with the&#xD;
           burr hole caps. The free end of the leads will be left in the sub-galeal space and the&#xD;
           incisions will be closed in anatomical layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The headframe will be removed and general anesthesia will be induced. Two Olympus RC+S&#xD;
           pulse generators will then be implanted in the subclavicular region and connected to the&#xD;
           deep brain and cortical leads via extension cables (two IPGs, each driving one cortical&#xD;
           and one subcortical lead).&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. A post-operative CT scan will be performed prior to discharge to ensure that an&#xD;
           intracerebral hemorrhage has not occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. The subject will be taken to the Recovery Room or the Neurosurgery ICU for post-&#xD;
           operative monitoring (See below) and will be discharged from the hospital after at least&#xD;
           one night of observation and when clinically stable. A Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP) may&#xD;
           be run on the subject to confirm they are clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. The subject will return to the neurosurgery clinic (Visit 4) for post-operative&#xD;
           evaluation according to normal clinical practice (approximately 1 week after surgery).&#xD;
           The wounds will be inspected and the subjects neurological status will be assessed.&#xD;
           Sutures will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBS Programming:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a monopolar survey will be conducted with frequency set to 150 Hz and pulse width&#xD;
      to 90 microseconds. Constant current amplitude will be used and increased in a step-wise&#xD;
      fashion as tolerated and without exceeding current density upper limits. The constant current&#xD;
      setting is particularly useful in the early weeks to months following surgery when impedances&#xD;
      are still changing. In order to elicit a mirth response, amplitude needs to return to 0&#xD;
      microamps for about 30 seconds before testing the next increment. For example, if 2mA, C+1,&#xD;
      90usec, 150Hz is ineffective, then amplitude is reduced to 0mA for 30 seconds and then&#xD;
      rapidly increased to 4mA, C+1-, 90usec, 150Hz. Soft start needs to be turned off. Bipolar&#xD;
      settings will also be tested and need to be used during rsfMRI. DBS parameters will be&#xD;
      optimized/adjusted based on clinical evaluation of mood and anxiety and to minimize side&#xD;
      effects. The following observed effects will be recorded via a scale used in a past study:&#xD;
      facial expression, nervousness, alertness, and positive or negative affect. Facial expression&#xD;
      will be measured using the AFAR system. AFAR will measure the maximum intensity and velocity&#xD;
      of the smile response in action units. Participants faces will be recorded on video as their&#xD;
      stimulation is increased to elicit the mirth response. Changes in facial expression using&#xD;
      facial muscles of orbicularis oris (muscle that encircles the mouth) zygomaticus (major and&#xD;
      minor muscles of the angle of the mouth) will be recorded. This information will be used to&#xD;
      train a classifier to recognize that stimulation intensity is too great. The investigators&#xD;
      will also have the subject self-report on changes in mood, anxiety, energy and side effects.&#xD;

The programmer (not the PI in this case) will be open to the design and perform &quot;sham&quot; activation as described previously. Relapse is defined as a 25% increase of the Y-BOCS over two consecutive visits compared to discontinuation baseline</description>

    <description>The subject and Independent Evaluators are blinded to timing of discontinuation. In all cases, the sequence will be as follows in one-week segments: 100% Active, 50% Active, Sham and Sham. Subjects will be seen weekly. Amplitude will be reduced by 50% at start of week 2 and turned off at start of week 3. Subjects will be told that DBS will be discontinued at some point during the 4 weeks. The purpose of the 50% initial reduction is to minimize rebound effects. The programmer (not the PI in this case) will be open to the design and perform &quot;sham&quot; activation as described previously. Relapse is defined as a 25% increase of the Y-BOCS over two consecutive visits compared to discontinuation baseline.</description>
