    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cross-sectional study to describe patients' perceptions and experience&#xD;
      regarding same day discharge following pelvic reconstructive surgery including total vaginal&#xD;
      hysterectomy, in order to improve future patient counseling and expectations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to COVID-19, the urogynecology department at TriHealth has recently transitioned&#xD;
      to a same day discharge (SDD) model for our major pelvic reconstruction surgeries with total&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy. Traditionally, these patients were admitted for overnight observation&#xD;
      and discharged to home on postoperative day one. SDD after major pelvic reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery is new in our department, but multiple studies have shown that SDD after hysterectomy&#xD;
      is safe, cost effective, and well received by patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While patients have been accepting of SDD, they often have questions in the preoperative&#xD;
      period about what to expect once they are discharged home. Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      patients appreciate advice and recommendations from others who have previously had the same&#xD;
      surgery; often reporting improved outcomes and satisfaction. Direct advice and narrative&#xD;
      stories from other patients can provide a &quot;more personal&quot; experience of the day-to-day coping&#xD;
      postoperatively that the physician cannot necessarily provide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would like to get our patients' perspective on what happened immediately after surgery, in&#xD;
      the hospital and at home. By expanding our awareness as providers of what challenges patients&#xD;
      face upon discharge, we will be better able to counsel patients in the preoperative period,&#xD;
      improve patient satisfaction with surgery and SDD, and help develop strategies to mitigate&#xD;
      areas of concern regarding the surgical process.&#xD;
