  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational prospective monosite study aims to describe, for the first time,&#xD;
      management in a hospital-at-home programme of patients treated by immunotherapy-chemotherapy&#xD;
      combo for bronchial cancer in maintenance phase of first row metastatic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility in good conditions of this management, the patients' quality of life and&#xD;
      their satisfaction will be evaluated. A cost-benefit analysis will be done to compare&#xD;
      hospital-at-home programme and classical day hospitalization.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Those last years, immunotherapy treatment for bronchial cancers allowed considerable progress&#xD;
      in terms of tumoral answer, survival without progression and global survival. Usually&#xD;
      administered in the day hospitalization department, its preparation and administration to the&#xD;
      patient are compatible with hospital-at-home management. This type of management has&#xD;
      particularly developed in the context of the COVID pandemic and recommendations for good&#xD;
      practices in hospital-at-home immunotherapy have recently been drafted by FITC (Société&#xD;
      Française d'Immuno-Thérapie du Cancer). These recommendations open the way for administration&#xD;
      of immunotherapy and chemotherapy combo in hospital-at-home. At the moment, there is no study&#xD;
      stating the feasibility of home hospitalization for patients treated by&#xD;
      immunotherapy-chemotherapy combo. To follow up on the feasibility study of home immunotherapy&#xD;
      (ImHADom) carried out at CH Pau from March 2019 to March 2021, the sponsor propose to&#xD;
      evaluate with descriptive study the feasibility under the same conditions of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-immunotherapy in patients treated in the maintenance phase of a first metastatic&#xD;
      row.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be proposed to all the patients in maintenance phase of first row treatment&#xD;
      with at least one positive tumoral imaging assessment (stable disease or partial response)&#xD;
      for whom home hospitalization has been decided and scheduled by the healthcare team in a&#xD;
      medical staff meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in the study will be followed according to the common practice: a&#xD;
      consultation every 3 months during 1 year.&#xD;
