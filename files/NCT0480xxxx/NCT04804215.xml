  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplant surgery has been used as a major treatment modality for end-stage liver&#xD;
      disease, hepatocellular carcinoma and acute liver failure due to innovations in surgical&#xD;
      treatment of donors and recipients over the past decade. However, despite these advances,&#xD;
      biliary tract complications are considered the technical &quot;Achilles tendon&quot; of liver&#xD;
      transplantation because of their high incidence, long-term interventions and potential risk&#xD;
      of transplant failure. The incidence of biliary tract complications after liver&#xD;
      transplantation is still a high incidence, with a prevalence of 10-50% despite increasing&#xD;
      technology and experience worldwide. Biliary tract complications are typically biliary tract&#xD;
      leakage and biliary stricture, which are the cause of post-transplant morbidity and&#xD;
      transplant loss. Most of the bile leakage occurs within 3 months after surgery, and the&#xD;
      incidence of these early complications reaches 10-20%. Biliary stricture is a late&#xD;
      complication that usually occurs within 5-8 months and can occur up to 1 year. The incidence&#xD;
      of biliary stricture currently reported is still occurring in 5-30% of large clinical&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of external T-tubes to reduce biliary tract complications has been discussed for many&#xD;
      years, and many published studies show no difference in biliary tract complications&#xD;
      regardless of the use of T-tubes, as well as T-tube-related cholangitis and tube removal.&#xD;
      Showed a relationship with certain morbidity rates, such as bile leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insertion of a stent into the bile duct has the advantage of preventing biliary complications&#xD;
      while avoiding the side effects associated with the use of external T-tubes. We presented a&#xD;
      preliminary study of 100 patients and confirmed that intrabiliary stents reduced biliary&#xD;
      tract complications, and not using an intrabiliary stent was an independent risk factor for&#xD;
      biliary stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in this study, the purpose of this study was to determine the effective and&#xD;
      rational use of intrabiliary stents through a randomized clinical trial according to the use&#xD;
      of intrabiliary stents during biliary reconstruction in patients with liver transplant&#xD;
      surgery. In addition, it is expected that clinical usefulness has not been announced until&#xD;
      now in Korea, since a double-blind prospective randomized controlled clinical trial was&#xD;
      conducted according to the presence or absence of an intrabiliary stent during biliary&#xD;
      reconstruction in liver transplantation.&#xD;

      Aim of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary end-point To compare and evaluate the incidence of biliary tract complications&#xD;
           within 6 months after surgery according to the presence or absence of an intrabiliary&#xD;
           stent during biliary reconstruction in liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second end-point Postoperative complications related to intrabiliary stent (cholangitis,&#xD;
           acute pancreatitis, intestinal perforation, bleeding, etc.), liver transplantation and&#xD;
           6-month survival rate, hospitalization period, re-hospitalization, non-biliary&#xD;
           complications, and liver through comparative analysis The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
           check the clinical effectiveness of the use of an intrabiliary stent during&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection criteria, exclusion criteria, number of target subjects and their rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Selection criteria ① 19 years old or older ~ under 70 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients eligible for liver transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Patients who have consented to written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  When performing hepato-plant anastomosis due to anatomical/biliary tract disease ②&#xD;
                Patients who are not eligible for liver transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Target number of people and basis for calculation Since this study was compared with the&#xD;
           control group, the number of subjects was calculated using a non-inferiority test. To&#xD;
           calculate the number of study subjects, in the existing literature, the incidence of&#xD;
           surgical site infection was 1.33% in the group with antibiotics and 3.36% in the group&#xD;
           without antibiotics. The difference between the ratio between the two groups is 2.02%&#xD;
           larger in the test group than in the control group, and as a result of calculating the&#xD;
           study subjects by assuming the upper limit of the confidence interval between the two&#xD;
           groups as the non-inferiority margin of 5.4%, 72 subjects per each group were required,&#xD;
           10%. When calculating the dropout rate, 80 subjects per group, a total of 160 subjects,&#xD;
           are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical trial design This clinical trial is an exploratory clinical trial evaluating&#xD;
           the safety and effectiveness of the use of intrabiliary stents during surgery in liver&#xD;
           disease requiring transplantation. A screening test is performed on subjects who&#xD;
           voluntarily agreed to participate in the trial in writing. On the day of surgery, after&#xD;
           determining whether the selection/exclusion criteria are met, appropriate subjects are&#xD;
           randomly assigned to the test group and the control group at a 1:1 ratio. In the control&#xD;
           group, during bile duct anastomosis, a stent is not inserted into the bile duct, and the&#xD;
           test group is inserted into the bile duct.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On the OP day and on the discharge day, adverse reaction investigations, laboratory&#xD;
           tests, and physical tests are conducted for safety and efficacy evaluation to evaluate&#xD;
           postoperative pain and hospital stay. At one week after discharge from the hospital,&#xD;
           adverse reactions, laboratory tests, and physical examinations are performed through an&#xD;
           outpatient visit to evaluate the occurrence of postoperative complications related to&#xD;
           infection, complications other than infection, and the need for additional procedures.&#xD;
           In addition, the degree of postoperative pain, re-hospitalization, complications other&#xD;
           than infection, and the need for additional procedures are evaluated and compared when&#xD;
           visiting the emergency room due to the occurrence of postoperative infection-related&#xD;
           complications within one month after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target registration and randomization method Subjects who agreed to voluntarily&#xD;
           participate in the trial after hearing the explanation about this clinical trial will be&#xD;
           given a subject identification code in the order in which they signed the consent form&#xD;
           at the screening visit.In this clinical trial, the comparability of the treatment group&#xD;
           is maximized and the treatment group's Randomization is performed to ensure the&#xD;
           scientific validity of the clinical trial by not involving the subjectivity of the&#xD;
           investigator in the assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Block randomization is performed to divide the patients who satisfy the&#xD;
           selection/exclusion criteria and agree to participate in the clinical trial into 2&#xD;
           groups and allocate them at a 1:1 ratio. For randomization, a statistical expert&#xD;
           independent from this clinical trial generates a random assignment number using SAS&#xD;
           ver.9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, NC, Cary, USA) or higher for Microsoft Windows and assigns&#xD;
           it sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operation and storage of random allocation In this clinical trial, randomization is&#xD;
           operated by a third party, and the investigator receives subject consent from the&#xD;
           subject during the screening period, and records necessary matters and test findings to&#xD;
           determine the subject selection/exclusion criteria. At this time, the subjects will be&#xD;
           given screening numbers in order.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, whether or not to participate in the clinical trial is determined by checking&#xD;
           the suitability of the subject's clinical trial. Subjects who are determined to&#xD;
           participate in the clinical trial are enrolled in the clinical trial and assigned a&#xD;
           randomization number through a randomization envelope according to the randomization&#xD;
           method to the test group or control group on the day of surgery, and based on the&#xD;
           randomization table operated by the investigator (surgeon). Groups are allocated&#xD;
           according to the subject assignment number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blind and unblind This clinical trial is a single-blind clinical trial. It should not be&#xD;
           known to which group the subjects are assigned according to the assignment number, and&#xD;
           the randomization table is kept by a third party, and the assigned envelope is managed&#xD;
           in a separate place. During the clinical trial period, if blindfolding is required&#xD;
           before the completion of the clinical trial due to a serious adverse reaction, the&#xD;
           research manager contacts the randomization staff to review and approve the reason for&#xD;
           the blindfolding, and then proceed with the blindfolding procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for end of study and early termination&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Criteria for cancellation and dropout In the case of the following occurrences, the&#xD;
           clinical trial may be canceled or eliminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ① When the subject requests to stop the test&#xD;
&#xD;
           ② When the investigator judges that it is difficult to continue the clinical trial due&#xD;
           to a serious adverse reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
           ③ In case of violation of selection/exclusion criteria or serious violation of clinical&#xD;
           trial plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           ④ If the subject's follow-up observation is unsuccessful&#xD;
&#xD;
           ⑤ When other testers decide that the test should be stopped&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment at the time of cancellation and dropout If a subject is discontinued or&#xD;
           eliminated from the clinical trial, the investigator shall record the date of&#xD;
           discontinuation and dropout, the reason for the discontinuation and dropout, and the&#xD;
           treatment and progress at the time of discontinuation and dropout, along with all data&#xD;
           acquired until the time of discontinuation and dropout. Subjects with early&#xD;
           discontinuation in the clinical trial for any reason are not replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical trial intervention plan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Test group: stent insertion into the bile duct. (silastic stent)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control: No stent insertion into the bile duct. Only subjects who have consented to&#xD;
                participate in the clinical trial and have been randomly assigned to meet the&#xD;
                criteria for selection/exclusion will perform the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Observation and inspection items&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Written consent and demographic survey, physical measurements, vital signs Before&#xD;
                entering the clinical trial, the investigator explains in detail the purpose and&#xD;
                contents of this clinical trial to the subject and obtains written consent. After&#xD;
                written consent, demographic information is investigated in the case record, and&#xD;
                the date of written consent, subject's initials, gender, date of birth, etc. are&#xD;
                recorded, and physical measurements (height, weight, BMI) and vital signs (systolic&#xD;
                blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, body temperature) Also measure and&#xD;
                record. After each visit, physical measurements (weight, BMI) and vital signs&#xD;
                (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and body temperature)&#xD;
                are also measured and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Investigation of medical history and drug administration history At the&#xD;
                     screening visit, the interview and past medical records are reviewed, and the&#xD;
                     subject's entire life history is investigated and recorded based on the&#xD;
                     screening visit. In addition, after investigating and recording all drugs&#xD;
                     taken from 30 days prior to the screening visit, and checking whether there is&#xD;
                     a change in the condition of administration of the combination drug that was&#xD;
                     investigated during the screening test at each visit thereafter, and whether&#xD;
                     there is a new combination drug, Record it on the case record.&#xD;
&#xD;
                       -  Physical and laboratory tests Physical and laboratory tests (blood and&#xD;
                          urine tests) are performed through screening visits and interviews at&#xD;
                          that visit, and the test results and normality are recorded in the case&#xD;
                          report.&#xD;
&#xD;
                          ④ ASA class According to the physical condition classification system&#xD;
                          established by the American Society of Anesthesiology, an evaluation is&#xD;

&#xD;
                          • Operation time from abdominal incision to skin suture&#xD;
&#xD;
                          • Surgery time required for resection&#xD;
&#xD;
                            -  Bleeding and intraoperative blood transfusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
                               -Measured in cc, taking into account the amount of blood inhaled&#xD;
                               during surgery and the weight of tape and gauze.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                 -  The amount of red blood cells and whole blood administered&#xD;
                                    during surgery is measured in cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
                            -  After surgery, the investigator evaluates the patient's recovery&#xD;
                               status (when the gas is released) once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
                            -  Evaluation items for patient recovery status: Record the progression&#xD;
                               of meals once a day every day, and if discharge is not made, the&#xD;
                               record of the progression of meals and postoperative complications&#xD;
                               on the discharge date is finally evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
                                 -  Investigation of complications related to infection&#xD;
                                    Infection-related complications are divided into surgical site&#xD;
                                    infection and wound infection, and other complications are&#xD;
                                    investigated as non-infection-related complications. Symptoms&#xD;
                                    such as fever are not collected as complications, but the cause&#xD;
                                    is investigated and classified as complications. In addition,&#xD;
                                    if additional procedures are needed due to the occurrence of&#xD;
                                    related complications, the information should be collected.&#xD;
