    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of stereotactic body proton radiotherapy in treating&#xD;
      patients with liver cancer. Proton radiotherapy is a type of treatment that uses high-energy&#xD;
      beams to treat tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 3-month rate of patients experiencing an increase in Child-Pugh (CP)&#xD;
      score by 2 or more points of 5-fraction stereotactic body proton radiotherapy (SBPT) in the&#xD;
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the 3-month complication rate as defined by grade 3 or higher acute adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess late toxicity with 2 year follow-up. III. To estimate the 6-month local&#xD;
      control, liver disease control, progression free survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine objective imaging response rates at 6 months by Modified (m) Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) and RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine the value of volumetric imaging analysis compared to mRECIST and RECIST in&#xD;
      the setting of HCC treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate patient-reported outcomes. II. To evaluate clinical features, treatment&#xD;
      technique, and dose-volume parameters associated with better local control and fewer adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the value of additional imaging analyses and techniques for assessing tumor&#xD;
      response after treatment with SBRT IV. To blood bank patient specimens for future analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo 1 SBPT fraction over 20-30 minutes per day for a total of 5 fractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks, 3 , 6, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months, then annually for 3 years.&#xD;
