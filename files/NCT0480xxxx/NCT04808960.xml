    <textblock>
      Back pain is the most common cause of disability with a substantial burden on affected&#xD;
      individuals, their families and society. Unfortunately, the causes of back pain are not well&#xD;
      understood, hindering the development of effective prevention and treatment approaches. Until&#xD;
      recently, the thin interface structure (endplate) between the vertebrae and the&#xD;
      intervertebral disc has attracted attention as a possible contributor to back pain problems.&#xD;
      However, the absence of clear descriptions for endplate defects has clouded associations with&#xD;
      back pain and other imaging findings, which is problematic for measurement reliability. Thus,&#xD;
      with CT, as with MRI, the varied measurement methods used to document the appearance of&#xD;
      endplate defects on clinical imaging in the scientific literature, and the absence of&#xD;
      validation of measurements of such methods leaves uncertainty about what the observations on&#xD;
      clinical imaging actually represent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Clinical CT is one of the most common imaging modalities used for the spine. On&#xD;
      the other hand, Micro-CT, which produces accurate and reproducible measurements, has been&#xD;
      used as a reference standard. The planned study will provide information that is critical for&#xD;
      establishing meaningful standards for the evaluation and interpretation of endplate defects&#xD;
      on clinical imaging, as well as for studies of their etiology and clinical consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study comprises 19 spines from 9 male and 10 female cadavers aged between 62 to 91 years&#xD;
      from Western. Clinical-CT scans acquired on the cadavers will be assessed independently by&#xD;
      two experienced imaging scientists (radiologists) and a graduate student studying endplate&#xD;
      defects. A master's student in Clinical Anatomy has assessed and documented endplate defects&#xD;
      on micro-CT, the reference standard. For the purpose of training and to identify practical&#xD;
      issues in the evaluation process; four joint training sessions were organized for the raters&#xD;
      to evaluate training sets of clinical CT images and discuss practical issues, using an&#xD;
      evaluation manual consisting of measurement descriptions and figures. All the raters&#xD;
      indicated satisfaction with the understanding and ability to use each measurement method.&#xD;
      Thereafter, the three raters will independently assess the clinical CT for endplate defect&#xD;
      presence, types, size and location. Endplate defects will be assessed with two weeks between&#xD;
      measurements. Data will be imported into a secured computer for analysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Back pain is a common health problem and a substantial burden on affected&#xD;
      individuals, their families and society. In fact, it is the single leading cause of&#xD;
      disability worldwide. Unfortunately, the pathological mechanisms behind back pain are not&#xD;
      well understood, hindering the development of well-targeted, effective prevention and&#xD;
      treatment approaches. The anatomical structures referred to as the functional spinal units,&#xD;
      each composed of an intervertebral disc, its two adjacent vertebrae, and other associated&#xD;
      osteoligamentous structures, have been studied for several decades with limited success in&#xD;
      identifying the source of the pain. The intervertebral disc has received the most attention,&#xD;
      and while disc degeneration or pathology is associated with the clinical conditions of disc&#xD;
      herniation and radiculopathy, as well as spinal stenosis, the role of the disc in common back&#xD;
      pain is uncertain. More recently, the vertebral endplate has attracted attention as a&#xD;
      possible contributor to back pain problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vertebral endplate is a thin interface structure between the intervertebral disc and the&#xD;
      cancellous bone of the adjacent vertebral body. Unlike the disc, the bony vertebral endplate&#xD;
      is highly vascularized and has a plentiful neural supply, and structural defects or lesions&#xD;
      in the endplate are relatively common in cadaveric samples and on clinical imaging. However,&#xD;
      there is a wide range of prevalence rates from 9% to 75% for structural endplate defects&#xD;
      across studies and conflicting findings on the association of structural endplate defects&#xD;
      with back pain. Also, there is a lack of consistency in the use of terms and definitions for&#xD;
      endplate defects, which limits the ability to effectively communicate findings, interpret and&#xD;
      compare study results, and build a coherent body of knowledge on the causes and consequences&#xD;
      of endplate defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the absence of clear definitions or descriptions for endplate defects&#xD;
      represented by various terms is problematic for measurement reliability, which is seldom&#xD;
      reported in studies of endplate defects. A morphologic description has been found to be more&#xD;
      important in establishing the reliability of a standardized MRI nomenclature than the&#xD;
      experience of the reader. However, a recent review identified few measurement methods with&#xD;
      detailed classification and definition of structural endplate phenotypes. Among them were&#xD;
      methods presented by Feng's and Brayda-Bruno's team. Both measurement methods stem from a&#xD;
      previous study on endplate defect phenotypes observed in a cadaveric sample. Good to&#xD;
      excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability was reported for each classification system in a&#xD;
      single MRI study, but neither has been validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical CT is one of the most common imaging modalities used for the spine and its use is&#xD;
      expected to increase with advancements in clinical CT technology, such as the low tube&#xD;
      potential and iterative reconstruction that decreases scan time and radiation dose while&#xD;
      optimizing image quality. Yet, with CT, as with MRI, the varied measurement methods used to&#xD;
      document the appearance of endplate defects on clinical imaging in the scientific literature,&#xD;
      and the absence of validation of such methods leaves uncertainty about what the observations&#xD;
      on imaging actually represent. It is also unclear how sensitive clinical imaging is in&#xD;
      picking up different types and sizes of defects (e.g. diagnostic accuracy). Micro-CT has been&#xD;
      used as a reference standard in human studies and for the characterization of morphological&#xD;
      features of endplate defects in cadaveric samples. Micro-CT measurement is accurate,&#xD;
      consistent and reproducible, and has the advantage of providing shape and texture information&#xD;
      for an object within a single measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will address the reliability and diagnostic test validity of structural endplate&#xD;
      defect assessments of clinical CT. Such information is critical for establishing meaningful&#xD;
      standards for the evaluation and interpretation of endplate defects on imaging, as well as&#xD;
      for studies of their etiology and clinical consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OBJECTIVES This study seeks to evaluate and compare the reliability and validity of two&#xD;
      methods to identify and characterize structural endplate defects on clinical imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the inter-rater reliability of endplate defect determinations on clinical CT&#xD;
           scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the diagnostic accuracy of assessments of clinical CT-scans for identifying&#xD;
           endplate defects, using micro-CT as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS &amp; METHODS This is a reliability and validity study of vertebral endplate defects on&#xD;
      clinical CT (index test) using micro-CT as the reference standard in 19 human cadavers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials Source: This study comprises cadavers of 9 men and 10 women with a median age of 82&#xD;
      years (range 62-91) from the Anatomy lab and Western University's whole-body donation program&#xD;
      maintained by the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Schulich School of Medicine and&#xD;
      Dentistry. We will use a sample of 19 harvested T7-S1 spines from embalmed (fixed) cadavers.&#xD;
      Embalming consisted of arterial distribution of embalming fluid, containing a mixture of&#xD;
      ethanol, phenol, and formalin (Wessel &amp; Associates: Troy, MI, USA), 24- to 48- hours&#xD;
      post-mortem).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor information: Only the anonymized cadaver ID number, cause of death, age, and sex of the&#xD;
      donor were available from Western's donation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spine imaging Clinical CT was acquired (scanned at 1.25mm x 1.25mm on a standard algorithm&#xD;
      and then reformatted into an axial, coronal and sagittal series at 3mm x 2mm) on all fully&#xD;
      intact cadavers prior to the onset of this study by the Schulich School of Medicine &amp;&#xD;
      Dentistry at the University of Western Ontario, in accordance with the Anatomy Act of Ontario&#xD;
      and guidelines of Western's Committee for Cadaveric Use in Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Micro-CT (µCT) of all cadaveric specimens was performed at Robarts Research Institute at a&#xD;
      peak voltage of 80 kVp and a tube current of 50 mA. The X-ray projections were reconstructed&#xD;
      into a single three-dimensional volume with isotropic voxel spacing of 154 µm. In preparation&#xD;
      for µCT the lower thoracic and lumbar spine (T7 through S1) was removed from each cadaver.&#xD;
      The ribs were dissected 1-2 cm lateral to the costovertebral joints and the soft tissue&#xD;
      associated with the spine was preserved and remained intact during micro-CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of endplate defects Assessment of clinical CT scans: Three raters will&#xD;
      independently assess the sagittal images of the clinical CT for endplate defect presence,&#xD;
      phenotype classification, and defect size and location, blinded to all prior assessments.&#xD;
      Endplate defect measurement methods by Brayda-Bruno's and Feng's teams will be strictly used.&#xD;
      First, measurement according to Brayda-Bruno will be used to assess the 19 clinical CTs of&#xD;
      the spines. Two weeks after the Brayda-Bruno assessment, evaluations according to Feng will&#xD;
      be performed on sagittal images to determine the type and location of the defects, as well as&#xD;
      to measure the anteroposterior and transverse diameter of the defects and endplates. Across&#xD;
      all measurements, endplates will be labelled with reference to the disc. All endplate defect&#xD;
      measurements will be observed from the immediate normal slice before the defect to the first&#xD;
      normal slice after the defect. Feng's initial measurement protocol used only sagittal MR&#xD;
      images to estimate the transverse diameter by dividing the number of images with endplate&#xD;
      defects by the total number of sagittal images containing the endplate. However, due to the&#xD;
      large number of sagittal images in CT compared to MRI, the current study will use the&#xD;
      transitional distance covered by the defects in relation to the image to determine the&#xD;
      transverse diameter. Artefact including osteophytes will be excluded when taking an endplate&#xD;
      measurement. Each rater will assess the images in the same order (Brayda-Bruno's followed by&#xD;
      Feng's measurements). All measurements will be taken in millimetres rounded up to the nearest&#xD;
      decimal point. All assessments will be entered into a pilot-tested excel data entry form.&#xD;
      After all assessments, a panellist with the three raters will discuss each rating for a&#xD;
      consensus on the single index test that will be compared to the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Raters, training, and Consensus The clinical-CT scans will be assessed independently by two&#xD;
      radiologists with experience in musculoskeletal imaging and a physical therapist, a Ph.D.&#xD;
      student studying endplate defects. A master's student in Clinical Anatomy has assessed and&#xD;
      documented endplate defects on micro-CT, the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure a consistent understanding of the nomenclature in each classification system, an&#xD;
      evaluation manual consisting of measurement descriptions and figures was prepared based on&#xD;
      the published articles introducing each of the classification systems. For the purpose of&#xD;
      training and to identify practical issues in the evaluation process; four joint training&#xD;
      sessions were organized for the raters to evaluate training sets of clinical CT images and&#xD;
      discuss practical issues. Each rater independently rated three clinical CT images (66&#xD;
      endplates). Results were collected and analyzed, conflicting domains were noted, discussed&#xD;
      and clarified during meetings. All the raters indicated satisfaction with the understanding&#xD;
      and ability to use each measurement method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Data will be imported into Stata/IC 14 (Stata Corp LP) for statistical&#xD;
      analysis. Inter-rater reliability among the three raters (objective 1) of the clinical CT&#xD;
      measurements will be determined using Cohen's kappa statistic for categorical variables&#xD;
      (presence or absence of defect and the type of the defect) or Intraclass Correlation&#xD;
      Coefficients (ICC) for continuous variables (e.g., anteroposterior and transverse&#xD;
      diameters.). ICC and Kappa values will be interpreted as poor (&lt; 0.40), fair (0.41-0.60),&#xD;
      good (0.61-0.80), and excellent (0.81-1.0). Discrepancies will then be reviewed and resolved&#xD;
      through consensus. For objective 2, for each endplate level, a 2x2 table will be used to&#xD;
      calculate percent agreement in detecting endplate defects between the clinical CT and&#xD;
      micro-CT.&#xD;
