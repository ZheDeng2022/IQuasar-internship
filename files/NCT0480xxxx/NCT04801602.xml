    <textblock>
      Typhoid fever (typhoid) is an enteric bacterial infection caused by Salmonella enterica&#xD;
      serovar Typhi (Salmonella Typhi; S. Typhi). It is one of the most common bacterial causes of&#xD;
      acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases&#xD;
      worldwide and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Like many febrile illnesses, typhoid presents&#xD;
      with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially in its early stages. In routine healthcare&#xD;
      settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), typhoid fever is commonly suspected and&#xD;
      treated empirically with antibiotics. This overuse of antibiotics creates a selective&#xD;
      pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that has resulted in the&#xD;
      emergence and spread of typhoid strains that are resistant to all first-line antibiotics.&#xD;
      Similarly, the low specificity of current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can lead to an over&#xD;
      diagnosis of typhoid fever that may result in the overuse of antibiotics and delay the proper&#xD;
      treatment for underlying conditions. FIND in collaboration with international typhoid experts&#xD;
      developed a target product profile outlining the ideal characteristics of point of care&#xD;
      tests. As part of this activity it became apparent that no quality data are available that&#xD;
      systematically compare all available commercially point of care tests against the same set of&#xD;
      reference standards used in multiple populations (e.g. Africa vs Asia). This lack of&#xD;
      benchmarking data significantly impedes health provider's ability to decide on the utility of&#xD;
      commercial tests in different settings, ultimately restricting use and access. Further the&#xD;
      lack of well characterized samples reduces the ability for targeted innovation in the typhoid&#xD;
      space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to benchmark different commercial typhoid tests against a defined&#xD;
      reference standard applied in multiple population and simultaneously develop a sample set&#xD;
      that can be used in future evaluations of emerging technologies and/or to support innovative&#xD;
      test development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typhoid is an enteric disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella Typhi; it is estimated that&#xD;
      11 to 20 million people contract typhoid each year and 128 000 to 161 000 die from the&#xD;
      disease; children under 5 are at higher risk of contracting the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typhoid endemic areas are located mainly in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa and is&#xD;
      transmitted through contaminated water and food. The disease is treatable with a specific&#xD;
      antibiotics regimen, however antimicrobial resistance has been reported in several countries,&#xD;
      particularly in Pakistan.Several vaccines have been developed but their uptake has been low,&#xD;
      partly due to limited information on the exact burden of the disease in endemic countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms of typhoid are similar to other undifferentiated febrile illnesses and typhoid&#xD;
      can be mistaken with vector borne febrile illnesses such as scrub typhus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and bone marrow cultures are considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of typhoid.&#xD;
      Those methods require specific infrastructure and skilled staff that are not always available&#xD;
      in LMICs and are not adequate for rapid patient management. In addition, although very&#xD;
      specific, blood culture sensitivity is impacted by misuse of antibiotics that lower the&#xD;
      bacterial load to undetectable levels in patients' blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a consequence, alternatives to blood culture have been used in LMIC. The Widal test is the&#xD;
      most used test despite a low performance (sensitivity range: 57-34%; specificity range:&#xD;
      43-83%;reported in several studies. Other options in typhoid diagnosis are rapid diagnostic&#xD;
      tests; among them, three tests (Typhidot, Tubex and Test-itâ„¢ Typhoid IgM) have been evaluated&#xD;
      in several studies. It has been reported a variability of tests performance in different&#xD;
      studies and according to the geographical regions. Variability in the test performance&#xD;
      reported so far in the literature has hampered WHO to recommend any of these rapid tests in&#xD;
      the EDL. FIND in collaboration with international typhoid experts developed a target product&#xD;
      profile outlining the ideal characteristics of point of care tests. As part of this activity&#xD;
      it became apparent that no quality data are available that systematically compare all&#xD;
      available commercially point of care tests against the same set of reference standards used&#xD;
      in multiple populations (e.g. Africa vs Asia). These lack of benchmarking data significantly&#xD;
      impedes health providers' ability to decide on the utility of commercial tests in different&#xD;
      settings, ultimately restricting use and access. Further the lack of well characterized&#xD;
      samples reduces the ability for targeted innovation in the typhoid space. A second gap that&#xD;
      was identified was the lack of a simple well-performing gold standard suggesting Latent class&#xD;
      modelling as a solution used for other pathogens with an imperfect gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aims to benchmark different commercial typhoid tests against a defined&#xD;
      reference standard applied in multiple population and simultaneously develop a sample set&#xD;
      that can be used in future evaluations of emerging technologies and/or to support innovative&#xD;
      test development.&#xD;
