  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open label, cross-over clinical study. A total of 18 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled to use the IDA for every peritoneal dialysis exchange for 14 days. To participate in&#xD;
      the study, the subjects must have current CKD5 and have been treated with PD for at least 3&#xD;
      months. The subjects will undergo a single peritoneal dialysis exchange procedure at the PD&#xD;
      clinic, under supervision of the medical staff and instructed about its operation. Further&#xD;
      exchanges will be performed by the subjects themselves at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes three periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First period (Observational): 14-day Observational Period. Eligible subjects who sign&#xD;
           informed consent will continue with their regular CAPD treatment while performing&#xD;
           measurement and recording of dialysate in/out time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second period (Interventional): 14-day interventional period, where subjects will&#xD;
           perform dialysis exchanges using the IDA according to the below visit schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Third period (Follow up): 14-day follow up period, during which the study staff will&#xD;
           call the subject once weekly to inquire about device-related SAEs and any changes to&#xD;
           concomitant medications.&#xD;
