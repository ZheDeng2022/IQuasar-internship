  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine if the stiffness of a commercially&#xD;
      available ankle foot orthosis (Malleo-Lok, Bio-Mechanical Composites, Des Moines IA) impacts&#xD;
      gait biomechanics and overall joint level stiffness. Previously published research suggests&#xD;
      that AFO stiffness can affect gait biomechanics and patient preference. However, previous&#xD;
      studies have focused on traditional posterior strut devices with the strut aligned in the&#xD;
      frontal plane to allow sagittal plane deflection. The Malleo-Lok is a novel, low-profile&#xD;
      carbon fiber device with two laterally positioned struts aligned in the sagittal plane. The&#xD;
      proposed study will provide insight that can be used by certified prosthetists orthotists&#xD;
      (CPOs), physical therapists, and physicians to select the device that bests meets their&#xD;
      patients' needs.&#xD;

      Healthy adult individuals will be invited to participate in this study, at the University of&#xD;
      Iowa, that involves one visit lasting 3-4 hours. The primary purpose of this work is to&#xD;
      determine the effects of Malleo-Lok stiffness on gait biomechanics and ankle joint stiffness.&#xD;
      Previous work has highlighted the effects of ankle foot orthosis stiffness on gait using&#xD;
      devices with a traditional single posterior strut opposed to the Malleo-Lok, which has two&#xD;
      laterally positioned struts. Orthosis stiffness is an important factor to consider during&#xD;
      device prescription and manufacturing. The ability to tune overall joint level stiffness by&#xD;
      determining the combined effects of biological limb stiffness and orthosis stiffness will&#xD;
      enhance precision medicine when treating individuals who require an orthosis for daily&#xD;
      activities. The secondary purpose of this research study is to determine the within session&#xD;
      repeatability of a novel approach for in-vivo AFO stiffness testing. AFO stiffness testing is&#xD;
      typically performed using mechanical testing systems without accounting for the interaction&#xD;
      of the individual and the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit to the University of Iowa campus participants will review a list of&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria to determine their eligibility for this study. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will review an informed consent document and have the chance to ask any&#xD;
      questions they may have. Study staff will thoroughly explain the informed consent document&#xD;
      and answer all questions. Upon signing the informed consent document study activities will&#xD;
      begin. Participants will complete all study activities wearing no brace and two braces of&#xD;
      differing stiffness's. Anthropometric and demographic information will be collected from each&#xD;
      participant. The investigators will also use a motion capture system to evaluate gait&#xD;
      biomechanics and ankle joint stiffness. Participants will walk at a self-selected and a&#xD;
      controlled speed to evaluate gait biomechanics, and will stand in the motion capture system&#xD;
      and bring their knee forward over the foot to evaluate ankle joint stiffness. Participants&#xD;
      will be provided visual feedback of muscle activity to minimize lower limb muscle activity&#xD;
      during ankle stiffness testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the proposed study will provide information about the effects of orthosis&#xD;
      stiffness on gait biomechanics and ankle joint stiffness. Study results will be made&#xD;
      available to clinicians to use when prescribing and fitting individuals with ankle foot&#xD;
      orthoses.&#xD;
