      ORTHOPUS develops assistive technologies to address the lack of availability of medical&#xD;
      devices in low and middle income countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the help of HI (Handicap International) Nepal, the need for upper limb prostheses was&#xD;
      identified. Indeed, according to the literature - especially Efficiency of voluntary opening&#xD;
      hand and hook prosthetic devices: 24 years of development? (JRRD, Volume 49, Number 4, 2012)&#xD;
      -, today available solutions do not fully address patients' needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Nepal, only 2 upper limb prostheses options are generally proposed to patients because of&#xD;
      supply and cost constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORTHOPUS' objective is to extend patients' autonomy with a new set of prosthetic solutions.&#xD;
      By offering low cost but high quality devices (according to CE marking requirements), another&#xD;
      of the ORTHOPUS' missions is also to address supply and cost constraints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To improve patients' capabilities, ORTHOPUS aims at extending grasping capabilities compared&#xD;
      to the usual passive aesthetic hand or voluntary opening one by proposing the following set&#xD;
      of solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an aesthetic articulated hand&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a mechanical wrist&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a work hook&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the different stated hypotheses, a clinical trial is set jointly with HI&#xD;
      Nepal. 14 patients will be enrolled in 2 cohorts (n1 = 7, n2 = 7), the first one is&#xD;
      constituted with patients usually using an aesthetic passive hand whereas the second one&#xD;
      comprise patients normally equipped with voluntary opening hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After selecting and getting the informed consent of the patients, a month to make the sockets&#xD;
      and adapt it to patients is planned. An evaluation of their quality of life will be done with&#xD;
      the WHO QOL - BREF quality of life assessment before and after the test period of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORTHOPUS' set of prosthetic solutions will be tested by them over one month. They will have&#xD;
      to fill on a daily basis a survey (OPUS) assessing their use of the prostheses. At the end of&#xD;
      the test period, different questionnaires and surveys will be filled during a last interview&#xD;
      to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed in order to extract evidence for or against the trial hypotheses. With&#xD;
      these results, a report will be written and submitted to the GATE (Global Cooperation on&#xD;
      Assistive Health Technology) community managed by WHO. This report will also feed the&#xD;
      ORTHOPUS R&amp;D with patients' feedbacks and, research findings will be shared publicly on&#xD;
      different social media in respect with patient privacy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORTHOPUS is a french private company founded in 2018 with the mission of increasing access to&#xD;
      assistive technology like prosthetics care. ORTHOPUS focuses its actions on low and middle&#xD;
      income countries with a model that mixes social impact (open source, frugal innovation, fair&#xD;
      pricing) and medical european quality (CE marking).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, over 1 billion people need at least one form of Assistive Technology (AT), but over&#xD;
      900 million people (90%) do not have access to the AT they require.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of people who need AT is expected to grow to more than 2 billion people by 2050&#xD;
      according to the WHO &quot;Assistive Technology Fact Sheet 18 May 2018&quot;. 80% of these persons live&#xD;
      in a Low or Middle Income Country (LMIC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to World Health Organization estimation, 0.5% of the populations need these&#xD;
      services and a report from the United Nations highlights that 0.7% of the Nepalese&#xD;
      populations are physically disabled - NEPAL: Disabled Population 2011, (UNRCHCO, 2011).&#xD;
      Prosthetics and Orthotics (P&amp;O) service is the subset of rehabilitation service, and National&#xD;
      health policy 2019 has identified rehabilitation as core health services .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared to other assistive products such as crutches and walkers, P&amp;O services are very&#xD;
      scarcely available in Nepal, even-though its need is going higher due to the increasing&#xD;
      prevalence of NCDs and road traffic injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Living Conditions among People with Disability in Nepal report (SINTEF, 2015) highlights that&#xD;
      73 percent of people with disabilities do not have access to Assistive Devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to WHO, failure of health policies, excessive prices of products, provision&#xD;
      difficulties and insufficient training of health personnel are the 4 reasons for this&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      ORTHOPUS objective is to address some of the problem highlighted by WHO:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To address LMIC product-related problems, ORTHOPUS proposes quality prosthetic solutions&#xD;
           with a moderate price by designing innovative solutions based on the frugal innovation&#xD;
           concept&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To address Information transmission and Health care practitioner formation, all&#xD;
           ORTHOPUS' solutions will be shared via a free/Open source licence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In order to guarantee the quality of medical devices, ORTHOPUS follows European&#xD;
           standards certification process for each and every product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nepal is one of the target countries of the ORTHOPUS objective as the 2011 Nepal Census&#xD;
      conducted by the government of Nepal reported that 1.94% of the total population of Nepal is&#xD;
      living with some kind of disabilities. The number will be more if the 'functioning' status of&#xD;
      the population is considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the Living Conditions among People with Disability in Nepal report (SINTEF, 2015)&#xD;
      highlights that 83 percent of people with disabilities do not have access to rehabilitation&#xD;
      services and that there is a 72.5% service gap in Assistive Devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, according to the Principal Investigator of the trial, the most popular solutions&#xD;
      provided by healthcare practitioners, in LMICs such as Nepal, for transradial amputation is a&#xD;
      voluntary opening hand or a passive aesthetics one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The voluntary opening hand is a compromise between efficiency and aesthetics according to the&#xD;
      publication Efficiency of voluntary opening hand and hook prosthetic devices: 24 years of&#xD;
      development? (JRRD, Volume 49, Number 4, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, the passive aesthetic solution does not provide any active grasping&#xD;
      functionalities but has an important social impact for users hiding the limb loss to a&#xD;
      certain extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Nepal was chosen for ORTHOPUS first clinical trial thanks to the help of HI&#xD;
      (Humanity and Inclusion) NGO who has already a program there. HI staff, Yeti Raj Niraula,&#xD;
      will be the principal investigator of this clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will focus on upper-limb prostheses. ORTHOPUS wants to demonstrate that a&#xD;
      set of solutions composed of multiple medical devices such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a wrist with a possible pronosupination as well as a rotational lock and a quick&#xD;
           connection/disconnection feature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an aesthetic articulated hand, similar to usual aesthetic passive hand proposed nowadays&#xD;
           in Nepal but with an additional articulation feature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a heavy duty work hook used as a working tool to address the shortage of heavy duty&#xD;
           prosthetic products in the country. The trial aims at assessing if using this solution&#xD;
           will improve work integration of the user.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a harness used to actuate the work hook allowing the user to open it with muscular&#xD;
           contraction of the upper part of the torso&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this trial, improvement of the autonomy of users and on the well-being in everyday life&#xD;
      will be studied compared to the sole use of a voluntary opening hand or a passive aesthetics&#xD;
      one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objective is to show the relevance of using the set of solutions made by ORTHOPUS&#xD;
      (aesthetic articulated hand, working hook and quick disconnect wrist) compared to the&#xD;
      widespread solution of a voluntary opening hand or passive aesthetic one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish the effect of the ORTHOPUS prosthetic solution, four primary objectives will be&#xD;
      studied to address the scientific question by collecting appropriate data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of grasping capacities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of sociodemographic conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of prosthesis perception&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the primary objectives of the trial the following subjective primary endpoints&#xD;
      will be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of grasping capacities will be evaluated using an adapted to Nepali culture&#xD;
           OPUS survey (Development and measurement properties of the Orthotics and Prosthetics&#xD;
           Users' Survey (OPUS): a comprehensive set of clinical outcome instruments, A W&#xD;
           Heinemann, 2003). Participants will be ranking the ease of realisation of a 30 item list&#xD;
           using ORTHOPUS prosthetic solution. These ranks will be compared to the one obtained&#xD;
           using the previous prosthetic solution (if applicable). Studying results to the survey,&#xD;
           a conclusion on the evolution of the grasping capacities of users will be formulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of quality of life will be evaluated using the WHOQoL-BREF questionnaire&#xD;
           (World Health Organisation, Program of Mental Health. WHOQOL-BREF : introduction,&#xD;
           administration, scoring and generic version of the assessment : field trial version.&#xD;
           1996). Participants will be asked to answer 27 questions with ranked propositions before&#xD;
           and after the test phase of the clinical trial. Scores will be compared to evaluate&#xD;
           improvements brought by the ORTHOPUS prosthetic solution on the quality of life of the&#xD;
           user and a conclusion will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of sociodemographic conditions will be evaluated using a questionnaire&#xD;
           written following the guidance of guidelines Standardization and Harmonization of&#xD;
           Socio-Demographic Variables (2016, GESIS Survey Guidelines). Again a comparison of the&#xD;
           answers to the 28 entries of the form will be made confronting questionnaires filled&#xD;
           before and after the clinical trial test phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluation of prosthesis perception will be conducted using a questionnaire filled by&#xD;
           participants at the end of the test phase of the clinical trial. Analysis of the ranks&#xD;
           given to the 90 entries will allow to draw a precise picture of the participants'&#xD;
           perception of the ORTHOPUS prosthesis solution. With these results a conclusion will be&#xD;
           drawn on the ORTHOPUS' solution improvements that needs to be performed to improve&#xD;
           future users' perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of evaluations of objectives achievements will be used to feed ORTHOPUS' R&amp;D&#xD;
      department in order to improve the studied prosthetic solution or to launch development of&#xD;
      new products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, in Nepal, most of the patients are equipped with either a voluntary opening hand or&#xD;
      a passive aesthetic one. These solutions present grasping capabilities or aesthetics&#xD;
      limitations (see additional document attached to the registration: Comparative scheme -&#xD;
      Standard VS ORTHOPUS prosthetic solutions.pdf) and we hypothesize that the ORTHOPUS&#xD;
      prosthetic solution will expand it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition with this grasping capabilities expansion, we hypothesize that, compared to&#xD;
      previously used prosthetic solution, the set of ORTHOPUS upper limb prosthetics solutions&#xD;
      will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve the autonomy of users (professional reintegration with the ability to perform&#xD;
           manual work)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improve the well-being in everyday life (social reintegration)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patient selection, we hypothesize that two different cohorts will be enough to&#xD;
      discriminate the data and make good clinical trial conclusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first cohort will be composed of prosthetic users usually equipped with aesthetic passive&#xD;
      hand solutions. The second one with a voluntary opening hand user. Data gathered from both&#xD;
      cohorts will allow a direct comparison between the use of voluntary opening hand or passive&#xD;
      aesthetic one (according to the cohort) and the use of the ORTHOPUS prosthetic solution.&#xD;
