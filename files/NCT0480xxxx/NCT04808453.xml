  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, single arm, non-randomized study of CPI-300 in patients&#xD;
      with advanced tumors. CPI-300 is administered via intravenous infusion using an accelerated&#xD;
      titration method followed by a conventional 3 + 3 study design to identify the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 6 dose levels of CPI-300 will be tested. MTD will be defined as the dose associated&#xD;
      with a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) in less than or equal to 33% of patients at the dose&#xD;
      level tested. Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as one of the following events&#xD;
      occurring from the intravenous injection of CPI-300 within 28 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4 or greater treatment related adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 or greater treatment related non-hematologic, non-dermatologic toxicity&#xD;
           (including nausea, vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 72 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be drawn to determine drug blood concentrations for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
