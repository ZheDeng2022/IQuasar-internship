      The main purpose of this study is to reveal the effectiveness of the Knack maneuver and&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations program to be given in addition to the pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      (PFMT) program, which has been proven to be effective in individuals with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence symptoms after prostatectomy. This study is a prospective, controlled,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. The study includes an 8-week pelvic floor muscle training, Knack&#xD;
      maneuver and lifestyle recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it is stated in the literature that PFMT and lifestyle recommendations are&#xD;
      beneficial in the treatment of urinary incontinence (UI). However, although there is evidence&#xD;
      of the effectiveness of the Knack maneuver in stress UI in women, there is no evidence of the&#xD;
      Knack maneuver in urinary incontinence after prostatectomy. On the other hand, the literature&#xD;
      on the effect of lifestyle recommendations after prostatectomy is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to reveal the effectiveness of the Knack maneuver and&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations program, which will be given in addition to the PFMT program, which&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in individuals with UI complaints after radical prostatectomy, in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled design.&#xD;

      The main purpose of this study is to reveal the effectiveness of the Knack maneuver and&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations program to be given in addition to the pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      (PFMT) program, which has been proven to be effective in individuals with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence symptoms after prostatectomy. This study is a prospective, controlled,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. The study includes an 8-week pelvic floor muscle training, Knack&#xD;
      maneuver and lifestyle recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was planned to enroll 72 individuals with urinary incontinence problems after radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy in this randomized controlled clinical study. A physical therapist is&#xD;
      responsible for all assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were included in one of three treatment groups (G1: Pelvic floor muscle training&#xD;
      + Knack maneuver + lifestyle recommendations; G2: Pelvic floor muscle training + Knack&#xD;
      maneuver G3: Pelvic floor muscle training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, it is stated in the literature that PFMT and lifestyle recommendations are&#xD;
      beneficial in the treatment of urinary incontinence (UI). However, although there is evidence&#xD;
      of the effectiveness of the Knack maneuver in stress UI in women, there is no evidence of the&#xD;
      Knack maneuver in urinary incontinence after prostatectomy. On the other hand, the literature&#xD;
      on the effect of lifestyle recommendations after prostatectomy is very limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to reveal the effectiveness of the Knack maneuver and&#xD;
      lifestyle recommendations program, which will be given in addition to the PFMT program, which&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in individuals with UI complaints after radical prostatectomy, in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, the effectiveness of different programs to be applied to individuals&#xD;
      suffering from urinary incontinence after prostatectomy will be determined and compared. It&#xD;
      will increase the level of evidence for the treatment of urinary incontinence, a common&#xD;
      complaint after prostate cancer surgery. In this direction, it will also contribute to the&#xD;
      development of public health.&#xD;
