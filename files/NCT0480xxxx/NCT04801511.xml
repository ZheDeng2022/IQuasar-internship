  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent high-dose intravenous vitamin C and mFOLFOX6 in&#xD;
      locally advanced rectal cancer patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sixty patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-4N0M0, cT1-4N1-2M0, ≤12cm from anus)&#xD;
      will be enrolled and receive preoperative IMRT concurrent with high-dose intravenous vitamin&#xD;
      C and 2-3 cycles of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy, and then after 4 weeks rest, they will continue to&#xD;
      complete 3 cycles of preoperative chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6). Radical surgery will be performed&#xD;
      at 10-12 weeks after IMRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the treatment method through&#xD;
      the acute toxicity [during CRT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy )], PCR (pathologic complete&#xD;
      response) rate, sphincter preserving surgery rate, 2-year survival rate and 2-year&#xD;
      disease-free survival rate.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Preoperative CRT: The eligible subjects will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and high-dose intravenous vitamin C. IMRT will be delivered to PTV-CTV (plan target volume-clinical target volume) with a dose of 45Gy/25f. If necessary, additional boost of 5-10Gy will be delivered to PTV-GTV (plan target volume- gross tumor volume). During the IMRT, 2-3 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) will be delivered. High-dose intravenous vitamin C (24g/d，QD) will be delivered on the day of radiotherapy from the beginning to the end. Three additional cycles of chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) will be given after radiotherapy. Radical surgery will be performed approximately 10-12 weeks after the end of radiotherapy. Whether or not to select &quot;watch and wait&quot; or sphincter preserving surgery needs to refer to the tumor location, tumor regression, surgeon's opinion and patient's will.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy and high-dose intravenous vitamin C :&#xD;
The eligible subjects will be treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy and high-dose intravenous vitamin C preoperatively. IMRT will be delivered to PTV-CTV (plan target volume-clinical target volume) with a dose of 45Gy/25fraction/5weeks. If necessary. During IMRT, 2-3 cycles of concurrent chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) will be delivered. High-dose intravenous vitamin C ( 24g/d，QD ) will be delivered on the day of radiotherapy from the beginning to the end of IMRT.&#xD;
preoperative consolidation chemotherapy: Three additional cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (mFOLFOX6) will be given after the end of IMRT.&#xD;
TME （total mesorectal excision）or sphincter preserving surgery will be performed approximately the 10th-12th weeks after the end of IMRT. Whether or not to select &quot;watch and wait&quot; needs to refer to the tumor location, tumor regression, surgeon's opinion and patient's will.</description>
