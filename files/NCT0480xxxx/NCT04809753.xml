  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Eustachian tube is a narrow tube which links the back of the nose to the middle ear.&#xD;
      Eustachian tube dysfunction may occur when the mucosal lining of the tube is swollen, or does&#xD;
      not open or close properly. It can occur after the start of a cold and other nose, sinus, ear&#xD;
      and throat infections causing ear pain and pressure, fullness, cracking/popping sounds. This&#xD;
      is an ubiquitous healthcare problem, affecting children and adults, that can lead to severe&#xD;
      consequences including hearing loss, chronic otitis media, tinnitus, and vertigo. Numerous&#xD;
      studies have consistently failed to support the effectiveness of medical managements.&#xD;
      Pressure equalizing tubes are considered a temporary solution that does not treat the&#xD;
      underlying pathology. More recent preliminary evidence of using inflation of a&#xD;
      noncompressible balloon in the eustachian tube improved clinical outcomes, patients' symptoms&#xD;
      and quality of life. This eustachian dilation catheter is not accessible in Canada since the&#xD;
      device and procedure is not covered by OHIP (Ontario health insurance plan) or any other&#xD;
      health insurance in Canada. In a cadaver study, we have evaluated using an endovascular&#xD;
      balloon (Balloon that is used to dilate (expand) vessels) for eustachian tube dilation, which&#xD;
      only costs about 10% of the eustachian tube dilation device. This endovascular balloon is&#xD;
      Health Canada approved, but not for this specific use. We therefore want to conduct a pilot&#xD;
      safety study with the main goal of assessing feasibility of eustachian tube dilation with the&#xD;
      endovascular device.&#xD;
