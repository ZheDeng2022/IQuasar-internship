  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In October 2011, the global population was estimated to be 7 billion. With a growth rate&#xD;
      1.05% per year, the world's population is expected to increase by 2 billion persons in the&#xD;
      next 30 years, from 7.7 billion currently to 9.7 billion in 2050 and could peak at nearly 11&#xD;
      billion around 2100 (1). Nearly all of this growth is occurring in developing nations, where&#xD;
      fertility rates remain relatively high(2) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an inverse relationship between contraceptive use and fertility. Countries with high&#xD;
      proportions of women using contraception generally have lower levels of fertility (3).&#xD;
      Globally, 62 percent of married women ages 15 to 49 use a method of family planning and 56&#xD;
      percent use a modern method. These rates are twice as high among women living in high-income&#xD;
      countries (67 percent and 60 percent, respectively) compared to women living in low-income&#xD;
      countries (34 percent and 29 percent, respectively)(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, many more women of reproductive age are using some form of contraception than in&#xD;
      1990. The growing use of contraceptive methods in recent decades has resulted not only in&#xD;
      improvements in health-related outcomes such as reduced unintended pregnancies, high-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies, maternal mortality, and infant mortality, but also in improvements in schooling&#xD;
      and economic outcomes, especially for girls and women. Beyond the impacts of contraceptive&#xD;
      use at the individual level, there are benefits at the population level. From a macroeconomic&#xD;
      perspective, reductions in fertility enhance economic growth as a result of reduced youth&#xD;
      dependency and an increased number of women participating in paid labour(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recognition of the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and&#xD;
      Development (ICPD) in 1994, governments reaffirmed the importance of the Program of Action&#xD;
      and its further implementation for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The&#xD;
      emphasis on universal access to a full range of safe and reliable family planning methods,&#xD;
      which help couples and individuals to realize their right to decide freely and responsibly on&#xD;
      the number, spacing and timing of births, remains as critical today as it did in 1994(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of interest to the family planning community has been contraceptive use&#xD;
      (often modern method use), which has traditionally been measured and interpreted in a fairly&#xD;
      straightforward way. Generally, a person using a (modern) method is considered a positive&#xD;
      outcome, while someone not using a (modern) method is considered a negative outcome (5). Most&#xD;
      studies of individual determinants of contraceptive use focus on cognitive, demographic, and&#xD;
      contextual variables. However, these models assume that individuals have personal control&#xD;
      over their contraceptive behavior(6) .As with other sexual risk outcomes, a woman's capacity&#xD;
      to act upon her intention to use contraception may be contingent upon the wishes and actions&#xD;
      of her partner or other members of her family or community(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomy is defined as the ability of subject to make his/her own decisions without being&#xD;
      controlled by anyone else (8). Reproductive autonomy means the women has the power to decide&#xD;
      when, if at all, to have children; also, many-but not all-of the choices relevant to&#xD;
      reproduction. It means focusing on decisions about whether and when to have children. Women&#xD;
      should also generally determine how their pregnancy will be carried out and how the birth&#xD;
      will happen(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproductive autonomy is central to women's welfare both because childbearing takes place in&#xD;
      women's bodies and because they are generally expected to take primary responsibility for&#xD;
      child rearing(9). It is one of the main reproductive rights. Unfortunately, such autonomy is&#xD;
      a low priority for most societies, or is anathema to their belief systems altogether. This&#xD;
      situation is doubly sad because women's reproductive autonomy is intrinsically valuable for&#xD;
      women and also instrumentally valuable for the welfare of humankind(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent American study has developed and validated an English multidimensional quantitative&#xD;
      instrument that can measure reproductive autonomy. Fourteen items were selected through&#xD;
      factor analysis and grouped into three subscales under the construct of reproductive&#xD;
      autonomy, labeled &quot;freedom from coercion,&quot;&quot;communication,&quot; and &quot; decision-making&quot;. The scale&#xD;
      is considered a reliable instrument to assess a woman's power to control matters regarding&#xD;
      contraceptive use, pregnancy, and childbearing, and to evaluate interventions to increase&#xD;
      women's autonomy domestically and globally(6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproductive autonomy cannot exist without attention to context to supports, to barriers, to&#xD;
      social policy, to social norms(10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional study of reproductive-age, sexually active women was conducted in Vietnam.&#xD;
      It aimed to validate the Reproductive Autonomy Scale among Vietnamese females. Subscales had&#xD;
      moderate to high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha: decision-making power 0.65, freedom&#xD;
      from coercion 0.85, and communication ability 0.87). However, the study highlight the need to&#xD;
      develop and validate a new measure for reproductive autonomy for populations outside the&#xD;
      United States or to adapt the existing measure for these contexts(7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although countless approaches to measuring the success of family planning programs exist and&#xD;
      novel measures are being continuously introduced, the most widely measured indicators in&#xD;
      global family planning continue to be: 1) the total fertility rate; 2) the contraceptive&#xD;
      prevalence rate; and 3) unmet need for contraception. These three population-based indicators&#xD;
      have the advantage of being routinely measured within nationally representative surveys such&#xD;
      as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) around the world without the need for a dedicated&#xD;
      study in any given context. In the absence of more nuanced data, we routinely summarize TFR,&#xD;
      CPR, and unmet need to paint a picture of the overall family planning context. However, none&#xD;
      of these indicators is a measure of health, quality, access, or rights(5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians and others show respect to autonomous persons by giving &quot;weight to their&#xD;
      considered opinions and choices&quot; and by &quot;refraining from obstructing their actions unless&#xD;
      they are clearly detrimental to others(10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Novel Family Planning Indicator is the contraceptive autonomy. It is defined as factors&#xD;
      necessary for a person to decide for themself what they want in relation to contraception and&#xD;
      then to realize that decision, this indicator divides the contraceptive autonomy construct&#xD;
      into subdomains of informed choice, full choice and free choice. It aimed to promote&#xD;
      reproductive health and right. By acknowledging that autonomous nonuse is a positive outcome,&#xD;
      aiming to maximize contraceptive autonomy rather than use could help shift incentives for&#xD;
      family planning programs and reduce some common forms of contraceptive coercion, as this&#xD;
      measurement approach is realigned with a focus on high-quality rights-based care (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in the status and empowerment of women is central to progress in global&#xD;
      development efforts and, perhaps more importantly, to the achievement of equitable treatment&#xD;
      and representation of the 3.5 billion women in the world (11). Women's autonomy is an&#xD;
      important determinant of women's health and well-being, (12). Review of literature reported&#xD;
      the positive associations between women's empowerment and modern contraceptive use and access&#xD;
      to maternal interventions such as antenatal care and skilled birth attendance(13), lower&#xD;
      fertility, longer birth intervals, and lower rates of unintended pregnancy (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of Pakistani Reproductive Health and Family Planning Survey, 2000 which interviewed&#xD;
      a national sample of ever married women aged 15-49 years showed that decision autonomy was&#xD;
      significantly associated with both lifetime and current contraception use. On other hand,&#xD;
      movement autonomy was not consistently associated with contraceptive use(14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Omani study analyzed the correlates of women's empowerment and the effect of empowerment on&#xD;
      unmet need for contraception. Two indicators of empowerment were used: women's involvement in&#xD;
      decision-making and freedom of movement. The results reveled that empowered women were more&#xD;
      likely to use contraception(15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Egypt situation In 2021, the estimated Egypt total population is 101,6 million.(16) Between&#xD;
      2011 and 2018, 11 million people were added to the Egyptian population.(17) Unless the&#xD;
      fertility rate of 3.47 changes, by 2030, Egypt's population is expected to grow to 128&#xD;
      million.(18) High fertility contributes to rapid population growth, which threatens the&#xD;
      health and well-being of the Egyptian people. In addition, It is likely to impose a costly&#xD;
      burden for Egypt by hindering economic development, limiting access to education, food,&#xD;
      employment, and potable water, and increasing health risks for women and children.(19) EDHS&#xD;
      2014 findings revealed that 58.5 percent of currently married women in Egypt are currently&#xD;
      using a contraceptive method and in Upper Egypt was 50%, modern methods 56.9%, traditional&#xD;
      methods 1.6%, total unmet need 12.6%, and not using 41.5%.(20) Women's autonomy over time is&#xD;
      a product not only of their individual characteristics, but also of the household and&#xD;
      community environment in which they live. Secondary analysis study used the 2006 and 2012&#xD;
      Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS) and multilevel models. It showed that There are&#xD;
      large and consistent variations in women's autonomy by household region of residence and&#xD;
      wealth. women in the rural and urban Upper Egypt region are less autonomous than women in the&#xD;
      Cairo region, and women in wealthier households are less autonomous compared to the poorest&#xD;
      households.(12) The ELMPS measures of autonomy include a set of questions on: (a)&#xD;
      participation in household decision-making, (b) woman's ability to move around on her own&#xD;
      (mobility), and (c) access to financial resources. (12) Attitudinal measures like attitudes&#xD;
      towards gender norms and tolerance of Intimate partner violence are also commonly used as&#xD;
      measures of women's empowerment globally(21) A secondary analysis of EDHS 2008 data aimed to&#xD;
      assess women's autonomy on modern contraceptive use and its associated factors among Egyptian&#xD;
      women. The study revealed that women's autonomy influences their use of modern contraception&#xD;
      methods, where household decision-making autonomy was significantly associated with current&#xD;
      modern contraceptive use. Women with intermediate and high autonomy were 1.19 (95%CI&#xD;
      1.04-1.35) and 1.32 (95% CI 1.18-1.49) more likely to use modern contraception methods&#xD;
      compared to women with low autonomy.(22)&#xD;
