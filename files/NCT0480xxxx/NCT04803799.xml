  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ageing is accompanied by a high risk of developing physical or cognitive impairments, as well&#xD;
      as a decrease in abilities to perform two tasks simultaneously, contributing to loss of&#xD;
      autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions based on the performance of cognitive-motor dual tasks show positive effects on&#xD;
      cognitive, physical and emotional development on dual-tasking capabilities. Exergames,&#xD;
      interactive serious games combining physical activity and technology, are a certain type of&#xD;
      cognitive-motor dual task training. These exergames appear to be cognitively effective,&#xD;
      discussed on a physical level, not studied on dual task functions. It is likely that a dual&#xD;
      task cognitive-motor with the support of a exercise leads to the same benefits as training&#xD;
      without the need for special support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the exergames benefit from specific features such as a good immersion and a&#xD;
      playful aspect that increase the participant's adhesion. Moreover, the level of security of&#xD;
      this type of programme has been little studied. It is likely that cognitive-motor dual tasks&#xD;
      training supported by an exercise programme leads to few undesirable events and good&#xD;
      adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many of the recommendations specific needs gaming state that it is important to develop&#xD;
      systems that respond to the needs specific to the population concerned in order to be&#xD;
      effective. Within the laboratory HAVAE has been developed a tool, the &quot;virtual carpet&quot;:&#xD;
&#xD;
      association between a video-projected scene and a monitoring system of position of the&#xD;
      participants. This system makes it possible to use as a grid of play the cartography and&#xD;
      iconography of the City of Limoges. The investigators suppose that this emphasis on local&#xD;
      heritage will encourage the participants leaving their homes, thereby increasing their level&#xD;
      of physical activity and their quality of life.&#xD;
