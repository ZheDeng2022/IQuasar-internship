  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Roughly 60% of people with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) have an incomplete one, with a strength,&#xD;
      sensibility, and muscle tone alteration. Moreover, this condition involves a high impact on&#xD;
      the psychological and socioeconomic levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an incomplete SCI, spontaneous functional recovery occurs. This recovery is strong&#xD;
      associated with injury and person characteristics, and with corticospinal fibers, motor&#xD;
      cortex, and spinal neurons neuroplasticity. However, also it is possible to stimulate&#xD;
      neuroplasticity mechanisms of these structures throughout rehabilitation techniques.&#xD;
      Generally, with external devices, exoskeletons, or physical exercise therapy. With it,&#xD;
      clinicians achieve early, intensive and specific therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This reorganization and recovery can be influenced because of mirror neurons, located in&#xD;
      motor and premotor areas, and in other cortical and subcortical areas. These types of neurons&#xD;
      are activated with a functional action observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to incomplete SCI neuroplasticity recover, these therapies (concretely, illusion visual&#xD;
      systems) have been the object of systematic review in this population with the aim of knowing&#xD;
      its repercussion on neuropathic pain in chronic patients. Moseley and collaborators in 2007&#xD;
      were the first of proposing a virtual gat system that induced patients' gait illusion. The&#xD;
      promising results in this intervention, leading institutions performed similar studies with&#xD;
      other stimuli and devices, with good results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, SCI studies are focused on neuropathic pain and not in motor function (like in other&#xD;
      populations). Therefore, there is not any study that assesses mirror neurons activity in the&#xD;
      physical condition and/or in functional gait capaity in incomplete spinal cord injury&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the above, the study principal aim is to evaluate a virtual gait treatment&#xD;
      effectiveness compared with combined interventions with specific gait physical exercise in&#xD;
      functional capacity in the incomplete spinal cord injury population. Concretely in follow&#xD;
      outcomes: gait, functionality, strength, muscle tone, sensibility, and neuropathic pain.&#xD;

      Roughly 60% of people with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) have an incomplete one, with a strength,&#xD;

      the psychological and socioeconomic levels.&#xD;

      This reorganization and recovery can be influenced because of mirror neurons, located in&#xD;
      motor and premotor areas, and in other cortical and subcortical areas. These types of neurons&#xD;
      are activated with a functional action observation. Mirror neurons activity has been studied&#xD;
      with several brain injury populations (Cranial traumatisms, Parkinson, or Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease). Therefore, several experimental investigations have been developed by applying&#xD;
      different interventions to modified their activity (mirror therapies, virtual reality&#xD;
      therapies, or Action-Observation therapies). Its results showed promising improvements,&#xD;
      except for advanced Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to incomplete SCI neuroplasticity recover, these therapies (concretely, illusion visual&#xD;
      systems) have been the object of systematic review in this population with the aim of knowing&#xD;

      functional capacity in the incomplete spinal cord injury population. Concretely in follow&#xD;
      outcomes: gait, functionality, strength, muscle tone, sensibility, and neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study is a randomized clinical trial in which four groups of twenty people in&#xD;
      each group will participate, with different interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Virtual Gait and Physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Documental projection and physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Virtual Gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Documental Projection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be performed with SPSS statistic program (v26). Normality and&#xD;
      homocedasticity will be analyzed by Shapiro-Wilk t-test and Levene test, respectively. For&#xD;
      comparation between groups Bonferroni will be used. If any confusion factor that not meet&#xD;
      requirements to be analysed like a covaraible exist, ANCOVA will be used. When p&lt;0.0.5&#xD;
      statistical significant differences will be asumed.&#xD;
