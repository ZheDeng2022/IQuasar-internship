      Using a highly innovative methodology, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), the&#xD;
      purpose of this randomized factorial trial is to identify components of a intervention&#xD;
      (CASCADE) to enhance the decision support skills of family caregivers of persons with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed advanced cancer. Using a 2x2x2x2 full factorial design, 352 family caregivers&#xD;
      of persons with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer will be randomized to receive one or more&#xD;
      nurse coach-delivered decision partnering training components, based on the Ottawa Decision&#xD;
      Support Framework and Social Support Effectiveness Theory: 1) psychoeducation on effective&#xD;
      decision partnering principles (1 vs. 3 sessions); 2) decision partnering communication&#xD;
      training (yes vs. no); 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training (yes vs. no); and monthly follow (1&#xD;
      monthly follow-up call vs. monthly follow-up calls for 24 weeks).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A priority focus in oncology and palliative care is preparing the 3.2 million U.S. family&#xD;
      caregivers of persons with cancer to effectively partner with patients in health-related&#xD;
      decision-making from diagnosis to the end of life, particularly in underserved settings. Over&#xD;
      70% of patients with cancer involve relatives, friends, and partners in healthcare decisions,&#xD;
      including choices about cancer treatments, surgery, transitions and location of care,&#xD;
      accessing palliative and hospice care, and many others. Patients making healthcare decisions&#xD;
      with unprepared family caregivers may experience inadequate family decision support leading&#xD;
      to heightened distress and receipt of care/treatments inconsistent with their values and&#xD;
      preferences. This in turn may increase distress for family caregivers. Hence, there is a&#xD;
      critical need to train cancer family caregivers to effectively support patient&#xD;
      decision-making; however, few interventions exist that enhance caregiver skills in providing&#xD;
      decision support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed and successfully pilot tested CASCADE (CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept&#xD;
      DEcision partners), a lay navigator-led, telehealth early palliative care intervention to&#xD;
      train advanced cancer caregivers how to effectively partner with patients in health-related&#xD;
      decision-making. Evolving out of our prior early palliative care caregiving interventions,&#xD;
      decision partnering relevant content for family caregivers includes principles of effective&#xD;
      social support in decision-making, decision support communication, and Ottawa Decision Guide&#xD;
      training; however we do not know which of these components and component interactions&#xD;
      influences patient and caregiver decision-making outcomes. Traditional research approaches&#xD;
      typically treat interventions as &quot;bundled&quot; treatment packages, making it difficult to assess&#xD;
      definitively which aspects of an intervention can be reduced, eliminated, or replaced to&#xD;
      improve efficiency. Using traditional research methods (e.g., two-arm randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials that test new features one at a time) requires conducting multiple studies, which is&#xD;
      an exorbitantly expensive and time consuming process. This paradox prompts us to consider&#xD;
      methodologies that offer a more efficient way to test multiple intervention components&#xD;
      simultaneously. The research question we raise is: &quot;What set of decision support training&#xD;
      components best optimizes family caregiver support of patient healthcare decision-making?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a highly innovative methodology, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to conduct an optimization trial to develop and refine the decision&#xD;
      support skills of family caregivers of persons with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer (CASCADE:&#xD;
      CAre Supporters Coached to be Adept DEcision partners). Using a 2x2x2x2 factorial design, 352&#xD;
      family caregivers of persons with newly-diagnosed advanced cancer will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive one or more lay coach-delivered decision support training components, based on the&#xD;
      Ottawa Decision Support Framework and Social Support Effectiveness Theory: 1) psychoeducation&#xD;
      on effective decision support and social support principles (1 vs. 3 sessions); 2) decision&#xD;
      support communication training (yes vs. no); 3) Ottawa Decision Guide training (yes vs. no);&#xD;
      and 4) monthly follow-up (1 monthly follow-up call vs. monthly follow-up calls for 24 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Identify CASCADE decision support training components (main effects/interactions) that&#xD;
      contribute meaningfully to improvement over 24 weeks in the primary outcome, patient-reported&#xD;
      decisional conflict, measured by the Decisional Conflict Scale and secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers: a) distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale),42 b) quality of life (PROMIS&#xD;
      Global 10) Patients: a) distress (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), b) quality of life&#xD;
      (PROMIS Global 10), c) healthcare utilization, d) advance directive completion. A component&#xD;
      will be considered effective if its presence produces a statistically significant main effect&#xD;
      or two-way interaction of Cohen's d ≥.30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Apply results obtained in Aim 1 to build: (1) an intervention made up of only active&#xD;
      components and (2) a second intervention that is optimized for scalability and cost.&#xD;
      Intervention (1) will be made up of the best set of component and component levels, based on&#xD;
      Aim 1 results. Intervention (2) will be comprised of the set of components for the smallest&#xD;
      cost that still yields a clinically meaningful effect in outcomes (d≥.30).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: Explore mediators and moderators (e.g., sociodemographics, decision&#xD;
      self-efficacy, social support) of the relationship between intervention components and&#xD;
      patient and caregiver outcomes.&#xD;
