  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is prepared to use CMR technology for early screening of myocardial lesions in 561&#xD;
      age-matched women with type 2 diabetes without PCOS, with PCOS without type 2 diabetes and&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes combined with PCOS, compare the differences between the two groups of&#xD;
      cardiomyocyte injury changes, and treat and follow-up with type 2 diabetes and PCOS in&#xD;
      accordance with the current standard treatment guidelines for type 2 diabetes and PCOS, after&#xD;
      3 years of follow-up we will analyse the changes in cardiomyopathy, cardiac serological&#xD;
      indicators, and heart function indicators,which can provide theoretical basis for early&#xD;
      clinical intervention in the future.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      So far, due to the lack of more sensitive noninvasive detection methods and indicators that&#xD;
      suggest early cardiomyopathy, it is not clear whether type 2 diabetes combined with PCOS will&#xD;
      lead to earlier and more progressive changes in cardiomyopathy, and whether there is a&#xD;
      difference with type 2 diabetes alone and early cardiomyopathy in patients with simple&#xD;
      PCOS.Compared with women with type 2 diabetes who did not combine polycystic Ovary&#xD;
      Syndrome(PCOS) or PCOS did not combine with type 2 diabetes, patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      who combined PCOS had the characteristics of lower age of onset, longer exposure to high risk&#xD;
      factors of CVD, and higher risk of cardiovascular disease on the basis of the dual&#xD;
      pathophysiology of insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism.The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find early cardiovascular disease of women with type 2 diabetes and PCOS and conduct early&#xD;
      clinical intervention.&#xD;
