  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 2-arm, randomized controlled, population based trial to test the impact of multiple&#xD;
      exposures to brief nicotine corrective messages among adult tobacco cigarette smokers and&#xD;
      non-smokers followed in waves over 12 weeks. The primary outcome, assessed at wave 1&#xD;
      (baseline), wave 2 (weeks 5-6), and wave 4 (weeks 11-13) is nicotine beliefs. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes assessed at the same time points include intention to use nicotine/tobacco products&#xD;
      and nicotine/tobacco use.&#xD;

      This is a 2-arm, randomized controlled, population based trial to test the impact of multiple&#xD;
      exposures to brief nicotine corrective messages among adult tobacco cigarette smokers and&#xD;
      non-smokers followed for 12 weeks. The primary outcome, assessed at wave 1 (baseline), wave 2&#xD;
      (weeks 5-6), and wave 4 (weeks 11-13) is nicotine beliefs. Secondary outcomes assessed at the&#xD;
      same time points include intention to use nicotine/tobacco products and nicotine/tobacco use.&#xD;
      All participants will be recruited from a US national consumer research panel. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be U.S. adults ages 18+ who are enrolled members of the partnering consumer&#xD;
      research panel. The sample will include non-smokers and smokers, oversampling current smokers&#xD;
      (defined as smoking 100+ lifetime cigarettes and now smoking all or some days) to ensure the&#xD;
      proportion of smokers in the sample reflects the ~15 % population smoking prevalence among&#xD;
      adults. Panel members will be contacted by email with a brief study description and link to&#xD;
      an eligibility screener and online informed consent form. Eligible and interested&#xD;
      participants will complete the baseline (Wave 1) survey measures of nicotine beliefs and&#xD;
      intentions/use of nicotine and tobacco products, after which they will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      in equal numbers to the nicotine corrective message (NCM) intervention condition or the&#xD;
      delayed message control condition. After completing the baseline survey, participants in the&#xD;
      NCM condition will receive their first exposure to the corrective messages. In the Wave 2&#xD;
      survey, all participants will complete measures of nicotine beliefs and intentions/use of&#xD;
      nicotine and tobacco products. Participants in the NCM condition will then receive their&#xD;
      second exposure to study messages. Only participants in the NCM condition will receive the&#xD;
      Wave 3 survey, which involves the third exposure to study messages. The Wave 4 survey will&#xD;
      include the fourth exposure to study messages for those in the NCM condition and the final&#xD;
      assessment of nicotine beliefs and intentions/use of nicotine and tobacco products for all&#xD;
      participants. Upon completion of the final assessment, participants in the control condition&#xD;
      will be exposed to the nicotine corrective messages and all participants will be directed to&#xD;
      resources on quitting smoking.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The intervention consists of 8 brief nicotine corrective public education messages delivered online. The messages will communicate misperceptions about nicotine's role in health harms as well as misperceptions that reduced nicotine content cigarettes are less harmful than tobacco cigarettes and that e-cigarettes contain less nicotine than tobacco cigarettes.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Nicotine beliefs</measure>
    <time_frame>Wave 4 (weeks 11-13)</time_frame>
    <description>8 items assessing nicotine beliefs, 4 items assessing nicotine false beliefs, 6 items assessing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) false beliefs, 4 items assessing e-cigarette false beliefs, 11 items assessing reduced nicotine content (RNC) cigarette false beliefs, and two items assessing beliefs about additive-free and organic tobacco products. Higher scale scores indicate a higher number of false beliefs.&#xD;
Nicotine beliefs relate specifically to its addictive nature, nicotine as a cause of cancer, and the role of nicotine in the health harms and cancer caused by smoking. The product-specific constructs (i.e., NRT, e-cigarette, RNC cigarette) include items related to the addictiveness of the product and the perceived health risks of the product compared to regular cigarettes. Two items regarding beliefs about additive-free and organic tobacco products (topics not addressed in the NCM intervention) evaluate whether effects on beliefs are specific to the manipulation.</description>

One item &quot;Rank the following three uses of nicotine in terms of their social acceptability to you and people like you.&quot; From 1= most acceptable to 3=least acceptable</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Behavioral control</measure>
    <time_frame>Wave 4 (weeks 11-13)</time_frame>
    <description>One item assessing confidence to resist smoking cigarettes when others are smoking (0=not at all confident to 3=very confident) and among current tobacco users, one item assessing confidence to quit smoking/tobacco use for good (0=not at all confident to 3=very confident). For past 30 day tobacco users, one item assessing importance of stopping tobacco use (0 to 10 scale, where 0= not at all), one item assessing readiness to quit within the next month (0 to 10 scale, where 0= not at all) and one item assessing confidence to quit within the next month (0 to 10 scale, where 0= not at all).</description>
