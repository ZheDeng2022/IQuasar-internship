  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the official guidelines, a range of settings for cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation, including the community- and home-based models, are considered to answer to&#xD;
      the inadequate number of rehabilitation services, especially at hospitals, and, also, to&#xD;
      respond to the patients' needs. For these settings outside the hospitals, new strategies for&#xD;
      the assessment of exercise capacity and exercise training are essential. The modality of&#xD;
      stepping can be a promising tool because it is inexpensive, portable, and reflects one of the&#xD;
      main activities of daily living (stair climbing). The development of a new field test implies&#xD;
      the establishment of normative values and reference equations generated from data of&#xD;
      populations without disabilities to aim to characterize a defined population at a specific&#xD;
      period of time, and evaluate and compare an individual's performance within a population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this project is to establish normative values and reference equations&#xD;
      generated from Portuguese adults without disabilities of a new step test for the assessment&#xD;
      of exercise capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a cross-sectional study in Portuguese adults (over 18 years)&#xD;
      without disabilities. The study will be advertised at the university campus, surrounding&#xD;
      areas, and interested participants can contact the research team for participation. The&#xD;
      participants who agree will be seen by the principal investigator who will explain the nature&#xD;
      of the study and assess eligibility for the study. The participants will sign informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the study will be performed in one day. The participants will perform&#xD;
      the incremental step test twice (30 minutes apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, socio-demographic information (age and sex), anthropometric measures (weight,&#xD;
      height, and body mass index), and clinical data (smoking status, comorbidities, and level of&#xD;
      physical activity) will be collected.&#xD;

    <description>Performance of the incremental step test (number of steps) for the assessment of exercise capacity. The step test will be designed according to the characteristics of other validated field tests - the walking tests (6-minute walk test and the incremental shuttle walking test) The step test will be performed on a 20 cm tall, single-step device with no handles. The criteria for stopping the test will be the same as described in standard operating procedures for the walking field tests, with the addition of the inability to follow the work rate for a period of 10 seconds.&#xD;
The main outcome of the test will be the highest number of steps and work rate achieved.</description>
