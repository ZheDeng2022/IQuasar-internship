      A Phase IV trial of a hospital policy of Tranexamic acid to reduce transfusion in major&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TRACTION Trial is a national multi-centre Phase IV randomized cluster-crossover trial of&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid versus placebo. Over the duration of the study, participating centres will be&#xD;
      centrally and randomly allocated to receive either TXA or matching placebo at 1-month&#xD;
      intervals for a total of 8 months. As our pragmatic trial is designed to define practice, we&#xD;
      have selected co-primary outcomes that evaluate effectiveness in the context of safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our co-primary outcomes are the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proportion of patients transfused RBCs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incidence of DVT or PE (collectively called venous thromboembolism (VTE) within 3 months&#xD;
           of surgery.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Over the duration of the study, participating centres will be centrally and randomly allocated to receive either TXA or matching placebo at 1-month intervals for a total of 8 months. Intervention assignment will only be known to the research pharmacy staff who will prepare the study drug specific to the interval assignment. To minimize sources of selection and ascertainment biases, anesthesiologists, surgeons, investigators, research staff, and members of the Data Safety and Monitoring Board will all be blinded to randomization schemes and treatments administered; only the trial statistician will have access to randomization schemes for all sites. The research site's Pharmacy staff will not have contact with the study team or the patient and will be expressly forbidden to discuss individual treatment allocation with the study team, the patient, the operating room and clinical care team unless emergency un-blinding is warranted.</masking_description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cluster-level inclusion criteria: Hospital sites will be included in the trial if&#xD;
             anesthesia and hospital leadership agree to manage patients as per the policy being&#xD;
             implemented and evaluated in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient-level inclusion criteria: Patients 18 years of age and with increased local&#xD;
             fibrinolysis undergoing surgery (a state necessarily indicative of hyperfibrinolysis).&#xD;
             To observe measurable effect of tranexamic acid on RBC transfusion we will include&#xD;
             hospital procedures known to be associated with a baseline RBC transfusion rate of ≥&#xD;
             5%. This threshold was chosen as both clinicians and our patient partners identified&#xD;
             that a 1 in 20 chance of transfusion was substantive, and to ensure inclusion of a&#xD;
             sufficiently broad patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Classification of major non-cardiac surgeries to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. General surgery (esophagectomy, gastrectomy, gastric repair, small bowel repair or&#xD;
             resection, ostomy formation, colon/rectum repair or resection, colostomy, splenectomy,&#xD;
             hepatectomy, pancreatectomy, resection of abdominal mass)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Orthopedics (hip fracture repair, pelvic fixation, femur repair / fixation, shoulder /&#xD;
             humerus open reduction internal fixation, lower extremity amputation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Spine (spinal fusion, vertebrectomy and diskectomy with instrumentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Otolaryngology (glossectomy, mandibulectomy, radical laryngectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Thoracic (lung resection or decortication)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Vascular (large vessel arterial bypass, large vessel aneurysmorrhaphy, large vessel&#xD;
             endarterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Gynecology (hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Urology (nephrectomy, cystectomy, prostatectomy, pelvic exenteration)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Plastic surgery (neoplasm resection, soft tissue resection, skin grafting)&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Surgeries anticipated to be associated with 5% or greater risk of RBC transfusion in&#xD;
             hospital as per the surgical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active thromboembolic disease (ie, patient is anticoagulated for thromboembolic&#xD;
             disease prior to admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiac surgery and hip and knee arthroplasty where TXA is standard-of-care&#xD;
