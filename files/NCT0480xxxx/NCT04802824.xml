  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most prevalent and lethal malignancy of the kidney. At the&#xD;
      time of diagnosis, as many as a fifth of patients have metastatic disease (mRCC). Despite&#xD;
      advances in treatment, long-term survival rates remain poor. 18F-fluoropivalate ([18F]FPIA)&#xD;
      is a new tracer that images short chain fatty acid (SCFA) uptake in tumours, a key component&#xD;
      of fatty acid oxidation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate longitudinal changes in [18F]FPIA uptake at baseline,&#xD;
      at 4-6 weeks and at 12 weeks following treatment initiation in patients using tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitors (TKI's), chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or combinations of these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that the import of [18F]FPIA-detectable SCFA into tumours is&#xD;
      high and decreases with effective treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      24 evaluable patients with radiological and/or histological evidence of mRCC and due to&#xD;
      receive systemic therapy will be enrolled. The patients invited to participate in the study&#xD;
      will provide written informed consent. Patients will only undergo [18F]FPIA positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging once they have satisfied the inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. Once these have been satisfied, eligible patients will proceed to&#xD;
      [18F]FPIA PET/CT. Patients will have three imaging visits at baseline, 4-6 weeks and 12 weeks&#xD;
      post the commencement of treatment. Patients will have been treated as per standard of care,&#xD;
      which may have included TKI's, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or combinations of these. Data&#xD;
      will be considered complete when patients have all three analysable scans. In the event of&#xD;
      dropout, additional subjects will be recruited to reach a total number of 24 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each day of imaging the patients will have a blood test and a urine sample collected to&#xD;
      measure concentrations of carnitine. For each scan, a single dose of [18F]FPIA (maximum 370&#xD;
      MBq) IV will be administered to the participant. The participant will then rest in a quiet&#xD;
      place for an uptake period and undergo whole body PET/CT scanning from 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Archival tumour biopsies (primary or metastatic lesion), taken within 3 months of the 1st&#xD;
      [18F]FPIA PET/CT scan will be retrieved for analysis where possible.&#xD;
