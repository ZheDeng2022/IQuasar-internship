      Objective The present study aimed to evaluate which factors were statistically associated&#xD;
      with a greater probability of inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) damage during lower third molar&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design A prospective observational study was performed at the Oral Surgery Unit of the&#xD;
      Umberto I Hospital on 92 patients which underwent surgical extraction of a lower third molar,&#xD;
      that was radiographically overlapped to the mandibular canal. All surgeries were performed by&#xD;
      the same expert surgeon. A principal component analysis and the exact two-tailed Fisher test&#xD;
      were used.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exclusion criteria were the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lower third molar buds;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  lack of contiguous second molar;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  wide cyst-like areas or severe osteo-metabolic/tumor pathologies associated with the&#xD;
           lower third molar;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pre-operative neurosensory deficit related to IAN on the side where surgery was to be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic data were noted on a special chart, developed in four areas&#xD;
      concerning the patient's personal data, pre-operative case evaluation, surgical technique,&#xD;
      and post-operative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of surgical difficulty was reached using a modified Pederson's scale by assigning&#xD;
      a 1 to 3 score to each of the following variables: tooth inclination (mesioangular/vertical =&#xD;
      1; horizontal = 2; distoangular = 3), depth of impaction (modified Winter classification: A/B&#xD;
      = 1; C1 = 2; C 2= 3), Pell &amp; Gregory class (I = 1; II = 2; III = 3), root morphology (fused&#xD;
      or slightly divergent = 1; strongly divergent = 2; presence of apical anomalies = 3),&#xD;
      proximity to the IAN (none = 1; contiguity = 2; embrication = 3) and maximum mouth opening (&gt;&#xD;
      4 cm = 1; 3-4 cm = 2; &lt; 3 cm = 3). For each extracted third molar, a total score between 6&#xD;
      and 18 was therefore obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries were performed by the same expert surgeon (RP), with the buccal approach using&#xD;
      local anesthesia, and included the following maneuvers:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  luxation of the coronal portion of the tooth/root in an ipsilateral or parallel&#xD;
           direction with respect to the IAN position and running, in order to minimize nerve&#xD;
           compression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  post-extraction residual bone cavity inspection using a Zeiss 4x300 magnification&#xD;
           optical system to better identify intra-operative nerve exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No material was inserted into the residual cavity, neither by regeneration nor by&#xD;
      haemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After one week, sensitivity was tested on both sides with the tactile test using a 27-gauge&#xD;
      needle tip and, if a difference was found, the patient was followed up once a week for the&#xD;
      first month and every two weeks thereafter, until he/she reported to perceive the pin-prick&#xD;
      test in the affected side the same way as the healthy side.&#xD;
