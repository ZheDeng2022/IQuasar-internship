  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many cancer patients suffer from intractable pain and which is often suboptimally controlled&#xD;
      by even strong opioid analgesics. Coeliac plexus neurolysis (CPN) is procedure which intended&#xD;
      to permanently destroy the nociceptive pathway that transmits the pain caused by the tumour.&#xD;
      It can be with different approaches, such as percutaneously guided by fluoroscopy,&#xD;
      echo-endoscopically or surgically with endoscopic approach being the more popular one in many&#xD;
      centers equipped with echo-endoscopic services. The effect of CPN has been well established&#xD;
      by some retrospective series. The overall response rate to CPN ranges from 70-90%, however,&#xD;
      the analgesic effect is limited and up to roughly around 3 months. It is believed that the&#xD;
      short-lasting analgesic effect is related to incomplete neurolysis by absolute alcohol&#xD;
      injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of coeliac plexus has been introduced as another mode&#xD;
      of CPN. So far, only one small single center randomized controlled trial (RCT) suggesting&#xD;
      superior performance in favour to CPN using RFA. This result has to be validated and by a RCT&#xD;
      with larger sample size. In addition, data concerning the quality of life (QOL) improvement&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness need to be further elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      perform a RCT to look into these issues.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of EUS-CPN by chemical ablation using&#xD;
      alcohol injection versus by radiofrequency ablation in patients with cancer pain related to&#xD;
      intra-abdominal malignancy. This is a randomised controlled trial to assess the clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and cost-effectiveness of this new treatment approach.&#xD;
