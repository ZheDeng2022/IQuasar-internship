  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether having the AMP Study antibody (called VRC01) in&#xD;
      a person's body might help their immune system control HIV better, even without HIV&#xD;
      medication called antiretroviral therapy or ART, if they get HIV. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the viral and immune system responses in an Analytical Treatment Interruption (ATI), in&#xD;
      participants who received VRC01 or placebo and got HIV while enrolled in HVTN 704/HPTN 085&#xD;
      (NCT02716675).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will stop taking their HIV medication. They will stay off HIV&#xD;
      medication unless and until the HIV levels in their blood show that their immune system is&#xD;
      unable to control the HIV or they meet other ART re-start criteria as noted in section&#xD;
      &quot;Detailed Description&quot;. While they are not taking HIV medication, their HIV levels will be&#xD;
      tested frequently, and their health will be monitored closely. This is called an analytical&#xD;
      treatment interruption, or an ATI. An ATI is an experimental procedure that is only used in&#xD;
      carefully monitored research.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate immunologic and virologic responses in an Analytical&#xD;
      Treatment Interruption (ATI), in participants who received VRC01 or placebo and got HIV while&#xD;
      enrolled in the HVTN 704/HPTN 085 Antibody-Mediated Prevention (AMP) Study (NCT02716675).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATI begins with the cessation of ART on Schedule 1 (Monitoring ATI). Participants on Schedule&#xD;
      1 will attend study visits every week for the first 8 weeks and at least every 2 weeks for&#xD;
      the next 16 weeks. After that, participants will attend study visits once a month for the&#xD;
      next 6 months, if their body is controlling their HIV without ART. Participants on Schedule 1&#xD;
      for more than a year will have visits every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants on Schedule 1 (Monitoring ATI), a confirmed VL ≥ 200 copies/mL will trigger&#xD;
      transition to Schedule 2 (ATI monitoring with viremia). Participants on Schedule 2 will&#xD;
      attend study visits every week for the first 8 weeks and at least every 2 weeks for the next&#xD;
      28 weeks. After that, participants will attend study visits once a month for the next 4&#xD;
      months, if their body is controlling their HIV without ART. Participants on Schedule 2 for&#xD;
      more than a year will have visits every 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants on Schedule 1 (Monitoring ATI), any of the following non-virologic criteria&#xD;
      will trigger re-initiation of ART and transition to Schedule 3 (Follow-up on ART) : confirmed&#xD;
      CD4+ T-cell count &lt; 350 cells/mm3, any HIV-related syndrome, pregnancy or breastfeeding, or&#xD;
      ART re-initiation requested by participant or if deemed medically necessary by primary HIV&#xD;
      provider or clinical research site Investigator of Record. Participants on Schedule 3 will&#xD;
      attend study visits every 2 weeks for the first 12 weeks, once a month for the next 16 weeks,&#xD;
      and on 2 occasions 3 months apart for the next 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants on Schedule 2 (ATI monitoring with viremia), the following virologic&#xD;
      criteria will trigger re-initiation of ART and transition to Schedule 3 (Follow-up on ART):&#xD;
      viral load remains ≥ 1,000 copies/mL for ≥ 4 consecutive weeks AND viral load has not dropped&#xD;
      0.5 log from the previous week (Week 0 - Week 24), confirmed viral load ≥ 200 copies/mL&#xD;
      (after Week 24). Or, the following non-virologic criteria will trigger re-initiation of ART&#xD;
      and transition from Schedule 2 (ATI monitoring with viremia) to Schedule 3 (Follow-up on&#xD;
      ART): confirmed CD4+ T-cell count &lt; 350 cells/mm3, any HIV-related syndrome, pregnancy or&#xD;
      breastfeeding, or ART re-initiation requested by participant or if deemed medically necessary&#xD;
      by primary HIV provider or clinical research site Investigator of Record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration is potentially indefinite for participants maintaining extreme and extended&#xD;
      viral control during ATI. Study duration for most participants is expected to be 13-18&#xD;
      months. The maximum anticipated duration for any participant is expected to be approximately&#xD;
      2 1/2 to 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits may include medical history review, physical exam, HIV testing, other STI testing&#xD;
      (blood, urine, and rectal and oral swab collection), blood draws, pregnancy testing for&#xD;
      participants assigned female sex at birth that can become pregnant, HIV transmission risk&#xD;
      reduction counseling, and interviews/questionnaires.&#xD;
