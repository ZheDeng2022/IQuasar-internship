  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a condition that affects women, usually during their reproductive years. In&#xD;
      women with endometriosis, the tissue that lines the uterus starts to grow outside of the&#xD;
      uterus. This can cause pain during their periods or during sex, and constant pain in the&#xD;
      pelvis. Endometriosis can decrease a woman's quality of life. It also requires long-term&#xD;
      treatment to control the symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, dienogest, has already been approved as a treatment for endometriosis.&#xD;
      Sometimes, researchers continue studying a treatment after it has been approved to learn more&#xD;
      about its safety. In this study, the researchers want to learn more about any medical&#xD;
      problems the patients have while taking dienogest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will include patients with endometriosis whose doctors have decided to start&#xD;
      treating them with dienogest. It will include about 160 women in India who are at least 18&#xD;
      years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the patients will take dienogest based on their doctor's instructions. They will then&#xD;
      visit their study site 3 times over 6 months. At these visits, their doctors will ask them&#xD;
      questions about how they are feeling and what medications they are taking. The doctors will&#xD;
      do tests to measure the pain caused by the patients' endometriosis and any other symptoms.&#xD;
      The doctors will also do physical examinations and check the patients' overall health.&#xD;
