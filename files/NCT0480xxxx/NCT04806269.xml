  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single center observational study to investigate the association between&#xD;
      biosignals from wearables and thyroid dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An algorithm to predict thyroid dysfunction using heart rate and activity data from wearables&#xD;
      was generated based on our previous clinical studies. This study was conducted to collect&#xD;
      more data to advance the algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with thyroid dysfunction including hypothyroidism and thyrotoxicosis were eligible&#xD;
      for this study. During the study period, each subject wears a smart band (Fitbit Inspire 2&#xD;
      TM) and gets 3 times of thyroid function tests with 1-month interval. Study participants will&#xD;
      use a mobile app (Glandy TM) to collect the symptom scores.&#xD;
