  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will investigate the effects of three surgical procedures and the&#xD;
      associated post-operative rehabilitation to optimize time to return to military duty, work&#xD;
      and sports, and patient-reported physical function for military personnel and civilians with&#xD;
      traumatic anterior shoulder instability and 10-20% glenoid bone loss.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this clinical trial is to determine the optimal surgical procedure and&#xD;
      post-operative rehabilitation strategy for treatment of military personnel and civilians with&#xD;
      shoulder instability and subcritical bone loss. Investigators will conduct a randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial comparing arthroscropic Bankart with remplissage/rehabilitation versus open&#xD;
      Bankart/rehabilitation versus Latarjet/rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: The investigators will determine the effects of arthroscopic Bankart repair with&#xD;
      remplissage of a Hill-Sachs lesion versus open Bankart versus Latarjet on patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes (Western Ontario Shoulder Instability score [WOSI]), time to Return to Duty/Activity&#xD;
      (RTD/A) at pre-injury levels, and recurrent instability/re-injury at 6 months, 1 and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The investigators will determine if participation in rehabilitation that optimizes&#xD;
      range of motion, strength, and functional performance predicts successful RTD/A, WOSI score,&#xD;
      and recurrent instability at 6 months, 1, and 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Male and female military personnel and civilians between the ages of 17&#xD;
      and 50 with a traumatic anterior shoulder dislocation with associated 10-20% glenoid bone&#xD;
      loss and plans to return to physically demanding work or sports, without multi-directional&#xD;
      instability, concomitant shoulder pathologies (e.g. rotator cuff tears, motor nerve lesion,&#xD;
      fractures, osteoarthritis &gt; Samilson Pietro grade 2), neuromuscular conditions including&#xD;
      seizures, a history of shoulder surgery related to any intraarticular soft tissue, and&#xD;
      vascular injury will be eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study / Experimental Design: Randomized controlled trial (Aim 1), Prospective cohort (Aim 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: 400 individuals will be randomized to arthroscopic Bankart with remplissage of a&#xD;
      Hill-Sachs lesion/rehabilitation vs. open Bankart/rehabilitation vs. open&#xD;
      Latarjet/rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address Aim 1, individuals with traumatic anterior shoulder instability with subcritical&#xD;
      bone loss will be randomized to arthroscopic Bankart repair with remplissageof a Hill-Sachs&#xD;
      lesion, or open Bankart, or Latarjet. To address Aim 2, all individuals will enter into&#xD;
      rehabilitation with specific instructions for the first 12 weeks dependent on the surgical&#xD;
      arm to which they are randomized. After week 12, all rehabilitation programs will be similar&#xD;
      and progressed based upon the results of interim testing at 3, 4, and 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 24 months, with primary outcomes consisting of&#xD;
      patient-reported physical function and time to return to pre-injury military duty, work and&#xD;
      sports. Secondary outcomes will include shoulder-specific and generic patient-reported&#xD;
      measures of physical function and health related quality of life and recurrent instability.&#xD;

    <description>The Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI) is an 18-item measure assessing the presence of medical comorbidities. The FCI is a self-administered report of medical comorbidities associated with physicla function. Using medical comorbidities is an important factor in creating risk adjustment models for orthopaedic trauma. The FCI was found to demonstrate a stronger association with the SF-36 physical function subscale (R2 = 0.29) than the Charleston (R2 = 0.18) and Kaplan-Feinstein (R2 = 0.17) indices. When individuals were classified into high and low function based ont he SF-36, the FCI correctly classified 77% of the cases.</description>

    <measure>Functional Comorbidity Index</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Comorbidity Index (FCI) is an 18-item measure assessing the presence of medical comorbidities. The FCI is a self-administered report of medical comorbidities associated with physicla function. Using medical comorbidities is an important factor in creating risk adjustment models for orthopaedic trauma. The FCI was found to demonstrate a stronger association with the SF-36 physical function subscale (R2 = 0.29) than the Charleston (R2 = 0.18) and Kaplan-Feinstein (R2 = 0.17) indices. When individuals were classified into high and low function based ont he SF-36, the FCI correctly classified 77% of the cases.</description>

    <ipd_description>A public-use version of the dataset will be constructed by the Data Coordinating Center (DCC) with contents to be determined jointly by the study PIs and the DCC Director. Copies of the public-use version of the dataset will be housed at the DCC on a secure server along with suitable documentation of this dataset. The public-use version of the dataset will be exported in one or more files in simple, widely-accessible formats, e.g., .xls, .csv, and/or Statistical Analysis Software (SAS) datasets. Documentation will be in .pdf files.</ipd_description>

    <ipd_time_frame>The public-use version of the dataset will be made available 2 years after the study's main paper is published.</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Outside investigators wishing to conduct analyses using the data will submit a request with objectives, methods, and analysis plan to the PI and the Director of the DCC. Once the request is approved, the public-use version of the dataset, with documentation, will be sent by secure email using e-mail, ftp, or other mutually agreeable transmission method.</ipd_access_criteria>
