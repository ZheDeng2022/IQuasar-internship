  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children with cerebral palsy, the interactions of the sensory systems, musculoskaletal&#xD;
      system and central nervous system are damaged. This situation plays an important role in the&#xD;
      realization of trunk control and upper extremity functions.When we look at the literature, it&#xD;
      was seen that upper extremity functions were associated with trunk control and oscillation,&#xD;
      and it was observed that upper extremity functions were improved in cases with increased&#xD;
      trunk control and balance.In the studies, it was concluded that increasing the trunk control&#xD;
      improves the static and dynamic balance.Ayres introduced the theory of sensory integrity in&#xD;
      the 1970s and defined sensory integration as &quot;the neurological process that organizes the&#xD;
      senses coming from the person's body and the environment and makes it possible to use the&#xD;
      body effectively in the environment&quot;.Sensory integration disorder is defined as the inability&#xD;
      of a person to use the information he / she receives through his / her senses properly in&#xD;
      order to continue his daily life properly.The incidence of sensory integration disorder in&#xD;
      children with motor dysfunction such as cerebral palsy and central nervous system involvement&#xD;
      is between 40 and 80%.In children with cerebral palsy, due to central nervous system damage,&#xD;
      posture problems, lack of movement and functional deficiencies, sensory problems that can&#xD;
      cause balance losses can be seen. When we look at the literature, it has been seen that there&#xD;
      are studies on balance, trunk control and upper extremity functions in children with cerebral&#xD;
      palsy, but among these studies, the inadequacy of studies that associate balance disorders&#xD;
      and trunk control with sensory integration therapy was observed.In this study, the effects of&#xD;
      sensory integration therapy on balance, trunk control and upper extremity functions in&#xD;
      children with cerebral palsy will be investigated.Pediatric Balance Scale, Trunk Control&#xD;
      Measurement Scale, Upper Extremity Skill Quality Scale will be used for balance assessment of&#xD;
      individuals with cerebral palsy participating in the study.The study was planned as a single&#xD;
      blind randomized control.Participants will be randomly divided into two groups, the control&#xD;
      group will be given balance exercises that are included in the standard physiotherapy&#xD;
      program, and the experimental group will be given sensory integration exercises for the&#xD;
      vestibular system in addition to standard physiotherapy programs.The treatment program to be&#xD;
      applied to both experimental and control groups will be carried out by a physiotherapist who&#xD;
      has 7 years of experience in pediatric physiotherapy and has 6 years of active sensory&#xD;
      integration therapy.Evaluations will be evaluated 3 times by a blinded physiotherapist&#xD;
      experienced in the field of pediatrics before, after treatment and 8 weeks after the late&#xD;
      period effects.&#xD;
