  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brain 18F-FDG PET (positron emission tomography) is recognised as having a good negative&#xD;
      predictive value in the search for a neurodegenerative origin of cognitive disorders. Indeed,&#xD;
      a ratio of 0.1 on the occurrence of worsening cognitive disorders has been reported in case&#xD;
      of normal brain FDG PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the risk of developing objective cognitive disorders in patients with no cognitive&#xD;
      complaints is estimated at 8% per year and the risk of developing dementia in patients with&#xD;
      mild cognitive disorders at 22% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cerebral 18F-FDG PET is a prognostic factor for the occurrence of unusual clinical&#xD;
      manifestations (MCI) or the conversion of MCI to Alzheimer's disease, but we do not really&#xD;
      know the impact on the longer term occurrence of cognitive impairment in patients with normal&#xD;
      cerebral 18F-FDG PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a longitudinal study will allow us to really know the true negative predictive value of&#xD;
      a normal 18F-FDG PET scan and the factors associated with a risk of dementia in these&#xD;
      subjects. This will allow us to better understand the prognostic impact of a normal brain&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET scan and to identify a sub-population that remains at risk, including in the case&#xD;
      of normal brain 18F-FDG PET.&#xD;

      Brain 18F-FDG PET is known to have a good negative predictive value in the search for a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative origin to cognitive disorders. Indeed, a ratio of 0.1 on the occurrence of&#xD;
      worsening cognitive disorders has been reported in case of normal brain FDG PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in patients without cognitive complaints, the risk of developing objective cognitive&#xD;
      impairment is estimated to be 8% per year and the risk of developing dementia in patients&#xD;
      with mild cognitive impairment 22% per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain 18F-FDG PET is a prognostic factor for the occurrence of MCI or for the conversion of&#xD;
      MCI to Alzheimer's disease , but we do not really know the impact on the longer-term&#xD;
      occurrence of cognitive impairment in patients with a normal brain 18F-FDG PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it is commonly accepted that a normal brain 18F-FDG PET scan can rule out a&#xD;
      neurodegenerative origin for cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the detection sensitivity of brain 18F-FDG PET is about 90% . Furthermore, we do not&#xD;
      know the pathophysiological factors that cause false negative PET scans and it would be&#xD;
      interesting to study them (age, sex, medical history, results of neuropsychological tests,&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on subjects available freely on the internet, an American team showed that brain&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET was predictive of cognitive decline in subjects with no or minor cognitive&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a longitudinal study will allow to really know the true negative predictive value of a&#xD;
      normal 18F-FDG PET scan and the factors associated with a risk of dementia in these subjects.&#xD;
      This will allow us to better understand the prognostic impact of a normal brain 18F-FDG PET&#xD;
      scan and to identify a subpopulation that remains at risk, including in case of normal brain&#xD;
      18F-FDG PET.&#xD;
