    <textblock>
      The VICTOR study plans to include rural communities served by Colorado Heart Healthy&#xD;
      Solutions (CHHS) program and find out whether participants will accept a referral to a&#xD;
      comprehensive virtual lifestyle intervention, Virta Health. The Virta Health program induces&#xD;
      nutritional ketosis to improve glucose control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The study&#xD;
      will inform the acceptability of the referral, the retention of participants in lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention, and the durability of effects on glucose control after the lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention has ended.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In rural communities served by Colorado Heart Healthy Solutions (CHHS), referral to a&#xD;
      comprehensive remotely-delivered (virtual) continuous remote care to induce nutritional&#xD;
      ketosis combined with remote medication management will improve glycemic control in patients&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes as compared with standard care. The study intervention is the referral.&#xD;
      Subjects are not mandated to receive Virta treatment and are welcome to continue in the study&#xD;
      whether or not the referral is accepted. 2 rural communities served by CHHS have been chosen&#xD;
      as recruitment sites. Study patients will be randomized at the site level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: To assess glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes living in a rural&#xD;
      community referred to a comprehensive remotely-delivered continuous remote care to induce&#xD;
      nutritional ketosis combined with remote medication management (termed &quot;continuous remote&#xD;
      care&quot;) as compared with those living in a rural community offered standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effects of referral to continuous remote care as compared with standard&#xD;
           care on body weight and on body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the effects of referral to continuous remote care as compared with standard&#xD;
           care on number and doses of anti-hyperglycemic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the durability of a continuous remote care intervention when paired with&#xD;
           ongoing community health worker support&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exploratory:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the effects of referral to continuous remote care as compared with standard&#xD;
           care on LDL-cholesterol, fasting glucose, and fasting triglyceride/HDL-cholesterol ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess patient-reported outcomes of continuous remote care as compared with standard&#xD;
           care&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To determine enrollment rate (offered vs accepted) in patients with type 2 diabetes&#xD;
           living in rural communities referred to continuous remote care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To determine active engagement (number, timing, and types of 2-way contacts) and&#xD;
           retention in patients with type 2 diabetes living in rural communities referred to&#xD;
           continuous remote care.&#xD;
