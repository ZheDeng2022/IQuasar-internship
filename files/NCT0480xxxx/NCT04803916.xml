  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a consequence of chronic relapsing inflammation in Crohn's disease (CD), progressive bowel&#xD;
      damage and scarring occurs in affected regions of intestine. This damage often leads to&#xD;
      narrowing, or stricturing of the bowel lumen, and even complete bowel obstruction.&#xD;
      Stricturing CD is thought to be a major contributor to penetrating complications including&#xD;
      abscesses and fistulae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the severity and clinical significance of fixed strictures, treatment options&#xD;
      include either endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD), or surgery with either resection or&#xD;
      stricturoplasty recommended on a case-by-case basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBD has been shown to be a safe alternative to surgery in management of CD strictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the short- and medium-term clinical outcomes of EBD have been well described, less well&#xD;
      studied is the impact of relieving Crohn's strictures on the inflammatory load proximal to&#xD;
      the stricture. The restricted flow of fecal contents through a stricture creates a region of&#xD;
      relative stasis in the bowel loops immediately proximal to the stricture, appreciated at&#xD;
      times by pre-stenotic dilatation on cross-sectional imaging. This stasis fosters localized&#xD;
      bacterial overgrowth and worsening dysbiosis in these bowel loops.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that improvement of fecal flow by way of successful balloon&#xD;
      dilatation of a CD stricture, could independently reduce the inflammatory burden, not only in&#xD;
      the stenotic segment but also in the proximal loop of bowel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, observational study will include both pediatric and adult patients with&#xD;
      stricturing CD on stable therapy who are planned to undergo EBD for management of a Crohn's&#xD;
      stricture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients are those in whom the treating physician is planning a colonoscopic EBD for&#xD;
      a CD stricture. Patients will be followed with imaging, clinical assessment, serologic&#xD;
      testing, stool microbiome and endoscopic assessment at time of EBD, and post-EBD. EBD will be&#xD;
      performed to a target dilatation size of 18-20mm. If the stricture is deemed too narrow to&#xD;
      allow dilatation to target size in a single session, graduated dilatations at a number of&#xD;
      sessions can be undertaken at the treating clinician discretion. Time-point of week 0 will be&#xD;
      defined as achievement of dilatation target size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment, blood and stool for calprotectin and microbiome, and focused bowel US to&#xD;
      be performed within a 4 week period prior to EBD. Previous imaging (US/MRE/CTE) from 2-4&#xD;
      months prior to EBD, where performed, will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of any contra-indication, repeat colonoscopy will be performed at week 12 (±2&#xD;
      weeks) to assess stricture size and assess extent of mucosal inflammation at the stricture&#xD;
      site and the pre-stenotic region. Follow-up clinical review with repeat blood tests, stool&#xD;
      for calprotectin and microbiome and focused bowel US will also be performed at week 12 (±2&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic images from pre-stenotic bowel loop and bowel US from week 0 and week 12 will be&#xD;
      centrally read by two central readers blinded to the patient and stage. An average of&#xD;
      pre-stenotic region SES-CD score and US-derived outcome measures from both readers will be&#xD;
      recorded. Where available, imaging from 2-4 months pre-EBD, either US, MRE or CTE, will be&#xD;
      assessed by the same central readers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in whom successful balloon dilatation was achieved (see definitions below) will be&#xD;
      included in the primary analysis. Patients in whom dilatation was attempted but was not&#xD;
      successful (see below) will also be followed and will be analyzed as control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's medications are to remain unchanged throughout the follow-up period, including&#xD;
      biologic type or dose, or addition of corticosteroids/nutritional therapy, unless the&#xD;
      treating physician decides otherwise on clinical grounds, in which case the patient will be&#xD;
      defaulted from analysis. Patients on corticosteroid or nutritional therapy at recruitment can&#xD;
      continue to wean therapy as per clinician directive.&#xD;
