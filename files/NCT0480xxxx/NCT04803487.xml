      Objective: To determine whether the newly developed Chinese Micro Hand S surgical robot&#xD;
      results in non-inferiority outcomes in cholecystectomy compared with the prevalent da Vinci&#xD;
      robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A single-blinded, prospective randomized parallel controlled clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed and conducted from December 2019 to November 2020. The study was conducted in an&#xD;
      academic hospital. 82 patients with a gallstone, gallbladder polyp and other benign&#xD;
      gallbladder diseases were enrolled in this study. Finally, 82 patients were randomly divided&#xD;
      into the Micro Hand S surgical robot group and the da Vinci surgical robot group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Standard robot-assisted transabdominal cholecystectomy was conducted using the&#xD;
      Micro Hand S robot or the da Vinci robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcomes and measures: The main outcome was the success rate of operation. Surgical&#xD;
      success was defined as that the surgical procedures were completed by the experimental or&#xD;
      control product without transferring to non-robotic surgery. Secondary outcomes included&#xD;
      assembly time, operation time, intraoperative hemorrhage, time to first flatus, postoperative&#xD;
      pain, comprehensive complication index, resident time and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholecystectomy is one of the most common operations in general surgery, with about half a&#xD;
      million patients getting cholecystectomy each year in the United States. In the 1990s,&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery (MIS), as a new technology, greatly improved the traditional open&#xD;
      abdominal surgery, of which defects are known as the big wound and long time to recover.&#xD;
      Today, nearly 90% of cholecystectomy are performed laparoscopically. Previous studies have&#xD;
      shown that laparoscopic cholecystectomy may reduce postoperative pain, shorten the hospital&#xD;
      stay, and save the overall cost in hospital, which has become the standard operation for the&#xD;
      treatment of gallbladder disease. In recent years, robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery has&#xD;
      become more and more widely used in general surgery because of its advantages of 3D visions,&#xD;
      high magnification, tremor suppression, and precise manipulation. According to a reported&#xD;
      retrospective study, the da Vinci robot-assisted cholecystectomy showed excellent operation&#xD;
      security, which can achieve the same therapeutic effect as the conventional laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy. But studies also reported that the increased cost may be the main problem of&#xD;
      the da Vinci robot-assisted cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Micro Hand S surgical robot is a new generation of Chinese independently developed&#xD;
      surgical robot system. Apart from the flexibility and intelligence in operation manipulation,&#xD;
      the Micro Hand S surgical robot also has the advantages of small size, portable equipment,&#xD;
      low maintenance costs and outstanding equipment compatibility. After initial preclinical&#xD;
      trials, the Micro Hand S surgical robot has been successfully applied in clinic, and proved&#xD;
      security and feasibility in various gastrointestinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2019, investigators in this group have designed and taken up research to assist&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy with the Micro Hand S surgical robot, which is noted as a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, single-blind, and parallel controlled clinical trial. The primary&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine whether the newly developed Chinese Micro Hand S&#xD;
      surgical robot results in non-inferiority outcomes in cholecystectomy compared with the&#xD;
      prevalent da Vinci robot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was designed as a single-blind prospective randomized clinical trial since it is&#xD;
      inevitable for the surgeon to know what kind of robot to use during the operation. After&#xD;
      obtaining the approval of the Ethics Review Committee and other relevant institutions of the&#xD;
      Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University, a total of 82 patients were included in this study&#xD;
      from December 2019 to November 2020. Finally, 82 patients were randomly divided into the&#xD;
      Micro Hand S robot group and the da Vinci robot group. All enrolled patients were fully&#xD;
      informed and signed the informed consent. Patients were randomly assigned to each group in a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio, and information of the grouping and intervention measures were not available to&#xD;
      patients. Patients of each group were matched for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and&#xD;
      complications to reduce confounding intervention factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient was placed in the supine position after general anesthesia. The Veress needle was&#xD;
      inserted at 2cm below the umbilicus (point A) to establish the CO2 artificial&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum. A 12mm trocar was inserted into the abdominal cavity and the&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum tube was connected to the trocar. The intra-abdominal pressure was set at&#xD;
      11-13mmHg, and then the preheated three-dimensional laparoscope and cold-light source were&#xD;
      placed into the abdominal cavity through the trocar. Then a thorough examination was taken on&#xD;
      the intended trocar points and the surgical area. After adjusting the patient with a&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position inclined to the left, 10.5mm magnetic trocars were respectively placed&#xD;
      at 2-3cm medial side of the right anterior axillary line, 8-10cm below the costal margin&#xD;
      (point B); and 2-3cm below the costal margin of the left mid-clavicular line (point C); and&#xD;
      were connected to the robotic arms No. 1 and 2. Besides, a 10mm trocar were placed at point D&#xD;
      (lateral inferior of the line connecting point A and C) as the auxiliary channel. The surgeon&#xD;
      held the neck of the gallbladder or Hartmann's Pouch with bipolar forceps, and pulled the&#xD;
      neck to the right upper to open the serosal layer of the cystic duct. The cystic duct and the&#xD;
      cystic artery were then separated by blunt dissection so as to distinguish the common bile&#xD;
      duct, hepatic common bile duct, and cystic duct. Clamp and cut off the cystic duct near the&#xD;
      gallbladder's neck with a Hemo-lock clamp. The cystic artery was found medial posterior side&#xD;
      of the cystic duct. Clamp and cut off the cystic artery with Hemo-lock clamp. Pull the&#xD;
      gallbladder's neck upward and remove the gallbladder by anterograde resection with an&#xD;
      ultrasonic knife. The assistant assisted in dragging the gallbladder and the liver bed to&#xD;
      keep a certain tension. The intact gallbladder was put into the specimen bag and removed.&#xD;
      Bleeding and bile leakage was carefully checked, and the gallbladder bed was coagulated. The&#xD;
      operating instruments were withdrawn from the patient's abdominal cavity after checking the&#xD;
      instruments and the gauze. The pneumoperitoneum was exsufflated and the incisions were&#xD;
      closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, the assembly time, intraoperative blood loss, operation time, operation&#xD;
      success rate, and the adjacent organ and vascular injury caused by the failure of the tested&#xD;
      system were recorded. Pain score was analyzed 24±2 hours after the surgery. The vital signs&#xD;
      (temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure) were measured on the 3rd day&#xD;
      postoperatively. Meanwhile, the routine blood test (red blood cells, white blood cells and&#xD;
      neutrophils, platelet, hemoglobin), liver and renal function (ALT, AST, TP, ALB, GLU, TBIL,&#xD;
      BUN, and CREA), the electrolyte (K, Na, Cl, Ca), blood sugar, and color ultrasound of liver,&#xD;
      gallbladder, pancreas and spleen were checked. Operating surgeons filled in the satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire postoperatively. Furthermore, the patients' postoperative condition changes,&#xD;
      postoperative medication, the first postoperative anal exhaust, postoperative complications,&#xD;
      and resident time were also recorded. All the patients were followed up by telephone at 30±5&#xD;
      days postoperatively to evaluate the incidncee of adverse events.&#xD;
