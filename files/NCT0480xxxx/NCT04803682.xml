    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies how well A Smoking Prevention Interactive Experience&#xD;
      (ASPIRE) program and mentorship works in preventing smoking in high school students. ASPIRE&#xD;
      is an online-based, youth-centered tobacco prevention and cessation program. The goal of this&#xD;
      research study is to learn if training eleventh grade high school students to be tobacco-free&#xD;
      role models and mentors for ninth grade high school students is possible and will positively&#xD;
      influence the younger peers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of training selected eleventh grade high school student&#xD;
      volunteers to provide an intervention involving mentoring combined with social support&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To increase ninth grade high school student well-being, which would ultimately influence&#xD;
      tobacco related knowledge and resistance skills regarding tobacco uptake among ninth grade&#xD;
      high school program participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Mentor ability, confidence, and intention (ACI) to address tobacco use and dependence and&#xD;
      providing anti-tobacco advice to mentees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the scores on mentoring competencies. III. To determine the influences of&#xD;
      social support and self-esteem by mentors. IV. To determine the quality and satisfaction with&#xD;
      the relationships among mentors and mentees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine level of knowledge about nicotine and tobacco products among mentees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To determine susceptibility to tobacco use among non-smokers. VII. To determine&#xD;
      progression through stages of change among smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete online ASPIRE course over 3.5-4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIGH SCHOOL MENTORS: Eleventh grade high school students receive mentor training over 4-5&#xD;
      hours on how to mentor ninth grade students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL STUDENTS: Mentors and mentees are paired up so that eleventh grade high school students&#xD;
      mentor the ninth grade high school students over 30 minutes for 7 sessions about the&#xD;
      different types of tobacco products (such as cigarettes, cigars, hookah, and so on) and the&#xD;
      dangers of these products.&#xD;
