    <textblock>
      This study assesses to determine the most effective type of device on the degree of&#xD;
      satisfaction of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for managing oral self-biting&#xD;
      injuries. Thirty-one patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis will wear two devices, a&#xD;
      hard occlusal splint (HOS) and a flexible customized mouthguard (FCM), for two weeks each&#xD;
      one. The sequence will be randomized to obtain one-half of the participants starting the&#xD;
      first week wearing the HOS, and the other half wearing the FCM. The participants will rate&#xD;
      the degree of satisfaction with the device and the degree of improvement or worsening of oral&#xD;
      self-biting injuries in a 10-point scale. They will also rate the degree of change in their&#xD;
      quality of life because of changes in their oral self-biting injuries. Finally they will rate&#xD;
      the compliance and report the adverse effects.&#xD;

      This crossover intervention study aims to assess the most effective type of device on the&#xD;
      degree of satisfaction of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis for managing oral&#xD;
      self-biting injuries. Thirty-one patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosed in the&#xD;
      ALS Functional Unit at Bellvitge University Hospital will participate in this randomized&#xD;
      crossover trial. Two devices will be prepared for each patient, a hard occlusal splint (HOS)&#xD;
      and a flexible customized mouthguard (FCM). They will wear one type of device for the first&#xD;
      two weeks, followed by a week off, and the other type of device for the fourth and fifth&#xD;
      week. The sequence will be randomized to obtain one-half of the participants starting the&#xD;
      first week wearing the HOS, and the other half wearing the FCM. The participants will rate&#xD;
      the degree of satisfaction with the device in a 10-point scale, considering 0 extremely&#xD;
      dissatisfied and 10 completely satisfied, and the degree of improvement or worsening of oral&#xD;
      self-biting injuries, considering 0 an extreme worsening and 10 completely improved. They&#xD;
      will also rate the degree of change in their quality of life (nothing, a bit, quite, a lot)&#xD;
      because of changes in their oral self-biting injuries. Finally they will rate the compliance&#xD;
      as the percentage of time the device was used with respect to the recommended time and report&#xD;
      the adverse effects (excessive salivation, dry mouth, tooth pain, mucosal irritation,&#xD;
      temporomandibular joint (TMJ) pain, TMJ sounds, bite change, other).&#xD;
