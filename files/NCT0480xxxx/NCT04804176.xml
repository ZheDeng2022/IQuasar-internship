  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is the second most common chronic neurodegenerative disease.At present,&#xD;
      researchers focus not only on the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but also on the&#xD;
      non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (including mood disorders, sleep disorders,&#xD;
      cognitive decline, and autonomic nervous kinetic disorder, etc.).The principle of&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation is based on the electromagnetic principle proposed by&#xD;
      Faraday. When an electrifying coil is suspended over the scalp at a certain distance, the&#xD;
      magnetic field generated by the coil current and the electric field generated by the magnetic&#xD;
      field can reach the skull and directly or indirectly affect the synapses and neurons in the&#xD;
      brain.The study by giving a sleep disorder Parkinson's disease patients with different&#xD;
      patterns of ultra-low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation or sham stimulation, scale&#xD;
      for assessment of the patients were observed, hematology and imaging changes before and after&#xD;
      therapy, clear ultra-low frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation for sleep disorder&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease treatment, to explore the mechanism of action, compare the difference&#xD;
      between different modes.&#xD;

    <description>It plays an important role in central nervous system diseases. In PD, the increase of IL-6 is the body's self-defense mechanism to protect neurons, and the change of IL-6 in peripheral blood can reflect the change of injury aggravation and recovery.It is also associated with psychiatric symptoms, and IL-6 is elevated in major depression.</description>
