  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The European database ESADA, containing data from more than 30,000 patients with very&#xD;
      different severities of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, prospectively collects data&#xD;
      from patients referred to academic sleep laboratories in many European countries&#xD;
      (https://esada.med.gu.se/). Since 2007, Grenoble is one of the two French centers with Paris&#xD;
      and is a very active participant in this European database for patient inclusion and data&#xD;
      exploitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the &quot;ESADA Follow-up and outcomes&quot; project is to collect&#xD;
      cardiovascular events during the follow-up of patients in the European database through&#xD;
      telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire. Other objectives are to collect&#xD;
      metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths in the same population using the same mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional objective is to assess the impact of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP,&#xD;
      the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence of cardiovascular and metabolic events and&#xD;
      incident cancers, as this is still discussed in the literature.&#xD;

      The European database ESADA prospectively collects data from patients referred to academic&#xD;
      sleep laboratories in many European countries (https://esada.med.gu.se/). Since 2007,&#xD;
      Grenoble is one of the two French centers with Paris and is a very active participant in this&#xD;
      European database for patient inclusion and data exploitation. A partnership agreement exists&#xD;
      between University Hospital Grenoble (CHUGA) and ESADA for the reuse of CHUGA data. The data&#xD;
      collected at CHUGA as part of the ESADA-Follow-up and outcomes questionnaire are also&#xD;
      collected in the other European centers and will be centralized at the level of the&#xD;
      coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESADA currently contains data from more than 30,000 patients with very different severities&#xD;
      of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome. One of the main limitations of this cohort is the&#xD;
      relatively limited amount of information concerning the long-term follow-up of the patients&#xD;
      included in the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first objective of the &quot;ESADA Follow-up and outcomes&quot; project is to collect&#xD;
      cardiovascular events during the follow-up of patients in the European database through&#xD;
      telephone interviews and a structured questionnaire. Other objectives are to collect&#xD;
      metabolic events, incident cancers and deaths in the same population using the same mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional objective at the end of this data collection is to aggregate the follow-up data&#xD;
      of more than 10,000 patients from all participating European centers to assess the impact of&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP, the reference treatment for OSA) on the occurrence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular and metabolic events and incident cancers, as this is still discussed in&#xD;
      the literature.&#xD;
