      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate upper extremity exercise capacity, muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation, balance and physical activity level in patients with cystic fibrosis.. The&#xD;
      secondary aim of the study is assessment of functional exercise capacity, respiratory&#xD;
      function, peripheral and respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with cystic fibrosis and compare them with healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease. Although it is a monogenetic&#xD;
      type of disease, its phenotype varies widely. CF is characterized by progressive lung&#xD;
      disease, malabsorption of fat and protein, fatty stools, pancreatic insufficiency resulting&#xD;
      in gastrointestinal malabsorption, intestinal abnormalities resulting in malnutrition, growth&#xD;
      retardation, sinusitis, and diabetes. The most important problems seen in patients are&#xD;
      excessive secretion, decreased exercise capacity, dyspnea and muscle strength loss. Exercise&#xD;
      capacity, respiratory functions, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, respiratory&#xD;
      muscle endurance, balance, physical activity, quality of life are poor in cystic fibrosis&#xD;
      patients.There are insufficient studies on this subject in the literature. The number of&#xD;
      studies using objective method is few. Cystic fibrosis patients have upper extremity muscle&#xD;
      weakness. There is no study on the evaluation of upper extremity exercise capacity in these&#xD;
      patients in the literature. Even if patients with CF have normal pulmonary function test&#xD;
      results, there are studies showing that exercise intolerance has developed. These reasons&#xD;
      have revealed the need to investigate oxygen metabolism at the cellular level.There are only&#xD;
      two studies in the literature evaluating muscle oxygenation in patients with cystic fibrosis.&#xD;
      There is no study evaluating with a &quot;Moxy&quot; monitor.The primary aim of the study is to&#xD;
      evaluate upper extremity exercise capacity, muscle oxygenation, balance and physical activity&#xD;
      level in patients with cystic fibrosis.. The secondary aim of the study is assessment of&#xD;
      functional exercise capacity, respiratory function, peripheral and respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, respiratory muscle endurance, quality of life in patients with cystic fibrosis and&#xD;
      compare them with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was planned cross-sectional. At least 30 cystic fibrosis patients and 30 age- and&#xD;
      sex-matched healthy controls will be included in the study. Individuals' exercise capacity,&#xD;
      respiratory functions, physical activity levels, balance assessments, peripheral and&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, respiratory muscle endurance, muscle oxygenation and quality of&#xD;
      life will be evaluated. Upper extremity exercise capacity will be assessed using six minute&#xD;
      pegboard ring test, functional exercise capacity using six minute walk test, muscle&#xD;
      oxygenation using &quot;Moxy&quot; monitor, balance using &quot;Biodex Balance System®&quot; and Y balance test,&#xD;
      physical activity using multi-sensor activity monitor, pulmonary function using spirometry,&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength using mouth pressure device, peripheral muscle strength using&#xD;
      hand held dynamometer, respiratory muscle endurance using incremental threshold loading test,&#xD;
      life quality using &quot;The Revised Cystic Fibrosis Questionnaire (CFQ-R)&quot; (Turkish version). The&#xD;
      assessments will be completed in two days.&#xD;

During the test, the number of breaths delivered and the maximal time reached during each 2-minute period will be recorded. If the individual cannot breathe 3 consecutive times, the test will be terminated by the physiotherapist. The total duration of the test and the maximum pressure value at which it continues to breathe for at least 1 minute will be multiplied. The value found will be recorded as the respiratory muscle endurance value.</description>

There are four CFQ-R questionnaires for patients of three different age groups (6-10, 12-13, and 14 years and older). The CFQ-R children's version consists of 35 questions. Scale subtitles; It consists of physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning, body ımage, eating disorders, treatment burden, and respiratory and digestive symptoms. Items for child CFQ-R are rated according to a 4-point scale. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
