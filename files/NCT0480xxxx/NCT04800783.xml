  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Swallowing disorders management requires an accurate recognition of implicated anatomical&#xD;
      structures and pathways. The usual clinical assessment of swallowing disorders lacks&#xD;
      reliability and accuracy. The gold standard remains the videofluoroscopy. However, this&#xD;
      imaging technique lacks reliability and standardisation. Moreover, videofluoroscopy is not&#xD;
      easily available, time and material consuming and exposes patients to ionisation. Ultrasound&#xD;
      imaging, which can be performed at the patient's bedside, is a non-invasive tool. It allows&#xD;
      the evaluation of the main structures involved in all the swallowing pathways and may be a&#xD;
      promising tool to assess the swallowing disorders. An ultrasound predictive model has never&#xD;
      been developed to diagnose swallowing disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to develop an ultrasound predictive model to diagnose swallowing&#xD;
      disorders, and assess its reliability and accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred outpatients at risk of swallowing disorders (neck cancer, neurological diseases,&#xD;
      previous ICU stay) will be enrolled in the Dysphagia Diagnostic Unit at the Forcilles'&#xD;
      Hospital, during a 2-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo a clinical examination by a speech-language therapist, and a&#xD;
      videofluoroscopy imaging in order to diagnose swallowing disorders. Then, an ultrasound&#xD;
      examination will be performed by the ultrasonographer. The ultrasonographer will be blinded&#xD;
      from the patient's status and previous clinical and imaging assessments. Severity of the&#xD;
      swallowing disorder will be assessed by the Dysphagia Outcome and Severity Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tongue kinetics and thickness, the laryngeal movement and the suprahyoid muscles&#xD;
      thickness and echogenicity will be assessed by ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter- and intra-reliability of ultrasound examination will be calculated. The threshold of&#xD;
      each ultrasound measurement allowing the swallowing disorders will be estimated using the ROC&#xD;
      curve analysis. Sensitivity and specificity of each ultrasound measurement will be estimated.&#xD;
      A global ultrasound predictive model will be developed after selecting variables in logistic&#xD;
      multivariable regression. Diagnostic accuracy of the global predictive model will also be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope a high reliability and accuracy of the ultrasound predictive model in&#xD;
      the swallowing disorders diagnostic. As ultrasonography is easy-to-perform, rapidly&#xD;
      available, non-invasive and inexpensive, it may be a valuable alternative to videofluoroscopy&#xD;
      in swallowing disorder diagnostic.&#xD;

      available, non-invasive and inexpensive, it may be a valuable alternative to videofluoroscopy&#xD;
      in swallowing disorders diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Hypothesis The investigators hypothesise that a new ultrasound predictive model is valid&#xD;
           and reliable to diagnose swallowing disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To create a new ultrasound predictive model based on the most relevant ultrasound&#xD;
           measurements of the swallowing structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the accuracy of the ultrasound predictive model in the swallowing&#xD;
                disorders diagnostic;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the inter- and intra-reliability of the ultrasound measurements;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To assess the accuracy of each ultrasound measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The prospective observational single-centre study will be performed per the ethical&#xD;
           standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and will be reported according to the&#xD;
           Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           One hundred outpatients at risk of swallowing disorders (neck cancer, neurological&#xD;
           diseases, previous ICU stay) will be enrolled in the Dysphagia Diagnostic Unit at the&#xD;
           Forcilles' Hospital, during a 2-year period. All consecutive patients will be screened&#xD;
           at hospital admission, and will be included if they satisfy the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
           All patients will provide oral consent to participate, in accordance with the clinical&#xD;
           research French laws. Duration of the patient's participation will take 3 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Data collection Data will be recorded using a local case report form. Demographic data,&#xD;
           comorbidities, medical and surgical history, reason for swallowing assessment will be&#xD;
           recorded at inclusion. Clinical, videofluoroscopy and ultrasound measurements will also&#xD;
           be recorded. On-site monitoring is planned every month.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will first undergo an ultrasound examination, then the clinical examination&#xD;
           and videofluoroscopy imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Ultrasound examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasonography will be performed using a Sonosite E2 Expert ultrasound device (Digital&#xD;
           Color Doppler Ultrasound System; Sonoscape medical corp. China) with a 7-10 MHz linear&#xD;
           and a 3-5 MHz probes. Detailed information for ultrasound procedure is described in the&#xD;
           research protocol. Ultrasonography will be performed with the patients in near-to-supine&#xD;
           position (30°).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hyoid bone movement, tongue kinetics and geniohyoid muscle measurement will be&#xD;
           performed in a sagittal plane with the curvilinear probe. The probe will be placed&#xD;
           between the posterior border of the symphysis and the anterior margin of the hyoid bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The anterior belly of digastric and geniohyoid muscles evaluation will be performed in a&#xD;
           frontal plane with the linear probe. The probe will be placed in the submandibular area,&#xD;
           behind the symphysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasonographer will be blinded from all patients' status and previous examination.&#xD;
           Reliability will be assessed in the first twenty participants. All ultrasound&#xD;
           measurements will be repeated twice by the first ultrasonographer to assess the&#xD;
           intra-operator reliability. A second ultrasound operator will perform all the ultrasound&#xD;
           measurement, allowing the inter-operator reliability evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Videofluoroscopy (VFSS):&#xD;
&#xD;
           VFSS is a radiographic procedure that provides a direct, dynamic view of oral,&#xD;
           pharyngeal, and upper oesophageal function during swallowing. The radiologist and SLP&#xD;
           work as a team to follow a standard protocol for conducting this examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           During this procedure, the speech-language therapist presents food and fluid mixed with&#xD;
           barium. The barium is necessary to view structures via videofluoroscopy during the&#xD;
           swallow. The following procedure will be followed: 5 ml of thin fluid; 5 ml of&#xD;
           ultra-thick liquid; 5 ml of solid aliment, then 30 ml of thin fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The VFSS allow the assessment of the characteristics of the swallow and the patterns of&#xD;
           bolus movement, including initiation of the swallow, nasopharyngeal reflux, pharyngeal&#xD;
           clearance, and laryngeal penetration and aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At any time, the radiologist may not initiate or stop the examination if it may be&#xD;
           harmful to the patient. The reason to stop the test will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In case of penetration or aspiration, the speech language therapist will use the&#xD;
           'Penetration-Aspiration Scale'.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous variables will be expressed as the mean (± standard deviation) and compared&#xD;
           using the Student's t test if the null hypothesis is not rejected by the Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
           test. Continuous variables will be expressed as the median (interquartile range) and&#xD;
           compared with the Mann-Whitney U or Kruskal-Wallis test if the null hypothesis is&#xD;
           rejected by the Shapiro-Wilk test. For categorical variables, the proportions of&#xD;
           patients in each category will be calculated. Then the groups will be compared using Chi&#xD;
           squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Continuous ultrasound variables will be dichotomised or grouped by class, depending on&#xD;
           the linear relation between the logit of the swallowing disorder diagnostic and the&#xD;
           ultrasound variable. The threshold for continuous ultrasound variables will be&#xD;
           calculated with the ROC curve analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A multivariate logistic regression model will be carried out to assess the relation&#xD;
           between swallowing disorders and ultrasound measures associated in univariate analyses.&#xD;
           All statistically significant ultrasound variables will be included in the model.&#xD;
           Variable selection will be stepwise, based on Akaike Information Criterion. To check&#xD;
           multicollinearity between independent variables, the variance inflation factor will be&#xD;
           calculated before performing multivariate logistic regression. Multicollinearity will be&#xD;
           regarded as present when the variance inflation factor is &gt; 5. Goodness of fit will be&#xD;
           assessed by Hosmer-Lemeshow method.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The outcome of each ultrasound variable from the multivariable logistic regression will&#xD;
           be used to weight it in the global ultrasound predictive model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intra- and inter-operator reliability will be assessed using the kappa coefficient for&#xD;
           categorical variables or intra-class coefficients for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For all tests, a p-value ≤ 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. All&#xD;
           statistical analysis will be made using R software (version 3.6.1, www.R-project.org).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators based the sample size calculation on the number of independent variables&#xD;
      which will be included in the logistic multivariable regression model. The investigators use&#xD;
      the criterion of one variable per 10 events for binary logistic regression analysis. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to include the 5 most relevant ultrasound measures in the model. As&#xD;
      prevalence of swallowing disorders in our unit is estimated at 0.5, the investigators plan a&#xD;
      sample size of 100 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability will be assessed on the first 20 patients. With an 80% predicted kappa, a minimal&#xD;
      value of the kappa of 50%, 2 observations, a 95% certainty and a 80% power, 20 patients will&#xD;
      be required.&#xD;
