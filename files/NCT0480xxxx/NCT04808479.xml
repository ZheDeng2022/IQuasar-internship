  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to examine the effectiveness of imFREE relative to mHealth ED in&#xD;
      facilitating treatment retention and adherence and reducing opioid use among adults with OUD&#xD;
      initiating BUP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two specific aims: (1) to test the effectiveness of imFREE, delivered in&#xD;
      conjunction with medical management with buprenorphine (imFREE + MM), relative to mHealth ED&#xD;
      + MM, in facilitating buprenorphine treatment retention and adherence in a population of&#xD;
      individuals with OUD initiating MM (N=200). (2) To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of imFREE.&#xD;

    <description>The imFREE condition is a 32-week tailored, interactive text messaging intervention targeting buprenorphine treatment retention and adherence as well as opioid use and associated health consequences. Following a face-to-face CBT session with a clinician, participants receive CBT skills training via daily text messaging, with content themes around relapse prevention, adherence behaviors, and personalized plans to overcome risk factors for treatment discontinuation.</description>

    <description>The mHealth condition will provide participants with a manualized health psychoeducation session of equivalent duration to the face-to-face CBT session delivered to imFREE participants. Content focuses on various dimensions of health and well-being. Subsequent to this session participants will receive an informational pamphlet regarding BUP and the importance of adherence. the mHealth component of the intervention comprises text reminders for scheduled MM appointments.</description>
