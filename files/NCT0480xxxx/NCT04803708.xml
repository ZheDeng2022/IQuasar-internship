      This is a Phase I/IIa trial designed to evaluate topical bacteriophage therapy in patients&#xD;
      with diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of a topical bacteriophage&#xD;
      cocktail in the treatment of non infected and infected diabetic foot ulcers with Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and/or Acinetobacter baumanni. Patients will also be&#xD;
      evaluated for bacterial clearance and wound reduction.&#xD;
