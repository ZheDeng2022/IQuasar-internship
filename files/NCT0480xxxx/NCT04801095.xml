    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, and dose-expansion study of&#xD;
      WM-S1-030 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      in 2 parts; a dose-escalation phase (Part 1) and a dose-expansion phase (Part 2). Part 1 will&#xD;
      investigate oral administration of WM-S1-030 as monotherapy. Once the MTD or recommended dose&#xD;
      is identified in Part 1, additional patients will be enrolled into Part 2 to further&#xD;
      investigate efficacy, safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, dosing interval or schedule, and food&#xD;
      effect on the single-dose PK of WM-S1-030.&#xD;
