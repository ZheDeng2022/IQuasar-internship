    <textblock>
      Ufoguide is a prospective single arm open study to assess the feasibility of a new type of&#xD;
      HIFU system to treat bone tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIFU is classically delivered by a transducer integrated in the MRI table. This study&#xD;
      assesses a new type of approach in which the HIFU transducer is manually placed on the skin&#xD;
      of the patient, under the assistance of optical navigation, and held in place by&#xD;
      MR-compatible passive arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of heating the tumor accurately&#xD;
      with this new HIFU system. The evaluation and monitoring of the treatment will be performed&#xD;
      by MR thermometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the evaluation of clinical efficacy, quality of life and safety.&#xD;

      Ufoguide is a prospective single arm open study to assess the feasibility of a new type of&#xD;
      HIFU system for the treatment of painful metastases (palliative intent) and osteoid osteoma&#xD;
      (curative intent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIFU is classically delivered by a transducer integrated in the MRI table. This study&#xD;
      assesses a new type of approach in which the HIFU transducer is manually placed on the skin&#xD;
      of the patient and held in place by MR-compatible passive arms. Optical infrared navigation&#xD;
      is used to help the physician with the positioning of the HIFU transducer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of heating the tumor accurately&#xD;
      with this new HIFU system. The evaluation and control of the treatment will be performed by&#xD;
      Proton Resonance Frequency Shift (PRFS) MR thermometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include the evaluation of clinical efficacy, quality of life and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical efficacy is defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in palliative intent by a decrease ≤3 on visual analogic scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in curative intent (osteoid osteoma) by a total disappearance of pain Quality of life is&#xD;
           assessed by EORTC quality of life questionnaire-core 30 items Complications are recorded&#xD;
           to assess safety.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>UFOGUIDE &quot;patient transducer&quot;</intervention_name>
    <description>The transducer is maintained by a flexible/rigid structure, consisting of a support base, and three to four feet forming an arch around the area to be treated. These feet exist in several lengths (10, 20, 30, 40 cm) depending on the area to be treated and can be easily mounted on the base by fast attachment. The structure is based on the principle of granular jamming: it is flexible in its normal state, and can be stiffened by the application of depression within the feet.</description>
