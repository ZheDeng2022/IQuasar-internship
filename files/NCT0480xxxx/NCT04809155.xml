  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot effectiveness study of Girl2Girl, a text messaging-based pregnancy prevention&#xD;
      program for cisgender sexual minority adolescents.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated one in four teen women will become pregnant by the time she is 20 years of age.&#xD;
      That said, significant disparity in rates exist for lesbian, gay, bisexual and other sexual&#xD;
      minority women (LGB) versus non-LGB teen women: Research suggests that lesbian and bisexual&#xD;
      teen women are between two and four times more likely to report having been pregnant than&#xD;
      teen women who identified as exclusively heterosexual. Despite this compelling evidence that&#xD;
      lesbian and bisexual adolescent women are at risk for teen pregnancy, programs tailored to&#xD;
      the unique needs of adolescent LGB women are nonexistent. Evidence-based teen pregnancy&#xD;
      prevention (TPP) programs targeting LGB teen women are urgently needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Girl2Girl intervention text messaging-based TPP program designed specifically for LGB&#xD;
      women ages 14-18 years, nation-wide. This is an extension of a previous randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. Here, the cohort was recruited using an effectiveness strategy: Girls were allowed to&#xD;
      register and enroll themselves without needing to talk to research staff. All eligible and&#xD;
      interested youth were allowed to enroll; no diversity targets were applied.&#xD;
