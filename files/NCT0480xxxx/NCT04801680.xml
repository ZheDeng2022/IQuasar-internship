  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cementless fixation, with or without screw augmentation, has evolved during the past few&#xD;
      decades as the preferred method for acetabular reconstruction. Although major improvements&#xD;
      have been recorded with regard to clinical outcomes and survivorship, acetabular component&#xD;
      loosening remains among the most common causes of failure and revision. Patient age, poor&#xD;
      bone quality and conditions, such as osteonecrosis and dysplasia, have been observed to&#xD;
      influence negatively long-term clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial stability is fundamental for survivorship of cementless cups. Prerequisites to&#xD;
      achieve durable cementless cup fixation are close contact with viable native bone, primary&#xD;
      mechanical stability and secondary bone integration. Press-fit techniques provide optimal&#xD;
      conditions for bone ingrowth and fixation but research focused on cup material in order to&#xD;
      improve primary stability. Pore size, bone-implant apposition, and material properties all&#xD;
      influence bone ingrowth and long-term stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological ingrowth surfaces have become a standard prosthetic element in reconstructive hip&#xD;
      surgery. A material's properties, three-dimensional architecture, and surface texture all&#xD;
      play integral parts in its biological performance. Trabecular metal is an important new&#xD;
      biomaterial that has been introduced to enhance the potential of biological ingrowth as well&#xD;
      as provide a structural scaffold in cases of severe bone deficit. The continuity between the&#xD;
      porous and solid parts has been specifically developed to overcome the limitations of the&#xD;
      traditional porous coatings. In fact, the absence of an interface between the trabecular&#xD;
      structure and the bulk material provides greater structural solidity and thus higher&#xD;
      resistance to detachment and corrosion. Initial clinical applications have focused on bone&#xD;
      restoration in tumor and salvage cases and in primary and revision reconstructive cases where&#xD;
      the increased biological fixation would be of clinical benefit. However the bone ingrowth&#xD;
      potential and mechanical integrity of this material offer exciting options for orthopedic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgeons such as difficult THA cases, such as patients with high demands,&#xD;
      subjects affected by severe hip conditions (i.e. osteonecrosis, dysplasia) or with extremely&#xD;
      poor bone quality. Medacta Mpact 3D Metal cup, is an acetabular cup realized using the EBM&#xD;
      (Electron Beam Melting) powder technology; this production method offers a high friction and&#xD;
      scratch-fit feel for the initial stability, without the need of any additional coating.&#xD;
      Moreover the 3D Metal structure creates a favorable environment for bone thus providing&#xD;
      secondary fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long term clinical and radiological performance of&#xD;
      MPact 3D Metal acetabular component.&#xD;

        according to the ODEP panel directive (Orthopaedic Data Evaluation Panel), for a long term&#xD;
        post-marketing observational study. The number of patients is in line with long term&#xD;
        observational study and considered sufficient to evaluate 10 years survival rate of the&#xD;
