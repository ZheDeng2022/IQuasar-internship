      Background: The aim of the study is to find out the prevelance of IL1A (rs1800587), IL1B&#xD;
      (rs1143634) and VDR (rs731236) gene polymorphisms in Turkish population and their association&#xD;
      with stage III grade B / C periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Individuals who were found to be systemically and periodontally healthy (N = 100)&#xD;
      after clinical and radiographic examination and who were diagnosed with Stage III Grade B / C&#xD;
      periodontitis (N = 100) were included in the study. Plaque index, gingival index, bleeding on&#xD;
      probing, pocket depth and clinical attachment levels of the patients were recorded.&#xD;
      Genotyping of IL1A (rs1800587), IL1B (rs1143634) and VDR (rs731236) gene polymorphisms was&#xD;
      performed by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction.&#xD;

      A total of 200 healthy or patients were recruited from the Clinics of Periodontology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodontal clinical parameters such as plaque index, gingival index, probing depth and&#xD;
      clinical attachment level were assessed. Genotyping of IL1A (rs1800587), IL1B (rs1143634) and&#xD;
      VDR (rs731236) gene polymorphisms was performed by Real Time Polymerase Chain&#xD;
      Reaction.Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software package SPSS v16.&#xD;
      SNPassoc.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with stage III, grade B / C periodontitis were diagnosed based on the new classification criteria. [2, 24] Clinical attachment loss ≥5 mm, probing depth (PD) ≥6 mm, ≥20 teeth and radiographic bone loss extending to the middle third of the root. Grade B was evaluated indirectly considering radiographic bone loss in the most affected tooth in the dentition as a function of age (0.25-1.0). Grade C was assessed considering the radiographic bone loss in the most affected tooth in the dentition as a function of age (&gt;1.0).</description>

    <description>The periodontally healthy subjects without any clinical sign of inflammation,not showing a history of periodontitis; PD ≤3 mm; &lt;10% of sites with bleeding on probing (BOP); an absence of detectable attachment and/or bone loss; without extensive caries or restorations and presence of at least 28 permanent teeth. In addition, all the control subjects showed the absence of any local or systemic pathology.</description>
