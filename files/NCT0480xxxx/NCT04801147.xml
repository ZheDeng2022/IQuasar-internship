  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale of the Study: Treatment for GBM currently consists of surgical resection of the&#xD;
      tumour mass followed by radio- and chemotherapy ((1)Stupp et al., 2005). Nonetheless overall&#xD;
      prognosis still remains bleak, recurrence is universal, and recurrent GBM patients clearly&#xD;
      need innovative therapies. Dendritic cells (DC) immunotherapy could represent a&#xD;
      well-tolerated, long-term tumour-specific treatment to kill all (residual) tumour cells which&#xD;
      infiltrate in the adjacent areas of the brain. Preclinical investigations for the development&#xD;
      of therapeutic vaccines against high grade gliomas, based on the use of DC loaded with a&#xD;
      mixture of glioma-derived tumor have been carried out in rat as well as in mouse models,&#xD;
      showing the capacity to generate a glioma-specific immune response. Mature DC loaded with&#xD;
      autologous tumor lysate have been used also for the treatment of patients with recurrent&#xD;
      malignant brain tumors; no major adverse events have been registered. Results about the use&#xD;
      of immunotherapy for GBM patients are encouraging, but further studies are necessary to find&#xD;
      out the most effective and safe combination of immunotherapy with radio- and chemotherapy&#xD;
      after exeresis of the tumour mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study. Primary objective of the study is to evaluate treatment tolerability and to&#xD;
      get preliminary information about efficacy. Secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      effect on the immune response. Additional objective is to identify a possible correlation&#xD;
      between methylation status of MGMT promoter and tumor response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage Simon design ((2)Simon, 1989) will be considered for the study. Assuming as&#xD;
      outcome measure the percentage of PFS12 patients and of clinical interest an increase to 42%&#xD;
      (P1) of the historical control rate of 27% (P0) ((1)Stupp et al., 2005), the alternative&#xD;
      hypothesis will be rejected at the end of the first stage if the PFS12 rate will be less than&#xD;
      8/24 treated patients (Fisher's exact test). In the second stage patients will be enrolled up&#xD;
      to 76 overall. The null hypothesis will be rejected (a=0.05, b=0.2) if at least 27 subjects&#xD;
      out of 76 are alive and progression free 12 months after the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;

      Background and significance. The therapeutic program will include radical surgical resection&#xD;
      of the tumor, followed by radiotherapy (fractionated local field irradiation in daily&#xD;
      fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days per week, Monday through Friday for 6 weeks, for a total of 60&#xD;
      Gy) plus temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy (75 mg per square meter of body-surface area per&#xD;
      day, 7 days per week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy). After a 4-week break,&#xD;
      up to 6 cycles of maintenance TMZ (mTMZ) will be administered according to the standard 5-day&#xD;
      (oral intake) schedule every 28 days. TMZ dose will be 150 mg per square meter for the first&#xD;
      cycle and will be increased to 200 mg per square meter beginning with the second cycle, so&#xD;
      long as there is no hematologic toxic effect. Immunotherapy will follow radiochemotherapy and&#xD;
      will comprise 4 vaccinations every second week (injections I, II, III, IV), 2 further monthly&#xD;
      vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination (injection VII) 2 months after the&#xD;
      sixth one. Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while&#xD;
      the others will be of 5 million cells only. In correspondence to the third vaccine injection&#xD;
      (week 13), mTMZ will start. On the basis of the patient clinical status, further vaccine&#xD;
      boosts will be considered as appropriate addition at the standard vaccination cycle.&#xD;
