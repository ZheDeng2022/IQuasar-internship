      The study is a randomized evaluation of a low-cost intervention that encourages mothers and&#xD;
      other caregivers to talk to infants, or to engage in what is known as infant-directed speech&#xD;
      (IDS) as a way of promoting language and brain development in Tamale and surrounding areas,&#xD;
      Ghana.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While parents universally use &quot;baby talk&quot; to soothe an infant or get her attention, engaging&#xD;
      in a second form of infant-directed speech (IDS) - talking to young children with complete,&#xD;
      if simplified, sentences and a rich variety of words -- varies by socioeconomic status (SES)&#xD;
      within societies and across societies. Preliminary evidence collected from Burkina Faso and&#xD;
      Ghana, as well as anecdotal experiences in Kenya and Uganda, are consistent with this: It is&#xD;
      less common for parents in sub-Saharan Africa to talk to their infants than it is among&#xD;
      parents in the US. Because IDS promotes cognitive development of children, gaps in IDS&#xD;
      compound the disadvantages that children in poorer families face.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most likely explanation for the IDS deficit among the poor is inaccurately low&#xD;
      expectations about the pace of child development. A large body of literature in the US has&#xD;
      shown that the lower the parents' SES, the lower their expectations about when children will&#xD;
      master certain cognitive skills, e.g. speaking in a partial sentence of 3 words or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized evaluation of a low-cost intervention that encourages mothers and&#xD;
      other caregivers to talk to infants, or to engage in what is known as infant-directed speech&#xD;
      (IDS) as a way of promoting language and brain development in Tamale and surrounding areas,&#xD;
      Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental beliefs about and practices of IDS will be evaluated through data obtained from a&#xD;
      series of questions on these topics at baseline, during a short phone follow-up survey, and&#xD;
      at endline. This will mainly be self-reported although we hope to explore the observation of&#xD;
      said practices at endline. Results of the treatment arm will be compared to that of the&#xD;
      comparison group to determine if the intervention is effective. To assess IDS behavior and&#xD;
      child language development at endline, the LENA system (Language ENvironment Analysis) which&#xD;
      produces two key measures It produced two key measures: adult word count (language the child&#xD;
      hears) and conversational turns (the sounds/words the child produces in conversation with&#xD;
      adults/others) will be compared among groups. Conditional on funding, there may be a 2-year&#xD;
      follow-up survey (i.e. second endline) to measure children's cognitive development.&#xD;

    <description>IDS Video: The IDS video was developed by the research team. It is a simple animation with a voiceover describing the value of IDS and encouraging the viewer to speak to her babies and to tell family members to do so as well. The video has been translated into Dagbani and English (viewers select the language). They may choose to watch it twice.&#xD;
Breastfeeding women are told by the surveyor following the video, &quot;For instance, you could talk to your baby in full sentences when your baby is breastfeeding.&quot;&#xD;
Wall Calendar: The calendar contains images from the video of parents practicing IDS, and key facts about IDS in bullet points. The 12-month calendar contains an empty star next to each week that the respondent can fill in if they perform IDS at least once a day in that week. The calendar also provides a link to a Facebook page where the respondents can re-watch the video or show it to others (https://www.facebook.com/ghanababytalk/videos).</description>
