      Objectives To assess the reactogenicity, measure the adaptive immune responses and track the&#xD;
      long-term immune memory in 3-years-old or above healthy children and adults as well as&#xD;
      pediatric patients receiving the COVID-19 vaccines-BNT162b2, CoronaVac-chosen by the Hong&#xD;
      Kong Government; to compare the reactogenicity and immunogenicity across the vaccines used&#xD;
      for these children and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested The safety profile and the magnitude and durability of immune&#xD;
      responses to the COVID-19 vaccines in children are non-inferior to those in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects A single-site, comparative nonrandomised clinical trial for 450 healthy&#xD;
      individuals or patients between 3-17 years old and one or both healthy parents and unrelated&#xD;
      adults to receive one of COVID-19 vaccines by intramuscular injection (and intradermal&#xD;
      injection for CoronaVac)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments Mobile app for subjects to record adverse effects, enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay, plaque reduction neutralization assay, luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay and&#xD;
      flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions BNT162b2 and CoronaVac, by intramuscular or intradermal route&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures Types and frequencies of adverse effects within 7 days, and changes and&#xD;
      peaks of antibody levels and antigen-specific memory T cell responses for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Comparison of rates of each type of adverse effects, immune responses at each&#xD;
      timepoint across the vaccines and age groups by ANOVA and multivariate longitudinal&#xD;
      statistical models, decay of immune response modelled by regression analysis.&#xD;
