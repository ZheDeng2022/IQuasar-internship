      Research question: Do preterm infants born &lt;1250 g achieve better weight gain with targeted&#xD;
      fortification compared with the adjustable fortification of human milk?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Targeted fortification of human milk results in better weight gain in infants&#xD;
      with birth weight &lt;1250 gr when compared to the adjustable fortification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Open-label, pragmatic, parallel randomized controlled trial in appropriate for&#xD;
      gestational age infants with birth weight &lt;1250 g.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Human milk is the ideal diet for neonates. However, it does not provide enough energy,&#xD;
      protein, and sodium to meet the nutritional requirements of very preterm infants. Postnatal&#xD;
      growth failure is common despite the current use of human milk fortifiers. The main human&#xD;
      milk fortification methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. standard HM fortification (SF) which assumes an average composition of breast milk and&#xD;
           adds fortifiers in a fixed dosage. It does not account for variations of nutrient&#xD;
           content in human milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Individualized human milk fortification which encompasses two methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Adjustable HM fortification (AF): Protein supplementation is provided in addition&#xD;
                to SF according to blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration which reflects the&#xD;
                infant's metabolic response to protein intake. However, there are clinical&#xD;
                scenarios in which the BUN levels are not a reliable marker of protein intake, such&#xD;
                as acute kidney injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Targeted HM fortification (TF): Based on routine analyses of HM that are used to&#xD;
                adjust fortification to meet the recommended requirements for infants. It does not&#xD;
                take into consideration that the requirements of infants may vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF has frequently failed to achieve appropriate weight gain, while individualized (AF or TF)&#xD;
      fortification seems to have better performance. However, the evidence to support one method&#xD;
      over the other is lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to compare weekly average weight gain between preterm infants&#xD;
      on AF versus TF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the written consent is obtained, the infant will be randomized to AF or TF. The sequence&#xD;
      code will be kept in sequential numbered sealed envelopes. Infants from multiple births will&#xD;
      be included as 1 unit and randomized to the same arm of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients allocated to the TF group, breast milk will be analyzed twice weekly for energy,&#xD;
      protein, and sodium contents. The daily protein, fat, and sodium intakes will be then&#xD;
      calculated and optimized to meet the recommended dietary reference intake (DRI) for preterm&#xD;
      infants with birth weight &lt;1250 g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients allocated to the AF group, weekly BUN measurements will be performed. Based on&#xD;
      BUN concentrations, the liquid protein will be added to achieve the targeted BUN level.&#xD;
      Additional calories will be added using formula if growth is suboptimal or DRI is not met&#xD;
      based on the assumed human milk content for protein and energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will last 4-8 weeks. For all patients, the day the first BUN concentration&#xD;
      and milk analyses are done will be day 1 of intervention. The following measurements will be&#xD;
      performed on days 7-8, 14-16, 21-23, and 28-30 of intervention: Weight (grams), length and&#xD;
      head circumference (centimeters), BUN and sodium concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on maternal and neonatal characteristics will be collected from their electronic and&#xD;
      physical charts.&#xD;
