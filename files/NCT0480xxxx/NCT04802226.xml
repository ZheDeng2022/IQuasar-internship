  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that self-excluded gamblers are very heavy gamblers, and that it is not&#xD;
      possible to distinguish between those who report self-exclusion for addictive reasons and&#xD;
      those who self-exclude for commercial reasons, which strongly suggests that all self-excluded&#xD;
      people are &quot;self-diagnosed&quot; problem gamblers. Several studies converge in recognizing&#xD;
      self-excluded people as problem gamblers who have lost control of their gambling and are&#xD;
      seeking to protect themselves by taking action, self-exclusion, to change their behaviour and&#xD;
      protect themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several reviews of the literature on interventions for problem gamblers have recently&#xD;
      identified self-exclusion as an intervention for problem gamblers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the effectiveness of the current self-exclusion system appears to be limited,&#xD;
      particularly for short self-exclusions and for heavier gamblers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that self-exclusion is an intervention for and by people who have developed a&#xD;
      gambling disorder, it currently consists exclusively of a behavioural intervention, in the&#xD;
      sense that it prevents the behaviour. It would then be possible to optimize this intervention&#xD;
      by enriching it with other components that have been shown to be effective with problem&#xD;
      gamblers or in other addictions: a brief intervention including a motivational, cognitive&#xD;
      approach, personalized normative feedback, referral to online help services (cresus and&#xD;
      gambling infoservice), and repeated contact to suggest an extension of the self-exclusion&#xD;
      period without having to return to the gambling environment. We hypothesize improved efficacy&#xD;
      as measured by reduced gambling for longer after an initial optimized self-exclusion compared&#xD;
      to self-exclusion with the standard procedure. Days will be randomized according to an a&#xD;
      priori randomization list, not players.&#xD;

      Main Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effect of the optimized self-exclusion&#xD;
      procedure, compared to the existing procedure, on the intensity of gambling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the change in total net loss over the last 4&#xD;
      weeks, between the last 4 weeks prior to self-exclusion T0, and the last 4 weeks at 12 months&#xD;
      T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary objectives The secondary objectives of the study are to assess early effect at&#xD;
      6 months and maintenance of effect at 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to evaluate early efficacy at 6 months and&#xD;
      maintenance of efficacy at 18 months. The endpoint used is the change in total net loss over&#xD;
      the last 4 weeks, between the last 4 weeks prior to self-exclusion, and the last 4 weeks at 6&#xD;
      T1 and 18 months T3. The other criteria will be the change between T0 and T1,2, and 3 of the&#xD;
      following variables (total of the last 4 weeks unless otherwise specified):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total deposit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total bet per game&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compulsiveness (as defined by three consecutive deposits in a 12-hour period) (yes/no)&#xD;
           (number of episodes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum number of deposits within one hour of a bet,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total loss per game (average)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of gambling sessions (all games) in a clinical sense; session is defined as the&#xD;
           gambling behavior itself; we will consider the beginning of a session when a gambling&#xD;
           action occurs after no gambling action has occurred for at least 30 minutes, and the end&#xD;
           of the gambling session a gambling action followed by no gambling action for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Session duration (average)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Total playing time defined as the sum of the session durations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extension of self-exclusion (yes no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second and subsequent self-exclusion (yes no, number)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exceeding 80% moderators (sum).&#xD;
