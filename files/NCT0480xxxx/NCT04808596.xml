      Establish a pulmonary hypertension registry and biorepository to lead towards a further&#xD;
      understanding of the disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The aim of this project will be to establish a broad and wide-ranging registry and&#xD;
      biorepository of blood samples from patients with pulmonary hypertension, including all WHO&#xD;
      groups I-V to be used for future research in these areas. This will be both a retrospective&#xD;
      and prospective project. The registry and biorepository will be utilized to study and grow&#xD;
      our knowledge of the cellular mechanisms and mediators of the disease and, in turn,&#xD;
      contribute to advancements in treatment.&#xD;

      Future projects might include genetic testing on your samples. Genetic testing studies pieces&#xD;
      of DNA called genes. The cells in your body contain deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA for short.&#xD;
      DNA is passed down from your parents. It carries the genes that determine how you look and&#xD;
      how your body works and tells a genetic story about you. Differences in genes may help&#xD;
      explain why a particular drug is effective and safe in some people, but not in others.&#xD;
      Differences in genes also may explain why some people get certain diseases, but others do&#xD;
      not. The genetic information may be important in guiding targeted treatments in the future.&#xD;
