  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected bladder tumor will undergo novel 4D MRI imaging along with single&#xD;
      cell RNA sequencing in hopes of identifying a radiogenomic signature that can improve our&#xD;
      staging of patients with muscle invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will accrue patients with sessile appearing bladder masses who are destined to&#xD;
      undergo transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) and are felt by the treating&#xD;
      physician to harbor MIBC. Prior to TURBT, ALL subjects will undergo axial imaging for&#xD;
      clinical staging in the form of contrast enhanced MRI of the abdomen and pelvis (standard of&#xD;
      care). The pelvic MRI will be multiparametric (mp)-4D MRI incorporating high resolution&#xD;
      diffusion weighted imaging (HR-DWI). Both the abdominal and pelvic MRI will have an official&#xD;
      intrepretation by a radiologist, thus both can be used in the care of the subject. Next, ALL&#xD;
      subjects will undergo TURBT at which time fresh frozen bladder tumor will be collected and&#xD;
      subjected to single cell RNA sequencing. Pathologic stage will be determined and reported on&#xD;
      both the TURBT specimen and radical cystectomy specimen. From the above radiogenomic data,&#xD;
      the investigators will show feasibility, which the investigators will define as know-how to&#xD;
      create a radiogenomic workflow and to learn about the correlation structure between the&#xD;
      radiomic and genomic parameters of interest, which will allow the investigators to design&#xD;
      future studies with adequate power.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be &gt; 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must have a sessile mass noted within the bladder on cystoscopy or imaging&#xD;
             worrisome for bladder cancer, specifically MIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must agree to undergo staging which will include mp-4D MRI HR-DWI of the&#xD;
             pelvis in addition to standard axial imaging of the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient must be agreeable to undergo planned TURBT as part of the normal treatment&#xD;
             course.&#xD;
&#xD;

             metastases). Subjects with malignant lymphadenopathy in the abdomen or pelvis&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Patient must not be adverse to undergo radical cystectomy as part of the normal&#xD;
             treatment course if found to have MIBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
