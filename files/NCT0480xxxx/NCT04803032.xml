  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The parotid has a close relationship with the extra temporal course of the facial nerve. The&#xD;
      study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and safety of trident landmark during superficial&#xD;
      parotidectomy in the identification of the facial nerve trunk.&#xD;

      A prospective study was conducted between January 2018 and January 2020 at Kafr El-Sheikh&#xD;
      university hospital (KUH) and Al Fayoum University Hospital (FUH), Egypt, on 60 patients with&#xD;
      benign parotid tumors in the superficial lobe. All patients were subjected to superficial&#xD;
      parotidectomy. The outcome was evaluated regarding the clinical success of facial nerve&#xD;
      identification by trident landmark and early postoperative complications.&#xD;

    <description>A modified Blair incision was made along the preauricular skin crease with the same steps of the routine parotid surgery. Dissection was performed using bipolar cautery and blunt instrument; from the tragal cartilage (the anterior surface) until the bony anterior wall of the external auditory canal (EAC); from there, the dissection was done using a blunt instrument. The styloid process's base is the upper point of the trident landmark; it is the superior portion of the trident landmark. Identification of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle till its origin was performed deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle; it is the lower point of the landmark. The facial nerve is located in the region between these two structures.</description>

    <description>The parotid gland was exposed with its capsule by subplatysmal and SMAS flaps. Dissection was performed from the tragal cartilage until the bony anterior wall of the external auditory canal; from there, the dissection was done using a blunt instrument. The styloid process's base is the upper point of the trident landmark; it is the superior portion of the trident landmark. Identification of the posterior belly of the digastric muscle till its origin was performed deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. ); it is the lower point of the landmark. The FNT is located in the region between these two structures. The dissection after identification of the main trunk of the facial nerve was similar to the routine parotidectomy. The surgical defect was closed over a removac suction drain using Vicryl materials; the skin was closed by 6-0 absorbable sutures. A dressing was applied to the surgical site. Then, a gauze was wrapped over the parotid area and secured around the forehead and neck.</description>
