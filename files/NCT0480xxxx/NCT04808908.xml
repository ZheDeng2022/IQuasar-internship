  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-803 has demonstrated ability to reactivate HIV from latency and can activate T cells and NK&#xD;
      cells to clear those cells, thus reducing the reservoir. However, a concern is that CD8 T&#xD;
      cells may be excluded from the B cell follicles, where a significant part of the reservoir&#xD;
      resides. Webb, et al, has shown that in SIV infected monkeys CD8 T cells in follicles&#xD;
      increase in frequency when N-803 is administered. We hypothesize that in HIV infected humans&#xD;
      treated with N-803 that CD8 T cells will increase in B cell follicles and that there will be&#xD;
      a further reduction in the frequency of cells with an inducible provirus.&#xD;

      A phase 1B single arm study of 10 HIV-infected adults on effective ART will be performed.&#xD;
      This is a two-center, non-randomized, open label, and uncontrolled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo an extensive baseline evaluation 7-14 days before the first&#xD;
      dose that will include an excisional biopsy of a lymph node, colonic biopsies, and&#xD;
      leukapheresis. Participants will then receive three doses of N-803 administered every 21&#xD;
      days. A second excisional biopsy will be performed between 7-14 days after the final dose.&#xD;
      The study drug N-803 will be administered at 6 mcg/kg, which is the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      determined in a recently completed dose-escalation study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infection, documented by any licensed rapid HIV test or HIV enzyme or&#xD;
             chemiluminescence immunoassay (E/CIA) test kit at any time prior to study entry and&#xD;
             confirmed by a licensed Western blot or a second antibody test by a method other than&#xD;
             the initial rapid HIV and/or E/CIA, or by HIV-1 antigen or plasma HIV-1 RNA viral&#xD;
             load.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On continuous antiretroviral therapy for over 24 months without any interruptions of&#xD;
             greater than 14 consecutive days, without plans to modify ARTduring the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening plasma HIV RNA levels &lt; 20 copies/mL and on at least 1 determination in past&#xD;
             12 months (isolated single values greater than or equal to 20 but &lt; 200 copies/mL will&#xD;
             be allowed if they were preceded and followed by undetectable viral load&#xD;
             determinations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening CD4+ T cell count greater than or equal to 350 cells/mm3 and nadir CD4+ T&#xD;
             cell count of &gt;200 per participant report.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to be off prednisone and other immunosuppressive drugs for at least 14 days&#xD;

             antihypertensive medication is allowed. However, if someone is on a beta-blocker this&#xD;
             must be switched to another class of medication as there is a theoretical risk for&#xD;
             bradycardia if the participant were to experience cytokine release syndrome symptoms&#xD;
             (which has not happened with this drug delivered SQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active females of child bearing potential and males with partners of child&#xD;
             bearing potential must agree to use effective contraception during study participation&#xD;

             drug). Acceptable birth control is defined as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             (1) For female participants of childbearing potential, two of the following forms of&#xD;
             contraception are required, one of which must be a barrier method:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Condoms (male or female) with or without a spermicidal agent&#xD;

               4. Tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Hormone-based contraceptive such as oral birth control pills&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory tests performed within 14 days of study enrollment must be a grade 0 or 1&#xD;
             as defined by the Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and&#xD;
