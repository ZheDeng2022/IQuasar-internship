    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to estimate changes in biomarkers of exposure (BoE) and&#xD;
      biomarkers of potential harm (BoPH) in adult cigarette smokers (AS) who switched to using an&#xD;
      e-vapor product (EVP) relative to adult smokers who continue smoking exclusively.&#xD;

      This study was conducted as a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, 24-week, controlled&#xD;
      clinical study split into an initial 12-week study (Study 1), with a follow-up at 24 weeks&#xD;
      (Study 2) in a sub-population of switchers. For Study 1 a total of 450 subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled. Of those subjects who successfully completed Study 1, 150 were then enrolled into&#xD;
      Study 2 with no interruption in study participation. The study compared changes in BoE and&#xD;
      BoPH in AS who switched to ad libitum use of one of two test EVPs with those in the Control&#xD;
      group who continued to smoke conventional cigarettes. The study enrolled AS who were&#xD;
      considered to be in overall good health.&#xD;
