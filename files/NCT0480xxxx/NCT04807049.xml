  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite relatively lower prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in Asians (~1%) than&#xD;
      Caucasians (~2%) as reported in observational studies, Asia has a much higher overall disease&#xD;
      burden, due to its proportionally larger aged population. Based on reported prevalence rates&#xD;
      and projected population figures in Asia, there will be an estimated 49 million men and 23&#xD;
      million women with AF, by year 2050. Stroke is a disabling complication of AF that is of&#xD;
      particular cause for concern in Asians patients. Implementing consensus expert&#xD;
      recommendations for managing stroke risk in AF patients can considerably reduce stroke rates.&#xD;
      However, caution is necessary when aligning management of Asian AF patients to that of their&#xD;
      Caucasian counterparts. Current international guidelines and risk stratification tools for AF&#xD;
      management are based on findings in predominantly Caucasian populations and may therefore&#xD;
      have limited relevance, in certain respects, to Asian patients. The vitamin K antagonist&#xD;
      (VKA), warfarin and alternative new oral anticoagulants, direct thrombin inhibitors or factor&#xD;
      Xa inhibitors is recommended for reducing the risk of stroke and thromboembolism in high-risk&#xD;
      patients with non-valvular AF. However, there is very limited information about the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of those agents in Asian population. Therefore, further research is urgently&#xD;
      needed to inform specific guidance on the implications of different stroke and bleeding&#xD;
      profiles in Asians versus Caucasians. In order to allow comparison between Asians versus&#xD;
      Caucasians population, we propose to adopt the current study protocol and case report form of&#xD;
      the EurObservational Research Programme on Atrial Fibrillation General Long-Term study.&#xD;

      This is a prospective observational study on the current practice of stroke prevention for AF&#xD;
      in Asia. We propose to recruit 5,000 patients (~1000 patients per country) from 5 countries&#xD;
      in Asia-Pacific regions (Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Korea). Patients who are&#xD;
      currently follow-up or newly diagnosed AF in these countries will be enrolled and follow-up&#xD;
      for 1 year. Their clinical data on baseline, and 12 months follow-up will be recorded (based&#xD;
      on the template of the European AF survey- in collaboration with ESC). All patients will be&#xD;
      treated according to the clinical practice in their hospital or clinic. Data on their&#xD;
      baseline demographic information, including the CHADS2, CHADS2-VAS score, HAS-BLED score,&#xD;
      clinical events, including death, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, major bleeding events and&#xD;
      morality will be collected via a web-based electronic system based on Case Report form of the&#xD;
      EurObservational Research Programme on Atrial Fibrillation General Long-Term study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general objectives of the APHRS AF registry on clinical epidemiology and medical&#xD;
      management of atrial fibrillation are summarized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To verify the applicability, and to adapt or strengthen international practice&#xD;
           guidelines (recommendations) on the diagnosis and treatment of AF and facilitate&#xD;
           implementation of such guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the applicability of the results of clinical trials in everyday practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyse the outcome of different disease management strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To foster the implementation of evidence-based medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives of this APHRS AF long term registry are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess whether the diagnostic work-up of AF complies with current international&#xD;
           guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate appropriateness of treatment in the different subsets of AF in relation to the&#xD;
           current clinical guidelines on AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the use of oral antithrombotic therapies, antiplatelet therapy (aspirin +/-&#xD;
           clopidogrel); with the Vitamin K antagonists or with the new drugs (oral direct thrombin&#xD;
           inhibitors or oral Factor Xa inhibitors) as they become available. Furthermore, the&#xD;
           characteristics, co-morbidities, and risk factors of AF patients who receive different&#xD;
           antithrombotic strategies will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For those patients who received VKA, we plan to determine what proportions of time these&#xD;
           AF patients have achieved an INR 2.0-3.0 or INR &lt;2.0 or &gt;3.0. Moreover, the patients&#xD;
           characteristics/co-morbidities are associated with different INR ranges and their&#xD;
           clinical outcomes (stroke or major bleed) will also investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To study the persistence of antithrombotic therapies for AF in Asia. Specifically, we&#xD;
           will determine the discontinuation and switch rates for VKA or different novel&#xD;
           anticoagulants. Moreover, the clinical characteristics, co-morbidities and the reasons&#xD;
           for discontinuation or switching as well as the outcomes (stroke, death, or major bleed)&#xD;
           among discontinued and switched patients will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To study the efficacy (stroke/death), risk (bleeding) and health resource utilization of&#xD;
           various anti-thrombotic therapies for real-world stroke prevention in the Asian&#xD;
           population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To study the utilization of different antithrombotic therapies during cardioversion and&#xD;
           catheter ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Describe the use of new antiarrhythmic therapy options such as catheter ablation and&#xD;
           newly available antiarrhythmic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Estimate AF-related symptoms and AF-related changes in quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Obtain contemporary information on the occurrence of AF-related complications.&#xD;
           Specifically, the ischemic stroke related to AF in the Asian population as stratified by&#xD;
           the CHADS2 and CHADS2-VAS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Evaluate mortality and morbidity in relation to therapeutic decisions including&#xD;
           adherence to guidelines in the AF cohort at 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Assess progression of atrial fibrillation from paroxysmal (self-terminating) to&#xD;
           persistent (non-self-terminating) atrial fibrillation. To assess the impact of validated&#xD;
           and less well-established risk factors for progression of atrial fibrillation, including&#xD;
           duration of history of associated diseases, blood pressure, BMI, kidney function, BNP&#xD;
           levels and pulmonary disease.&#xD;
