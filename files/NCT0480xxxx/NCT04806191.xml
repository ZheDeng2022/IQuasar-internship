  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous research suggests that general practitioners find handling patients with shoulder&#xD;
      pain difficult and that the current care for shoulder pain is not in line with the best&#xD;
      available evidence (1).This project aims to assess the effectiveness, costs and&#xD;
      implementation of an evidence-based guideline for shoulder pain in general practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A simplified and evidence-based algorithm for examination and treatment of patients with&#xD;
      shoulder pain will be developed and implemented in general practice. The purpose is to&#xD;
      improve quality of care and provide GPs with a simplified and efficient tool to handle&#xD;
      patients with common shoulder- related pain. The study is a stepped-wedge, cluster-randomized&#xD;
      trial with a hybrid design including a effectiveness, cost and implementation assessment of a&#xD;
      guideline-based intervention in clinical practice (2). General practitioners in Norway will&#xD;
      be recruited and the GP offices will be randomized to the time of crossover from current&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) to the implementation of the intervention. The intervention is a&#xD;
      tailored strategy that includes workshops for general practitioners covering information and&#xD;
      access to a decision support tool, an education program where the general practitioner learn&#xD;
      an evidence-based approach to shoulder pain and access to patient information materials.&#xD;
      Outcomes will be measured at patient and GP levels, using self-report questionnaires, focus&#xD;
      group interviews and register based data.&#xD;
