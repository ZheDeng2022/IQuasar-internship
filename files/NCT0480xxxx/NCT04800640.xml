  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a consensus in the literature that changes in lifestyle and carbohydrate-rich diet are&#xD;
      part of a context that has led to an obesity pandemic. Its treatment is multidisciplinary,&#xD;
      however, in many cases, conventional therapy has no effect, requiring surgical intervention.&#xD;
      The latter, in turn, is not free of risks and causes important changes in lung function.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of electroanalgesia through conventional&#xD;
      transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) on pulmonary function in the postoperative period of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;

      This is an uncontrolled cross-sectional clinical trial with a sample of 66 individuals&#xD;
      between 18 and 50 years of age in a hospital in the West of Paraná. Pain assessment will be&#xD;
      performed through analogue pain scale, pulmonary function through spirometry and respiratory&#xD;
      muscle strength through manovacuometry. Four TENS applications will be performed for a period&#xD;
      of 30 minutes. Through this research, it is expected that the patients who perform TENS&#xD;
      present a reduction in postoperative pain and, consequently, a lower impact on lung function.&#xD;
