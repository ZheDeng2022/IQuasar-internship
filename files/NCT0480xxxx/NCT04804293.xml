    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test a new ultrasound method to detect possible stiffness&#xD;
      problems within wrist(s). The purpose of this research is to the test the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      new ultrasound method to check the nerve and surrounding tissue in both wrist of patient&#xD;
      volunteers before and after treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ultrasound system is FDA approved. The risks associated with this research study are not&#xD;
      beyond the normal risk of conventional ultrasound and should not cause you any discomfort.&#xD;
      Ultrasound at the intensity levels and duration used in this study has not been shown to&#xD;
      present risk to humans. The investigators will conduct the SWE study on the set time point&#xD;
      when the patient returns for follow-up after the therapy (surgical decompression or&#xD;
      corticosteroid injection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of pictures will be taken of patients wrists by the FDA approved ultrasound system.&#xD;
      This system uses a special type of ultrasound for imaging your wrists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound study will be repeated after 3 and 6 months after the treatments.&#xD;

    <description>Shear wave elastography (SWE) will be used to assess the stiffness of tissue. Patients will be revaluated at 3 and 6 months post-operatively. Patient will sit done in a chair. The investigators will scan the wrist area of both arms to acquire SWE map. This imaging will be done before the treatment. We will repeat the imaging study at 3 and 6 months after the treatment. Each ultrasound imaging session will take about less than 10 min. The investigators do not expect any discomfort during the imaging.</description>
