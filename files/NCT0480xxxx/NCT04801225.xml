  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Early Feasibility Study (EFS) is a multi-center, open-label single-arm study in 10 acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with VitalFlow-IS stimulation within 6 hours of&#xD;
      symptom onset. The purpose of the EFS is to evaluate initial clinical safety and device&#xD;
      functionality in the clinical workflow setting for treatment of acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients that will inform design modifications and/or user interface in preparation for next&#xD;
      steps consisting of (1) a full safety/feasibility clinical study and (2) randomized&#xD;
      controlled pivotal trial with a surrogate endpoint (expedited Premarket Approval (PMA)&#xD;
      pathway).&#xD;

    <description>Enrolled subjects shall receive a VitalFlow stimulation after other standard-of-care treatments are initiated. VitalFlow treatment is initiated by powering on the System and positioning the two (Left and Right) VItalFlow coils on each side of the head (by the ear).&#xD;
The operator controls the VItalFlow Stimulation through the accompanying console with simple button operation. Once treatment is initiated, the VitalFlow provides continuous, biphasic pulses at a preset power cycle with the total treatment time under 5 min (fixed time). After treatment is completed, the coils are removed and replaced on the VitalFlow System.</description>
