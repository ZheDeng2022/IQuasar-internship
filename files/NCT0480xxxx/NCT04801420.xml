    <textblock>
      VLA15-221 is a Phase 2 study, which will be conducted in two parts: Main Study Phase (Part A)&#xD;
      and Booster Phase (Part B). The study will compare the safety and immunogenicity of two&#xD;
      different primary immunization schedules applying three (Month 0-2-6) or two (Month 0-6)&#xD;
      vaccinations. Within the study, 600 healthy subjects aged 5-65 years will be included.&#xD;
      Subjects with a history of Lyme borreliosis (previous infection with Borrelia) as well as&#xD;
      Borrelia na√Øve subjects will be enrolled. Study duration per subject will be a maximum of 19&#xD;
      months in Part A and additional 37 months for subjects enrolled in the Part B.&#xD;

      VLA15-221 is a randomized, observer-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study,&#xD;
      which is set up in two parts: Main Study Phase (Part A) and Booster Phase (Part B). In Part A&#xD;
      600 subjects aged 5-65 years will be enrolled 1:1:1 into three groups: Group 1 will be&#xD;
      vaccinated with VLA15 at Month 0-2-6, Group 2 will be vaccinated with VLA15 at Month 0-6 and&#xD;
      with placebo at Month 2 and Group 3 will be vaccinated with placebo at Month 0-2-6. In Part B&#xD;
      a subset of subjects will receive a booster injection with VLA15 or placebo at Month 18.&#xD;
