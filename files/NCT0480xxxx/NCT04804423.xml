    <textblock>
      This observational cohort study aims to evaluate the short-term (3 months) efficacy of the&#xD;
      standard fluoride therapy in the German National Health System for managing hypersensitive&#xD;
      carious lesions in primary teeth (fluoride varnish application), and further compare it to a&#xD;
      different fluoride therapy utilizing a silver-containing fluoride agent combined with&#xD;
      potassium iodide solution.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single trained investigator will screen for possible study participants of children aged&#xD;
      2-5 years old, and their parents will be asked to participate in the study. The participants&#xD;
      will be consecutively recruited from regular clinic attendees of the Department of Preventive&#xD;
      and Pediatric Dentistry at the University of Greifswald, from whom present with active&#xD;
      carious lesions (ICDAS 5) along symptoms of hypersensitivity to be treated with fluoride&#xD;
      varnish, and further compared to participants treated with silver fluoride and potassium&#xD;
      iodide application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility to the study will be determined by a single trained examiner through clinical&#xD;
      findings of caries activity according to Bjørndal criteria, and reported history of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity symptoms obtained from the parent/caregiver of the participant, followed by&#xD;
      hypersensitivity confirmatory test using a triple syringe air blast on the exposed surface of&#xD;
      the carious lesion to allocate areas with suspected dentin hypersensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After clinical examination and obtainment of an informed consent, eligible children will be&#xD;
      treated with fluoride varnish application (Duraphat®), or silver fluoride and potassium&#xD;
      iodide application (Riva Star®) according to manufacturer's instructions.The participant's&#xD;
      behavior shall be evaluated at the beginning, during and after treatment. Plaque Index (API)&#xD;
      and Papillary Bleeding Index (PBI) will also be assessed prior to treatment and at the&#xD;
      3-months mark. Procedures will be performed by six different dentists (four pediatric&#xD;
      specialists and two post-graduate pediatric dentistry students), all of whom were briefed on&#xD;
      the study protocol and received instructions in carrying in the interventions according to&#xD;
      the manufacturer's guide, and their technical opinions regarding the performed procedures&#xD;
      will be obtained following the procedure. Follow up examinations after 3 months will be done&#xD;
      by a single examiner. Only one tooth per child will be included in the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and information of this study will be recorded, handled, and stored in an organized and&#xD;
      secure way, to allow its accurate reporting, interpretation, and verification. To assure&#xD;
      confidentiality of clinical records, an unambiguous subject identification code will be used.&#xD;
      Patients who are no longer willing to continue in the study will have the right to quit at&#xD;
      any time without any penalty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All variables will be statistically analyzed using descriptive statistics, plots, and tests&#xD;
      of normality. Means and standard deviations (SD) will be calculated for all quantitative&#xD;
      variables, while frequencies and percentages will be calculated for categorical variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison between the two study groups will utilize independent samples t-test for&#xD;
      quantitative normally distributed variables, and Mann-Whitney U for quantitative non-normally&#xD;
      distributed variables and qualitative ordinal variables. Chi-squared and Fisher exact tests&#xD;
      will be performed for comparing qualitative nominal variables between the two study groups.&#xD;
      Comparing the baseline and follow-up shall be done using paired t-test when the variable is&#xD;
      normally distributed, and Wilcoxon signed rank test when the variable is not normally&#xD;
      distributed. For comparing lesion activity before and after treatment, McNemar test will be&#xD;
      used and Friedman test for comparing the children's behavior at 3 different time points&#xD;
      (before, during and after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Significance will be set at p&lt;0.05. Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS statistical&#xD;
      software for windows (version 25).&#xD;
