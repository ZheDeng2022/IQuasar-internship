  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organisation Patient Safety Challenge: Medication Without Harm has brought&#xD;
      our attention to the importance of medication-related harm as a global public health issue.&#xD;
      One of the major contributing factors is polypharmacy, the usage of multiple medicines at the&#xD;
      same time. People are getting older and living longer with chronic diseases; they need more&#xD;
      medications, which frequently leads to polypharmacy. Subsequently, they are at more risk of&#xD;
      medication-related harm. The planned project is an epidemiological study on polypharmacy,&#xD;
      medication appropriateness, risk factors, and clinical outcomes post-discharge from a&#xD;
      hospital for surgical patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group hypothesise that pre-and post-operative polypharmacy and potentially&#xD;
      inappropriate prescribing is common, especially among older patients, patients with a high&#xD;
      comorbidity and frailty burden, and patients undergoing more complicated surgery. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is additionally that preoperative polypharmacy and potentially inappropriate&#xD;
      prescribing is associated with a higher short- and long-term mortality, a longer primary&#xD;
      hospitalization length of stay, and a higher risk of readmission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, retrospective, single centered study, using clinical data from the&#xD;
      patient's medical record from the hospital, the national prescription database of the&#xD;
      Directorate of Health, and the and ICD-10 codes from primary care records. For this analysis,&#xD;
      medicines will be classified into drug classes based on the first five characters of their&#xD;
      WHO Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) code. The prevalence (pre) and incidence (post) of&#xD;
      polypharmacy (≥5 or more regular medicines) and hyper-polypharmacy (≥10 regular medicines)&#xD;
      will be calculated. Potentially inappropriate prescribing will be assessed in individuals ≥65&#xD;
      years applying Beers 2019, Start and Stopp 2014, explicit prescribing criteria. The analysis&#xD;
      will be restricted to older individuals, as Beers criteria have not been validated in younger&#xD;
      age groups. The anticholinergic burden will be assessed for all individuals ≥18 years will be&#xD;
      assessed by applying the anticholinergic burden scale This stratification is important in&#xD;
      order to deliver targeted interventions in resource-limited healthcare settings&#xD;
