  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pharmacokinetic study to determine risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity of&#xD;
      ropivacaine when used in erector spinae plane blocks for thoracic surgery. Through serial&#xD;
      blood sampling and the use of NONMEM population pharmacokinetic analysis this risk will be&#xD;
      determined for the study population and other populations as well. Pain and quality of&#xD;
      recovery will also be assessed.The erector spinae plane (ESP) block was first described in&#xD;
      2016 as a novel fascial plane block that provided analgesia for thoracic neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      Since then hundreds of articles have been published that have reported use of the ESP block&#xD;
      for indications such as rib fractures, breast surgery, abdominal surgery, and even shoulder&#xD;
      surgery. It has also been studied in thoracic surgery and clinical experience confirms that&#xD;
      patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or robot-assisted thoracic&#xD;
      surgery experience satisfactory analgesia with ESP blocks. Because the block location is&#xD;
      further from the neuraxis than both epidural and paravertebral blocks, ESP blocks have been&#xD;
      suggested as a safer alternative to these older blocks but safety data have not yet been&#xD;
      generated. In particular, the risk of local anesthetic systemic toxicity (LAST) has not been&#xD;
      studied in ESP blocks. While the pharmacokinetics of ropivacaine used for thoracic&#xD;
      paravertebral blocks have been established, similar studies have yet to be performed for the&#xD;
      newer ESP block. Of particular concern for ESP blocks are two factors not present in some&#xD;
      other blocks with established safety: 1). significant intercostal spread has been noted in&#xD;
      anatomical studies, which could put patients at risk for LAST and 2). some of the proposed&#xD;
      dosing regimens involve the intermittent injection of large bolus doses of local anesthetic.&#xD;
      While measurement of arterial plasma levels is useful and necessary to study the safety of&#xD;
      ropivacaine given in ESP blocks, the measurements alone do not allow for prediction of plasma&#xD;
      levels that would occur in populations as a whole. Nonmem is a population pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      application that provides estimates of mean parameters and residual variability in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic values across populations and has been shown to generate better estimates&#xD;
      than the two-stage approach. Nonmem will be used in this study to predict pharmacokinetics in&#xD;
      populations with different characteristics than the one being studied here, which would&#xD;
      create generalizable results.&#xD;
