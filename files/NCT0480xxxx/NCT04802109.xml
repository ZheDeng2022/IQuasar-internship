  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      High-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation is the key to recovering patients with sudden&#xD;
      cardiac death. However, when the environment is exposure to biologic hazard, the medical&#xD;
      personnel need to use different personal protective equipment while doing CPR, and this&#xD;
      difficulty is greatly increased. The research on this part is quite limited, and the results&#xD;
      need to be further analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the effects of CPR wearing different levels of personal protective equipment on CPR&#xD;
      quality and rescue fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed as a prospective randomized crossover trial with an expected total of&#xD;
      40 volunteer participants, performed during 2021 April 1 to 2021 June 30. Each participant is&#xD;
      required to perform a five-minute CPR in kneeling position using three different types of&#xD;
      personal protective equipment. These three modes are Level D protective equipment with&#xD;
      surgical mask, Level C protective equipment with N-95 mask, and Level-C protective equipment&#xD;
      with Powered Air Purifying Respirator. Participants are physicians or nurses at the hospital.&#xD;
      The participation are randomly assigned to the order of the three modes, and each mode can be&#xD;
      rested for 120 minutes. Laerdal Skillreporter is used for CPR and quality measurement. The&#xD;
      main results were effective chest compression ratio, correct chest depth ratio, correct chest&#xD;
      recoil ratio and chest compression number per minute. The secondary results were personal&#xD;
      blood pressure before and after the CPR, heartbeat, pulse oximeter, number of breaths, and&#xD;
      subjective fatigue index (VAS 1 ~ 100 points), Questionnaire for the opinion of wearing&#xD;
      personal protective equipment and using the porta count test to test the N-95 face mask for&#xD;
      its quantitative fitness factor before and during CPR, and infrared detector for qualitative&#xD;
      fitness test.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      physicians and nurses from An Nan Hospital, with more than one year of work experience,&#xD;
      possessing ACLS or BLS certificate, regardless of gender, height and weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      back pain in the past, spine surgery, sciatica, coronary heart disease, and lung diseases&#xD;
      such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pregnant women need to be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Method On the basis of our previous study (Foo NP,et al.Rescuer fatigue and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary resuscitation positions: A randomized controlled crossover trial.&#xD;
      Resuscitation. 2010;81(5):579-584). we estimated that with a level of 0.05, a power of 80%,&#xD;
      and an effect size of 0.6, a sample size of 18 participants would be sufficient for&#xD;
      evaluating the primary outcome. We applied the Shapiro-Wilk test to evaluate the normality of&#xD;
      the distribution of data. Then, we applied ANOVA for repeat measures and the Bonferroni&#xD;
      procedure to evaluate the differences among and between different positions if the data fit&#xD;
      the Gaussian distribution, and the Friedman test and Wilcoxon signed rank test if the data&#xD;
      did not fit the Gaussian distribution. All the statistical tests were performed at the&#xD;
      two-tailed level of significance at 0.05, and all statistical analyses were performed using&#xD;
      SPSS for Windows, Version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, U.S.A.).&#xD;
