      This is a multi-country, multi-centre, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study planned&#xD;
      to include patients diagnosed with mCRPC between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2018, who&#xD;
      have received at least 1 line of treatment (LOT) in the mCRPC setting, and have 12 months of&#xD;

      This is a multi-country, multi-centre, retrospective, non-interventional cohort study planned&#xD;
      to include patients diagnosed with mCRPC between 01 January 2016 and 31 December 2018, who&#xD;
      have received at least 1 line of treatment (LOT) in the mCRPC setting, and have 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up data available.To describe the real-world treatment patterns in patients with mCRPC&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be collected retrospectively between the date of diagnosis of mCRPC (index&#xD;
      date) and the end of follow-up, i.e., until death, the last medical record entry, or the date&#xD;
      of data extraction, whichever is the earliest. The data on different types of treatment&#xD;
      received by the patients, sociodemographic and clinico-pathological characteristics, and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization will be extracted from the medical records of patients (alive or&#xD;
      deceased) into a centrally designed electronic data capture system. For the exploratory end&#xD;
      point on real-world treatment patterns in patients with mCSPC, data on different types of&#xD;
      treatment received by the patients, sociodemographic and clinico-pathological characteristics&#xD;
      will be retrospectively extracted from the medical records of patients (alive or deceased)&#xD;
      into a centrally designed electronic data capture system.&#xD;
