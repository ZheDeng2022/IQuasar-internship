  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BBP-418 is being developed for the treatment of patients with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy&#xD;
      Type 2I (LGMD2I). This is an open label study to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      ascending dose levels of BBP-418 in the treatment of ambulatory and non-ambulatory patients&#xD;
      with LGMD2I for which no approved therapy currently exists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study in ambulatory and non-ambulatory subjects with LGMD2I (also known&#xD;
      as LGMD R9) previously enrolled in the natural history Study MLB-01-001. This is a study to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of ascending dose levels of BBP-418 in those subjects.&#xD;

    <description>BBP-418 is being developed for the treatment of patients with Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2I (LGMD2I) for which no approved therapy currently exists. It targets the molecular defect at the source by supplying excess substrate to the mutant enzyme thus boosting glycosylation of muscle α-dystroglycan. The BBP-418 drug product will be packaged in sachets and provided in a carton for in-clinic and at home use.</description>
