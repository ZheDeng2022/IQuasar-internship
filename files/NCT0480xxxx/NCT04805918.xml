  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supportive parenting is a strong predictor of positive outcomes for children, and harsh&#xD;
      parenting is a risk factor for child development, especially for the child developing&#xD;
      externalizing problems (overactive, oppositional, and aggressive behavior). Externalizing&#xD;
      problems in preschoolers are predictive of a variety of problems in later childhood. Thus,&#xD;
      parents are key targets for change in preventive programs with children at risk for&#xD;
      developing externalizing problems. More than 95% of 2-6 year old Danish children spend an&#xD;
      average of 7.5 hours, 5 days a week in a daycare setting, thus pedagogues are key frontline&#xD;
      staff in the promotion of parental abilities and early childhood mental health. However, a&#xD;
      recent Danish study shows that pedagogues experience a need for systematic skills and methods&#xD;
      for intervening in families with a child at risk. Attachment-based programs enhancing&#xD;
      parental sensitivity and parental sensitive discipline show promising results. This efficacy&#xD;
      study examines the Video-feedback Intervention to Promote Positive Parenting and Sensitive&#xD;
      Discipline (VIPP-SD)delivered by 22 VIPP-SD trained pedagogues at home-visits to 120 families&#xD;
      with a child (1-6 years) identified to be at risk. Pedagogues are supervised by four VIPP&#xD;
      municipality psychologists, thus promoting the cross-disciplinary collaboration. The results&#xD;
      will point to future identification of families that may (and may not) profit from a&#xD;
      pedagogue delivered VIPP-SD intervention, as well as to revise the intervention in order to&#xD;
      maximizing its effect, i.e. point to changes to tailor intervention to the particular needs&#xD;
      of different families in a Danish context.&#xD;
