      This study is being conducted to assess the relative effectiveness of radiofrequency&#xD;
      neurotomy in subjects with chronic axial low back pain originating in the lumbar facet joints&#xD;
      using the COOLIEF* Cooled Radiofrequency Probe as compared to the same procedure conducted&#xD;
      using a Standard Radiofrequency Probe.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, single-blind comparison study examining the&#xD;
      outcomes of subjects with chronic axial low back pain that originates in the lumbar facet&#xD;
      joints undergoing a procedure to create a radiofrequency lesion in the medial branch nerves&#xD;
      with either Cooled Radiofrequency Ablation (CRFA) or Conventional (Standard) Radiofrequency&#xD;
      Ablation (SRFA). Approximately 188 participants from approximately 15 sites will be enrolled&#xD;
      into this study, with subjects undergoing either CRFA or SRFA in a 1:1 randomization scheme.&#xD;
      Follow-up will be conducted for 12 months post-treatment, with the primary endpoint being&#xD;
      completed at month 6. Pain, overall outcome, quality of life, pain medication use, and&#xD;
      adverse events will be compared between the two treatment groups to determine success.&#xD;
