  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is one of the success stories of modern surgery, providing high&#xD;
      patient satisfaction outcomes. Total knee prostheses are generally composed by a femoral&#xD;
      component articulating on a polyethylene insert and a tibial tray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently there has been particular attention on the component material; traditionally femoral&#xD;
      components are made of cobalt alloys while tibial baseplates are made, in the great majority&#xD;
      of cases, of metallic materials, but also polyethylene versions are available. There has been&#xD;
      a degree of acceptance in some countries that metal related pathology may exist as&#xD;
      demonstrated by the Australian Arthroplasty register where metal hypersensitivity was&#xD;
      reported as the fifth most common cause for revision hip arthroplasty 2012 report, making up&#xD;
      for 5.9% of all revisions. The wording was subsequently changed from &quot;metal sensitivity&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;metal related pathology&quot; in the 2014 report with 0.5% of all revision total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasties (THA) associated with this term. The same change in terminology was used for&#xD;
      TKA with metal sensitivity as a cause for revision in 1.3% of revisions in 2012 and in 2014,&#xD;
      1.8% of revision TKAs attributed to &quot;metal related pathology&quot; . The overall revision rate was&#xD;
      3.45% after 10 years in 396.472 TKAs, suggesting a revision rate of 0.06-0.32% secondary to&#xD;
      metal or cement allergies. Up to today there is no question that metallic implants may&#xD;
      generate wear debris that cause local reactions. This local reaction is not dose related nor&#xD;
      predictable and therefore not purely due to the toxic effect of the debris but possibly due&#xD;
      to an immunological host process. Hypersensitivity to metal undoubtedly exists but it cannot&#xD;
      be stated at the moment to be an allergic reaction. To prevent issues arising due to metal&#xD;
      related pathology, alternative solutions to conventional chrome cobalt material have been&#xD;
      proposed, for example ceramic component or implant coating. In particular, TiNbN coating has&#xD;
      been proposed by most companies thanks to its excellent biological properties. Preclinical&#xD;
      studies have showed a high scratch resistance and low coefficient of friction, more&#xD;
      resistance to fretting corrosion, reduction of wear, lower ion release rates and low fatigue&#xD;
      cycle, as described in the review of Hove. Clinically, cohort of studies of TiN-coated&#xD;
      implants showed an overall survival exceeding 90% with a follow-up of 15 to 77 months and&#xD;
      good clinical outcomes. No reports of adverse effects related to TiN coating of CoCrMo knee&#xD;
      implants have been showed. There are few studies that compared TiN-coated implants with the&#xD;
      same uncoated version. Thienpont, comparing TiN-coated and uncoated CoCrMo implants, showed&#xD;
      similar clinical and radiological outcomes at short-term follow up in both patients groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall we can conclude that in literature no adverse events have been reported concerning&#xD;
      the TiNbN coating and in particular it has been showed that the coating doesn't not affect&#xD;
      the performance of the device if compared with the same uncoated version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the long term clinical and radiological performance of&#xD;
      GMK Sphere total knee component, coated version.&#xD;

        Sample size calculation has been performed according to one proportion test comparing&#xD;
        expected survival at 10 year of 96.3%[5] with the bench mark value defined by ODEP Panel&#xD;
        for a total knee arthroplasty at 10 yrs of 90%. With a significance level of 5% and a power&#xD;
        of 80%, 141 patients are necessary to show a non-inferiority test. Considering a lost to&#xD;
