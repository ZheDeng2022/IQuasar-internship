  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients with locally advanced BCC, not amenable to surgical treatment and who obtained&#xD;
      a complete response (CR) to Hedgehog inhibitors are administered a tailored schedule of the&#xD;
      study drug. The tailored schedule consists of a change in the time of drug assumption. It&#xD;
      implements some weeks of assumption and some weeks of suspension of sonidegib rather than a&#xD;
      continuous administration.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One cycle of therapy is defined as 28 days of sonidegib. The patient will start with first&#xD;
      schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment schedule 1 (TS1): assumption 14 days on and 14 days off. TS1 may be temporary&#xD;
           interrupted for any grade 2 or 3 toxicity (excluding alopecia) until return to grade 1.&#xD;
           If the patient experiences any grade 3 or 2 side effects lasting for more than 28 days,&#xD;
           at treatment resumption they will start the TS2 schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment schedule 2 (TS2): assumption 7 days on and 21 days off. TS2 may be temporary&#xD;
           interrupted for any grade 2 or 3 toxicity (excluding alopecia) until return to grade 1.&#xD;
           If the patient experiences any grade 3 or 2 side effects lasting for more than 28 days,&#xD;
           he/she is discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If progression of disease is observed (during TS1 or TS2) the patient is discontinued from&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Histologic confirmation of locally advanced BCC lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with BCCs already in treatment with Hedgehog inhibitor sonidegib for:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  BCC that has recurred in the same location after three or more surgical&#xD;
                  procedures and/or curative resection is deemed unlikely&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  multifocal BCC or extensive tumours with bleeding or infected areas&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  anticipated substantial morbidity and/or deformity from surgery (e.g. removal of&#xD;
                  all or part of a facial structure, such as nose, ear, eyelid, eye; or requirement&#xD;
                  for limb amputation)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  multiple BCCs not amenable to surgical treatment because of oncologic or clinical&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Patient having shown a complete response (CR) to Hedgehog inhibitor sonidegib within&#xD;
             the 3 months prior to the screening. In BCC every effort should be made to obtain&#xD;
             histologic confirmation of CR mainly in case of doubt, performing several biopsies in&#xD;
             the sites where disease was present. CR must have been confirmed by 2 consecutive&#xD;
             radiologic exams and by visual and dermoscopic examinations.&#xD;

             including one highly effective method and a barrier method, as directed by their&#xD;
             physician, during treatment and for at least 20 months after completion of study&#xD;
             treatment. Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as those which result&#xD;
             in a low failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and&#xD;
             correctly (e.g., implants, injectables, combined oral contraception, or intra-uterine&#xD;
             devices). Check Appendix B for details.&#xD;

             condom, even after a vasectomy, during sexual intercourse with female partners while&#xD;
             being treated with sonidegib, and for 6 months after the last dose was received.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Agreement not to donate blood or blood products during the study and for at least 20&#xD;
             months after the last dose was received.&#xD;

          5. Concurrent non-protocol-specified anti-tumour therapy (e.g., chemotherapy, other&#xD;
             targeted therapy, radiation therapy, or photodynamic therapy, including participation&#xD;
             in an experimental drug study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Uncontrolled medical illness, including advanced malignancies, at the discretion of&#xD;
             the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that might affect interpretation&#xD;
             of the results of the study or renders the patient at high risk for treatment&#xD;
