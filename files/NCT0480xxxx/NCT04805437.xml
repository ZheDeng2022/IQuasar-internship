  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic scoliosis is the most common spinal deformity in children and adolescents with an&#xD;
      estimated prevalence of 3%. About one tenth of the children with scoliosis develop a&#xD;
      deformity that requires treatment with brace or surgery with the current treatment protocol.&#xD;
      When brace treatment for scoliosis is indicated, standard treatment consists of bracing 20&#xD;
      hours or more per day. Outcomes of brace treatment depend to a large extent on wearing time&#xD;
      and since many adolescents feel uncomfortable in the brace, it is of importance to combine&#xD;
      efficacy and comfortability of the brace.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bracing with a rigid TLSO is gold-standard treatment in terms of halting progression of&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis in skeletally immature adolescents and children. The treatment is&#xD;
      cumbersome and demanding for adolescents during a vulnerable stage in life, and may be&#xD;
      associated with poor compliance. Furthermore, the treatment lasts in many cases for several&#xD;
      years and has shown to have a negative psychological effect for patients. Since time in brace&#xD;
      is of utmost importance for best possible outcome, the braces need to be tolerated by the&#xD;
      patients. As of today, 3D designed braces have received much attention and are thought to&#xD;
      increase comfortability and ultimately increase wearing time, leading to better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we seek to compare standard Boston brace to a&#xD;
      newly developed 3D designed Boston brace. Skeletally immature patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      scoliosis will be randomized to receive either standard Boston brace or Boston 3D brace. All&#xD;
      patients will be encouraged to be physically active for 60 minutes per day. Patients, outcome&#xD;
      assessors and clinician in charge during follow-ups will be blinded for the type of brace the&#xD;
      patients are being treated with. Thermal sensors will be installed in all braces to monitor&#xD;
      compliance. Outcome include change in curve severity, quality of life and surgical rates.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated with clinical and radiological follow-ups every six months until&#xD;
      skeletal maturity and thereafter at 2, 5 and 10 years. Curve progression will not lead to&#xD;
      change of brace. A total of 85 individuals are required in each group based on the hypothesis&#xD;
      of a 2% failure rate in the 3D-brace group and 15% in the standard brace group with 5%&#xD;
      significance level and 80% power and consideration for dropout of up to 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For individuals who are not willing to be randomized and participate in the study, standard&#xD;
      Boston brace will be offered and these individuals will serve as an observational group with&#xD;
      similar follow-ups and will be asked to answer same survey as the study populations will do.&#xD;
