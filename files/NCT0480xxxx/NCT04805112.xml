    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial will assess the feasibility, acceptability and impact of the&#xD;
      provision of multiple oral-fluid based HIV self-test kits to HIV-negative adolescents aged&#xD;
      15-19 years to promote HIV testing among their sexual partners and couples testing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will recruit HIV-negative adolescents girls (AG) aged 15-19 years in Siaya County,&#xD;
      western Kenya. The study will evaluate the impact of the provision of oral HIV self-testing&#xD;
      on uptake of testing among partners of adolescent girls. We will randomize about 300 sexually&#xD;
      active AG to either an intervention group that receives multiple oral self-test kits that&#xD;
      they can choose to offer to their sexual partner(s) or to a control group that will be given&#xD;
      multiple referral coupons that their partners can use for HIV testing at pre-selected HIV&#xD;
      testing services (HTS) sites. We will collect data on whether the kits were offered, to whom&#xD;
      they were offered, if they were accepted, if they were used and with what results, if known,&#xD;
      and if the partners who obtained HIV-positive results sought confirmatory testing. We will&#xD;
      also conduct in-depth interviews with a sub-set adolescents to explore their experiences in&#xD;
      offering HIV self-testing to their male partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 4 specific aims: i) determine whether adolescent girls can safely offer oral&#xD;
      HIV self-tests to their partners; ii) assess whether oral self-testing improves uptake of HIV&#xD;
      testing among partners of adolescent girls; iii) document adverse events associated with&#xD;
      offering oral self-testing to sexual partners of adolescent girls; and iv) qualitatively&#xD;
      explore the experiences of adolescent girls when offering self-test kits to their partners.&#xD;
