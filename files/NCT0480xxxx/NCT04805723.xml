    <textblock>
      The investigators aimed to compare the pre-post operative effects of video-assisted&#xD;
      thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) and thoracotomy on pulmonary function, exercise capacity,&#xD;
      physical activity level, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, inspiratory muscle&#xD;
      endurance, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea perception and pain in patients with pulmonary&#xD;
      nodules.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to global cancer statistics, lung cancer accounts for 11.6% of all cancer cases and&#xD;
      it is the most common type of cancer in the world. Surgery is the primary treatment approach,&#xD;
      especially in early stages lung cancer. Cardiopulmonary fitness of patients with lung cancer&#xD;
      is lower than healthy individuals due to the disease itself and treatments. Pulmonary&#xD;
      function, exercise capacity and physical activity level are affected in lung cancer depending&#xD;
      on the resected lung tissue and the type of surgery. VATS and thoracotomy surgeries, which&#xD;
      are the most preferred techniques in lung cancer, have advantages and disadvantages over each&#xD;
      other. There are few studies compared the early effects of two surgeries on the pulmonary&#xD;
      function, exercise capacity, physical activity, quality of life and fatigue. And also, no&#xD;
      study compared the effects of two surgeries on respiratory muscle endurance and peripheral&#xD;
      muscle strength, previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to sample size calculation, at least 15 patients with pulmonary lesion both VATS&#xD;
      and thoracotomy groups would be included in the study. The demographic, physical and&#xD;
      physiological characteristics were recorded from the patient files. Pulmonary function,&#xD;
      functional exercise capacity, physical activity level, respiratory and peripheral muscle&#xD;
      strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, quality of life, fatigue, dyspnea perception and pain&#xD;
      were evaluated pre and two weeks after postoperative term. Primary outcomes were pulmonary&#xD;
      function, functional exercise capacity and physical activity level. Secondary outcomes were&#xD;
      respiratory and peripheral muscle strength, inspiratory muscle endurance, quality of life,&#xD;
      fatigue, dyspnea perception and pain.&#xD;

    <description>Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a minimal invasive technique in which used to diagnose or treat for lung diseases. During this surgery, one or two small incisions are opened via camera and surgical instruments in patient's chest wall. Thus, less muscle and nerve tissue are damaged.&#xD;
Thoracotomy is an open surgical technique in which allowing visualization of the inside of the thorax. During this surgery, an incision in patient's chest wall is made between the ribs and some muscles important for respiration are cutted to remove a part of lung.</description>
