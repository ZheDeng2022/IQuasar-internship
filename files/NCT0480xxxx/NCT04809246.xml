      An interventional cohort study will be used to assess the effect of an intervention&#xD;

      assessment, same-visit direct-acting antiviral (DAA) prescription, and linkage to hepatitis&#xD;
      care, on the proportion of participants initiating DAA therapy among people who are recently&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study will be conducted as an interventional cohort study with a primary objective of assessing the effect of an intervention integrating point-of-care HCV RNA testing, non-invasive liver fibrosis assessment, same-visit DAA therapy, and linkage to hepatitis care, on the proportion of participants initiating DAA therapy among people who are recently incarcerated within reception correctional centre(s) in Australia.&#xD;
During the initial control period, all people who are newly incarcerated (in the previous six weeks) will be offered participation and will receive the standard of care with the current health service model. After a control period of approximately 12 weeks (dependent on recruitment rate) to enrol n=240 individuals, all people who are newly incarcerated (in the previous six weeks) will be offered participation in the intervention period which will continue for approximately 24 weeks (dependent on recruitment rate) to enrol n=480 individuals.</intervention_model_description>
