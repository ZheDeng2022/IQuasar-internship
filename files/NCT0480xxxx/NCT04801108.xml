  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is to perform a pilot prospective randomized controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the potential role of lung fissure completion strategy (experimental&#xD;
      intervention) in addition to endobronchial valve (EBV) placement (representing&#xD;
      &quot;standard-of-care&quot;) in select patients with severe COPD/emphysema and with evidence for &gt;95%&#xD;
      incomplete fissure between adjacent lung lobes. In select patients, lung fissure completion&#xD;
      strategy will be performed by video-assisted thorascopic surgery (VATS)-guided stapling along&#xD;
      the lung fissures in an attempt to reduce collateral ventilation and determine whether or not&#xD;
      this experimental strategy will improve outcome following subsequent EBV placement. EBV&#xD;
      placement will follow successful VATS-guided fissure stapling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 20 patients at BIDMC, and outcomes will focus on&#xD;
      procedure-related complications, physiological measurements (ex. FEV1 by pulmonary function&#xD;
      testing) and clinical symptoms (i.e. questionnaires). Patient will be followed for 3-month&#xD;
      period, receiving usual standard of care during the 3 months of follow-up. The goal of this&#xD;
      protocol is to determine if elimination of significant collateral lung ventilation between&#xD;
      lung lobes is possible, and whether such strategy to eliminate collateral lung ventilation&#xD;
      between lobes improves outcomes following subsequent EBV placement (i.e. promotes atelectasis&#xD;
      of diseased lung segments) in the management of severe COPD/emphysema in appropriate&#xD;
      candidates. For subjects in the medical management control group, upon completion of the&#xD;
      3-month F/U period, they will be eligible for EBV if they choose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We plan to approach all EBVs candidates that have &lt; 95% lobar fissure completion. Once the&#xD;
      patient agrees to participate and sign the consent, all the screening information collected&#xD;
      as part of the standard of care will be extracted retrospectively from the medical records&#xD;
      including appointment details, 6MWD, and PFTs results. In addition, during the same visit,&#xD;
      health-related quality of life will be measured using the Saint George Respiratory&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SGRQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT), and dyspnea will be assessed with the&#xD;
      self-reported modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (mMRC). After completing these&#xD;
      questionnaires and indexes, subjects will be randomized by an opaque envelope technique&#xD;
      following a block 2-4 pattern to either Group 1 (Combined VATS-fissure completion and BLVR&#xD;
      with BVs) or Group 2 (Medical management).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both surgical stapling for fissure completion and EBVs implantation will be performed during&#xD;
      the same procedure and under general anesthesia in the operating room. Depending on the&#xD;
      duration of the surgical intervention, the endoscopic valve implantation might be deferred&#xD;
      and performed within 48 hours, based on the clinical judgment of the PI, surgeon, and&#xD;
      anesthesiologist present during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Bronchoscopic Evaluation Initial flexible bronchoscopy will be done by the&#xD;
      interventional pulmonologist who will perform the endoscopic valve placement as part of the&#xD;
      standard of care. The bronchoscope will be passed via the endotracheal tube and the major&#xD;
      airways will be examined. A bronchial wash will be performed with samples sent for culture.&#xD;
      If there are unexpected findings, such as a lesion suspicious for carcinoma or secretions&#xD;
      suggesting infection, then appropriate clinical samples will be obtained, and the subject&#xD;
      will be re-evaluated to determine if they are eligible to undergo the study procedure later.&#xD;
      If so, the procedure will be rescheduled. If not, the subject will be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study and will be considered as an &quot;Enrollment Failure&quot; and recorded as such for statistical&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First ChartisTM Pulmonary System Evaluation of CV Following initial bronchoscopy, evaluation&#xD;
      of CV using the ChartisTM system (Pulmonx Inc., Redwood, CA, USA), will be performed also as&#xD;
      part of the standard of care of the patients. If there is no evidence of CV between the&#xD;
      target lobe and the adjacent one, the patient will be withdrawn from the study and EBVs will&#xD;
      be placed. On the other hand, if the ChartisTM evaluation is positive for CV, the&#xD;
      bronchoscope will be withdrawn, and the patient will undergo VATS completion of the&#xD;
      inter-lobar fissure adjacent to the previously selected target lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VATS Inter-Lobar Fissure Completion Surgery will be performed with VATS under inhaled&#xD;
      anesthetic agents by an experienced thoracic surgeon from BIDMC. A double-lumen endotracheal&#xD;
      tube will be inserted allowing one-lung ventilation and the maximal collapse of the operative&#xD;
      lung. The subject will be placed in lateral decubitus with the operative side up. Through&#xD;
      small incisions, the surgeon will create a camera port through the intercostal space and then&#xD;
      the anterior and posterior inferior ports. Electrocautery will be used for dissection and&#xD;
      exposure of the anterior aspect of the hilum. Stapling will then be performed on the&#xD;
      incomplete fissure adjacent to the target lobe, using the Endo GIATM (CovidienTM, Mansfield,&#xD;
      MA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An attempt at conversion to a complete fissure will be made, though depending on the anatomy,&#xD;
      it may be possible that residual incomplete fissure of up to 5% may be tolerated. Hemostasis&#xD;
      will be evaluated. Sterile water will then be used to fill the surgical area, followed by&#xD;
      lung inflation and inspection to verify for air leaks at the level of the stapling. If an air&#xD;
      leak is detected, suturing, re-stapling, or applying pleural sealants will be used to seal&#xD;
      it. If the air leak persists at the site of stapling despite these measures, the subject will&#xD;
      still be allowed to proceed to EBVs implantation. Once the fissure is surgically completed, a&#xD;
      chest tube will be installed and connected to a digital chest drainage system (ThopazTM&#xD;
      Digital Chest Drainage System, Medela Healthcare).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second ChartisTM Pulmonary System Evaluation of CV The double-lumen endotracheal tube will be&#xD;
      removed, and a single-lumen tube (8.0 to 8.5 mm) inserted. The lung will be completely&#xD;
      re-inflated before this evaluation to return them to normal anatomy. Assessment of CV with&#xD;
      the ChartisTM system will be performed once again in the same inter-lobar fissure as before&#xD;
      following the previously described methods. If the result is negative for CV or there is an&#xD;
      improvement in the evaluation, then we will proceed with EBVs implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EBVs Placement Bronchoscopic placement of EBVs will then be performed as part of the standard&#xD;
      of care of patients since they meet the previously mentioned inclusion criteria and have no&#xD;
      CV, same as patients with an initial negative ChartisTM evaluation. The airway sizing system&#xD;
      and a calibrated balloon will be used in the previous re-inflated lung to determine the&#xD;
      appropriate ZephyrÂ® valves size to treat the target lobe airways. The treatment algorithm is&#xD;
      complete occlusion of one lobe by using valves to occlude all segments of the lobe. Either&#xD;
      upper or lower lobes may be targeted for treatment. The lobe will have been selected by the&#xD;
      CT core laboratory based on imaging with computed tomography. However, the PI can choose the&#xD;
      alternate eligible lobe if the airway in the primary eligible lobe is overly challenging for&#xD;
      valve implantation, such as difficulty associated with the underlying airway anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A valve may be removed and replaced with a different size valve during the procedure and a&#xD;
      valve may also be removed and replaced to improve the location. However, a valve may not be&#xD;
      repositioned during the procedure. It is intended that the investigator occlude all segments&#xD;
      of the target lobe by placing valves into segmental or sub-segmental airways. There is&#xD;
      anatomic variability in the number and size of segments in a lobe, so this protocol does not&#xD;
      have a limit on the number of valves to be used. Subjects who do not have any endobronchial&#xD;
      valves placed at the end of the bronchoscopy procedure will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Period After BLVR with EBVs, patients will be placed on a standardized follow-up&#xD;
      protocol used for individuals that underwent BLVR. All procedures and appointments following&#xD;
      EBV placement will be considered standard of care. Data from follow-up appointments at 14&#xD;
      days and 3 months will be collected from the medical records retrospectively including&#xD;
      appointment details, complications, CT-scan results, 6MWD, and PFTs results. TLVR will be&#xD;
      assessed at 3 months using the CT scans performed on patients as part of their standard of&#xD;
      care. The only procedures that will be considered research after the initial surgical&#xD;
      intervention would be the measurement of health-related quality of life with the SGRQ and&#xD;
      CAT, and dyspnea assessment with the self-reported mMRC at every follow-up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crossover Group After the patient allocated to the medical management, the arm is followed&#xD;
      for 3 months, they will be offered the VATS fissure completion procedure. It will be&#xD;
      completely up to the candidates to undergo the intervention. If they decide that they want to&#xD;
      proceed with surgery, the previously described methods will be used including the same&#xD;
      surgical technique, same postoperative management, and same follow-up timelines and&#xD;
      datapoints.&#xD;
