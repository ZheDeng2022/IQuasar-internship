  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, photobiomodulation has been studied as a means of increasing muscle&#xD;
      performance in athletes and healthy individuals. This is possible due to the physiological&#xD;
      changes that photobiomodulation therapy can promote. Moreover, given a large number of&#xD;
      existing studies on the subject, some directions for future research have been established.&#xD;
      For example, future research was established, the relationship between power and time because&#xD;
      with high power, it will achieve the same energy with shorter application times. However,&#xD;
      irradiation may not be offered for the minimum recommended time. Therefore, this study aims&#xD;
      to compare different powers and, consequently, different application times for muscle&#xD;
      performance in healthy individuals. For this, 42 participants will be recruited, males&#xD;
      between 18 to 40 years old, without recent musculoskeletal injury or cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      problems. The participants will participate in 3 evaluations containing functional and&#xD;
      physiological variables and ten training sessions of lower limbs with previous&#xD;
      photobiomodulation therapy application, comparing devices with a power of 0.864W and 1.864W.&#xD;
      0.864W and 1.2W. Lower limbs training will be composed of stiff and squat exercises twice a&#xD;
      week, for five weeks. In the pre- and post-intervention evaluations, the following parameters&#xD;
      will be evaluated isokinetic apparatus, body composition, and functionality of the vertical&#xD;
      jump. For data analysis, we will use a normality test to verify the distribution and&#xD;
      statistical tests will be used for intra and intra and intergroup comparisons, considering&#xD;
      two factors in the comparisons time and group. A significance level of 5% will be adopted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a blinded randomized clinical trial. The volunteers will undergo pre-evaluation, 5&#xD;
      weeks of training associated with the LED application, being distributed in two applications&#xD;
      per week, and a re-evaluation 24 hours after the last application, totaling a total of&#xD;
      approximately 7 weeks. Thus, on the first day (Pre-test) volunteers will be submitted to&#xD;
      anthropometric evaluation and evaluation by bioimpedance for analysis of detailed body&#xD;
      composition. Then, the maximum voluntary contraction test (CVM) will be performed on the&#xD;
      isokinetic dynamometer, together with the electromyographic evaluation. Before and after the&#xD;
      evaluation with the isokinetic dynamometer, thermography will be collected. Still, will be&#xD;
      evaluated the vertical jump test after 15 minutes of passive rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluations, the researcher will go apply the respective interventions,&#xD;
      which consist of applying LEDs all over the quadriceps and hamstring bilaterally, while the&#xD;
      sham group (GS) will receive the LED application off, without the emission of light. The&#xD;
      application will occur for five weeks and will occur twice weekly, on days spaced for at&#xD;
      least 48 hours. The same will be done in conjunction with the lower limb strength training&#xD;
      protocol. It is noteworthy that although the therapy follows the same energy values, two&#xD;
      different pieces of equipment will be used, thus changing the wavelength, total power and&#xD;
      power density, and the consequent coverage time and area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests performed at the time of pre-application of the LED (Pre-test) will be reapplied in&#xD;
      the same order 24 hours after the last application of the interventions. After seven days of&#xD;
      the last application, the isokinetic evaluation, electromyography, and vertical jump&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed. In addition, at the end of the second and fourth weeks, the&#xD;
      volunteer will carry out an evaluation with the isokinetic dynamometer, electromyography,&#xD;
      plethysmography, and thermography.&#xD;
