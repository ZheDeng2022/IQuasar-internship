  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parents are children's primary role models, are food and physical activity gatekeepers, and&#xD;
      create the structure/lifestyle environment within the home. Thus, parents strongly influence&#xD;
      children's weight-related behaviors and have the opportunity to cultivate a &quot;culture of&#xD;
      health&quot; within the home. Yet, there continues to be a dearth of evidence-based obesity&#xD;
      prevention intervention programs, especially for families with children aged 6 to 11 years,&#xD;
      commonly called the middle childhood years. The aim of the HomeStyles-2 online learning mode&#xD;
      RCT is to determine whether this novel, age-appropriate, family intervention enables and&#xD;
      motivates parents to shape their home environments and weight-related lifestyle practices&#xD;
      (i.e., diet, exercise, sleep) to be more supportive of optimal health and reduced risk of&#xD;
      obesity in their middle childhood youth more than those in the control condition. The RCT&#xD;
      will include the experimental group and an attention control group who will engage in a bona&#xD;
      fide concurrent treatment different in subject matter but equal in nonspecific treatment&#xD;
      effects. The participants will be families with school-age children who are systematically&#xD;
      randomly assigned by computer to study condition. The HomeStyles intervention is predicated&#xD;
      on the social cognitive theory and a social ecological framework. The RCT will collect&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics of the participant, child, and partner/spouse; child and&#xD;
      parent health status; parent weight-related cognitions; weight-related behaviors of the&#xD;
      parent and child; and weight-related characteristics of the home environment. Enrollment for&#xD;
      this study will begin mid-2021.This paper describes these aspects of the HomeStyles-2&#xD;
      intervention: rationale; sample eligibility criteria and recruitment; study design;&#xD;
      experimental group intervention theoretical and philosophical underpinnings, structure,&#xD;
      content, and development process; attention control intervention; survey instrument&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of the HomeStyles-2 online learning mode RCT is to determine whether this novel,&#xD;
      age-appropriate, family intervention enables and motivates parents to shape their home&#xD;
      environments and weight-related lifestyle practices (i.e., diet, exercise, sleep) to be more&#xD;
      supportive of optimal health and reduced risk of obesity in their middle childhood youth more&#xD;
      than those in the control condition. RCT Design CONSORT guidelines extension for social and&#xD;
      psychological intervention trials will be used to generate a participant flow diagram and&#xD;
      report RCT enrollment and retention data.113 Interested participants will begin by completing&#xD;
      a short eligibility screener survey. Eligible participants who give informed consent will&#xD;
      have immediate access to the baseline survey. Those who complete the baseline survey, meet&#xD;
      survey plausibility checks (e.g., consistent answers to items measuring the same concept,&#xD;
      meet minimal likely completion time, do not answer to all questions on a survey page the&#xD;
      same), and complete the registration page (i.e., provide name and contact information) will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the RCT. Enrolled participants will be systematically randomized by computer&#xD;
      by alternating assignment to the experimental or attention control study condition.&#xD;
      Recruitment materials and the bona fide treatment to be delivered to the attention control&#xD;
      group are designed to blind participant assignment to study condition. Participants will&#xD;
      receive intervention materials starting immediately after registration and at weekly&#xD;
      intervals for 8 weeks. In week 9 of the study, participants will be invited to take the post&#xD;
      survey to assess intervention effects Approximately 8 to 10 weeks after participants complete&#xD;
      the post survey, they will be invited to take the follow-up survey to assess longer-term&#xD;
      intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week parents will be encouraged to spend about 15 minutes reviewing intervention&#xD;
      materials; think about the changes like those suggested in the materials that could help&#xD;
      their families; and implement 1 or 2 easy, quick, low-cost changes in their homes.&#xD;
      Intervention materials (described in a subsequent section) provided each week for 8 weeks&#xD;
      include an electronic informational guide for parents, tracker to list guide-related goals&#xD;
      for the week and monitor progress toward them, 3 to 4 encouraging nudges delivered by SMS and&#xD;
      email, and a guide for kids that is available electronically and is mailed to the participant&#xD;
      homes along with a reminder magnet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant progress through the RCT will be monitored by project staff by observing their&#xD;
      visits to the website. Bilingual staff will be trained in customer service strategies and&#xD;
      instructed to quickly address any participant queries submitted by email or phone using&#xD;
      scripted responses to ensure equitable care across study groups. Participants will receive&#xD;
      modest stipends that increase in value after they complete each survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group Intervention The HomeStyles-2 experimental group intervention materials&#xD;
      (i.e., &quot;Healthy&quot; HomeStyles-2) were designed to be congruent with White House and IOM&#xD;
      recommendations for home-centered obesity prevention interventions and critical elements for&#xD;
      effective interventions (e.g., interventions are positive, culturally sensitive, supportive&#xD;
      of parent-child interaction and child development; develop realistic, effective plans that&#xD;
      empower families). Like HomeStyles for preschoolers, HomeStyles-2 for middle childhood&#xD;
      intervention materials provide intensive, interactive, fun, non-judgmental opportunities for&#xD;
      parents to shape their home environments and lifestyle practices to protect child health.&#xD;
      They also promote positive strategies and changes that adults can control in their&#xD;
      environments to reduce risk of excessive weight gain in their middle childhood youth. A&#xD;
      positive approach teaches individuals what they can do (eat more fruits) rather than giving&#xD;
      prohibitions (cut out fries). Substantial evidence supports parent preference for positive&#xD;
      messages and the value of promoting positive vs restrictive behaviors to achieve health&#xD;
      goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Content. Key factors contributing to childhood obesity that can be suitably&#xD;
      addressed in the home environment with middle childhood kids identified for inclusion in the&#xD;
      intervention materials were selected using systematic literature reviews and input from&#xD;
      experts in childhood obesity prevention. The most salient factors affecting school-age&#xD;
      children's health and nutritional status that emerged were inadequate intake of fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables, infrequent family meals, excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages,&#xD;
      large portion sizes, irregular breakfast consumption, limited physical activity, and&#xD;
      inadequate sleep. An additional factor was children's limited food preparation skills.&#xD;
      Attitudes toward engaging in healthy behaviors (i.e., eating fruits and vegetables, having&#xD;
      family meals, curtailing intake of sweet beverages, controlling portion sizes, eating&#xD;
      breakfast, getting physical exercise and limiting screentime, getting sufficient sleep, and&#xD;
      giving children food preparation opportunities), barriers to performing healthy behaviors,&#xD;
      strategies for overcoming barriers to healthy behaviors, and confidence in the ability to&#xD;
      perform healthy behaviors regularly, as well as determinants of quality of life, were&#xD;
      explored via focus groups with parents of middle-childhood youth and children ages 6 to 11&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention Control Intervention The attention control intervention will use bona fide,&#xD;
      credible materials that are structurally equivalent to the experimental group. The attention&#xD;
      control treatment will be credible in that it focuses on a topic fitting the description of&#xD;
      the study recruitment materials (i.e., shaping homes and lifestyles to help kids grow up even&#xD;
      happier and healthier) yet providing distinctly different, non-overlapping content (i.e.,&#xD;
      home safety) devoid of the RCT &quot;active&quot; ingredient (i.e., content related to childhood&#xD;
      obesity prevention). The attention control intervention materials include the same components&#xD;
      as those used in the experimental group (i.e., parent guides, trackers, children's guides,&#xD;
      and reminder magnets) with the content focused on home safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Safe HomeStyles parent guides, like the HomeStyles! Guide for the experimental group&#xD;
      provided an overview of home safety. The other parent guides, as well as the children's&#xD;
      guides, trackers, and reminder magnets, focus on indoor air quality, mold &amp; moisture,&#xD;
      hazardous household products, carbon monoxide, home safety, foodborne illness, and&#xD;
      refrigerator temperatures. The Safe HomeStyles materials have an appearance and structure&#xD;
      similar to those in the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments The study survey, &quot;Home Obesogenicity Measure of EnvironmentS&quot;-Families with&#xD;
      School-age Kids (HOMES-FSAK), will be used to collect baseline, post, and follow-up data in&#xD;
      the HomeStyles-2 RCT. The Social Cognitive Theory along with the key concepts addressed in&#xD;
      the HomeStyles-2 guides provided the framework for identification of cognitions, behaviors,&#xD;
      and aspects of the home environment to be assessed. Online survey collection procedures will&#xD;
      be used to collect baseline, post, and follow-up data. The survey will collect&#xD;
      sociodemographic characteristics of the participant, child, and partner/spouse; child and&#xD;
      parent health status; parent weight-related cognitions; weight-related behaviors of the&#xD;
      parent and child; and weight-related characteristics of the home environment.&#xD;
