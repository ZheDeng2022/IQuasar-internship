  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extracts of sage have been reported to interact with central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms&#xD;
      relevant to cognitive performance but, to date, no trial has clearly demonstrated the&#xD;
      possible effects in healthy individuals in fatiguing conditions. The current study&#xD;
      investigates the effects of this supplementation in healthy males and females versus placebo&#xD;
      on cognition, heart rate and perceived exertion, during a fatiguing cycling exercise.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy males and females will be tested in fresh and fatiguing conditions to mimic&#xD;
      individuals at the beginning or during a competition where cognitive function are important&#xD;
      for decision making for example. Tests will be conducted during the warm-up (fresh), during&#xD;
      fatiguing situations (during two consecutive 10-minutes pedaling exercises) and during&#xD;
      recovery. Tests will include a reverse digit memory test (from 3 to 7 digits), a stroop test,&#xD;
      a simple reaction time test. Moreover, heart rate and rating of perceived exertion will be&#xD;
      quantified.&#xD;
