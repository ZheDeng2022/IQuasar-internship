  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat chronic cough. Before patients with medical&#xD;
      conditions can join clinical trials, researchers do trials in healthy participants first to&#xD;
      understand how the body acts on the new treatment and learn how safe it is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the researchers will study how much of the trial drug, BAY1817080, gets into&#xD;
      the blood in a small number of participants. The trial will include about 39 healthy Chinese&#xD;
      male who are aged 18 to 45.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this trial participants will be divided in 3 groups. Groups 1 and 2 will take either dose&#xD;
      1 or dose 2 of BAY1817080 or placebo 1 time. Participants of groups 3 will take dose 3 of&#xD;
      BAY1817080 or placebo one time at the first day and continue to take dose 3 of BAY1817080&#xD;
      twice a day from day 7 to day 16 of the trial. On day 17 they will take only one dose 3 of&#xD;
      BAY1817080.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will take BAY1817080 or a placebo as a tablet by mouth. For this trial, the&#xD;
      participants in Groups 1 and 2 will stay at the trial site for up to 10 days. The&#xD;
      participants in Group 3 will stay at the trial site for up to 26 days. The trial will last up&#xD;
      to 4 weeks for the participants in Groups 1 and 2, and 6 weeks for the participants in Group&#xD;
      3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the trial, the doctors will take blood and urine samples and check the participants&#xD;
      blood pressure, pulse rate and electrocardiogram (ECG). The participants will answer&#xD;
      questions about how they are feeling to check their general wellbeing.&#xD;
