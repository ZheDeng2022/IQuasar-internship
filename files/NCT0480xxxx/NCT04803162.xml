  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to assess the correlation between the results of high-resolution&#xD;
      oesophageal manometry and specific biomarkers of inflammation (eotaxin 3, major basic&#xD;
      protein, IL-5, IL-13, TGF-beta1) with symptoms of dysphagia, endoscopic and histological&#xD;
      features and the assessment of quality of life in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research hypothesis: The results of high resolution esophageal manometry (HRM) and specific&#xD;
      inflammatory biomarkers correlate with symptoms of dysphagia, endoscopic and histological&#xD;
      features, and assessment of quality of life in patients with eosinophilic oesophagitis. HRM,&#xD;
      along with the determination of specific inflammatory biomarkers present in the peripheral&#xD;
      blood, may serve as a less invasive method of assessing the effectiveness of the treatment of&#xD;
      eosinophilic oesophagitis in relation to the currently used endoscopic examinations.&#xD;

    <description>Each project participant completed a health and existing disease questionnaire and the GIQLI. Quantification of IL-5, IL-13 and TGF-β1 serum levels was performed using enzyme immunoassays. From each participant during the esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 6 oesophageal mucosa biopsy specimens were collected. The obtained material was sent for histopathological examination to assess peak eosinophil count (PEC). After completing medical examinations, the project participants were divided according to the histopathological criterion's fulfillment for the diagnosis of EoE. Patients with ≥15 eosinophils/HPF in the biopsy samples constituted the group of patients with EoE, while the remaining patients - the control group. EoE patients were then treated for 8 weeks with PPs - omeprazole in the dose of 20 mg twice daily. After 8 weeks, each patient in the EoE group again passed all the tests (the protocols were identical to those used for qualifying patients to the project).</description>
