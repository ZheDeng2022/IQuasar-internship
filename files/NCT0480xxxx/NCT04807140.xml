  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of preoperative administration of&#xD;
      Toripalimab or Toripalimab combined with nab-paclitaxel and carboplatin in Head and Neck&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) who are about to undergo surgery，and it will be helpful for&#xD;
      comprehensive exploratory characterization of tumor immune microenvironment and circulating&#xD;
      immune cells in these patients. Data obtained in this trial will provide valuable information&#xD;
      for planning further prospective clinical trials of anti-PD-1 and other immunotherapies in&#xD;
      HNSCC. We are also eager to identify potential biomarkers of response and toxicity that will&#xD;
      enable patients with HNSCC who are most likely to benefit to receive anti-PD-1 therapy and,&#xD;
      to the contrary, reduce the risk of toxicity and ineffective therapy in patients who are less&#xD;
      likely to benefit from it.&#xD;
