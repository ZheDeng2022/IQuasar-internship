  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Michigan Opioid Prescribing and Engagement Network (M-OPEN) was established in 2016 with&#xD;
      the goal of reducing excessive opioid prescribing after surgery using evidence-based&#xD;
      prescribing guidelines. Beginning in July 2016, M-OPEN began a statewide quality improvement&#xD;
      campaign to educate providers and share prescribing best practices. This retrospective study&#xD;
      examines the effect of these efforts on new persistent opioid use after surgery compared to&#xD;
      other states where no such program existed using a difference-in-differences approach.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, surgical care has become a gateway for chronic opioid dependence and&#xD;
      its associated morbidity. Between 5-10% of patients who receive opioids for postoperative&#xD;
      pain control go on to develop long-term opioid use. This translates to more than 2 million&#xD;
      previously opioid-na√Øve individuals developing chronic opioid use after surgery each year.&#xD;
      Persistent opioid use after surgery is associated with increased readmissions, healthcare&#xD;
      utilization, and healthcare expenditures. Critically, long-term opioid use increases the risk&#xD;
      of overdose and death in patients who, prior to their surgery, had no exposure to opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Growing recognition of this problem has led to numerous efforts aimed at reducing&#xD;
      opioid-associated morbidity after surgery. These include legislative limits on opioid&#xD;
      prescribing for acute pain, procedure-specific prescribing guidelines based on&#xD;
      patient-reported opioid use, and opioid-sparing pain management pathways. In Michigan&#xD;
      specifically, the Michigan Opioid Prescribing and Engagement Network (M-OPEN) led a statewide&#xD;
      quality improvement effort beginning in 2016 that focused on provider education using&#xD;
      evidence-based opioid prescribing guidelines. Previously, these guidelines have been shown to&#xD;
      significantly reduce excessive postoperative opioid prescribing across the state, however it&#xD;
      is currently unknown whether these efforts have had any effect on the actual incidence of&#xD;
      persistent opioid use after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the current study will evaluate the incidence of new persistent opioid use before&#xD;
      and after the establishment of M-OPEN in Michigan. Beginning in 2016, a statewide quality&#xD;
      improvement initiative was undertaken in Michigan to improve postoperative opioid&#xD;
      prescribing. In order to accomplish this goal, this study will use a&#xD;
      difference-in-differences approach to compare new persistent opioid use in Michigan before&#xD;
      and after 2016 to other states where no such quality improvement effort existed.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Postoperative days 4 to 180</time_frame>
    <description>Among patients who undergo surgery, new persistent opioid use is defined as filling an opioid prescription in post-discharge days 4-90 and filling another opioid prescription in post-discharge days 91-180. This incidence will be measured from 1/1/13-6/30/16 (before M-OPEN established) and from 7/1/16-12/31/19 (after M-OPEN established) and the change before and after this date will be compared between Michigan and all other states (the difference-in-differences). Outcomes will be measured at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years post-intervention.</description>
