        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has signed informed consent by parents or legally authorized representatives and&#xD;
             assent by the child according to local requirements (e.g., Protected Health&#xD;
             Information [PHI]) prior to initiation of any study-mandated procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is aged 12 to &lt;18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has signs and symptoms of CDI including diarrhea such that in the Investigator's&#xD;
             opinion CDI antimicrobial therapy is required. Diarrhea is defined as a change in&#xD;
             bowel habits, with ≥3 unformed bowel movements (UBMs (5, 6 or 7 on the Bristol Stool&#xD;
             Chart, see Appendix 5)) in the 24 h prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has tested positive for toxin A and/or B of C. difficile in the stool determined by a&#xD;
             positive free toxin test (using a Sponsor agreed test). The stool sample must have&#xD;
             been produced within 72 hours prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a negative stool test for other pathogens than C. difficile, or a positive test&#xD;
             that in the investigator's judgement is not associated with clinically significant&#xD;
             signs and symptoms of GI infection, within 48 hours of randomization. Example&#xD;
             pathogens may be norovirus, enteroviruses (coxsackie and ECHO), enteric adenoviruses,&#xD;
             Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia and Campylobacter).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has contraceptive measures in place as follows (see Appendix 4 for details): Male&#xD;
             subject: Agrees to use a highly effective contraceptive method as detailed in Appendix&#xD;
             4 of this protocol during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study treatment OR Agrees to adhere to abstinence, Refrains from donating&#xD;
             sperm during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. Female subject: Is not pregnant or breastfeeding and must have a&#xD;
             documented negative pregnancy test at screening, complies with one of the following&#xD;
             three conditions: Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) as defined in Appendix&#xD;
             4, A WOCBP who agrees to follow the guidance in Appendix 4 on highly effective&#xD;
             contraceptive methods during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study treatment, A WOCBP adhering to abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had more than the equivalent of 24 hours of dosing of antimicrobial treatment&#xD;
             active against the current episode of CDI prior to randomization. (i.e. more than four&#xD;
             doses of oral vancomycin, two doses of fidaxomicin or three doses of metronidazole).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has prior or current use or application of ridinilazole any time in the past, a&#xD;
             (investigational) vaccine against C. difficile any time in the past, anti-toxin&#xD;
             antibodies including bezlotoxumab within the past 6 months, intravenous immunoglobulin&#xD;
             (IVIG) within the past 3 months, fecal microbiota replacement therapy within the past&#xD;
             3 months, or any investigational medicinal product for treatment of CDI within the&#xD;
             past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has life-threatening or fulminant CDI with evidence of hypotension, septic shock,&#xD;
             peritoneal signs or absence of bowel sounds, toxic megacolon, or ileus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had major GI surgery (e.g. significant bowel resection, but not including&#xD;
             appendectomy) within the past 3 months or has the presence of a colostomy or ileostomy&#xD;
             or has the likely requirement of an ostomy during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has current or planned (for within the study period up to Day 40) cancer treatment&#xD;
             (including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, biologic treatment (e.g. monoclonal&#xD;
             antibodies), immune-oncological treatments) that generally is associated with or&#xD;
             currently is causing vomiting and/or severe nausea that cannot be managed with&#xD;
             antiemetics and is limiting the ability to take oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has been involved in a clinical trial and received an investigational medicinal&#xD;
             product for an indication other than CDI within the past month or five half-lives&#xD;
             (whichever is longer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is unable to tolerate oral medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to vancomycin or any&#xD;
             excipient of vancomycin or ridinilazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is, in the Investigator's judgment, inappropriate for participation in the study&#xD;
             including for example those subjects with any other (medical) condition that would&#xD;
             make the subject unsuitable for inclusion in the study, who are not likely to complete&#xD;
             the whole study for whatever reason, e.g., a short life expectancy, or who are&#xD;
             unwilling or unable to comply with protocol requirements, for example complete the&#xD;
             full course of study treatment, attend study clinic visits, provide stool samples,&#xD;
             ingest capsules, tolerate blood draws.&#xD;
