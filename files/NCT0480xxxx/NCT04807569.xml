  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main hypothesis of this study is that peripheral magnetic neuromodulation can correct the&#xD;
      symptoms of lower urinary tract in men. We assume that under the influence of t peripheral&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation, both the subjective state of patients assessed by standardized&#xD;
      questionnaires and a urination diary, as well as the objective parameters, assessed by&#xD;
      non-invasive urodynamic studies, will be improved. This study will use standard protocols&#xD;
      built into the BTL Emsella magnetic stimulator.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that the use of the peripheral magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation in men with lower urinary tract symptoms will help to reduce subjective and&#xD;
      objective clinical symptoms and improve the quality of life of patients.&#xD;

    <description>The IPSS questionnaire evaluates the impact of lower urinary tract symptoms on the patient's quality of life. It consists of 8 questions. Questionts evaluates whether the patient has symptoms of incomplete emptying of the bladder and ranges from 0 to 5 points. The increase in scores is directly proportional to the increase in symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change baseline of micturition episodes per day</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 4, 12, 24, 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Patients should document how many times they go to the restroom during the day and at night, as well as the loss of urine in stressful situations (coughing, sneezing, laughter, squatting, weightlifting, walking, running), changing liner or absorbent and episodes of urgency and urgency-incontinence. The journal shall be held for a consecutive period of 24 hours, for a minimum of three consecutive days.</description>
