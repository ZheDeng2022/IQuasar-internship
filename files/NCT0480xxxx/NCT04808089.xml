      The aim of the present study is to explore if the &quot;Health Lung&quot; application of smart phone&#xD;
      and portable spirometry &quot;ezOxygen&quot; can further improve asthma control for chronic asthma&#xD;
      adult patients with well asthma control (ACT 20~24, but not 25), compared to hospital-based&#xD;
      usual care in a medical center.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease. Despite we have academic treatment guidelines, and&#xD;
      the asthma treatment develops persistently, many asthma patients do not have well control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma Control Test (ACT) is a patient self-administered tool for identifying those with&#xD;
      poorly controlled asthma. ACT includes 5 items on 5-point scale, with 4-week recall on&#xD;
      symptoms and daily functioning. The scores range from 5 (poor control of asthma) to 25&#xD;
      (complete control of asthma), with higher scores reflecting greater asthma control. An ACT&#xD;
      score &gt;19 indicates well-controlled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to correct diagnosis and prescription by physicians, achieving asthma well&#xD;
      control depend on the patient's ability of self- management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-management of asthma patients includes monitor of symptoms, monitor of peak&#xD;
      expiratory flow, compliance of inhaler and avoiding the asthma triggers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portable digital tools may be the possible solution for home monitor of asthma patients.&#xD;
      Through the application of mobile phone and hand-held mobile spirometry, asthma patients can&#xD;
      monitor their symptoms and lung function at home outside of hospital.(5-7)ã€‚&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Health Lung&quot; (AstraZeneca Pharmaceuticals LP) is the application for mobile phone to help&#xD;
      asthma care and is available freely in Google Play. Health Lung can be connected to the&#xD;
      mobile spirometry, &quot;ezOxygen&quot; (Genius Holding Co.,Ltd Taiwan Branch).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the functions of this App. include asthma control monitor, lung function monitor,&#xD;
      controller and reliver inhaler reminder and recording, asthma educational topics in brief and&#xD;
      information of air quality. The physicians can get the information about control status, lung&#xD;
      function, adherence of controller and usage of reliver of patients between each clinical&#xD;
      visit, if patients following the instruction of &quot;Health Lung&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, how the patients are willing to use digital tools at home and what is the real&#xD;
      impact on the current hospital-based asthma care need to be validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to explore if the &quot;Health Lung&quot; application of smart phone&#xD;
      and portable spirometry &quot;ezOxygen&quot; can further improve asthma control for chronic asthma&#xD;
      adult patients with well asthma control (ACT 20~24, but not 25), compared to hospital-based&#xD;
