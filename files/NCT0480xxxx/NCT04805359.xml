  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pathological erythrocyte aggregation reduces capillary perfusion and oxygen transfer to&#xD;
      tissue. The aggregation is determined by opposing forces, the repulsive force between cells,&#xD;
      cell-to-cell adhesion induced by plasma fibrinogen, and the disaggregating shear force&#xD;
      generated by blood flow. The investigators investigate how hypoxic exercise affects&#xD;
      intrinsic/extrinsic factors of aggregation. Sixty sedentary males were randomly assigned into&#xD;
      either hypoxic (HE; FiO2=15%, n=20) or normoxic (NE; FiO2=21%, n=20) training groups for 30&#xD;
      min·d-1, 5 d·wk-1 for 6 weeks at 60% of maximum work rate or to a control group (CTL; n=20).&#xD;
      A hypoxia exercise test (HET, FiO2=12%) was performed before and after the intervention. The&#xD;
      erythrocyte aggregation, binding affinity of fibrinogen and membrane biomarkers were&#xD;
      determined by an ektacytometry and flow cytometry, respectively.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to clarify the effects of exercise training with and without hypoxia&#xD;
      on the erythrocyte aggregation, further providing a feasible strategy for developing an&#xD;
      appropriate exercise regimen that improves cardiopulmonary fitness and minimizes the risk of&#xD;
      hemorheological disorders. This study evaluated the distinct effects of hypoxic exercise&#xD;
      training (HE) and normaxia exercise training (NE) for 6 weeks on the following issue: (1)&#xD;
      intrinsic/extrinsic erythrocyte aggregation, (2) binding affinity of fibrinogen to&#xD;
      erythrocyte, (3) erythrocyte turnover rate and (4) characteristic of mature erythrocytes in&#xD;
      blood, under hypoxic exercise test (HET) (100W under air 12% O2 condition) in healthy&#xD;
      sedentary men.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess cardiopulmonary capacity, the cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on a cycle ergometer was performed 4 days before and after the intervention. All subjects underwent exercise with a mask to measured oxygen consumption (VO2) breath by breath using a computer-based system (Master Screen CPX, Cardinal-health Germany). After 5-min baseline resting period records, a 2-min warm-up period (60 rpm, unloaded pedaling) was started and followed by an incremental work (30 W elevation for each 3-minute) until exhaustion (i.e., progressive exercise to maximal O2 consumption, VO2max).</description>

    <description>The erythrocyte suspension (1×10^6 cells/μl) was incubated with fibrinogen (400 mM) and anti-fibrinogen-FITC monoclonal antibody (1:500, Cedarlane) in the dark for 30 min at RT.&#xD;
After the staining is completed, add 1μl suspension into 100μl medium solution, then rotate the sample on a Viscometer (Brookfield) at different rates (0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 rpm) for 1 min at 37°C in the dark.&#xD;
