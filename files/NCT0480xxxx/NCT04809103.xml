      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral cisplatin, delivered during a&#xD;
      single bronchoscopy with cone-beam CT confirmation, in a dose escalation protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: 3+3 dose escalation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the United&#xD;
      States. Even for early stage disease, the rate of recurrence following surgical resection is&#xD;
      as high as 50%. Although neoadjuvant therapy, administered before surgery, for early stage&#xD;
      lung cancer is associated with a survival benefit, it is rarely used due to the systemic&#xD;
      toxicity of intravenous (IV) cytotoxic chemotherapy. IV immunotherapies are also being&#xD;
      evaluated in combination with systemic therapies in the neoadjuvant setting. However, only a&#xD;
      minority of patients respond to immunotherapy. One of the most common reasons for failure of&#xD;
      immunotherapy is lack of presentation of tumor antigens to the immune system, a problem that&#xD;
      may be potentially addressed with cytotoxic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last several years, case series have demonstrated the feasibility and safety of&#xD;
      delivering cisplatin directly into lung tumors. Given the current knowledge of safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of intratumoral cisplatin, coupled with the potential to achieve immune priming&#xD;
      that may help address systemic micrometastases, the investigators postulate that intratumoral&#xD;
      cisplatin will be well-tolerated, and potentially effective, neoadjuvant therapy for patients&#xD;
      with early stage, resectable, non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
