  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the acceptability and feasibility of a randomized&#xD;
      trial of a 10 week virtual intervention to reduce fall risk in people with HIV who consume&#xD;
      alcohol. The hypothesis is that this randomized trial of the fall prevention intervention&#xD;
      will be found to be feasible and acceptable in this pilot stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized assessments will be administered in-person at Boston University Medical Campus&#xD;
      to assess various domains including fall risk, fear of falling, physical performance measures&#xD;
      (such as grip strength, balance, and gait speed), substance use, and other related measures.&#xD;
      The intervention has 3 main components: home exercises, virtual group sessions and weekly&#xD;
      phone check-ins. Home exercise will be customized to match the current fitness level of&#xD;
      participants. Participants will be asked to complete assigned exercises 3 times per week.&#xD;
      Additionally, there will be a weekly virtual group session led by an Occupational Therapist&#xD;
      trained in group facilitation via Zoom. The virtual group sessions will be used to help&#xD;
      answer any questions and lead a discussion around challenges related to falls. Finally, a&#xD;
      member of the research team will check-in with participants once per week to answer any&#xD;
      remaining questions that participants have, provide individual feedback on exercises, and set&#xD;
      up reminders for the upcoming week. Reminders will be tailored to the individual&#xD;
      participant's needs to remind the participant to complete the intervention's components.&#xD;

    <measure>Satisfaction with Intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks (final assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ-8), which includes 8 items that yield a single score measuring a single dimension of overall satisfaction. Each item is assessed using a Likert scale that ranges from 1-4. Scores range from 8-32, with higher values indicating greater satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>Change in Self Reported Falls</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (final assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as an unexpected event, including a slip or a trip, in which a participant lost their balance and landed on the floor, ground, or lower level, or hit an object like a table or a chair. Reported as having experienced 0 falls, 1 fall, 2 falls, 3-5 falls, or more than 5 falls.</description>

    <measure>Change in Physical Function based on the Short Physical Performance Battery Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (final assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>A composite score based on balance (the ability to stand for 10 seconds with feet in 3 different positions: side-by-side, semi-tandem, and tandem), gait speed (timed trial of a 4m walk), and chair rises (time to rise from a chair 5 times). The score ranges from 0-12, with a higher score indicating better physical function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Fried's Frailty Phenotype (Fried et al., 2001)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (final assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty is defined as the presence of five components: Weakness, defined as having a low grip strength measured with a dynamometer; slowness, defined as having a slow walking speed measured using a 20 meter gait speed assessment; exhaustion, defined as answering &quot;Most or all of the time (5-7 days)&quot; to at least one of two questions from the Center for Epidemiologic Studies (CESD-10) scale (&quot;How often do you feel like everything you did was an effort?&quot; and &quot;How often did you feel like you could not get going?&quot;); Low physical activity, defined as answering &quot;Yes, limited a lot&quot; to the question &quot;Does your health limit you in vigorous activities, such as running, lifting heavy objects, participating in strenuous sports?&quot;; and unintentional weight loss, defined as answering &quot;Yes&quot; to the question &quot;In the past year, have you lost more than 10 pounds unintentionally?&quot;. Stages of frailty are categorized as: Non-frail (score 0), Pre-frail (score 1-2), and Frail (score 3-5).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Number of Days of Alcohol use and Other Drug Use in the Past 30 Days</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 10 weeks (final assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using the past 30 day alcohol/drug use section of the Addiction Severity Index (ASI), a validated instrument. The past 30 day alcohol/drug use section of the ASI measures the number of days of substance use in the past 30 days. The substances assessed by the ASI include: alcohol [including number of days where 4+ drinks (women)/5+drinks (men) were consumed], cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens, phencyclidines, cannabis/marijuana, stimulants/amphetamines, tranquilizers/sedatives, buprenorphine, methadone, other prescription opioids, inhalants, synthetic marijuana/K2/spice, miscellaneous. Number of days range from 0-30 for each substance, with a higher number of days indicating more frequent substance use.</description>

    <description>The Intervention involves 3 primary components: virtual group sessions, at-home exercises, and weekly phone check-ins.&#xD;
Virtual Group Session will be held via phone/video call for approximately 30 minutes per week for 10 weeks.&#xD;
At-Home Exercises will be assigned by a registered occupational therapist member of the study team, and participants will be instructed to complete them independently at home 3 times per week. Participants will record the exercises that they complete.&#xD;
Weekly Phone Check-Ins will occur once per week. These check-ins will be used to provide support and problem solving as needed, and individualized reminder systems will be set up to prompt the participant to engage in their weekly exercises (e.g., set up alarm on phone, notifications through calendar app).</description>
