  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mechanisms regulating fat mass homeostasis are incompletely understood although recent&#xD;
      animal and human trials would suggest that there is a leptin independent regulatory pathway&#xD;
      which may play a role in weight control and maintenance. Although evidence would suggest that&#xD;
      external loading in patients with obesity may promote body weight loss, this has not been&#xD;
      explored in patients following bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms regulating weight loss and the&#xD;
      potential role of the 'gravitostat' in fat free mass retention in patients following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the mechanisms that regulate weight loss, particularly&#xD;
      following bariatric surgery. Previous animal studies have suggested that there is an&#xD;
      underlying regulatory process controlled by 'the gravitostat' which is an evolutionary&#xD;
      adaptation responsible for weight control and maintenance. Studies exploring this concept in&#xD;
      rodent models have suggested that artificially increasing the animal's weight with the&#xD;
      implantation of weighted capsules results in greater weight loss in mice with obesity but&#xD;
      does not affect those of normal weight. We will use weighted vests in patients following&#xD;
      surgery to replicate this increased mechanical loading to determine whether a similar process&#xD;
      occurs in humans. This will improve our understanding of the underlying processes regulating&#xD;
      weight in patients with obesity and following bariatric surgery.&#xD;
