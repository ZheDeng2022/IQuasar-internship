    <textblock>
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To evaluate the tolerability and safety of ascending single doses of DF2755A in healthy&#xD;
      adultmale and female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics parameters of DF2755A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a dose concentration-response relationship over a wide range of doses in&#xD;
           order toselect a narrower range of dose and dosing regimen to be subsequently studied in&#xD;
           patients aftersingle administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of ascending single doses on the pharmacodynamics parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare metabolites pathway in Human with the one observed in animals&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a phase I, single center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized,&#xD;
      ascending single doses study in healthy male and female volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design consists of a double blind comparison of the test compound versus placebo in which&#xD;
      the dose is increased in successive treatment periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose was escalated in order to achieve enough safety information on an interval of doses&#xD;
      possibly encompassing both the effective dose and the maximum tolerated dose (defined as the&#xD;
      highest dose devoid of any clinical signs/symptoms).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been terminated after Part A (single ascending doses) so the methodology was&#xD;
      revised accordingly.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse Event (AE), is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment/product. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.&#xD;
Serious Adverse Event or Reaction, a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) or Reaction (SAR) is any untoward medical occurrence, including intercurrent pathology, or effect that at any dose:&#xD;
