      An version of the standard scale for syndrome differentiation of Yin Deficiency Syndrome is&#xD;
      not available yet for Chinese medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and validate the standard scale for syndrome&#xD;
      differentiation of Yin Deficiency Syndrome. The study is divided into two steps. The first&#xD;
      step is to develop the standard scale for syndrome differentiation of Yin Deficiency Syndrome&#xD;
      through expert consultation (Delphi method). The second step is to apply the scale in the&#xD;
      participants and find out the diagnostic cut-off value of the scale by comparing it with the&#xD;
      gold standard.&#xD;

        All the subjects were enrolled continuously in the TCM outpatient department. If the&#xD;
        informed consent of the researcher is obtained, the scale measurement of the study subjects&#xD;
        can be carried out.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject will be recruited from the current outpatients' clinic activity of the&#xD;
             affiliated hospitals of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine and Nanjing University&#xD;
             of Chinese Medicine. Subjects must be able to read and write in Chinese. After&#xD;
             obtained informed consent we will ask them to participate to this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All the subjects need to fill in the scale of Yin Deficiency syndrome and be diagnosed&#xD;
             by a specialist in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to determine whether they have&#xD;
             Yin deficiency syndrome. The judgment of TCM experts is the gold standard.&#xD;
