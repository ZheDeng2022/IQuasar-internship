    <textblock>
      Objective: To compare the vNOTES approach versus conventional laparoscopic approach to be&#xD;
      used in elective bilateral salpingectomy for sterilisation as an opportunistic cancer&#xD;
      prevention strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective cohort, two-centred trial. Study population: All women aged over 18&#xD;
      who are planned to undergo for definitive surgical sterilisation regardless of parity with a&#xD;
      non-prolapsed uterus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: (1) Patient satisfaction (at 1st week and 1st month of the surgery)&#xD;
      measured by The Patient Global Imression of Improvement (PGI-I), (2) Postoperative early pain&#xD;
      (Visual Analog Score (VAS) at 6th and 24th hours of the surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: (1) Conversion to laparoscopy or laparotomy, (2) duration of the&#xD;
      procedure, (3)total amount of analgesics used, (4) New-onset dyspareunia at first coitus&#xD;
      measured by the Pain subdomain of Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), (5) intraoperative&#xD;
      complications, (6) postoperative complications&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who are indicated or seek for surgical sterilisation are routinely offered&#xD;
      salpingectomy rather than tubal ligation for cancer prevention purposes as a local protocol.&#xD;
      Those patients will be offered for vNOTES approach after detailed patient counselling and&#xD;
      will be enrolled to the study upon acceptation.&#xD;

    <description>Subjective Success - Change from baseline Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) to measure sexual dysfunction at first month.&#xD;
Validated into Turkish language form will be used to compare preoperative and postoperative period. The FSFI is a multiple-trait scoring, self-report document used to assess female sexual function. It consists of 19 items that encompass six separate domains: desire, arousal, lubrication, orgasm, satisfaction, and pain. The maximum score is 36 points and the minimum score is 2 points. Only pain subdomain will be used for research purposes.</description>
