    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research was to examine the respiratory functions, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and peripheral muscle strength of patients with COPD in different groups and to&#xD;
      evaluate their correlation with the duration and prognosis of the disease in COPD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common disease characterized by airway&#xD;
      obstruction against harmful particles and gases in the airway and lungs, and is progressive,&#xD;
      treatable and preventable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of the disease in COPD is determined according to the GOLD (Global Initiative&#xD;
      for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease) guidelines (2). While determining the severity of&#xD;
      airway obstruction with the patient's spirometric values in COPD; Combined COPD assessment is&#xD;
      made with symptomatic evaluation, number of exacerbations and hospitalizations. Airway&#xD;
      restriction is numerically (GOLD 1-4), symptom evaluation and exacerbation risk combined with&#xD;
      letter grouping (Group A-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a loss of respiratory and peripheral muscle strength in COPD patients. A mixture of&#xD;
      various local and systemic causes was responsible for respiratory muscle dysfunction in COPD.&#xD;
      Immobility, systemic inflammation, hypoxia of the tissue, oxidative stress and increased&#xD;
      apoptosis of the skeletal muscle have been identified as possible pathogenic factors for loss&#xD;
      of peripheral muscle strength in COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      it was aimed to evaluate the respiratory functions, respiratory muscle strength and&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength of patients with different COPD groups clinically and to evaluate&#xD;
      their correlation with the duration and prognosis of the disease.&#xD;

    <time_frame>10 minutes after obtaining socio-demographic information (It was done between the 10th and 20th minutes of the assessment).</time_frame>
    <description>It is a non-invasive test that indirectly demonstrates respiratory muscle strength with maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) and maximal expiratory pressure (PEmax).Test were carried out according to American Thoracic Society (ATS) / European Respiratory Society (ERS) criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral Muscle Strength Assessment-Upper extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>25 minutes after obtaining socio-demographic information. After the respiratory muscle strength evaluation, the patients were rested for 5 minutes (It was done between the 25th and 35th minutes of the assessment).</time_frame>
    <description>Upper extremity: For grip strength test a manual hydraulic dynamometer was used according to the recommendations of the American Association of Hand Therapists (AETD). The patients were measured in sitting position, shoulder adduction at 90 Â°, elbow flexion, forearm in pronosupination, neutral and wrist joints in neutral position. Three consecutive measurements were obtained by giving 60-second rest breaks between measurements. The result obtained from the average of three measurements was recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peripheral Muscle Strength Assessment-Lower extremity</measure>
    <time_frame>40 minutes after obtaining socio-demographic information. After Upper extremity muscle strength evaluation patients were rested for five minutes (It was done between the 40th and 55th minutes of the assessment)</time_frame>
    <description>M. Quadriceps femoris strength was evaluated for knee extension. M. Hamstring strength was evaluated for knee flexion. The test was applied with the &quot;make test&quot; technique that requires isometric contraction. Participant was asked to maintain maximum isometric contraction for 5 seconds, and the average of 3 consecutive maximum contraction measurements performed at 30-second intervals was recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>55 minutes after obtaining socio-demographic information.</time_frame>
    <description>The PFT results of patients' performed during their routine controls taken into consideration. The percentages of the predicted values (percent) for forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, mid-expiratory flow rate (MEF25-75) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were used for statistical analysis.</description>
