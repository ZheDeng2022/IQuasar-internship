      This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of novel ILT3-targeted CAR-T cell therapy for&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (M4/M5).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our group has developed a novel anti-ILT3 CAR T cell therapy, and this pilot study is focused&#xD;
      on the safety and efficacy of the anti-ILT3 CAR-T for R/R AML(M4/M5) patients. A total of 25&#xD;
      subjects are intravenously adminstered with anti-ILT3 CAR-T cells. The dosages of CAR-T cells&#xD;
      follow the &quot;3+3&quot; dose increment program.&#xD;
