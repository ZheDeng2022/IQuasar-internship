  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the literature, studies reporting that symptoms such as limitation of motion in the neck,&#xD;
      reduced functionality, and disability and depression occur in cervical pain are frequently&#xD;
      encountered. Treatments such as medical therapy, intramuscular injections, and traditional&#xD;
      physical therapy modalities have been used in the treatment of these symptoms. In recent&#xD;
      years, the popularity of the instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization (IASTM) technique&#xD;
      in the treatment of soft tissue-related problems has increased and has been widely used in&#xD;
      studies. This technique is a low-cost, easy-to-apply, and accessible method that is&#xD;
      frequently used in extremity soft tissue problems and trigger point treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators did not find any study on the effectiveness of the IASTM technique on pain and&#xD;
      functionality in cervical region disorders. For this reason, the primary purpose of the study&#xD;
      is; While the effectiveness of the IASTM technique on pain and functionality in patients with&#xD;
      neck pain caused by cervical disc herniation, the secondary purpose is to reveal the effect&#xD;
      of IASTM on anxiety-depression.&#xD;

      Ethics Approval: The study started with the approval of the Ethics Committee of Marmara&#xD;
      University Faculty of Medicine with the 09.2019.491 protocol number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four patients who were diagnosed with cervical disc herniation (bulging, protrusion)&#xD;
      based on radiological evaluation and who achieved 100% continuity in the treatment program&#xD;
      will be included in the study. A similar study was taken as a reference when calculating the&#xD;
      sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Participants will be randomized and divided into two groups using online&#xD;
      randomization software. Conventional treatment methods will be applied to &quot;Conventional&#xD;
      Treatment Group&quot;, and IASTM will be applied to &quot;IASTM Group&quot; participants in addition to the&#xD;
      conventional treatment protocol. Conventional treatment will be applied to both groups for 4&#xD;
      weeks, 5 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Conventional treatment protocol was determined as hot pack application,&#xD;
      electrotherapy agents, and exercise program. Hotpack intervention will be made on the neck&#xD;
      and upper back area by wrapping in hot water bags and a towel for 25 minutes. The&#xD;
      electrotherapy program consists of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) and&#xD;
      ultrasound (US). Conventional TENS; 2 channels and 4 electrodes on the neck and upper&#xD;
      trapezius muscle; It will be applied for 25 minutes (Acutens Brand, frequency 100 Hz, wave&#xD;
      width 200 ms, 1-100 mA current). The current intensity will be adjusted in a way that does&#xD;
      not cause discomfort for the patient. US will be applied at an intensity of 1-2.5 W / cm2 and&#xD;
      a frequency of 1 MHz for 5 minutes to increase circulation in deep tissues. After the&#xD;
      electrotherapy application, the patients will be given an exercise program under the&#xD;
      supervision of a physiotherapist for 25 minutes. This program consists of deep flexor and&#xD;
      extensor strengthening, posture, stretching, and mobilization exercises with elastic bands.&#xD;
      The instrument-assisted soft tissue mobilization technique will be applied over the&#xD;
      superficial and deep fascia region between C1-T1 neck-shoulder segments. The instrument used&#xD;
      is made of stainless steel and will be applied using a brushing technique parallel to the&#xD;
      muscle fibers (applications at an angle of 30 °). A water-based gel will be used to prevent&#xD;
      adverse effects on the tissue due to friction. This technique will be applied as 2 sessions&#xD;
      per week and 5 minutes per session, 8 sessions in total for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic Data Form: Patients' gender, age, body mass index, and time of pain&#xD;
           onset will be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Analogue Scale: The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is an easy-to-apply and reliable&#xD;
           assessment scale used to determine the pain level of patients. VAS was created to&#xD;
           digitize values that are not expressed numerically. Scoring is made between 0-10 points.&#xD;
           &quot;0&quot; represents the absence of pain, &quot;10&quot; represents the presence of unbearable pain.&#xD;
           Using VAS, participants will be questioned for additional information such as the time&#xD;
           of onset of neck pain, its frequency, rest, and activity pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Copenhagen Neck Functional Disability Scale: It is a valid and reliable scale that&#xD;
           evaluates the disability of patients due to neck pain. The scale consists of 15 items.&#xD;
           The items are answered as &quot;Yes, No, Sometimes&quot; and scored between 0-2 points. The total&#xD;
           score is between 0 and 30 points. If the total score is &quot;0&quot;, it means &quot;no neck pain and&#xD;
           disability&quot;, &quot;30&quot; means &quot;maximum neck pain and disability&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale: It includes anxiety and depression subscales. The&#xD;
           scale consists of 14 items in total. Even-numbered items evaluate depression, and&#xD;
           odd-numbered items assess anxiety. Answers are in four-point Likert format and are&#xD;
           scored between 0 and 3. The cut-off point for the anxiety subscale of the scale was&#xD;
           reported to be 10 and 7 for the depression subscale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: The data obtained in the study will be evaluated with SPSS 11.0&#xD;
      statistical program at an 80% confidence interval and p &lt;0.05 significance level. The normal&#xD;
      distribution of the data will be examined with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and histogram&#xD;
      curves.&#xD;
