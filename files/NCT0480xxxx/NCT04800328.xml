      Reliability of infant neurological international battery (INFANIB) among hospitalized preterm&#xD;
      infants will be checked. This study will mainly focus on test-retest reliability.&#xD;

      Background: NICU is a specialised intensive care unit that treats and cares for premature or&#xD;
      critically ill newborn babies. A special category of high-risk babies consists of premature&#xD;
      infants. Their motor growth differs from that of healthy full-term infants and their&#xD;
      occurrence of motor disorders is greater. The outcome of neuromotor disorders can be&#xD;
      substantially changed by treatments during the first year of life. So in order to detect&#xD;
      these neuromotor disorder there must be a reliable screening tool present. Hence, in this&#xD;
      study we will check reliability of INFANIB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: Reliability of INFANIB among hospitalized preterm infants. Methodology: It will be&#xD;
      an observational study and will be carried out in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). The&#xD;
      study will recruit preterm infants that are stable and are present without any respiratory&#xD;
      assistive devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INFANIB screening tool will be performed on these infants. It has 20 items that measure the&#xD;
      state of the infant for body tone and posture, primitive reflexes and French angles in the&#xD;
      supine, prone, sitting, standing and suspended position upto 18 months. But we will take only&#xD;
      preterm infants so only 14 items will be assessed and infants will be scored accordingly. The&#xD;
      main focus will be on test- retest reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: A similar research has been carried out in Iran and China, that established that&#xD;
      reliability of INFANIB is excellent. Another research was carried out in India that stated&#xD;
      INFANIB's reliability to be low. So this study is required to be carried out in India to know&#xD;
      the actual results.&#xD;
