  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this project is to constitute a collection of biological samples, obtained&#xD;
      through the clinical activity of the Centre for Screening and Prevention of Atherosclerosis&#xD;
      at Toulouse University Hospital, managing patients in primary or secondary prevention for&#xD;
      cardiovascular (CV) diseases. The main objective is to validate new biomarkers with&#xD;
      prognostic value regarding the onset of future CV events. Besides, the biological collection&#xD;
      will enable patho-physiological studies on atherosclerosis related diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular (CV) diseases, particularly those secondary to atherosclerosis, are a leading&#xD;
      cause of morbidity and mortality in modern societies. Classical CV risk factors, including&#xD;
      age and gender, family history, tobacco smoking, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia and&#xD;
      obesity cannot predict more than 50% of future CV events. Use of specific scores (like the&#xD;
      SCORE chart) does not much contribute to the precise evaluation of patients classified at&#xD;
      moderate risk. Thus, more research is needed: 1) to study patho-physiological mechanisms of&#xD;
      the atherothrombotic process in order to identify new pharmacological targets and, 2) to&#xD;
      validate new biomarkers with a strong predictive value regarding the onset of hard CV&#xD;
      clinical events. Moreover, genetic polymorphisms underlie an individual's susceptibility to&#xD;
      develop atherosclerotic diseases. Identification of those gene variants might help to define&#xD;
      a personalized approach for the treatment of CV diseases. Patients consulting the Centre for&#xD;
      Screening and Prevention of Atherosclerosis (CDPA) are submitted to a personal face-to-face&#xD;
      interview addressing their life style, nutritional and smoking habits, and their physical&#xD;
      activity practice. Clinical examination includes ECG, stress test, ankle-arm systolic index,&#xD;
      ultrasonography of arteries (carotid, aorta, lower limb) and determination of a coronary&#xD;
      calcification score. Blood samples are taken up for chemistry measurements including&#xD;
      lipoproteins (triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, Lp(a)). For the specific purpose of the biological&#xD;
      collection, two supplementary blood tubes will be collected (2 x 7 ml); serum, plasma and&#xD;
      genomic DNA will be prepared. Patients will be followed up yearly for those on secondary&#xD;
      prevention and every 2nd year on primary prevention. Identical investigation will be carried&#xD;
      out at every visit. Recruitment period will spread over 5 years and follow-up will be pursued&#xD;
      up to 8 years.&#xD;
