      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of tele-yoga on functional level, disease&#xD;
      activity, spinal mobility, balance, aerobic capacity, sleep quality, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      stress, mindfulness and quality of life in patients with ankylosing spondylitis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yoga is an ancient discipline that emerged in India thousands of years ago, designed to bring&#xD;
      balance and health to the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual dimensions of the&#xD;
      individual.Due to its therapeutic effects, yoga can be considered as an alternative approach&#xD;
      for those with rheumatic disease. Because of Covid-19, which has changed the world and the&#xD;
      lifestyle of people, tele-yoga practice can be considered as an alternative instead of&#xD;
      traditional face-to-face yoga classes. The use of online platforms provides a good&#xD;
      environment for yoga training at home. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      tele-yoga on functional level, disease activity, spinal mobility, balance, sleep quality,&#xD;
      depression, mindfulness and quality of life in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 AS patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be assigned to the tele-yoga or waiting&#xD;
      list control group by the block randomization method. Patients in the tele-yoga group will&#xD;
      participate in tele-yoga sessions with a maximum of 5 people in each group by&#xD;
      video-conference method for 8 weeks, 3 days a week. Assessments will perform just before&#xD;
      starting to study and after the 8-week tele-yoga program. Patients in the waiting list&#xD;
      control group will be asked to continue their normal physical activities during the 8-week&#xD;
      study, not to start a new exercise program, and to report any changes in the drug or dosage&#xD;
      used. Control group's assessments will be performed when they are included in the study and&#xD;
      at the end of 8 weeks. After these assessments, patients who wish will participate in the&#xD;
      tele-yoga program.&#xD;

    <measure>Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index (BASFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Assess functional capacity. This self-assessment instrument consists of eight specific questions regarding function in AS and two questions reflecting the patient's ability to cope with everyday life regarding function in AS and two questions reflecting the patient's ability to cope with everyday life.The BASFI score is calculated by dividing the sum of the scores from 10 questions by 10. Score range is 0-10, with 0 reflecting no functional impairments and 10 reflecting maximal impairment.</description>
