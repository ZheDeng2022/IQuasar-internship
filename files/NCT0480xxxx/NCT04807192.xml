  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, window-of-opportunity phase 2 clinical study evaluating&#xD;
      the biological activity of preoperative Stereotactic Body RadioTherapy (SBRT) alone (Arm 1),&#xD;
      and combined with subcutaneous (SC) followed by intra-tumoral (IT) administrations of CMP-001&#xD;
      (Arm 2), in subjects with early stage TNBC. Safety and efficacy of the treatments are also&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis that the study treatment induces an increase in stromal tumor&#xD;
      infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) will be explored in each arm separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a randomized selection study, with randomization used to address&#xD;
      patient selection bias while each arm is run as an independent study. No formal statistical&#xD;
      comparison between the two arms is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients will be equally (1:1) randomized in this study (20 per arm).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, proof of principle study that explores the therapeutic window between&#xD;
      diagnosis and surgery in patients with early stage invasive TNBC not being candidates for&#xD;
      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the tumors of patients with&#xD;
      early invasive TNBC has been associated with improved prognosis. The hypothesis of this study&#xD;
      is that pre-operative SBRT with or without CpG (CMP-001), a toll-like receptor (TLR) 9&#xD;
      agonist will induce an increase in sTILs in the tumor in patients with early invasive TNBC,&#xD;
      which theoretically should improve those patients' prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence indicating that radiotherapy (RT) induces massive release of&#xD;
      tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) during cancer cell death. RT enhances tumor immunogenicity&#xD;
      and increases the presence of effector immune cells to the tumor site. It increases&#xD;
      availability of tumor antigens and promotes antigen capture, cell migration to the lymph&#xD;
      nodes, polarization towards a tolerogenic or immunogenic phenotype or migration of&#xD;
      lymphocytes into the tumor. Doses of around 8 Gy induce more important immune infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SBRT is a precise technique of irradiation within the tumor permitting high dose delivery in&#xD;
      a safe manner with tight margins. In our study, the irradiated tissue will then be removed by&#xD;
      surgery, allowing for standard of care irradiation to be administered postoperatively.&#xD;
      However, the preoperative SBRT on the tumor might increase intratumoral or stromal TILs'&#xD;
      presence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMP-001 has already been shown to increase CD8+ T cell intratumoral infiltration in early&#xD;
      clinical data, and ongoing data of a phase Ib clinical trial combining intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
      injections of CMP-001 (3-10 mg) in melanoma lesions with Pembrolizumab show rapid abscopal&#xD;
      responses in other skin lesions after 3 injections. The combination of IT CMP-001 and SBRT,&#xD;
      through increased TAA release and immunologic enhancement due to the TLR9 agonist, might&#xD;
      ultimately result in a clinically meaningful &quot; in-situ vaccination &quot; effect through&#xD;
      enhancement of the host's antitumor immunity, promoting immune eradication of micrometastatic&#xD;
      disease. The TNBC population is prone to micrometastatic disease, even at early stages;&#xD;
      therefore any of these experimental treatments might result in increased TILs' infiltration,&#xD;
      which theoretically would bring potential benefits in distant control of the disease and&#xD;
      overall survival improvements.&#xD;
