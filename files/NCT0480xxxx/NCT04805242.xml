  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind study is to determine the&#xD;
      effects of dextrose prolotherapy on shoulder pain and functions in patients with chronic&#xD;
      rotator cuff disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rotator cuff disease is a major cause of shoulder pain and disability. Non-surgical&#xD;
      treatments to reduce pain and improve function have included therapeutic exercises, NSAIDs,&#xD;
      subacromial corticosteroid injections. However, some patients are resistant to these&#xD;
      conservative treatments. In recent years, prolotherapy has increased in popularity for the&#xD;
      treatment of musculosketal conditions. Regenerative injection methods can be applied in&#xD;
      resistant chronic rotator cuff disease. In this prospective, randomized controlled, single&#xD;
      blind, interventional study, a total of 60 patients with shoulder pain due to rotator cuff&#xD;
      disease who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups using computer-generated random numbers.&#xD;
      In the dextrose prolotherapy group, ultrasound-guided prolotherapy injections will be applied&#xD;
      under aseptic conditions at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. In the salin injection group, salin injections&#xD;
      will be applied under aseptic conditions at 0, 3, and 6 weeks. Home exercise program will be&#xD;
      apply to both groups. Participants are going to evaluate before injection, and at the 1-month&#xD;
      follow-up and 3-month follow-up using the visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain during&#xD;
      activity, at rest, and at night, with the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) change&#xD;
      in pain and disability score, with The University of California and Los Angeles Rating Score&#xD;
      (UCLA) change in pain and functional score and the change in the Ultrasound Shoulder&#xD;
      Pathology Rating Scale (USPRS).&#xD;

    <description>Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) measures shoulder pain and disability. It consists of 2 chapters and 13 subtitles in total. The total score range in the scale varies between 0-130. High scores are associated with more pain, and disability, while low scores indicate well-being.</description>

    <description>UCLA Shoulder Rating Score (The University of California and Los Angeles Rating Score); Over a total of 35 points, pain, function, patient satisfaction, flexion muscle strength, flexion angle are evaluated. Pain and function are evaluated on a scale of 1-10 points each, active flexion angle, flexion muscle strength, and patient satisfaction on a scale of 1-5 points each. In total, 34-35 points are considered excellent, 29-33 points good, and values below 29 points are considered poor. This outcome measure is a composite outcome measure consisting of multiple measures.</description>
