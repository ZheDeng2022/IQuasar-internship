      The main purpose of this research study is to determine if exercise improve or worsen&#xD;
      cachexia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigator would like to better understand how cachexia may improve or&#xD;
      worsen, and how exercise may impact this process. The investigator would like to see whether&#xD;
      a progressive resistance exercise program (EXCAP©®, Exercise for Cancer Patients) can improve&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with gastrointestinal cancers with weight loss and cachexia. The&#xD;
      investigator would also like to find out if this exercise intervention improves physical&#xD;
      performance, day-to-day function, quality of life, and how exercise may affect different&#xD;
      markers in the blood over time.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Have a primary diagnosis of colorectal, esophageal, gastric, pancreatic or biliary&#xD;
             tract cancer and plans to initiate systemic chemotherapy within the next 4 weeks after&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been diagnosed as having an advanced unresectable cancer with no plans for&#xD;
             surgical intervention during the active study period (12 weeks).&#xD;

             albumin level &lt;3.5, and/or impaired glucose tolerance within the past year such as a&#xD;
             new diagnosis of diabetes, an A1C level &gt;5.7, a random glucose level &gt;200 or a fasting&#xD;
             glucose level &gt;100.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have permission from primary oncologist to engage in low to moderate intensity&#xD;
             exercise regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to read English (since the assessment materials are in printed format).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to give written informed consent.&#xD;

             wheel-chair bound, unable to perform low-to-moderate intensity exercise regimen&#xD;
             (patients unable to perform 6 minute walk or stair climb test will be allowed to&#xD;
             participate, but will be held out of these measurements).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had major surgery (excluding diagnostic procedures like laparoscopy, EGD/EUS,&#xD;
             esophageal stent placement) in the past 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be experiencing dysphagia that requires enteral or parenteral feeding for nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be enrolled on hospice at time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
