  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to increase the protection of patients, employees and the&#xD;
      organization by means of data collection about traffic collisions of ambulance cars.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Published research studies have shown not only that approximately half of Emergency Medical&#xD;
      Services (EMS) providers show signs of severe fatigue before traffic collision, but also that&#xD;
      drowsy or tired EMS providers are significantly more often injured at work. Among the&#xD;
      circumstances and factors contributing to the collisions, including environmental, road or&#xD;
      equipment factors, the real causes of the collisions remain unclear, but might be&#xD;
      investigated through interviews with participating drivers. The aim is to increase the&#xD;
      protection of patients, employees and the organization by collect data in both qualitative&#xD;
      and quantitative ways and to identify factors and measurable variables that might lead to&#xD;
      strengthen healthy driving habits under the blue lights. The factors associated with&#xD;
      ambulance accidents are not similar to those of the general driving population. The in-depth&#xD;
      analysis of the whole problem aims not only to clarify the causes of collisions, but&#xD;
      especially to create prevention steps so that such situations occur as little as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology will use the so-called mixed design - a combination of in-depth interviews&#xD;
      with participating members of collisions (employees, or patient / relative), data from the&#xD;
      road-scans and qualitative data including measurable variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A video-analysis of the collision will be performed. All data will be recorded anonymously -&#xD;
      each participant in the accident will receive a special number for coding, under which they&#xD;
      will appear. Data will be presented both in descriptive statistics and after statistical&#xD;
      analysis (chi square test for independence and Fischer's exact test at the level of&#xD;
      significance = 0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of qualitative data, in-depth interviews and their coding will be performed using&#xD;
      grounded theory (based on Strauss and Corbin methodology). The aim is to gain the same view&#xD;
      of events and their actions as the members of the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of participants depends on collision rate, which was 50 incidents in the year 2020&#xD;
      (expecting approx. 100 cases in 2 years).&#xD;
