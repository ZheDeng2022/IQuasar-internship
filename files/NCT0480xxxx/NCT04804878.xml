  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the Morehouse Total Cancer Care study is to develop an improved&#xD;
      standard of cancer care by facilitating new biomarker and drug target discovery, informatics&#xD;
      solutions, clinical trials, and &quot;personalized medicine&quot; for our community oncology partners&#xD;
      (i.e., community hospital systems, and other cancer care providers). To bring new&#xD;
      translational research to the community, Morehouse School of Medicine has initiated the Total&#xD;
      Cancer Care Program (TCCP). The TCCP establishes a unique collection of blood, tissue, other&#xD;
      biological samples and their associated data (survey data, medical records data, cancer&#xD;
      registry data, and other related data) from thousands of African American cancer patients,&#xD;
      survivors, or those at risk of having cancer. This is not a treatment trial, but a&#xD;
      longitudinal study designed to create a centralized cancer biorepository for precision&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Through this protocol, Morehouse School of Medicine and its partners will establish and&#xD;
      maintain a unique repository of blood, tissue, other biological samples and their associated&#xD;
      data (survey data, medical records data, cancer registry data, and other related data)&#xD;
      collected from thousands of patients 18 years of age or older who have cancer or are at risk&#xD;
      of developing cancer. In this protocol, investigators require an informed consent of patients&#xD;
      to study their answers to survey questions that may be collected as part of their regular&#xD;
      clinical care, permission to study their medical and related records, and permission to&#xD;
      collect excess tissues removed at the time of planned surgery, an additional tumor sampling&#xD;
      (needle passes) at the time of planned diagnostic biopsies, previously collected, stored&#xD;
      tumor tissue (if available), blood, and/or other biological samples. Additional research&#xD;
      tumor samples may be collected at the time of any diagnostic needle biopsy or endoscopic&#xD;
      biopsy or, if available, patient tissue from a previous procedure will be obtained and&#xD;
      utilized as needed. Clinical and related data will be collected on all patients from the time&#xD;
      of initial entry into the study and will continue for life.&#xD;

      Biospecimens collected under TCC protocol can include excess tissue, fluid or blood removed&#xD;
      during a clinical procedure, tissue collected as part of clinical care, and research specific&#xD;
      collection. Other biological samples, such as saliva, sputum, urine, feces, hair, surface&#xD;
      skin swabs, etc., may be collected as part of the TCCP if the collection meets criteria for&#xD;
      minimal risk and/or is part of the patient's routine standard of care.&#xD;
