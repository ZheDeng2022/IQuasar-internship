  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exacerbations, in particular during chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) infection, are very&#xD;
      important in the prognosis of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis (BE). In&#xD;
      Cystic Fibrosis patients, PA biofilms are associated with chronic respiratory infections and&#xD;
      are the primary cause of their increased morbidity and mortality. However, the presence and&#xD;
      role in exacerbations of PA biofilms, microbiome dysbiosis and inflammatory biomarkers has&#xD;
      not been studied in depth in BE patients. Our aim is to determine the association between PA&#xD;
      chronic infection and its biofilms with the number of exacerbations in the next year (primary&#xD;
      outcome), time until next exacerbation, quality of life, FEV1 and inflammatory biomarkers&#xD;
      (secondary outcomes) in BE patients with or without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (COPD). The investigators will include and follow up during 12 months post study inclusion,&#xD;
      48 patients with BE and 48 with BE-COPD, with a positive sputum culture of PA. During&#xD;
      stability and follow up (and in each exacerbation) The investigators will collect 4 sputum, 4&#xD;
      serum samples, perform spirometry, and quality of life tests every three months. For the&#xD;
      biomarkers subproject, 4 additional serum samples will be collected at: exacerbation, 3-5&#xD;
      days after treatment, at 30 days and three months post-exacerbation. Biomarkers will be&#xD;
      measured by commercial kits and Luminex. The investigators will quantify PA colony forming&#xD;
      units (CFU)/mL, their resistance pattern, their mutation frequency and isolate mucoid and&#xD;
      non-mucoid colonies. In each sputum, the investigators will analyze by Confocal Laser&#xD;
      Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) and Fluorescent in situ Hybridizatrion (FISH) PA biofilms, their&#xD;
      size, bacterial density and their in situ growth rate. Specific serum antibodies against PA&#xD;
      will be determined through Crossed Immunoelectrophoresis. In addition, the investigators will&#xD;
      indentify potential respiratory microbiome and gene expression patterns predictive for&#xD;
      exacerbations, or with a protective role against chronic PA infection, as well as their&#xD;
      association with biofilms. Microbiome analysis will be performed through the Illumina Miseq&#xD;
      platform. Finally, the investigators will explore the antimicrobial activity of novel&#xD;
      combinations of antibiotics against PA, both in in vitro planktonic cultures and in a biofilm&#xD;
      model, and will include testing of antibiotic-containing alginate nanoparticles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project will study the association between chronic PA infection in the airways and the&#xD;
      formation of biofilms in the following patient populations: 1-bronchiectasis not associated&#xD;
      with cystic fibrosis (BQ) and 2-bronchiectasis with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
      (BQ-EPOC). The primary objective is to determine the association between chronic infection by&#xD;
      PA, presence of biofilms of PA and the worst evolution of the disease measured mainly by the&#xD;
      number of exacerbations per year (primary outcome) days until the next exacerbation, quality&#xD;
      of Life and Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1), and inflammatory biomarkers (secondary&#xD;
      outcomes). For this, these parameters will be compared in patients with chronic infection by&#xD;
      PA and with the presence of biofilms of PA in the sputum (identified by FISH-CLSM) vs those&#xD;
      with PA without chronic infection and without biofilms (control negative) in each study&#xD;
      population (BE and BE-COPD). The investigators will analyze, to the recruitment and&#xD;
      sequentially (3 determinations), various aspects of the biofilms that are detailed in the&#xD;
      methodology. In addition, by comparing the microbiome before, during and after each&#xD;
      exacerbation, the investigators will try to identify those microbial patterns that entail a&#xD;
      higher risk of exacerbation, those with a protective role against chronic PA infection and&#xD;
      its relationship with biofilms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of biofilms is not yet routinely implemented in clinical practice for Chronic&#xD;
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and NonCF Bronchiectasis (BE) infections. The first&#xD;
      guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of biofilm infections were published in 2015 and&#xD;
      included many biofilm-associated infections, but not COPD or BE. There are in fact very few&#xD;
      studies on the presence of PA biofilms in these populations and on their potential role in&#xD;
      exacerbations. However, there is sound scientific evidence that PA biofilms are associated&#xD;
      with chronic respiratory infections in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients, and are the primary&#xD;
      cause of their increased morbidity and mortality. It has been reported that during chronic PA&#xD;
      lung infection in CF, PA adapts to different niches in the lungs. Both mucoid (biofilms) and&#xD;
      non-mucoid (planktonic) bacteria are present in sputum. Cells with higher mutation rate&#xD;
      develop multi-resistance to many antibiotics and their in situ growth rate is lower, since&#xD;
      bacteria decrease their metabolism conditioned by high polymorphonuclear oxygen consumption,&#xD;
      As yet, however, none of this has been described in patients with BE; in fact, there are very&#xD;
      few studies on the presence of PA biofilms in these populations, and their role in the&#xD;
      exacerbations has not been demonstrated. In addition, there is little evidence of the&#xD;
      association of the microbiome dysbiosis with chronic colonization by PA and during&#xD;
      exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic colonization by PA is present in 12-27% of patients with BE and BE-COPD, and entails&#xD;
      a worse prognosis (a 3-fold increase in mortality risk) and up to a 7-fold increase in the&#xD;
      risk of hospital admission, with an average of one additional exacerbation per patient and&#xD;
      per year. In these patients, eradication of PA is difficult, despite the fact that an&#xD;
      adequate antimicrobial treatment reduces the bacterial load and the number of exacerbations&#xD;
      and improves lung function and quality of life. One of the main challenges in patients with&#xD;
      BE is the eradication of PA, especially during the early stages of colonization by this&#xD;
      pathogen. In this situation, aggressive antibiotic treatment is recommended. However, this&#xD;
      eradication fails in a notable percentage of cases. In addition to the increase in&#xD;
      multiresistance in PA, even against quinolones, its ability to produce biofilms and survive&#xD;
      in them is one of the reasons for the failed eradication. Although the presence of PA in&#xD;
      sputum is a factor of poor prognosis in BE, biofilms have not yet been identified and&#xD;
      characterized (i.e., their presence, size, amount of alginate and metabolic status) in sputum&#xD;
      of these populations. Recently, the presence of biofilms in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL)&#xD;
      samples has been described by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in pediatric patients&#xD;
      with BE, even in those samples in which the culture was negative. This finding draws&#xD;
      attention to the lack of studies on biofilm in BE and the importance of improving diagnostic&#xD;
      tools for detection in respiratory samples, especially in patients with recurrent&#xD;
      exacerbations despite antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 30 and 50% of patients with moderate or severe COPD have BE. Its prevalence increases&#xD;
      with the severity of COPD, while 5-10% of patients with BE have COPD. Patients with COPD and&#xD;
      BE form a clinical group with its own characteristics (increased sputum production and&#xD;
      purulence, greater dyspnea and number of exacerbations), worse prognosis, possible&#xD;
      therapeutic implications and higher mortality. Although the causes of exacerbations are not&#xD;
      yet well understood, bacterial infections are thought to be involved in approximately&#xD;
      one-half of cases PA is one of the most frequent pathogens isolated from these exacerbations&#xD;
      and is associated with higher mortality. PA from sputum of chronically infected COPD patients&#xD;
      tends to be less cytotoxic and motile and produces more biofilm than PA from blood samples.&#xD;
      Therefore, some authors suggest that COPD, BE and CF present similar patterns of infection&#xD;
      and evolution. Following this reasoning, our hypothesis is that PA biofilms could be one of&#xD;
      the pathogenic mechanisms associated with both the persistence of infections and the&#xD;
      frequency and severity of exacerbations in patients with BE (with or without COPD). However,&#xD;
      further research using the recommendations of the current guidelines is needed to confirm&#xD;
      this hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors who have studied microbial dysbiosis in COPD exacerbations have seen that, along&#xD;
      with eosinophilic inflammation, it is associated with more severe exacerbations and a greater&#xD;
      fall in lung function. Longitudinal studies of the microbiome in the sputum of patients with&#xD;
      BE suggest that the management of chronic bronchial infection can be improved with a therapy&#xD;
      that is specific for its microbiome, taking into account the burden of the pathogen, the&#xD;
      stability of the community, and acute and chronic community responses to antibiotics.&#xD;
      However, the fluctuations in the microbiome and its predictive role in the exacerbations of&#xD;
      bronchiectasis have not yet been studied in depth. The study of variations in the microbiome&#xD;
      before and during the exacerbation could reveal novel therapeutic targets that may have an&#xD;
      impact on the management of patients. The results could help to determine the need to&#xD;
      administer antimicrobial treatment in patients with negative microbiological cultures during&#xD;
      the exacerbation. There is evidence that a balanced oral flora could have a protective role&#xD;
      against the colonization of saliva by PA; however, a microbiome pattern with a protective&#xD;
      effect on the upper respiratory tract against PA in BE patients and its relationship with PA&#xD;
      biofilms has not yet been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneously, systemic biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines determine the potential&#xD;
      importance of chronic PA infection and the productions of biofilms. Systemic CRP has been&#xD;
      shown to be correlated with higher BE scores such as FACED and BSI. However, there are no&#xD;
      longitudinal studies evaluating the intensity and duration of systemic inflammation caused by&#xD;
      chronic PA infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spread of antibiotic resistance and increasing prevalence of biofilm-associated&#xD;
      infections is driving demand for new means to treat such difficult to eradicate bacterial&#xD;
      infections. Recently, the WHO published a list of bacteria for with research on new&#xD;
      antibiotics is urgently needed. Drug discovery and development is a tedious, long and costly&#xD;
      endeavour that can take hundreds of millions EUR and 10-15 years from the bench discovery to&#xD;
      the bedside. Chronic PA infections associated to BE are typically treated with combinations&#xD;
      of up to three antimicrobials. Despite periodic courses of multidrug therapy, effective cure&#xD;
      for these diseases is below optimal levels. It is clear then that new therapeutic options are&#xD;
      needed to improve positive outcomes in these patients. Our approach focuses on the concept of&#xD;
      synergy, i.e. identifying synergistic combinations of antibiotics, being together more&#xD;
      effective that when used alone. The investigators aim to systematically evaluate the&#xD;
      synergistic interactions of currently used antibiotics and explore the introduction of other&#xD;
      clinically approved antibiotics. Since their pharmacology and toxicity has been already well&#xD;
      documented, any potential synergistic antibiotic combination could progress to clinical&#xD;
      trials at fraction of the standard development cost and in much shorter period of time. Along&#xD;
      with this, the nanocarrier-mediated delivery strategy has been suggested as a promising&#xD;
      approach in treatment of drug resistant infections. Nanotechnology may provide an innovative&#xD;
      platform for addressing the challenge of PA chronic infections associated to bronchiectasis,&#xD;
      with potential to manage difficult to treat infections involving multidrug-resistant (MDR)&#xD;
      bacteria. In particular, polysaccharide (PS)-based nanocarriers are ideal vehicles for&#xD;
      encapsulation of antimicrobials and alginate is an ideal carrier for pulmonary administration&#xD;
      due to its mucoadhesive properties.&#xD;
