  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle Cell Anemia (SCA) occurs in 300,000 newborns per year in the world, with 150,000&#xD;
      affected births in Nigeria, alone. With improvement in survival for children with SCA in both&#xD;
      high- and low-resource countries, neurological morbidity is an emerging significant public&#xD;
      health challenge, particularly in countries with a high rate of sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
      Both silent cerebral infarcts (SCI) and overt strokes result in significant neurological&#xD;
      morbidity and premature death. Five NIH-funded randomized controlled trials (RCT)&#xD;
      demonstrated that regular blood transfusion or hydroxyurea therapy are efficacious treatments&#xD;
      for primary and secondary stroke prevention in children with SCA. Despite the observation&#xD;
      that at least 99% of children with SCA in high-resource settings reach adulthood, and&#xD;
      approximately 60% of adults will experience one or more strokes (~50% with SCI and ~10% with&#xD;
      overt strokes) and the high disease-burden in Nigeria, the prevalence and incidence rates of&#xD;
      new and recurrent stroke (overt and silent strokes)have not been collected systematically in&#xD;
      children and young adults (16-25 years old) with SCA. In the last decade, there has been&#xD;
      growing use of stroke registries in economically advanced nations, particularly for&#xD;
      epidemiological purposes of trend analysis, clinical effectiveness, compliance to guidelines,&#xD;
      assessment of implementation, adoption of novel techniques, and quality improvement process.&#xD;
      For the first time in clinical centers in Nigeria, the Investigators will conduct an&#xD;
      observational epidemiological study to document the prevalence and track the incidence of new&#xD;
      and recurrent strokes in children and young adults with SCD. The Investigators will create a&#xD;
      stroke registry referred to as the Afolabi Stroke Registry for Children and Young Adults with&#xD;
      Sickle Cell Disease in Nigeria. The overall purpose of the stroke registry is to document the&#xD;
      natural history of SCD in a low-resource setting and to improve the quality of the care of&#xD;
      children and young adults with SCD living in Nigeria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, prospective observational cohort study. Thus, it is designed to&#xD;
      be a longitudinal registry of strokes in children and young adults with SCA in Nigeria.&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from multiple sites in Nigeria that agree to participate. This&#xD;
      study does not entail offering any intervention; all data collected will be based on standard&#xD;
      of care. As new information is obtained about the rate of stroke recurrence, risk factors for&#xD;
      strokes, and best treatment for strokes in children and young adults with SCA, the site&#xD;
      investigators will share this information with the participants in the registry and their&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and young adults with SCA will be consented to participate in the Afolabi Stroke&#xD;
      Registry after a diagnosis of a stroke has been made within 3 months of the event. To enhance&#xD;
      retention, the Investigators developed strategies to reduce loss-to-follow-up, including&#xD;
      clear written participant instructions, reimbursing patient transportation costs for&#xD;
      follow-up visits outside standard care visits, and fortnightly study phone calls. Further,&#xD;
      the Investigators will request the names, addresses, and phone numbers of two family members&#xD;
      or friends who know how to reach the participant in the event of a missed appointment (this&#xD;
      information will be kept at each site and will not be entered into the central database). A&#xD;
      medical history and physical examination, magnetic resonance imaging/magnetic resonance&#xD;
      angiography (MRI/MRA), and neurological examination will be completed prior to enrollment of&#xD;
      participants to confirm their eligibility for the study. Data on patients' demographics,&#xD;
      stroke risk factors, and severity of strokes using the National Institute of Neurological&#xD;
      Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements or modified Rankin scale at baseline and&#xD;
      annually. Children and young adults with SCA will be consented to participate in the Afolabi&#xD;
      Stroke Registry after a diagnosis of a stroke has been made within 3 months of the event. To&#xD;
      enhance retention, the Investigators developed strategies to reduce loss-to-follow-up,&#xD;
      including clear written participant instructions, reimbursing patient transportation costs&#xD;
      for follow-up visits outside standard care visits, and fortnightly study phone calls.&#xD;
      Further, the Investigators will request the names, addresses, and phone numbers of two family&#xD;
      members or friends who know how to reach the participant in the event of a missed appointment&#xD;
      (this information will be kept at each site and will not be entered into the central&#xD;
      database).A medical history and physical examination, MRI/MRA, and neurological examination&#xD;
      will be completed prior to enrollment of participants to confirm their eligibility for the&#xD;
      study. Data on patients' demographics, stroke risk factors, and severity of strokes using the&#xD;
      National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) Common Data Elements or&#xD;
      modified Rankin scale at baseline and annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be prospectively followed until at least 10 years. the Investigators&#xD;
      will collect and record all acute neurological events (overt stroke and TIA) requiring&#xD;
      hospitalization or emergency department visits during the study. Imaging and clinical data&#xD;
      collected as part of standard care will be used for secondary analysis. Research information,&#xD;
      including consent forms, questionnaires, and results of cognitive testing will be maintained&#xD;
      in a secure fashion in research charts in a locked file room or locked file cabinet, or in a&#xD;
      secure Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) database.&#xD;
