      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of n-3pufas on cognitive function in&#xD;
      patients with depression&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is often accompanied by cognitive impairment. At present, there is no effective&#xD;
      drug to improve the cognitive impairment in patients with depression, and the social function&#xD;
      and quality of life of patients are affected in varying degrees. N-3 polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (n-3pufas) are food products with high safety and few adverse reactions. Previous&#xD;
      clinical trials have also suggested that n-3pufas may help to improve cognitive impairment in&#xD;
      patients with depression, but the reported results are different. We have developed a new&#xD;
      generation of n-3pufas optimal proportion combination products and found good cognitive&#xD;
      improvement effect in animal models of depression. Therefore, this clinical research project&#xD;
      will screen out the depressive patients with cognitive impairment through the cognitive&#xD;
      function battery test (MCCB) tool for schizophrenia. On the basis of routine treatment of&#xD;
      depression, these patients will be added with the cognitive improvement formula n-3pufas&#xD;
      capsule developed by us to explore the effect of n-3pufas formula on cognitive impairment of&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
