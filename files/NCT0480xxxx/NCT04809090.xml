  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify effective methodologies to help people improve their&#xD;
      ability to adapt to psychological stress.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects involved will follow a Stress Management Training (SMT) to learn some techniques&#xD;
      to manage stress in the workplace and to increase the effectiveness of the intervention will&#xD;
      use an APP and a Conversational Agent (CA) an Artificial Intelligence (AI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the smartphone Application (APP) and CA will be to help people identify their&#xD;
      thoughts, help them understand their emotions and the events that generated them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected and analyzed will be integrated into artificial intelligence to improve&#xD;
      understanding of what people are writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these analyses, it will be possible to identify the many different variables that&#xD;
      interact in cases where a subject shows signs of stress related to adapting to change in the&#xD;
      work environment and possible resilience factors that contribute to decreasing the state of&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests will be administered at the beginning, at the end of the meetings, and 3 months after&#xD;
      the end of the sessions. Subjects will be divided into various groups to understand whether&#xD;
      APP and CA have a significant impact in increasing psychological well-being and stress coping&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Subjects who will participate in the study voluntarily will be given some pre-intervention tests (T1) to assess their psychological well-being, to understand the main coping strategies they employ to manage stress, general stress, and the presence of cognitive impairment. Questionnaires will be used to collect data and exclude those subjects who do not meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
Subjects included in the research will be randomly divided into 4 groups, one group will receive a standard 8 SMT (Stress Management Training) psychological interviews, one group will receive 8 (SMT) psychological interviews and subjects will use an APP together with a CA (Conversational Agent), one group will receive only the APP and the CA, one group will be placed in waiting-list.&#xD;
After the closing of the pathway (T2) the subjects will receive the same questionnaires they received at the beginning and again after 3 months (T3).</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to day 60</time_frame>
    <description>The GAD-7 test is a validated test for the detection of generalized anxiety disorder. GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21. Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
