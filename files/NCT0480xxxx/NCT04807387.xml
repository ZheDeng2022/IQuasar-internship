  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each year, females need surgery to create a vaginal canal or pelvic radiation to treat&#xD;
      cancer. The result is often a narrowing or scarring of their vagina. To aid in healing a&#xD;
      stent is often placed. However, current stents are poorly designed. The goal of this trial is&#xD;
      to test newly designed vaginal stents, with the hope of replacing the poorly retained and&#xD;
      uncomfortable standard of care. This trial has two aims. In the first aim, healthy&#xD;
      participants will evaluate two newly designed vaginal stents for retention, comfort, and&#xD;
      safety over 24 hours. The preferred stent will then be worn by the healthy participants for 2&#xD;
      weeks, again evaluating retention, comfort, and safety. In the second aim, the stents will be&#xD;
      evaluated by two different patient populations. Adolescent participants undergoing vaginal&#xD;
      surgery for genetic anomalies, will have a stent placed following surgery for continuous wear&#xD;
      for 2 weeks. Adult participants undergoing vaginal brachytherapy will have the stent placed&#xD;
      following the final brachytherapy treatment. These participants will wear the stent&#xD;
      continuously for 2 weeks, followed by an additional 2 weeks of continuous wear. Each&#xD;
      participant will evaluate the stent for retention, comfort, and safety. We hypothesize the&#xD;
      newly designed stents will be retained longer and be more comfortable compared to current&#xD;
      standards of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After surgery or radiation to the vaginal area, a common patient risk is that their vaginal&#xD;
      tissue sticks together and scars. This can cause the vaginal canal to narrow or shorten. This&#xD;
      can occur in up to 73% of patients and to fix the scarring, more surgery or uncomfortable&#xD;
      procedures may be needed to widen the canal. To prevent the problem of scarring after surgery&#xD;
      or radiation, patients should wear a stent to hold open the vaginal canal. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      current stents are poorly made and not very advanced. The result can be a poor fit to the&#xD;
      vagina, movement of the stent, and patients not being able to wear the stent for a long&#xD;
      enough time to keep the vaginal tissue from scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of this trial is for healthy participants to evaluate two newly designed&#xD;
      stents. Each participant will have a stent placed for 24 hours, removed for 24 hours, and the&#xD;
      second stent placed for 24 hours. The participants will evaluate the stent on comfort (during&#xD;
      insertion, wearing, and removal), retention, any impact on daily functions, and chose which&#xD;
      stent performed better overall. That stent will then be placed in the healthy participants&#xD;
      for 2 weeks of continuous wear. Participants will answer daily questionnaires on comfort,&#xD;
      retention, and any adverse effects. Physicians will also be asked to complete questionnaires&#xD;
      at each appointment related to stent performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the trial is for two different patient populations to evaluate the&#xD;
      preferred stent chosen by the healthy participants. Adolescent girls undergoing vaginal&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery for vaginal anomalies will have a stent placed following surgery.&#xD;
      During the two weeks of continuous wear, participants will be asked to answer daily&#xD;
      questionnaires on comfort, retention, and adverse effects. The stent will be removed at two&#xD;
      weeks, and participants will be asked to complete a follow-up questionnaire at each of their&#xD;
      standard of care appointments, 2, 4, and 6 weeks, 3, 6, and 12 months. Adult females&#xD;
      undergoing vaginal brachytherapy will have a stent placed after their last brachytherapy&#xD;
      treatment. The participants will wear the stent continuously for 2 weeks and be asked to&#xD;
      answer daily questionnaires on comfort, retention, and adverse effects. Participants will&#xD;
      have a 2-week follow-up, during which the stent will be removed, they will be examined, and&#xD;
      the stent will be replaced for 2 more weeks of continuous wear. At the 4-week follow-up, the&#xD;
      stent will be removed and subsequent standard of care follow-ups will continue at 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months. Physicians will also be asked to complete questionnaires at each appointment&#xD;
      related to stent performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all phases of the trial, the data safety monitoring board will meet at regularly&#xD;
      scheduled meetings and immediately after any severe or unanticipated adverse event. After our&#xD;
      12 months of follow up, data collected from both participant and physician questionnaires&#xD;
      will be analyzed by the study bio-statistician and compared to retrospective data.&#xD;
