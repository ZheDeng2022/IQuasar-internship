  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal treatment of deep caries lesions extended to the inner third of dentin is still&#xD;
      under discussion. Cariologists prefer selective caries removal, meanwhile endodontists&#xD;
      recommend partial pulpotomy. So far, no clinical trial compared both interventions against&#xD;
      each other. Additionally, current literature indicates alternative treatment options for&#xD;
      irreversible pulpitis besides conventional orthograde root canal treatments like the partial&#xD;
      or full pulpotomy. Existing clinical studies on this topic were using different clinical&#xD;
      protocols, especially with regards to the accepted time to achieve hemostasis. It is still&#xD;
      unclear, if the pulpal bleeding time prior to the capping procedure affects the outcome of&#xD;
      partial or full pulpotomy.&#xD;

      Goals of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      In consequence, the investigators aim to proof the effectiveness of different therapies and&#xD;
      protocols in two study arms, depending on the initial diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: Randomized-controlled clinical non-inferiority trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth with reversible pulpitis will be included accordingly to the inclusion criteria (see&#xD;
      below). After randomization, teeth will be treated either with selective caries removal&#xD;
      (indirect pulp capping) or partial pulpotomy pursuant to the below described clinical&#xD;
      protocol. The intention of this study arm is to evaluate both therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Prospective non-controlled clinical intervention trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth with reversible pulpitis according to the inclusion criteria (see below) will be&#xD;
      included. Depending on the clinical situation, a partial or full pulpotomy will be conducted&#xD;
      accordingly to the defined clinical protocols (see below). In this study arm, the&#xD;
      investigators want to evaluate 1) different times of pulpal bleeding before pulp capping and&#xD;
      2) partial versus full pulpotomy on the clinical outcome in teeth with irreversible pulpitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no statistically significant difference in the clinical success (absence of any&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and signs of inflammation) between both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no statistically significant difference in the radiographical success (absence of&#xD;
      any pathosis) between both treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is estimated to complete enrollment within 18 months from study initiation. In&#xD;
      cases of unforeseeable events, enrollment will remain open until the study goal is met. For&#xD;
      each subject, participation will be a maximum of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Products intended use&#xD;
&#xD;
      All products the investigators intend to use are registered medicine products and well&#xD;
      established on the market:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Biodentine™ (Septodont, Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France): Biodentine™ is a hydraulic calcium&#xD;
      silicate cement (HSC), which is commonly used for vital pulp therapy in both, children and&#xD;
      adults. Many clinical trials were successfully conducted with this material. Compared to&#xD;
      other HSC, the effect of tooth staining is much less likely and the clinical perfomance is&#xD;
      comparable to other HSC. The main advantage of Biodentine™ compared to other HSC is, that&#xD;
      Biodentine™ needs only 15 min for setting up, other HSC show significantly longer settings&#xD;
      times. Septodont recommends using a self-etch adhesive in combination with Biodentine™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Scotchbond Universal™ and Filtek Supreme XTE™ Scotchbond Universal™ is a self-etch adhesive&#xD;
      and Filtek Supreme XTE™ is a universal restorative material for direct restorations (3M,&#xD;
      Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA). Both materials are commercially available since many years and&#xD;
      approved in several clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product acquisition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biodentine™, Scotchbond Universal™ and Filtek Supreme XTE™ will be sponsored by the&#xD;
      manufacturer. All other materials of routine use will be purchased by the centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential benefits and risks to patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every effort is taken during all treatments to minimize the risks to the patients. The&#xD;
      primary goal of arms A and B is to evaluate three well established interventions. In&#xD;
      consequence, the investigators expect no higher risks to the patients compared to routine&#xD;
      treatments in our clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefit in participating for the patient is, that the investigators offer minimally&#xD;
      invasive interventions for lower costs than usual. In cases of failure, the investigators&#xD;
      follow our protocol as described in &quot;failure management&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single-blind multi-center study with two arms involving two hundred and forty-nine (249)&#xD;
      subjects undergoing a deep caries therapy. Four dental clinics with board certified&#xD;
      endodontists contribute to this study in terms of patient recruitment and treatment. The&#xD;
      centers are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Department for Oral Diagnostics, Digital Health&#xD;
           and Health Services Research, Aßmannshauser Str. 4-6, 14197 Berlin Local principal&#xD;
           investigator and study leader: Dr. Sascha Herbst&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. B1 Zahnärzte, Clayallee 177, 14195 Berlin Local principal investigator: Dr. Claus&#xD;
           Schüttler-Janikulla&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endo Berlin Süd, Alt-Buckow 9-11, 12349 Berlin Local principal investigator: ZÄ Olga&#xD;
           Bleckmann&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Dentalsplace, Kurfürstendamm 22 Local principal investigator: Dr. Markus Lietzau, M.Sc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every patient has to give informed consent for participating in one of both study arms. To&#xD;
      avoid clustering, only one tooth per patient can be included. Arm A is designed as a&#xD;
      randomized-controlled and arm B as a non-controlled intervention trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention in study arm B will be conducted adapted to the clinical findings after&#xD;
      entering slightly the pulp chamber. Depending on the pulpal bleeding time, either a partial&#xD;
      pulpotomy or a full pulpotomy will be conducted, according to the predefined protocol&#xD;
      mentioned in &quot;treatment protocol for arm A&quot;. Due to the experimental design, only single&#xD;
      blinding of the patient is feasible.&#xD;
