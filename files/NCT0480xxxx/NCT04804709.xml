  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The blood brain barrier (BBB) prevents some drugs from successfully reaching the target&#xD;
      tumor. Focused Ultrasound (FUS) using microbubbles and neuro-navigator-controlled sonication&#xD;
      is a non-invasive method of temporarily opening up the blood brain barrier to allow a greater&#xD;
      concentration of the drug to reach into the brain tumor. This may improve response and may&#xD;
      also reduce system side effects in the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of safely opening the BBB in&#xD;
      children with progressive diffuse midline gliomas (DMG) treated with oral Panobinostat using&#xD;
      FUS with microbubbles and neuro-navigator-controlled sonication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the study, the investigators will be opening up the BBB temporarily in&#xD;
      one, two, or three locations around the tumor using the non-invasive FUS technology, and&#xD;
      administrating oral Panobinostat in children with progressive DMG.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs), constitute 10% of all pediatric central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      tumors. Subjects with Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Gliomas (DIPG) have a poor prognosis with a&#xD;
      median survival that is usually reported to be 9 months, and nearly 90% of children die&#xD;
      within 18 months from diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is radiation to the primary tumor&#xD;
      site. Surgical resection does not influence the outcome and is often not feasible in this&#xD;
      part of the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many promising drugs for central nervous system (CNS) disorders have failed to attain&#xD;
      clinical success due to an intact blood brain barrier (BBB), limiting their access from the&#xD;
      systemic circulation into the brain. Systemic administration of high doses may increase&#xD;
      delivery to the brain, but this approach risks significant side effects and systemic&#xD;
      toxicities. Direct delivery of the drugs to the brain by injection into the parenchyma&#xD;
      bypasses the BBB, however, drug distribution from the site of injection tends to be limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of using focused ultrasound (FUS) with microbubbles and&#xD;
      neuro-navigator-controlled sonication can temporarily open up the blood brain barrier and&#xD;
      allow for a greater concentration of drug to reach the tumor, thus potentially improving&#xD;
      response in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the current study, the investigators are planning to evaluate the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of using FUS and open-space neuronavigator-controlled sonication to open one, two, or three&#xD;
      tumor sites. For the purpose of the study, investigators will be administrating oral&#xD;
      Panobinostat in children with progressive DMG. This drug has a known toxicity profile, dose,&#xD;
      and well-documented efficacy against many metastatic cancers. Successful opening and closing&#xD;
      of the BBB will be confirmed with periodic magnetic resonance imaging (MRIs).&#xD;

    <description>The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of opening the BBB safely using specific parameters of focused ultrasound in progressive/recurrent diffuse midline gliomas in one, two, or three tumor sites. The trial will follow a 3+3 Number of Tumor Sites (NOTS) escalation scheme. The &quot;number of tumor sites&quot; in reference to here is the number of openings in the blood-brain barrier using Focused Ultrasound (FUS). Subjects will start the first cycle of the treatment arm with 1 tumor site and move on to incrementing NOTS levels if no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed.</description>
