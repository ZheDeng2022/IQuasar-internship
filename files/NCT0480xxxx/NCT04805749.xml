  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis are bowel disease (IBS) with an autoimmune&#xD;
      component believed to affect approximately 1 in 140 Canadians. Despite this high prevalence,&#xD;
      more than 30% patients with IBD have to live with recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms that is&#xD;
      poorly relieved by allopathic medicine. Numerous studies have shown that the quality of life&#xD;
      of individuals with IBS is lower than that of the general population. Since visceral&#xD;
      manipulations have been shown to be effective in reducing the main discomforts associated&#xD;
      with IBS during clinical interventions, it seems likely that it may provide similar relief to&#xD;
      patients with IBD. To our best knowledge, no study has evaluated the impact of osteopathic&#xD;
      manual therapy on neuro-immuno-vascular modulation of intestine to reduce IBS symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the relevance of an osteopathic approach addressing the&#xD;
      brain-intestine axis in order to improve symptomatology in subject suffering from IBD by&#xD;
      modulating inflammation and vagal tone.&#xD;

      For this study, 10 to 12 participant (18 to 65 years) with Inflammatory Bowel Disease (in&#xD;
      remission state) will be recruited to receiving visceral osteopathic therapy. Participant&#xD;
      will received four standardized osteopathic session of 45 minutes (1 session every 7 days:&#xD;
      week 0, 1, 2 and 3) and a follow up visit at week 4. The osteopathic protocol will&#xD;
      specifically address the gut-to-brain neuro-immuno-vascular axis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Global quality of life and severity of IBS-like symptoms will be a assess at week 0, 2 and 4&#xD;
      using three standardized questionnaires. Gut permeability and intestinal inflammation will be&#xD;
      assessed at week 0 and 4 by measuring Zonulin (pre-Haptoglobin 2), Histamine and Diamine&#xD;
      Oxidase (DO) levels respectively. Vagal tone at the beginning and at the end of each&#xD;
      osteopathic session will be evaluate using heart rate variability (HRV) measurements.&#xD;

Zonulin (Pre-Haptoglobin 2) is a protein found in intestinal cells, with production and release mimicking the effect of certain bacterial toxins on the tight junctions of the small intestine. Zonulin binds to a specific receptor only on the luminal surface of the intestinal epithelia and triggers a cascade of biochemical processes that induces tight junction (TJ) disassembly and a subsequent permeability increase of the intestinal epithelia. The Zonulin range is from 1 to 20 ng/ml.&#xD;
Values between 1 and 6 ng/ml are considered as optimal Values between 6 and 10 ng/ml are considered as borderline Values from 10 to 20 ng/ml are considered as elevated</description>
