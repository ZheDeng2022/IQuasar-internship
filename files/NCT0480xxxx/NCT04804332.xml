  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Elective immediate dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) for miscarriage is associated with&#xD;
      the occurrence of intrauterine adhesions (IUA). IUAs may be associated with subsequent&#xD;
      subfertility and premature birth. Recent studies have shown that in women with miscarriage,&#xD;
      medical treatment (misoprostol/mifepristone) is an effective alternative for curettage. A&#xD;
      problem with medication and expectant management is that after initial treatment, sonographic&#xD;
      findings during follow-up frequently show incomplete evacuation of uterine retained products&#xD;
      of conception (RPOC), which often lead to additional interventions or expectant&#xD;
      time-consuming management limiting the benefits of medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To assess, in women with a wish for immediate future pregnancy and RPOC after&#xD;
      non-surgical management of a miscarriage, as diagnosed with sonography, the effects of&#xD;
      operative hysteroscopy versus expectant management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Multicenter randomized clinical trial. Study population: Patients after&#xD;
      non-surgical management of a miscarriage with sonographic evidence of RPOC at the follow-up&#xD;
      visit 6 weeks after initial treatment and wish for immediate (within 6 months) future&#xD;
      pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: operative hysteroscopy versus expectant management. Main study&#xD;
      parameters/endpoints: The primary outcome is time to next pregnancy, as substantiated by a&#xD;
      positive urinary or serum hCG test. Secondary outcomes are Quality of Life (QOL) scores&#xD;
      assessed with the SF-36, HADS and EQ-5D-5L, the need for additional and/or unscheduled&#xD;
      treatments and/or visits and complications. Furthermore, data on the course of pregnancy -&#xD;
      including miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy and live birth - are documented in those women who&#xD;
      have an ongoing pregnancy after randomization during the study follow up period. In addition,&#xD;
      iMTA PCQ questionnaires and health-costs are measured in all patients to perform a&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 244 (122 per arm) women will be sufficient to answer the questions on the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Women participating in the study will be asked to fill out questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, 8 weeks and 6 months after randomization. We don not expect specific risks as a&#xD;
      result of either the intervention or expectant management.&#xD;

      Design : RCT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multicenter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized controlled&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parallel group design&#xD;

        -  Non-blinded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the effectiveness in terms of time to next pregnancy between operative&#xD;
      hysteroscopy and expectant management in patients with sonographic evidence of RPOC after&#xD;
      primary non-surgical management of miscarriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Effectiveness objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare the effectiveness between operative hysteroscopy and expectant management&#xD;
           with respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Generic quality of life (QOL) (as measured by SF-36, HADS (Hospital Anxiety and&#xD;
                Depression Scale)) and EQ-5D-5L 6 months after randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Course of pregnancy in those women who have an ongoing pregnancy after&#xD;
                randomization during the study follow-up period (including miscarriage, ectopic&#xD;
                pregnancy and live birth)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare the safety between operative hysteroscopy and expectant management with&#xD;
           respect to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Necessity for additional treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Out-of-protocol/unscheduled visits to the outpatient clinic or general practitioner&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cost-effectiveness objectives To compare the health related costs between operative&#xD;
           hysteroscopy and expectant management.&#xD;

    <description>Operative hysteroscopy is performed without or under local, regional or general anesthesia according to the local protocol preferably within 2 to 3 weeks after randomization. In case of highly vascularized RPOC, a repeat sonogram is performed 2 to 4 weeks after randomization to check for persistence of vascularity and to optimize operative timing. Operative hysteroscopy is then performed within 2 to 3 weeks after the repeat sonogram. Removal of the RPOC is performed by an experienced gynecologist using hysteroscopic morcellation (TruClearTM Hysteroscopic Tissue Removal System (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA)) and according to the local protocol.</description>
