  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a novel ostomy ring device will be assessed for safety and efficacy in&#xD;
      increasing the lifespan of ostomy pouching equipment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this crossover design trial, patients will be asked to first wear their normal ostomy&#xD;
      pouching equipment for 28 days followed by 28 days with the OstoRing®. Patients may choose to&#xD;
      continue using the OstoRing for an additional 19 days. Study visits will occur between each&#xD;
      section of the trial and will involve a skin assessment and quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
      Additionally, over the course of the trial, participants will be asked to fill out a survey&#xD;
      and take a picture of their stoma with ostomy pouching change.&#xD;

    <measure>Coloplast Tool Skin Assessment Score</measure>
    <time_frame>75 days</time_frame>
    <description>The skin surrounding the peristomal area will be assessed at all study visits utilizing the coloplast skin score tool. Skin score may range from 0 to 15 with a smaller score indicating better skin condition in the peristomal area.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>City of Hope Quality of Life Ostomy Questionnaire Score</measure>
    <time_frame>75 days</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of life will be assessed at all study visits utilizing the City of Hope Quality of Life Ostomy Questionnaire. This instrument contains 43 questions with answers on a Likert scale from 1 to 10. The final score is the sum of all responses divided by the total number questions which gives a final score from 1 to 10. Greater score on this survey is indicative of a better quality of life.</description>
