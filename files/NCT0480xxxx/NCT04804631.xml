    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the problems and a range of nutritional and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes that occur with two feeding tubes used by children having a bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
      Children and parents will also be interviewed to ask about their experiences of tube feeding.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Bone marrow transplant (BMT) is the only potentially curative treatment for&#xD;
      children with malignant and non-malignant diseases. Chemotherapy provided during BMT causes&#xD;
      side-effects including diarrhoea and vomiting meaning all children become unable to eat and&#xD;
      require tube feeding. All 16 centres in the UK use a nasogastric tube. Great Ormond Street&#xD;
      Hospital offer families a gastrostomy as an alternative. Minimal published literature exists&#xD;
      on gastrostomies in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: Investigate complications, outcomes and family experiences of gastrostomy tubes in&#xD;
      paediatric BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Survey current nutrition practices, use and opinions towards gastrostomy tubes in UK&#xD;
           paediatric BMT centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare clinical outcomes and complications occurring from gastrostomy versus&#xD;
           nasogastric tubes in children during BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate decision making and experiences of families regarding tube feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A multiphase, convergent parallel mixed methods study across 3 work packages (WPs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Survey: A survey will be sent to a dietitian, nurse and doctor (the staff involved in&#xD;
           tube feeding) in each UK paediatric BMT centre. Questions will focus on nutrition&#xD;
           practices, and current use and opinions of gastrostomies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Prospective cohort study: Outcomes will be compared between children fed via gastrostomy&#xD;
           versus nasogastric tube from admission to six months post-BMT. All children transplanted&#xD;
           over one year at one centre will be included. Outcomes including complications occurring&#xD;
           with both tubes, dietary intake and anthropometry will be investigated. Anticipated&#xD;
           sample size is 9-15 children fed via gastrostomy, 30-50 via nasogastric tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Family interviews: Families from WP 2 will be invited to be interviewed at two times; on&#xD;
           admission to discuss why they did or did not choose a gastrostomy, and one month after&#xD;
           discharge to discuss their experience of tube feeding. Creative methods including&#xD;
           drawing and scrapbooks will be used during children's interviews to help them articulate&#xD;
           their thoughts. Parents will take part in semi-structured interviews.&#xD;

        All children admitted to the centre over 12 months (allowing six months follow up) for an&#xD;
        allogeneic BMT, for any diagnosis (malignant or non-malignant), planned to receive any type&#xD;
        of conditioning and any donor type, will be eligible and vetted according to the&#xD;
        inclusion/exclusion criteria. Children transplanted at the centre mainly come from London,&#xD;
        but can be from other parts of the UK too, and are anywhere between a few months old up to&#xD;
        the eldest of around 13 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Admitted to the centre during the study period for an allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
             transplant (BMT) for any diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving any conditioning regimen, donor type and stem cell source.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children admitted for their second or more BMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children admitted on an established enteral tube feeding regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NHS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children receiving first-line, prophylactic, parenteral nutrition as this is not the&#xD;
             standard nutrition pathway of most children receiving BMT at the centre. This is&#xD;
             usually given in specific circumstances such as children receiving cord blood&#xD;
             transplants or those with gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autologous BMT, including children receiving chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy&#xD;
             (CAR-T).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No feeding tube placed and no nutrition support required from tube feeding or&#xD;
             parenteral nutrition. Children rarely do not require any form of nutrition support.&#xD;
