  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young adult survivors of breast and gynecologic cancer face a number of challenges, including&#xD;
      interrupted life plans. As many as two-thirds of these young survivors experience negative&#xD;
      effects of cancer and cancer treatment on their reproductive health, including sexual&#xD;
      function and ability to have children. These are among the most distressing aspects of life&#xD;
      after cancer for young survivors and their partners, and when left unaddressed, lead to&#xD;
      poorer mental health and quality of life. Yet, surprisingly, evidence-based programs are not&#xD;
      available to help young couples manage this aspect of life after cancer. In this study, we&#xD;
      will adapt and evaluate an intervention designed to help young couples cope with and&#xD;
      communicate about cancer-related reproductive and sexual health concerns.&#xD;

      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Phase I). Systematically adapt an empirically supported couple-based skills training&#xD;
      intervention to help young breast and gynecologic cancer (BGC) survivors and their partners&#xD;
      jointly manage the reproductive and sexual health consequences of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Phase II - Quantitative). Evaluate the efficacy of the intervention and hypothesized&#xD;
      mediators by conducting a randomized trial. We will evaluate the efficacy of the newly&#xD;
      adapted intervention, Opening the Conversation (OC), on survivors' and their partners'&#xD;
      reproductive and sexual distress as well as the relationship, sexual, and psychosocial health&#xD;
      outcomes. We will determine whether dyadic coping and communication mediate intervention&#xD;
      effects on survivors' and partners' reproductive and sexual distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Phase II - Qualitative). Evaluate couples' experiences within and across conditions to&#xD;
      gain in-depth knowledge of intervention components that influence hypothesized mediators and&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
