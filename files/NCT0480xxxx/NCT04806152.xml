  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examined the effects of combined-modality exercise training (resistance,&#xD;
      endurance, flexibility and balance) on muscle mass, muscle function and physical activity in&#xD;
      community-dwelling elderly living in Jamaica who had been characterised as having sarcopenia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Community-dwelling seniors aged 60 years and older were screened for muscle mass and function&#xD;
      (grip strength and walk speed) and persons with sarcopenia were identified using the European&#xD;
      Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older Persons (EWGSOP) algorithm for case finding (N=1344). Of&#xD;
      the 77 seniors with sarcopenia, 38 consented to participate and were randomly allocated to&#xD;
      receive 6 months combined-modality high intensity treadmill based exercise and a 'usual care'&#xD;
      home exercise programme. A comparison of the effects of treatment assignment on muscle mass,&#xD;
      function, fitness, physical activity level and disability was done. Participants in the&#xD;
      supervised combined-modality high intensity group were required to attend sessions 3 times&#xD;
      per week; participants in the home exercise programme were required to attend 1 supervised&#xD;
      session at the start of their 6-month intervention. Outcomes were assessed at baseline and at&#xD;
      the end of the 6-month intervention. Data were analysed using standard statistical parametric&#xD;
      and non-parametric methods including repeated measures analysis of variance to determine&#xD;
      changes in outcomes and regression to establish determinants of outcomes.&#xD;

  <why_stopped>
    The COVID19 outbreak began March 2020 in Jamaica. Associated risks, prohibitive cost of&#xD;
    mitigating those risks for study participants and locally enacted legislation militated against&#xD;
    further recruitment and intervention activities.&#xD;

    <description>Participants were given Treadmill exercise training, lower extremity progressive resistance training using a Cybex leg press machine, and a 1-hour adaptive physical activity (APA) programme in which participants were required to walk for 12 minutes through an obstacle course in which they must clear 10 cm high boards, climb 3 steps and walk sideways through hula-hoops placed on the floor all the while dual-tasking i.e. waving at strategically placed signs, conversing while walking and picking up objects. Participants also performed exercises at the parallel bars which included weight-shifting from leg to leg and half-squatting; they were also guided through seated upper- and lower-limb stretching exercises for range of motion and trunk mobility. All exercise sessions were supervised by physiotherapists. For two of the weekdays on which participants did not attend supervised training, they were asked to walk for 30 minutes at home and perform the APA exercises described above.</description>
