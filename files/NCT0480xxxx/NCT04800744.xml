  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-operative anxiety is a very common condition that plagues many patients prior to&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. Anxious patients are most frequently treated with sedatives in the&#xD;
      perioperative period, which can have a negative impact on post-operative recovery, especially&#xD;
      when combined with narcotic pain medications. Pre-operative anxiety, depression and&#xD;
      catastrophizing have been shown to be factors leading to an increase of up to 50% of&#xD;
      postoperative pain and opioid requirement. Therefore, the control of mood disorders prior to&#xD;
      surgery may help with the perioperative pain management and postoperative opioid requirement.&#xD;
      The use of essential oils in aromatherapy have long been associated with psychological&#xD;
      wellness, and anecdotal reports suggest that aromatherapy, specifically lavender scent, may&#xD;
      reduce anxiety. This study will assess the role of the elequil aromatab #373&#xD;
      Lavender-Peppermint in improving post-surgical quality of life in patients undergoing&#xD;
      unilateral hip replacement surgery and in patients undergoing unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      mastectomy. Additionally, this study will follow subjects through their perioperative course&#xD;
      to measure to what degree the aromatherapy intervention helps to reduce instances of&#xD;
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and opioid requirement following surgery.&#xD;

      Potential subjects will be recruited from the office of orthopedic surgeon Dr. Michael&#xD;
      O'Malley or Dr. Brian Klatt, as well as the office of plastic surgeon Dr. Carolyn De La Cruz&#xD;
      and will be provided with a recruitment flier. The patient will have the option of contacting&#xD;
      our research team to discuss the study further, or, if they express interest in the study to&#xD;
      the surgeon's office, their name will be given to us by the surgeon's office staff. If our&#xD;
      research team is contacted, or if we reach out based upon the list of interested potential&#xD;
      subjects, we will discuss the study over the telephone with the patient with the&#xD;
      understanding that they will sign the informed consent with Dr. Chelly or a co-investigator&#xD;
      on the day of surgery in the pre-operative area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that meet inclusion criteria, self report anxiety, and provide informed consent will&#xD;
      complete the PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short Form 8a before completing any other&#xD;
      questionnaires. If the subject scores ≥19 on the PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short&#xD;
      Form 8a they will be enrolled in the study. However, if the subject scores &lt;19 on the PROMIS&#xD;
      Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short Form 8a they will be considered a screen fail and&#xD;
      excluded from participation in the study. Once the subject is enrolled, they will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the PROMIS Emotional Distress-Depression-Short Form, the PROMIS Pain Interference -&#xD;
      Short Form 6b and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale. After completion of these forms, subjects&#xD;
      will be equally randomized to either the active comparator aromatab (sweet almond oil) or&#xD;
      treatment aromatab (lavendar peppermint). Study coordinators, Co-Is, and subjects will be&#xD;
      blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aromatab will be placed on the patient's clothing at least one hour prior to surgery&#xD;
      while the patient is in same day admission. After surgery, the subject will be assessed for&#xD;
      post-operative nausea, pain scores, and pain medication requirement in the PACU and then&#xD;
      assessed daily until discharge. At the 12-hour mark, the subject will receive another new&#xD;
      patch that is consistent with their randomization arm. They will apply a new patch every 12&#xD;
      hours for the duration of the 72-hour treatment window with the last patch being placed at 60&#xD;
      hrs post-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon discharge, subjects will receive patches for the remaining 72-hour treatment window. At&#xD;
      this time, subjects will be asked an overall satisfaction questionnaire measured on a scale&#xD;
      to 0-10 (0=lowest satisfaction and 10=highest satisfaction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be contacted via Redcap 24 hours, 48 hours and 7 days post-operative and&#xD;
      asked to complete PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short Form 8a, the PROMIS Emotional&#xD;
      Distress-Depression-Short Form , the PROMIS Pain Interference - Short Form 6b and the Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale. In addition to this, the subject will be asked to report in a Redcap&#xD;
      survey VAS pain score, incidence of nausea and vomiting, and their opioid consumption at 24&#xD;
      hrs, 48 hrs and 7 days post-operative. The subjects will also receive reminders via Redcap at&#xD;
      12hrs, 24hrs, 36hrs, 48hrs, and 60 hrs to change their patch, and will be asked to document&#xD;
      in Redcap the time this is complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month following the surgery the subject will be contacted via Redcap to determine their&#xD;
      level of pain (VAS), opioid consumption, incidence of nausea and vomiting, functional&#xD;
      recovery using SF12, and the PROMIS Emotional Distress - Anxiety - Short Form 8a, the PROMIS&#xD;
      Emotional Distress-Depression-Short Form, PROMIS Pain Interference - Short Form 6b and Pain&#xD;
      Catastrophizing Scale. Subjects who are contacted via Redcap to complete follow-up&#xD;
      questionnaires and do not complete them on the day they are assigned will be contacted via&#xD;
      phone for reminder.&#xD;

    <description>Post-operative pain ratings will be measured by the assessment of the participant's answers to the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). This measurement is a visual scale from 0-10, with 0 being no pain, 5 being moderate pain and 10 being the worst imaginable pain. The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 10.The participant will be asked to score pain at its best and worst over the period since they were last asked. Higher scores present a worse outcome.</description>

There are 13 statements related to pain that participants will record experiencing on a scale of 0 being experienced not at all to 4 being experienced all of the time. The lowest possible score is 0 and the highest possible score is 52. Higher scores present a worse outcome.</description>
