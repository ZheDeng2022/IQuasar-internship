  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the beginning of the implant dentistry, a large variety of materials have been used for&#xD;
      restoring single or multiple implants, such as gold, titanium, alumina (Al2O3), and zirconia&#xD;
      (ZrO2). Patient physical and esthetic requirements play one of the most important role in&#xD;
      making decisions related to which material should be chosen. In fact, long-term stability,&#xD;
      compatibility with oral tissues esthetics and costs should be considered. Several studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that both titanium and zirconia have an excellent biocompatibility and long-term&#xD;
      stability even though something could change in terms of esthetic outcomes. Related to&#xD;
      esthetics, the color of the peri-implant mucosa is an essential factor that clinicians have&#xD;
      to take in to account. Unfortunately, discoloration of peri-implant mucosa sometimes happens.&#xD;
      Some authors hypothesized that titanium abutments could provoke a grayish appearance of the&#xD;
      mucosa, and, in order to avoid this problem, other authors suggested to perform augmentation&#xD;
      of the peri-implant soft tissue thickness in the esthetic area. A study on pig maxillae found&#xD;
      that the type of abutment or crown material and the mucosa thickness have significant&#xD;
      influences on color changes of the mucosa. Titanium induced the most prominent color change,&#xD;
      and, in patients with thinner mucosa, zirconia induced the least noticeable color changes.&#xD;
      Nowadays, to reliably evaluate differences in color in implantology, the most used method is&#xD;
      spectrophotometry, due to the capacity of detecting even small color differences and due to&#xD;
      the higher reproducibility. Several investigations on pig jaws using spectrophotometric&#xD;
      measurements were carried out recently, with the aim of investigating the color changes. It&#xD;
      was found that generally titanium abutment lead to a more pronounced discoloration; however,&#xD;
      gingival thickness greater than 2 mm did not reveal any difference related to the type of&#xD;
      abutments. In addition, an increase in mucosal thickness might minimize the discoloration.&#xD;
      The only study on human patients revealed that the color of the peri-implant mucosa presents&#xD;
      more dark, green and blue components compared to the natural gingiva. Soft tissue thickness&#xD;
      appeared a crucial factor with respect to the spectrophotometrically measured degree of&#xD;
      peri-implant mucosal discoloration, with a trend for less pronounced discolorations in&#xD;
      patients with thick mucosa. Furthermore, the authors found that peri-implant mucosa was on&#xD;
      average 0,5-0,7 mm thicker than natural gingiva. However, this study evaluated the thickness&#xD;
      of the gingiva by means of CBCT, which could lead to some errors due to the superimposition&#xD;
      of the lips and cheeks, as well as the tongue that occupies the most space of the oral&#xD;
      cavity. Moreover, esthetics were evaluated by clinicians visually at a specific distance&#xD;
      asking them if discoloration was visible or not visible. Furthermore, no questionnaire was&#xD;
      given to patients to evaluate esthetics neither discomfort while brushing. Therefore, The&#xD;
      objective of this cross-sectional study is to evaluate the influence of gingival thickness&#xD;
      (GT) upon mucosal color (MC) around dental implants measured spectrophotometrically. A&#xD;
      secondary goal is to evaluate the correlation between mucosal color changes and type of&#xD;
      abutment material around dental implants.&#xD;
