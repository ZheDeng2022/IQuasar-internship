    <textblock>
      Diabetic pregnancies are often complicated by placental dysfunction with reduced transfer of&#xD;
      oxygen from the mother to the fetus, which may compromise fetal growth and organ development.&#xD;
      In diabetic pregnancies, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia very often leads to fetal&#xD;
      macrosomia. The combination of reduced placental oxygen transfer and increasing fetal demand&#xD;
      due to fetal overgrowth may possess a particular risk of adverse pregnancy outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current methods in the antenatal identification of placental dysfunction relies on estimates&#xD;
      of fetal size and fetal wellbeing using ultrasound including Doppler flows measurements.&#xD;
      These measurements are only indirect estimates of placental function, as no clinical method&#xD;
      exists to assess placental function directly. In diabetic pregnancies, the estimates are&#xD;
      further limited due to fetal overgrowth and unreliable Doppler. In addition, in diabetic&#xD;
      pregnancies, intrauterine fetal weight estimates by ultrasound are inaccurate because of&#xD;
      asymmetric fetal growth. Therefore, new accurate methods to assess placental function, fetal&#xD;
      oxygenation and fetal growth in this particular group of high-risk pregnancies is highly&#xD;
      needed. Early and precise identification of pathology in diabetes pregnancy may lead to an&#xD;
      improved outcome in the offspring, as precise identification of pathology facilitates&#xD;
      important obstetric decisions in regards to maternal antidiabetic treatment and timing of&#xD;
      delivery. Resent research indicates that MRI is useful for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well described, that preeclampsia is associated with an increased maternal risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease later in life. Recent studies suggest, that pregestational subclinical&#xD;
      cardiovascular dysfunction, in particular left ventricular dysfunction, may increase the risk&#xD;
      of preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction during pregnancy. Cardiac MRI is a sensitive&#xD;
      method to detect subclinical maternal cardiac dysfunction, which may be used in&#xD;
      identification of high-risk pregnancies. In addition, the longitudinal design of this study&#xD;
      allows for the investigation of cardiovascular changes during pregnancies in normal&#xD;
      pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to improve the antenatal fetal and maternal monitoring in&#xD;
      diabetes pregnancies. Early and precise identification of pregnancy pathology provides a&#xD;
      better basis for important obstetric decisions regarding antidiabetic treatment, monitoring&#xD;
      intervals and timing of delivery, which leads to a better outcome for the mother and&#xD;
      offspring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal diabetes is an increasing problem among pregnant women worldwide. The incidence of&#xD;
      diabetes in pregnancy has increased by 50% during the last 20 years, which is related to&#xD;
      increased maternal BMI and higher maternal age. In Denmark the current incidence of&#xD;
      gestational diabetes is approximately 6%. Maternal diabetes is a serious complication of&#xD;
      pregnancy, and it is associated with an increased risk of maternal and neonatal complications&#xD;
      such as preeclampsia, abnormal fetal growth, fetal asphyxia, still birth, caesarian section&#xD;
      and premature delivery. In addition, diabetes is associated adverse long term consequences in&#xD;
      the mother and the offspring such as increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These complications may be related to impaired fetal oxygenation, which is a result of&#xD;
      increased oxygen demand of the macrosomic fetus and impaired fetal supply of oxygen due to&#xD;
      placental dysfunction. The diabetic placenta is characterized by immaturity and maternal&#xD;
      vascular malperfusion which leads to a reduced transport of oxygen from the mother to the&#xD;
      fetus. At the same time, there are adaptive changes such as peripheral vascular hyperplasia,&#xD;
      which tends to normalize the oxygen transport capacity. However, in a number of diabetic&#xD;
      pregnancies this process remains inadequate to meet the increasing metabolic demand of the&#xD;
      growing fetus. This explains why diabetic pregnancies have an increased risk of chronic&#xD;
      intrauterine hypoxia and asphyxia in labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current antenatal care in pregnancies complicated by diabetes focus on keeping maternal&#xD;
      glucose level stable by the use of either diet or insulin treatment. It has been demonstrated&#xD;
      that maternal glucose control is directly related to placental development and adverse&#xD;
      obstetric outcomes. Placental function or fetal oxygenation cannot be assessed directly by&#xD;
      current clinical methods. In antenatal care screening for placental dysfunction focus on&#xD;
      ultrasound estimates of fetal size and ultrasound Doppler measurement of fetal and umbilical&#xD;
      blood flow. Small fetal size and specific circulatory changes are indirect signs of placental&#xD;
      dysfunction. Unfortunately, in diabetic pregnancies, screening for placental dysfunction is&#xD;
      limited by fetal macrosomia and unreliable Doppler flow measurements and therefore new&#xD;
      methods to directly assess placental function and fetal growth in this particular group of&#xD;
      high risk pregnancies is highly needed in order to ensure rational obstetric decisions on&#xD;
      when and how to deliver these high-risk fetuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well described, that preeclampsia is associated with an increased maternal risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease later in life. Women with GDM has a substantially increased risk of&#xD;
      both preeclampsia and cardiovascular disease and GDM may be recognized as an early marker of&#xD;
      atherosclerosis . Recent studies suggest, that pregestational subclinical cardiovascular&#xD;
      dysfunction, in particular left ventricular dysfunction, may increase the risk of&#xD;
      preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction during pregnancy. Therefore, early identification&#xD;
      of maternal cardiovascular dysfunction is highly important, as prophylactic treatment with&#xD;
      aspirin before gestational week 16 may reduce the risk of preeclampsia by more than 50%.&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI is a sensitive method to detect subclinical maternal cardiac dysfunction, which&#xD;
      may be used in identification of high-risk pregnancies. In addition, the longitudinal design&#xD;
      of this study allows for the investigation of cardiovascular changes during pregnancies in&#xD;
      normal pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to improve the antenatal fetal and maternal monitoring in&#xD;
      diabetes pregnancies. Early and precise identification of pregnancy pathology provides a&#xD;
      better basis for important obstetric decisions regarding antidiabetic treatment, monitoring&#xD;

           Recruitment and informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All pregestational diabetes and uncomplicated pregnancies who meet the above-mentioned&#xD;
           inclusion criteria will be presented for the project by the obstetrician/sonographer&#xD;
           performing the ultrasound at their first trimester scan. It will be emphasized that&#xD;
           participating is optional, rejection of participating will not affect the ongoing or&#xD;
           future treatment of the women and the women can withdraw their consent at any time&#xD;
           without reason. The results of the project examination are for research only, and they&#xD;
           will not affect the clinical decisions regarding the current pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If interested the woman will receive written information. The written information&#xD;
           consists of the document &quot;Written participant information&quot; and &quot;Subjects' rights in a&#xD;
           health science research project&quot;. She will then have time to read and consider the&#xD;
           information carefully. If the woman is still interested in participating in the project,&#xD;
           she will receive oral information about the project and about her rights as a trial&#xD;
           subject by the doctor responsible for the project (PhD student Sidsel Linneberg&#xD;
           Rathcke). The woman has the right to have another person with her during the oral&#xD;
           information. The oral information will be given when the woman is ready for additional&#xD;
           information. The oral information will be given in one of the departments outpatient&#xD;
           rooms, where the information can be given undisturbed and in private. The oral&#xD;
           information can be given at the same day as the written information or another day&#xD;
           depending on the woman. The woman will have at least 24 hours of consideration prior to&#xD;
           giving informed consent. The written consent will give the research team access to the&#xD;
           patient's chart and all the information's regarding the patient's health necessary to&#xD;
           complete, monitor and control the project. The woman can retract the informed consent at&#xD;
           any time and without a reason, and this will not affect the following examinations or&#xD;
           treatment during the pregnancy. Moreover, participation will not prevent or postpone&#xD;
           necessary treatment and all participants will still attend in their regular pregnancy&#xD;
           controls both in and out of the department / hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will have to give an additional informed consent to give the permission to&#xD;
           store the remaining blood, a blood sample from the umbilical cord and a small section of&#xD;
           the placenta tissue in a clinical biobank for future research projects. This consent can&#xD;
           be retracted at any time and the blood/placenta tissue will then be disposed. This&#xD;
           decision is independent of the participation in the rest of the project described in&#xD;
           this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study outline:&#xD;

           Doppler flow assessments of the uterine artery (UtA), umbilical artery (UA) and the&#xD;
           middle cerebral artery (MCA) and an ultrasound estimate of the fetal weight by fetal&#xD;
           biometrics using Hadlock formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Maternal serum markers and ECG A venous blood sample will be collected from the woman on&#xD;
           the day of MRI and at the day of birth. The blood sample will be analyzed immediately&#xD;
           for maternal baseline physiology (glucose, HgbA1c, electrolytes, liver parameters,&#xD;
           hematological parameters), and will be used to compare blood glucose regulation between&#xD;
           the groups. At the end of the inclusion period, all blood samples will be analyzed for&#xD;
           specific placental and cardiac markers. The blood samples will be stored at Department&#xD;
           of Clinical Biochemistry, Aalborg University Hospital until analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The remaining blood will be stored in a biobank for future research if the woman gives&#xD;
           her permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An ECG will be obtained from the woman on the day of MRI.&#xD;

           Umbilical cord blood serum markers A blood sample from the umbilical cord will be&#xD;
           collected when the routine blood samples for pH-analysis are taken. This additional&#xD;
           blood sample will be stored in a biobank for future research, regarding fetal glucose&#xD;
           metabolism, fetal growth and placental function, if the woman gives her permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Placental histopathological examination A trained pathologist will examine all the&#xD;
           placentas postnatally. The examination will be done according to the national standard&#xD;
           protocol. The pathologic examination of the placenta includes macroscopic and&#xD;
           microscopic evaluation for signs of maternal and/or fetal malperfusion which indicates&#xD;
           placental dysfunction. The pathologist will be blinded to clinical information- except&#xD;
           gestational age at birth A placental biopsy will be stored in a biobank for future&#xD;
           research if the woman gives her permission.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Power calculation Due to lack of presumptions for power calculations, the number of&#xD;
           women to be included in this study is based on the estimated number of women available&#xD;
           and the clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           AaUH is a tertiary center for diabetes in pregnancy. The total number of deliveries is&#xD;
           3700 pr. year, and the number of pregnancies complicated by pregestational diabetes&#xD;
           every year is around 60. Previous clinical studies on Placental MRI conducted at AaUH&#xD;
           have demonstrated an inclusion success ratio of 70%. Thus, it should be feasible to&#xD;
           include the estimated number of participants during the 2-year recruitment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethics and risks&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data handling Personal data are anonymized by an encrypted ID-number and data is stored&#xD;
           in at Aalborg University Hospital in a locked cabinet in a locked room on a device&#xD;
           locked by a code. An MRI database is established in RedCap.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data collection is approved by a regional notification to The Danish Data Protection&#xD;
           Agency. All data will be handled in compliance with the General Data Protection&#xD;
           Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MRI safety MRI is a widely used method to examine the fetus if any structural&#xD;
           malformation (e.g. cerebral) or invasive placental disorders is suspected during&#xD;
           ultrasound examination. Then an MRI with 1.5 Tesla magnetic field are performed to give&#xD;
           additional information to the ultrasound previously done. Present data have not&#xD;
           documented any harmful effects of MRI during pregnancy and no studies have shown any&#xD;
           association between MRI and adverse fetal outcome. The potential harmful effects are&#xD;
           discussed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acoustic noise The MRI scanner generates noise in the range from 80 to 120 dB&#xD;
                during acquisition of images. Ear protection is recommended for adults at this&#xD;
                level of noise. The fetus is protected by the maternal abdomen and by the amniotic&#xD;
                fluid, which reduces fetal noise exposure with at least 30 dB . The Danish Working&#xD;
                Environment Authority suggests that 85 dB during a workday for pregnant women is&#xD;
                likely to affect the fetus. No studies have shown hearing impairment of fetuses&#xD;
                exposed to 1.5 T MRI during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiation and static magnetic fields MRI does not involve ionizing radiation.&#xD;
                Static magnetic fields may interact with living tissues in various ways with one&#xD;
                important mechanism being the magnetic induction, which may create electric&#xD;
                currents by moving electrolytes in the blood vessels. No change in heart rate or&#xD;
                systolic/diastolic blood pressure have been demonstrated when humans were exposed&#xD;
                to 8 T for 1 hour. Likewise, studies using cardiotocography have demonstrated no&#xD;
                effects on fetal heart rate during MRI. Another mechanism is the magneto-mechanical&#xD;
                effect from static magnetic field, which induces reorientation of molecules.&#xD;
                However, the magneto-mechanical effect is considered too small to affect human&#xD;
                tissue in vivo, since human tissue does not contain strong ferromagnetic&#xD;
                components. According to a review by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing&#xD;
                Radiation Protection (ICNRIP), no consistent effects of static magnetic field&#xD;
                exposure on reproduction and development have been seen in mammalian species.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tissue heat The radiofrequency pulses used for generating the MR images may deposit&#xD;
                heat in the tissues. Therefore, during the MRI acquisition a specific absorption&#xD;
                rate (SAR value, Watt/kg) is calculated in order to prevent tissue heating. The SAR&#xD;
                value will estimate the amount of thermal energy conducted and correlates to the&#xD;
                tissue heat deposited. The SAR value is directly correlated to the time of the MRI&#xD;
                scan. According to the recommendations by the International Commission on&#xD;
                Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) , the whole-body SAR value should be&#xD;
                kept below 2 W/kg during a one hour scan equivalent to a raise in adult tissue&#xD;
                temperature of 0.5°C and a rise of fetal temperature to less than 38°C. Within a&#xD;
                1.5 T MRI system, the fetal peak SAR value is approximately 50% of that generated&#xD;
                in the mother and using standard sequences at 1.5 T for less than one hour, the SAR&#xD;
                value does not exceed the recommended maximum value, neither for the mother nor the&#xD;
                fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasound safety Thermal effects of ultrasound examination have been investigated and a&#xD;
           temperature elevation of 1.5°C is generally considered as the threshold and safe for the&#xD;
           fetus .&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thermal Index (TI) is the prediction of the temperature rise in the tissue within the&#xD;
           ultrasound beam. TI is depending on ultrasound frequency, focus of the beam and duration&#xD;
           of exposure. Perfusion, absorption and reflection of the tissue affect the temperature&#xD;
           of the tissue. TI is a relative risk for the temperature rise and is expressed TI = 1.0&#xD;
           if the ultrasound beam may cause a temperature rise of 1°C. A rise of more than 1°C in&#xD;
           the tissue may cause biological effects42. TI remains very low and under 1.0 during&#xD;
           routine obstetric ultrasound examinations .&#xD;
&#xD;
           No adverse effects in humans have been showed when exposed to diagnostic ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Research ethical considerations None of the examinations during this project will cause&#xD;
           harmful effect neither for the pregnant woman or the fetus. The woman should attend the&#xD;
           regular antenatal care program. None of the examinations during this project will affect&#xD;
           or delay the clinical decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Longitudinal T2* weighted placental and fetal MRI, volumentry MRI and maternal cardiac&#xD;
           MRI are all methods that need to be validated in diabetes pregnancies. Therefore, the&#xD;
           MRI data analysis is blinded to clinical information, and the MRI will not contribute to&#xD;
           any clinical decisions during the current pregnancy. However, the knowledge obtained by&#xD;
           this study may improve the general antenatal care in a longer perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical perspectives Pregnant women with diabetes possess a group in particular high&#xD;
           risk of placental related complications of pregnancy. MRI may improve the antenatal care&#xD;
           as the current methods based on ultrasound measurements of fetal growth and fetal&#xD;
           circulation are inadequate. MRI provides precise estimates of fetal oxygenation,&#xD;
           placental function and maternal cardiac function to support the obstetric decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Early and precise identification of pathology in diabetes pregnancy may facilitate&#xD;
           important obstetric decisions regarding initiation of insulin therapy and timing of&#xD;
           delivery. This is highly important in order to ensure vaginal birth of a healthy, normal&#xD;
           size baby at term.&#xD;
