  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency; in which the problem is weakness&#xD;
      or damage of the sphincter muscle responsible for continence. Mesenchymal stem cells are&#xD;
      undifferentiated cells which can undergo self-renewal &amp; differentiation into other cell types&#xD;
      like muscle cells; thus can be used to regenerate the damaged sphincter muscles. In this&#xD;
      study mesenchymal stem cells will be obtained from bone marrow from the patient, processed, &amp;&#xD;
      then re-injected periurethrally. Effectiveness will be compared to that of the surgical&#xD;
      treatment (tension-free vaginal tape).&#xD;

      ** Study settings : The study is to be held at Ain-Shams University Maternity Hospital -&#xD;
      urogynecolgy unit; recruiting the patients from the urogynecology outpatient clinic&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty female patients with stress urinary incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency&#xD;
      will be recruited into two groups; group A including 25 patients will be injected with stem&#xD;
      cells, &amp; these will be the patients refusing surgery as a primary line of treatment, or unfit&#xD;
      for surgery. Group B; including 25 patients, will undergo the tension-free vaginal tape&#xD;
      operation. The sample size is determined according to the following equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      [ P1( 100-P1) + P2( 100-P2) ] / (P2 - P1)2 where; Power of the test = 80% Confidence level =&#xD;
      95% Alpha error = 5% Assuming success rate for the preferably used intervention &quot;tension-free&#xD;
      vaginal tape&quot; in patients with intrinsic sphincter deficiency P1=80% ( Schierlitz et al,&#xD;
      2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming success rate for stem cell therapy P2= 90% ( Smaldone et al, 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Consent Informed consent will be taken according to World Medical Association (WMA)&#xD;
           Declaration of Helsinki; the Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human&#xD;
           Subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. History Full medical history will be taken from each patient, together with detailed&#xD;
           history as regards voiding habits, incontinence, voiding dysfunction, urinary infection.&#xD;
           Questionnaire about incontinence, &amp; questionnaire about quality of life will be&#xD;
           obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examination Complete physical and pelvic examination to evaluate the presence of stress&#xD;
           urinary incontinence, &amp; to exclude patients with marked hypermobility of the urethra, or&#xD;
           severe cystocele or rectocele.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Urodynamic study A multi-channel urodynamic study using Euet Sensik ® will be performed&#xD;
           including cystometry, urethral pressure measurement, abdominal leak point pressure&#xD;
           (ALPP) measurement, &amp; residual urine measurement. Patients with stress urinary&#xD;
           incontinence due to intrinsic sphincter deficiency will be selected. Criteria for&#xD;
           selection are: absence of involuntary contractions during leakage caused by a stress&#xD;
           maneuver; low ALPP (&lt;60 cmH2O); &amp; maximum urethral closure pressure (MUCP) &lt;20-30 cmH2O.&#xD;
           Patients with voiding dysfunction will be excluded (residual urine volume &gt;100ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cells retrieval, culture, &amp; processing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Bone marrow aspiration:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Site: posterior superior iliac crest.&#xD;
&#xD;
           -Procedure: The patient is placed in the lateral decubitus position, with the top leg&#xD;
           flexed and the lower leg straight. The iliac crest is palpated, and the preferred&#xD;
           sampling site is marked with a pen. Aseptic technique is employed, including sterile&#xD;
           gloves and gown. The site is prepared with an antiseptic (povidone-iodine), scrubbed,&#xD;
           and draped, exposing only the site to be sampled. The skin and the underlying tissue to&#xD;
           the periosteum are infiltrated with a local anaesthetic (approximately 10 mL of 1%&#xD;
           Xylocaine [lidocaine]). A 10-mL syringe with a 25-gauge needle is used to inject an&#xD;
           initial 0.5 mL directly under the skin, raising a wheal. A 22-gauge needle is used to&#xD;
           penetrate deeper into the subcutaneous tissue and the underlying periosteum, an area&#xD;
           roughly 1 cm in diameter. A skin incision is made with a small surgical blade, through&#xD;
           which the bone marrow aspiration needle, with a stylet locked in place, is inserted.&#xD;
           Once the needle contacts the bone, it is advanced by slowly rotating clockwise and&#xD;
           counter clockwise until the cortical bone is penetrated and the marrow cavity is&#xD;
           entered. The depth of the penetration should not extend beyond an initial 1cm. Once&#xD;
           within the marrow cavity, the stylet is removed. Using a 20 mL syringe, approximately 5&#xD;
           mL of bone marrow are aspirated. Subsequent specimens are obtained by attaching a&#xD;
           separate syringe, collecting 5 mL at a time. The samples are then transferred into an&#xD;
           ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) -containing tube. The marrow needle is removed,&#xD;
           and pressure is applied to the aspiration site with gauze until any bleeding stops.&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Cells processing &amp; culture:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Mononuclear cells (MNCs) will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation using&#xD;
           Ficol/Hypaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be isolated through plastic adherence by the&#xD;
           seeding of MNCs in T25 tissue culture flasks in complete culture media (DMEM, 1%&#xD;
           antibiotics/antifungal, 20% autologous serum). Flasks will be incubated at 37ºC in CO2&#xD;
           incubator for 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - After 5 days, flasks will be evaluated under inverted microscope for the number and&#xD;
           morphology of MSCs. Non-adherent cells will be discarded and medium replenished.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Half of the medium will be changed every 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Flasks will be evaluated until cells reach about 80-90% confluence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MSCs will be harvested using Trypsin-EDTA (0.25%) for 5 minutes. Afterwards,&#xD;
                trypsin action will be stopped by the addition of autologous serum.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MSCs will be washed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS), counted, tested for&#xD;
                viability using trypan blue exclusion test.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MSC will be identified using immunophenotypic markers (positive for CD44 and&#xD;
                negative for CD34).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cells will be suspended in sterile saline, a minimum of 20 X 106 MSCs cells in a 10&#xD;
                cc syringe, ready for injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Quality control check for the sterility by the performance of bacterial aerobic and&#xD;
           anaerobic cultures will be done to ensure the complete aseptic conditions during the&#xD;
           specimen retrieval, preparation, storage, and injection. (Gunetti et al., 2012)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Injection of cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The patient will be placed in lithotomy position. A Foley's catheter (size 18) will be&#xD;
           inserted in the urethra, then under local anaesthesia; retrieved cells (total 20- 30&#xD;
           million cells per patient in 10cc syringe) (Sebe et al., 2011) will be injected into the&#xD;
           submucosal tissue at the level of the proximal urethra just distal to the bladder neck&#xD;
           (guided by stretch on the Foley's catheter), at 3,9,12 o'clock, injecting around 3.5 cc&#xD;
           in each site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Tension-free vaginal tape (TVT):&#xD;
&#xD;
           Another 25 patients will undergo surgical intervention, which is the &quot;tension-free&#xD;
           vaginal tape&quot; operation at the obstetrics &amp; gynecology department - Ain Shams Maternity&#xD;
           Hospital - urogynecology unit. In this technique, a small midurethral incision will be&#xD;
           made in the vaginal mucosa, then a polypropylene 40*1cm mesh tape attached to two curved&#xD;
           trocars will be passed lateral to the urethra &amp; through the endopelvic fascia into the&#xD;
           retropubic space. The trocar will then be passed along the back of the pubic bone,&#xD;
           through the rectus fascia, in two small suprapubic skin incisions, then the tension on&#xD;
           the tape adjusted &amp; the remaining tape cut off at the level of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up visits will be conducted at 3months, 6months, 9months, and 12months after therapy.&#xD;
      Clinical examination, incontinence questionnaire, quality of life questionnaire, &amp; urodynamic&#xD;
      study will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** Data collection &amp; recording:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will have a case record form (CRF) in which the following data will be recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, parity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of intervention (stem cell therapy or TVT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form&#xD;
           (ICIQ-UI SF) on admission &amp; 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL) Instrument Score on admission &amp; 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m&#xD;
           post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cough test on admission &amp; 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urodynamic study on admission &amp; 3m, 6m, 9m, 12m post-injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics for measured variables will be expressed as range, mean and standard&#xD;
      deviation (for metric data); range, median and interquartile range (for discrete data); and&#xD;
      number and proportions (for categorical data). Pre-injection &amp; post-injection findings will&#xD;
      be compared using the t-test or the Wilcoxon test depending on whether the measured&#xD;
      parameters were Gaussian variables. A P-value of 0.05 or less will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Delegation of investigator responsibilities:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigator will ensure that all persons assisting with the trial are adequately&#xD;
           informed about the protocol, &amp; their trial-related duties and functions. The&#xD;
           investigator will maintain a list of sub-investigators and other appropriately qualified&#xD;
           person to whom he or she has delegated significant trial-related duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient information and informed consent Before being admitted to the clinical study,&#xD;
           the patient must consent to participate after the nature, scope, and possible&#xD;
           consequences of the clinical study have been explained in a form understandable to her.&#xD;
           An informed consent document, in Arabic language, contains all locally required elements&#xD;
           and specifies who informed the patient. After reading the informed consent document, the&#xD;
           patient must give consent in writing. The patient's consent must be confirmed at the&#xD;
           time of consent by the personally dated signature of the patient and by the personally&#xD;
           dated signature of the person conducting the informed consent discussions. If the&#xD;
           patient is unable to read, oral presentation and explanation of the written informed&#xD;
           consent form and information to be supplied to patients must take place in the presence&#xD;
           of an impartial witness. Consent must be confirmed at the time of consent orally and by&#xD;
           the personally dated signature of the patient or by a local legally recognized&#xD;
           alternative (e.g., the patient's thumbprint or mark). The witness and the person&#xD;
           conducting the informed consent discussions must also sign and personally date the&#xD;
           consent document. The original signed consent document will be retained by the&#xD;
           investigator. The investigator will not undertake any measures specifically required&#xD;
           only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Confidentiality Only the patient number and patient initials will be recorded in the&#xD;
           CRF, and if the patients name appears on any other document, it must be kept in privacy&#xD;
           by the investigators. The investigator will maintain a personal patient identification&#xD;
           list (patient numbers with the corresponding patient names) to enable records to be&#xD;
           identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Protocol approval Before the beginning of the study and in accordance with the local&#xD;
           regulation followed, the protocol and all corresponding documents will be declared for&#xD;
           ethical and research approval by the council of ob/gyn department, Ain Shams University;&#xD;
           according to the WMA Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
