    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effects of pembrolizumab on the body, or pharmacodynamics, in&#xD;
      patients with glioblastoma that has come back. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such&#xD;
      as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate immune effector function in resected glioblastoma tissue after treatment with&#xD;
      intravenously administered pembrolizumab monotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To correlate the progression free survival at 6 months (PFS6) with objective increases in&#xD;
      the immune effector T cell: regulatory T cell (Treg) ratio in tumor tissue as measured by ex&#xD;
      vivo T-cell-specific cytokines profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Comparison of time to progression of last prior therapy to time to progression on&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, median duration of response, overall response rate (ORR), and overall survival&#xD;
      (OS) and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify imaging characteristics associated with immunological changes in tumor&#xD;
      following treatment with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day -21 and day -1, and&#xD;
      then undergo surgery on day 0. After 2-3 weeks or recovery from surgery, patients continue to&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 42 days for up&#xD;
      to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;
