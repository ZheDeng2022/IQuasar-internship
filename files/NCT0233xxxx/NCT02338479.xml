      This is a prospective non-therapeutic study, assessing the long-term toxicity of pediatric&#xD;
      HCT for hematologic malignancies. This study is a collaboration between the Pediatric Blood&#xD;
      and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC), the Center for International Blood and Marrow&#xD;
      Transplant Research (CIBMTR), the National Marrow Transplant Program (NMDP) and the Resource&#xD;
      for Clinical Investigation in Blood and Marrow Transplantation (RCI-BMT) of the CIBMTR. The&#xD;
      study will enroll pediatric patients who undergo myeloablative HCT for hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies at PBMTC sites.&#xD;

      This is a prospective non-therapeutic study, assessing the long-term toxicity of pediatric&#xD;
      HCT for hematologic malignancies. This study is a collaboration between the Pediatric Blood&#xD;
      and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC), the Center for International Blood and Marrow&#xD;

      for Clinical Investigation in Blood and Marrow Transplantation (RCI-BMT) of the CIBMTR. The&#xD;
      study will enroll pediatric patients who undergo myeloablative HCT for hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies at PBMTC sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study examines the hypothesis that survivors of pediatric HCT are at risk for late organ&#xD;
      toxicity and they will have identifiable biomarkers present within the first two years&#xD;
      following HCT which will be predictive for late adverse outcomes allowing for early&#xD;
      identification of patients at risk.&#xD;
