  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the most severe form of stroke: early mortality is 40%, and&#xD;
      80%-of survivors are physically disabled with high rates of cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to address the issues with conventional treatments, a new integrated systematic&#xD;
      approach has been developed. This approach utilizes an educational process where specific&#xD;
      core competencies (pillars) of mapping, navigation, access, optics and automated resection&#xD;
      have been integrated into a single standardized system to deliver targeted therapy for an&#xD;
      individual patient based on location and patient factors. This system has demonstrated safety&#xD;
      and efficacy in oncology patients and is also FDA approved for use in the ICH patient&#xD;
      population as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This registry will collect data form multiple site that preform the MiSPACE procedure as part&#xD;
      of clinical care. The intent of this registry is to collect data on the economic impact as&#xD;
      well as clinical outcomes using the MiSPACE approach with the integrated technology in the&#xD;
      early treatment of ICH.&#xD;

      Aurora Health Care is serving as the coordinating center and will prepare Standard Operating&#xD;
      Procedures to address registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient&#xD;
      recruitment, data collection, data management, data analysis, and reporting for adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sites will identify, recruit, obtain consent for subjects and collect data using standard&#xD;
      forms; these activities will be monitored remotely by the coordinating site. Data from the&#xD;
      participating hospitals will be checked for heterogeneity, queried and subsequently pooled.&#xD;
      Baseline patient characteristics and demographics, Hemphill and Essen predictive scores,&#xD;
      NIHSS stroke severity score, functional status from the Barthel index and mRS score, and ICH&#xD;
      volumetric assessments, will be presented as means, medians, or proportions, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Eligibility and consent rates will be derived for each center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be largely descriptive in nature. Follow-up assessments at 30 and 90 days, for&#xD;
      composite outcome of death or disability (defined as mRS&gt;2), and death and disability&#xD;
      separately, will be described with proportions. Tallies of surgical complications will also&#xD;
      be derived as separate outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of 30- and 90-day status will entail an informal comparison for the purposes of&#xD;
      providing preliminary evidence and for planning of a larger comparative trial. The proportion&#xD;
      of patients under experimental treatment who suffer from death or dependency at 30-days, as&#xD;
      determined by cutoffs on the modified Rankin Scale with exact binomial upper and lower 90%&#xD;
      confidence limits will be used in a comparison to our criteria of: (1) 65% (historical&#xD;
      proportion of patients under medical management, unselected for baseline risk), and (2) 50%&#xD;
      (proportion of patients under other minimally invasive surgical techniques unselected for&#xD;
      baseline risk). This confidence limit comparative approach provides a flexible method of&#xD;
      assessment of non-inferiority, equivalence, and superiority. The unselected population will,&#xD;
      however, be a mix of patients at different levels of baseline risk, and so a follow-up&#xD;
      stratified analysis will be conducted if counts permit. The unselected population will be&#xD;
      matched using demographics, lesion characteristics and comorbidities as close as possible to&#xD;
      the study group. A heterogeneity index will be used for comparison. As a corollary to this&#xD;
      analysis, baseline predictive scores (translated from scores to percentages/risks) will be&#xD;
      used to calculate expected counts of 30 and 90 day status stratified within the 0-3 range of&#xD;
      the Hemphill ICH score and 0-10 range of the Essen ICH score, and these expected counts will&#xD;
      be compared to observed counts using a Fisher Exact Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty (50) patients were chosen as a convenient sample size, based on enrollments from all of&#xD;
      the participating hospitals, with recruitment accomplished in a reasonable timeframe of 2&#xD;
      years. About 65% of unselected patients with ICH (that is, not stratified by baseline&#xD;
      predicted risk) have a documented 30- day composite outcome of death or dependency under&#xD;
      medical management. Reviews of other types of minimallyinvasive ICH surgeries provide&#xD;
      evidence of significantly improved outcomes (meta-analysis odds ratio 0.54 (0.39, 0.76)). An&#xD;
      odds ratio of 0.54 indicates a reduction in risk from 65% to about 50% (15% absolute&#xD;
      reduction).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming the new procedure is truly at least as effective as other minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgeries (50% 30-day composite outcome risk), and therefore 15% more effective than&#xD;
      conventional management, 50 patients provides 66% surity that a 95% 1-sided confidence&#xD;
      interval will exclude the chance that the new procedure is worse than medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative method of framing this, based on an exact one-sided binomial test of a&#xD;
      one-sample proportion and an alpha level of 5%, is that a sample size of 50 patients provides&#xD;
      approximately 66% surity/power that the new procedure is superior to medical management&#xD;
      (i.e., lower than 65% suffering from death or poor functional outcomes). The computed&#xD;
      critical value for this test, to provide some initial evidence of superiority, is observing&#xD;
      no more than 26 patients (out of 50) suffering from death or dependency under the new&#xD;
      surgical procedure. The surity/power of 66% used as an assumption above is permissive. The&#xD;
      study size and preliminary nature of the results will not be sufficient to perform robust&#xD;
      statistical testing for superiority or non-inferiority of the new parafascicular&#xD;
      ICH-evacuation technique, though results from this registry will provide a crucial first look&#xD;
      at effectiveness, and health costs.&#xD;

    <description>Overall surgical performance is a composite outcome measure that will be assessed by evaluating a number of events and outcomes. Data will be collected on any surgical complications (defined as peri-operative blood loss, thrombotic events, infections, neurological worsening, seizures, metabolic disturbances, and cardiopulmonary events, within 30 days of surgery). Data from re-admissions within the first 30 days will also be included. In addition, data regarding the duration of surgery, time to reach the hematoma, intra-operative monitoring, blood transfusion, use of hemostatic agents, use of post-operative ICP monitoring, residual post-operative hematoma volumes, and post-operative recurrence of hematoma will also be collected.</description>
