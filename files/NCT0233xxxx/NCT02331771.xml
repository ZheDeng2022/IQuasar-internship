      This randomized, placebo-controlled trial will evaluate the use of donepezil compared to&#xD;
      placebo to reduce the risk of memory impairment after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a method used to treat a variety of psychiatric&#xD;
      conditions. An electrical current is distributed throughout the brain (Lisanby 2007) inducing&#xD;
      seizure activity in a controlled setting using neuromuscular blocking agents (Mirzakhani&#xD;
      2012) while the patient is under anesthesia (Deiner 2009). ECT is approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the following conditions: unipolar and bipolar depression,&#xD;
      manic and mixed states in bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,&#xD;
      schizophreniform disorder and catatonia (FDA executive summary). ECT is often used after&#xD;
      trials of psychotropic medications have failed (Kellner 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is commonly associated with cognitive side effects that range&#xD;
      from anterograde and retrograde amnesia to issues with executive function, attention and&#xD;
      declines in information processing. Problems with autobiographical memory and recall for new&#xD;
      information appear to be affected the most. In addition, data suggests that the loss of&#xD;
      memory of autobiographical events may persist as long as six months. These issues may cause&#xD;
      patient adherence problems and potential relapses into previous psychiatric conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donepezil is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor indicated for Alzheimer's Dementia and has&#xD;
      been shown to slow the progressive decline in cognition and memory in Alzheimer's Dementia.&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that donepezil will help to preserve memory and minimize the decline in&#xD;
      memory that is associated with the administration of ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine if donepezil can minimize deficiencies in autobiographical&#xD;
      memory 4-5 weeks after ECT treatment has been started.&#xD;
