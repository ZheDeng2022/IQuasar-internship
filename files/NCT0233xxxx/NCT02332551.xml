      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of irreversible&#xD;
      electroporation for unresectable Hepatic carcinoma close to the gallbladder, also Progress&#xD;
      Free Survival (PFS) will be recorded.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatic carcinoma is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and a large proportion of&#xD;
      patients are unsuitable for tumor resection because of factors such as poor hepatic&#xD;
      reserve(cirrhosis), multicentric tumors or near vital structures such as vessels,&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dome and gallbladder. Direct ablative treatments include radiofrequency&#xD;
      ablation, microwave (MW) ablation and cryotherapy and irreversible electroporation had been&#xD;
      used successful as a therapeutic choice for unresectable patients. At the same&#xD;
      time，Irreversible electroporation(IRE)，which was applied with a novel ablation technology,&#xD;
      can induce tissue necrosis by utilizing short pulses of high-voltage electrical energy. The&#xD;
      technique also had many advantages, including Short ablation time, preservation of vital&#xD;
      structures within IRE-ablated zone, avoidance of heat/cold-sink effect, complete ablation&#xD;
      with well-demarcated margin and real-time monitoring of IRE ablation.&#xD;
