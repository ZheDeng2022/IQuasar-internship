    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore temporal relationships between self-worth and&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) participation in middle-aged women (aged 35-64 years). We are&#xD;
      particularly interested in the predictive role of self-worth on women's daily PA&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include two phases: a pilot phase to test the procedures and a test phase to&#xD;
      assess self-worth and PA. During the test phase, Women will receive text message prompts in&#xD;
      the morning, afternoon, and evening for 28 days on their cell phones. Each prompt will&#xD;
      include a link to an 11-item mobile Internet-based survey assessing momentary PA, self-worth,&#xD;
      and self-efficacy. Women will also concurrently wear an activity monitor (GENEActiv) to&#xD;
      objectively measure their activity levels throughout the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Using ecological momentary assessment, the purpose of this study is to explore temporal&#xD;
      relationships between self-worth and physical activity (PA) participation in middle-aged&#xD;
      women (aged 35-64 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will occur in two phases. During an initial pilot phase ten women will be asked to&#xD;
      test the instruments and procedures for this study. During the second phase, the test phase,&#xD;
      60-100 women will be asked to complete daily surveys assessing their self-worth,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, and PA participation. The results of the pilot phase will be used to modify&#xD;
      instruments and procedures before the test phase commences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pilot phase, 10 women will be asked to participate in an initial intake&#xD;
      appointment to sign the informed consent form, complete baseline questionnaires, receive an&#xD;
      activity monitor, and receive instructions on completing the daily surveys and wearing the&#xD;
      activity monitor. Women will also be asked to provide their typical daily wake times and&#xD;
      bedtimes during this appointment to guide the sampling schedule. Ecological momentary&#xD;
      assessment (EMA) in which women receive two or three daily prompts to complete a short survey&#xD;
      will be used in this study. Women will be asked to answer seven questions assessing their&#xD;
      momentary activity (1), self-efficacy (1), and self-worth (5) twice per day for one week and&#xD;
      three times per day for one week. Five women will be assigned to each condition each week so&#xD;
      that half of the sample receives the twice per day condition during the first week and half&#xD;
      receives the twice per day condition during the second week of the pilot phase. Women sampled&#xD;
      twice per day will be prompted to complete assessments 1) 15 minutes after their typical wake&#xD;
      time reported during their intake appointment and 2) 90 minutes prior to their typical&#xD;
      bedtime. Women sampled three times per day will be prompted one additional time during the&#xD;
      afternoon (random time between 2:00 and 3:00pm). Women will be prompted to complete the&#xD;
      survey via text message. A link will be provided in each text message to direct women to a&#xD;
      mobile compatible Qualtrics survey containing seven items assessing women's current activity,&#xD;
      self-efficacy, general self-worth, knowledge self-worth, emotional self-worth, social&#xD;
      self-worth, and physical self-worth. At the end of the two week pilot phase, women will be&#xD;
      asked to complete a survey to provide feedback on the sampling scheme and the usability of&#xD;
      the mobile survey. Results of the survey will inform modifications to the test phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the test phase, 60-100 women will be asked to participate in an initial intake&#xD;
      appointment to sign the informed consent form, complete baseline questionnaires, receive an&#xD;
      activity monitor, and receive instructions on completing the daily surveys and wearing the&#xD;
      activity monitor. Women will be asked to answer eleven questions assessing their current&#xD;
      activity (1), self-efficacy (1), and self-worth (9) three times per day for 28 days,&#xD;
      depending upon the results of the pilot phase. The three-times daily sampling scheme will be&#xD;
      adopted for the test phase. Therefore, women will receive text message prompts with a link to&#xD;
      the mobile compatible Qualtrics survey daily in the morning, afternoon, and evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current activity will be measured using an item modified from a recent EMA study by Dunton&#xD;
      and colleagues (2012). Using a list of options, this item assesses the activity in which the&#xD;
      participant was engaged immediately prior to receiving the prompt. One item from the Exercise&#xD;
      Self-Efficacy Scale (McAuley, 1993) will be used to assess women's confidence in their&#xD;
      ability to participate in daily PA on a scale of 0% to 100% - &quot;I am able to participate in&#xD;
      physical activity at a moderate intensity for 30+ minutes today without quitting.&quot; General&#xD;
      self-worth will be measured using one item from the general self-worth subscale of the Adult&#xD;
      Self-Perception Profile (Messer &amp; Harter, 1986). Women will choose among four statements to&#xD;
      indicate how they feel about themselves: &quot;Which of the following statements is most true of&#xD;
      how you feel RIGHT NOW? It is REALLY TRUE that I am dissatisfied with myself It is SORT OF&#xD;
      TRUE that I am dissatisfied with myself It is SORT OF TRUE that I am satisfied with myself It&#xD;
      is REALLY TRUE that I am satisfied with myself&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Women's Physical Activity Self-Worth Inventory (WPASWI) (Huberty et al., 2013) will be&#xD;
      used to measure knowledge, emotional, and social self-worth. Women will be asked the extent&#xD;
      to which they agree (strongly disagree, somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree)&#xD;
      with statements describing their knowledge, emotional, and social self-worth. One WPASWI item&#xD;
      from each of the self-worth domains was chosen for the pilot phase. Based upon results of the&#xD;
      pilot phase, the EMA survey was modified for the test phase and two items were chosen to&#xD;
      assess each domain, for a total of six items from the WPASWI. Examples include: &quot;RIGHT NOW -&#xD;
      My knowledge about physical activity affects the way I feel about myself.&quot; (knowledge&#xD;
      self-worth) &quot;RIGHT NOW - I feel it is important to take time to be physically active today.&quot;&#xD;
      (emotional self-worth) &quot;RIGHT NOW - I need to know I have friends or family to support my&#xD;
      commitment to exercise in order to feel good about myself.&quot; (social self-worth)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two items from the Physical Self-Perception Profile (Fox &amp; Corbin, 1989) will be used to&#xD;
      measure perceived body attractiveness and physical condition, both important subdomains of&#xD;
      physical self-worth. Women will be asked the extent to which they agree (strongly disagree,&#xD;
      somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree) with the following statements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;RIGHT NOW - I feel confident about the appearance of my body.&quot; (body attractiveness) &quot;RIGHT&#xD;
      NOW - I am confident in my level of physical conditioning and fitness.&quot; (physical condition)&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the EMA survey used in the test phase of this study will include eleven items&#xD;
      assessing momentary activity (1) (Dunton et al., 2012); self-efficacy (1) (McAuley, 1993),&#xD;
      general self-worth (1) (Messer &amp; Harter, 1986); knowledge (2), emotional (2), and social (2)&#xD;
      self-worth (Huberty et al., 2013); and physical self-worth (2) (Fox &amp; Corbin, 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women will also be asked to wear a GENEActiv accelerometer for the duration of their&#xD;
      participation in the study (14 days for the pilot phase and 28 days for the test phase). All&#xD;
      participants will receive their GENEActiv during the initial intake appointment and will&#xD;
      return the device during a schedule appointment with a researcher. Women not local to the&#xD;
      Phoenix area will receive and return their GENEActiv by mail. As part of wearing the activity&#xD;
      monitor, women will also be asked to log their wear time, wake time, and bedtime. All&#xD;
      participants will receive comprehensive feedback on their time spent in sedentary, light,&#xD;
      moderate, and vigorous activity each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intake appointment, women will also be asked to complete the full-length&#xD;
      questionnaires upon which the EMA survey was developed (i.e., Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale&#xD;
      [McAuley, 1993], Adult Self-Perception Profile [Messer &amp; Harter, 1986], WPASWI [Huberty et&#xD;
      al., 2013], Physical Self-Perception Profile [Fox &amp; Corbin, 1989]), a demographics&#xD;
      questionnaire, and a regular PA questionnaire (Past-Week Modifiable Activity Questionnaire&#xD;
      [Gabriel et al., 2010]).&#xD;
