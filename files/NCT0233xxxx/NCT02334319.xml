  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies how well ganetespib works before surgery in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage I-IVA squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck that can be removed by&#xD;
      surgery. Ganetespib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth. Studying samples of blood and tissue in the laboratory from patients&#xD;
      receiving ganetespib may help doctors learn more about the effects of ganetespib on cells. It&#xD;
      may also help doctors understand how well patients respond to treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ganetespib is a small molecule inhibitor of HSP90 that is currently being studied in several&#xD;
      ongoing clinical trials. Investigators have demonstrated that ganetespib sensitizes&#xD;
      colorectal cell lines to the effects of chemo radiotherapy in vitro. Ganetespib may have an&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect in head and neck cancer. The investigators propose this pilot study as a&#xD;
      first step to examine the activity of ganetespib in patients with locally advanced squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) who have a planned surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ganetespib has not been investigated in SCCHN. This protocol is a window of opportunity trial&#xD;
      that will be looking at whether there is a rationale for pursuing this agent in future&#xD;
      development of clinical trials that would then focus on therapeutic interventions with or&#xD;
      without radiotherapy. There are therefore no clinical trials currently opened using&#xD;
      ganetespib in SCCHN and listed on ClinicalTrials.gov. It is not clear if patients who receive&#xD;
      this drug prior to surgery will benefit from this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, ganetespib will be administered twice weekly (doses approximately 72 hours&#xD;
      apart) for 2 weeks, followed by surgery the day after the last dose of the study drug. There&#xD;
      will be 3 dose levels, 80, 100 and 150mg/m² as highest dose. These doses were chosen based on&#xD;
      the following considerations. In a Phase 1 study (protocol 9090-01) investigating a&#xD;
      twice-weekly ganetespib treatment schedule, doses up to 173 mg/m² were well tolerated, with&#xD;
      manageable diarrhea and fatigue being the most common adverse events. Extensive correlative&#xD;
      studies and pharmacokinetic (PK)/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of preclinical data suggest&#xD;
      that in humans the effective dose range for ganetespib is 70-150 mg/m². Therefore, 80 mg/m²&#xD;
      is within the range of ganetespib effectiveness and 150 mg/m² twice weekly is a&#xD;
      well-tolerated dose.&#xD;

A paired sample Wilcoxon signed rank test will be considered to test whether the mean of post-treatment expression is different from the pre-treatment expression. This analysis will be done separately by each of the three dose levels, and by pooling all dose levels together. Kruskal-Wallis test will also be carried out.</description>
