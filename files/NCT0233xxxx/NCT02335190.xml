    <textblock>
      The sacroiliac (SI) joint is a common source of low back pain. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)&#xD;
      can be used to treat low back pain from the SI joint , and is often recommended by physicians&#xD;
      to provide long lasting pain relief. However, the use of RFA for SI joint pain has not been&#xD;
      as successful as RFA for pain in other areas of the back and neck. X-ray guidance&#xD;
      (fluoroscopy) is currently used to perform this procedure. Under fluoroscopy, however, it can&#xD;
      be difficult for physicians to identify necessary landmarks, and there are risks to the&#xD;
      patient because of radiation exposure. In contrast, ultrasound may provide better image&#xD;
      guidance than fluoroscopy, and there is no radiation risk. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine if ultrasound guided SI joint RFA is effective.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine the effectiveness of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) diagnostic sensory blocks&#xD;
      and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) under ultrasound guidance. The sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is&#xD;
      estimated to be the source of pain in 10-27% of patients suffering from mechanical low back&#xD;
      pain. When pain is refractory to conventional treatments (such as activity modification,&#xD;
      exercise, physical therapy, chiropractic, anti-inflammatory and analgesic medications and&#xD;
      corticosteroid injections), radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a treatment option in carefully&#xD;
      selected individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice is to perform the SIJ posterior sensory blocks and RFA under fluoroscopic&#xD;
      guidance. Research has confirmed that SIJ RFA can provide significant relief, however, the&#xD;
      success rate and magnitude of relief are variable. Part of this variability may relate to the&#xD;
      challenging nature of identifying key anatomical landmarks under fluoroscopy - their location&#xD;
      may not be clearly evident with fluoroscopy particularly if the patient is obese, has low&#xD;
      bone mineral density or has abundant bowel gas and/or stool in the pelvis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent cadaveric study by our research group has clarified the sensory innervation of the&#xD;
      SIJ and the findings have implications for currently practiced SIJ sensory block and RFA&#xD;
      procedures. The study confirmed that the posterior sacral network innervates the SIJ and runs&#xD;
      along the lateral crest of the sacrum between the S1 and the S3 lateral sacral tubercles.&#xD;
      Inasmuch as the lateral sacral crest is predictably and clearly visible on ultrasound,&#xD;
      posterior sacral network (PSN) SIJ sensory blocks and RFA under ultrasound guidance may be&#xD;
      feasible using the lateral sacral crest as the key anatomical structure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical studies have been done that use ultrasound guidance for SIJ RFA. There are&#xD;
      numerous advantages to ultrasound-guided SIJ sensory block and RFA. Significantly, patients&#xD;
      would no longer be exposed to ionizing radiation for their SIJ procedures. With an improved&#xD;
      understanding of SIJ sensory innevation and technical improvements in RFA electrodes, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that ultrasound guided SIJ diagnostic sensory blocks and RFA will lead to&#xD;
      clinically significant outcomes that will be at least comparable to conventional&#xD;
      fluoroscopic-guided techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of ultrasound-guided PSN sacroiliac joint sensory&#xD;
           block compared to fluoroscopic-guided lateral branch sacroiliac joint block.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the relative effectiveness of ultrasound-guided PSN sacroiliac joint&#xD;
           radiofrequency ablation compared to fluoroscopic-guided lateral branch sacroiliac joint&#xD;
           RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective cohort study examining the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided SIJ&#xD;
      sensory block and RFA of the PSN, compared to fluoroscopic guided SIJ RFA. Participants will&#xD;
      first undergo a local anesthetic block under ultrasound guidance to determine the predictive&#xD;
      value of this test for SIJ RFA; they will then undergo the SIJ RFA procedure. For some&#xD;
      patients in this study, this will be a repeat RFA procedure as they would have had a previous&#xD;
      fluoroscopic-guided SIJ RFA with success, but subsequent return of their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIJ Sensory Block: Eligible study subjects will initially undergo a lidocaine block of the&#xD;
      PSN at the lateral crest under ultrasound guidance. Their index pain intensity prior to the&#xD;
      block must be &gt;2/10. Under ultrasound guidance, 0.5 mL of 2% lidocaine will be injected from&#xD;
      the inferomedial border of the PSIS to the third transverse sacral tubercle at approximately&#xD;
      1.5 cm intervals along the skin surface. Following the local anesthetic block, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a pain diary for 6 hours. Specifically, their baseline pain will be&#xD;
      reassessed and their ability to perform functional activities will also be assessed over that&#xD;
      time period. The results of this block will be compared to the results of conventional blocks&#xD;
      done under fluoroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIJ RFA: Ultrasound-guided RFA of the PSN will be performed using the same technique as the&#xD;
      local anesthetic block with the exception that 2 Nimbus multitined electrodes will be used in&#xD;
      a bipolar configuration. The electrodes will be placed along the lateral crest using a&#xD;
      sequential, leap-frogging technique from the inferomedial aspect of the PSIS (at or just&#xD;
      above the level of the S1 dorsal sacral foramen if visible, or the S1 spinous process if not)&#xD;
      to the third transverse sacral tubercle at 1.5-2 cm intervals at the skin surface. A&#xD;
      radiofrequency current will be passed for 120 seconds per site thus raising the temperature&#xD;
      at the dorsal periosteum and adjacent soft tissue to 80Â°C resulting in thermal coagulation of&#xD;
      the plexus. Prior to performing the thermal lesion, electrical stimulation at 2 Hz and 2.0 V&#xD;
      will be administered. If the patient perceives, or the operator observes muscle contraction&#xD;
      of the leg or anal sphincter, no radiofrequency current will be applied and the needle tip&#xD;
      will be adjusted to a position away from where the sacral nerve roots may lie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of ultrasound-guided sensory blocks and RFA will be directly compared to&#xD;
      the effectiveness of fluoroscopic-guided sensory blocks and RFA. In patients who have had the&#xD;
      SIJ RFA procedure previously, their current ultrasound-guided PDQQ-S scores will be compared&#xD;
      to their previous fluoroscopic-guided PDQQ-S results. In patients who are receiving the SIJ&#xD;
      RFA procedure for the first time, a database of SIJ RFA PDQQ-S scores of patients treated&#xD;
      over the past 5 years with the fluoroscopic-guided RFA technique is available for comparison.&#xD;
      Their results will be compared to age and pre-RFA matched patients from the database.&#xD;

If there is ongoing, clinically significant relief at 6 months (&gt;30% improvement in pain intensity and/or at least 2 point improvement on the pain severity question (question #1) of the PDQQ-S), patients will be reached by phone to complete the PDQQ-S at 3-month intervals up to 12 months post-RFA and then at 4-month intervals up to 24 months, or until their pain intensity returns to baseline (&lt;30% improvement and/or &lt;2 point improvement on question 1 of the PDQQ-S on 2 consecutive follow-ups), whichever comes first.</description>
