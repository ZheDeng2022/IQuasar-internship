  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immigrant and refugee children and youth are the fastest growing segment of Canadian society,&#xD;
      but their mental health is too often overlooked even though their high rates of symptoms are&#xD;
      increasingly of concern. These children and youth face the same developmental challenges as&#xD;
      other children, but migration and resettlement amplify challenges and also create additional&#xD;
      risks. Although a literature about the effects of immigrant family life on the mental health&#xD;
      of children exists, very little research has examined the specific extent and implications of&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among refugee children and youth. In addition, the best&#xD;
      practice intervention strategies that most optimally support their mental health difficulties&#xD;
      have not been evaluated. This study investigates the effectiveness of a treatment&#xD;
      intervention in a sample of refugee children: Narrative Exposure Therapy or NET and KIDNET&#xD;
      (developed for younger children), selected due to their documented superiority relative to&#xD;
      other forms of treatment for children and youth with PTSD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Refugee children and youth are at high risk for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and&#xD;
      related psychological distress potentially interfering with optimal adjustment and&#xD;
      development in the host country. Following extensive efforts and a workshop by the&#xD;
      Partnership for Health System Improvement Initiative, comprised of researchers, decision&#xD;
      makers, practitioners, immigrant service agencies and related community groups in Ontario, it&#xD;
      was determined that research addressing this at-risk population is a priority area. The&#xD;
      current study addresses this urgent need by aiming to enhance the health system's capacity in&#xD;
      relation to the needs of one of Canada's most vulnerable population. As local refugee&#xD;
      settlement continue to rise and reported rates for PTSD in refugee children and youth remain&#xD;
      startling; often intensified by historical traumatic factors such as the intensity of&#xD;
      exposure to war and other atrocities prior to migration, it is essential to research this&#xD;
      highly vulnerable population. In particular, a need exists for research, such as the current&#xD;
      study, that specifically documents, assesses and treats PTSD in refugee children and youth,&#xD;
      thereby increasing knowledge in the community and preventing further negative outcomes by&#xD;
      improving education and health care systems. Although treatment interventions exist for PTSD,&#xD;
      the many unique challenges faced by refugee populations are often overlooked. Narrative&#xD;
      Exposure Therapy (NET or KIDNET), designed to restore agency and provide symptom relief, is&#xD;
      one intervention for PTSD treatment that can indicate positive outcomes for refugee&#xD;
      populations. The current proposal describes a research study to address the needs of this&#xD;
      at-risk population through pilot testing of the feasibility of providing PTSD intervention&#xD;
      within two school-based primary health care programs and an inner city youth shelter in&#xD;
      Toronto. The results will contribute to our understanding of the feasibility of a model of&#xD;
      intervention, which can be made available for use in other jurisdictions of Ontario and&#xD;
      across Canada to improve adjustment and prevent mental health problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is research project will utilize a randomized clinical trial of treatment for PTSD. It&#xD;
      includes refugee children and youth, between the ages of 7 and 15, from two established MHSPI&#xD;
      clinics, which currently serve approximately 40 schools, with a total school-aged population&#xD;
      of more than 20,000 as well as youth between the ages of 16 and 19 from Covenant House. This&#xD;
      study will draw on established measures for PTSD mental health and trauma histories through&#xD;
      the use of standardized rating scales and interview methods. Interpreters will be made&#xD;
      available and sensitivity adjustments for language and culture will be made. Research&#xD;
      assistants will be trained to administer the UCLA screening instruments for PTSD to identify&#xD;
      potential contributing or mediating factors of outcome . In addition, paediatricians will be&#xD;
      trained in the UCLA diagnostic process to provide case identification, and graduate/medical&#xD;
      students will be trained in NET/KIDNET, to facilitate implementation and evaluation of the&#xD;
      treatment procedures. All children and youth enrolled at the two MSPHI and Covenant House&#xD;
      clinics will placed into one of 3 groups: 'refugee', 'other immigrant' and 'native-born', and&#xD;
      be screened for PTSD. All study participants, with a score of 15 or higher, as recommended by&#xD;
      the UCLA group, will then be included in the next phase which consists of in depth clinical&#xD;
      assessment. Of these participants who are identified as PTSD diagnostic cases are then&#xD;
      included in the treatment evaluation phase: randomized into the control- treatment groups and&#xD;
      placed into gender-paired therapeutic dyads, i.e. female therapists will be paired with&#xD;
      female children and adolescents with PTSD and males with males. Ten male and 10 female&#xD;
      therapists will take part in the project and each will be assigned to treat 20 people with&#xD;
      PTSD, resulting in a total estimated treated study sample of 400. The control group&#xD;
      participants will proceed to the exact same treatment procedures following a three-month&#xD;
      wait. All participants included in the treatment groups, either immediate or waiting list&#xD;
      control, will receive 3, 6 and 12 month follow-up assessments to evaluate PTSD symptoms using&#xD;
      the same UCLA measurements to screen initially. All data will be collected, coded and&#xD;
      analyzed using standard statistical analyses appropriate to the research design.&#xD;
