  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain represents one of the most common symptoms of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that can seriously&#xD;
      affect patient health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central neuropathic pain, the main form of pain in MS patients, represents a significant&#xD;
      clinical problem, in consideration of its poorly responsiveness to available therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive, well-tolerated procedure with an high&#xD;
      and well documented neuromodulation activity at Central Nervous System (CNS) level. First&#xD;
      evidences obtained by animal, neurophysiological and clinical studies suggested its potential&#xD;
      efficacy in neuropathic pain treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular spinal DCS (sDCS) has been proven to modulate Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflex&#xD;
      (NWR), an objective and sensitive tool to explore pain processing at the Spinal Level and&#xD;
      recommended by European Federation of Neurological Society (EFNS) to evaluate the analgesic&#xD;
      effect of treatments. In this order of view the investigators' objective is to investigate&#xD;
      sDCS efficacy in MS neurophatic pain treatment applying validated clinical scales,&#xD;
      neurophysiological acquisitions and specific biological marker dosages.&#xD;

      The investigators plan to recruit, at the IRCCS Neurological National Institute C. Mondino,&#xD;
      60 consecutive patients with definite Multiple Sclerosis (MS) according to 2005 McDonald&#xD;
      criteria in a follow-up procedure that includes a general and neurological evaluation scored&#xD;
      according to the Expanded Disability Status Scale of Kurtzke and its functional systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapsing-remitting (RR), secondary-progressive (SP) and primary-progressive (PP) MS&#xD;
      patients, affecting by neuropathic or nociceptive chronic pain conditions in accord to 1994&#xD;
      International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)classification, will be recruited.&#xD;
      Patients complaining any form of headache will be excluded by the study. The investigators&#xD;
      will excluded also patients with cognitive impairment (Minimental State Examination - MMSE-&#xD;
      &lt;= 21) and psychiatry diseases, in particular depression (Back Depression Inventory Scale -&#xD;
      BDI - &gt;15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristic and intensity of pain symptoms will be collected respectively with validated&#xD;
      Italian version of Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory Scale (NPSI) and Numerical Rating&#xD;
      Scale (NRS). Spasticity of lower legs, if present, will be clinical assessed with Ashworth&#xD;
      Scale and Neurophysiologically evaluated with H/M ratio and Vibratory Inhibition of H-Reflex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) will be assessed by means of the Medical Outcome&#xD;
      36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) whereas the presence and severity of fatigue will be&#xD;
      assessed by means of the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RR patients will be evaluated in stationary phase of the disease that is at least two months&#xD;
      after the last clinical relapse and at least one month after the end of a steroidal&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be consecutive enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to two group: 1.&#xD;
      Sham and 2. Anodal Spinal Direct Current Stimulation Treatment, in a double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before enrollment, the study protocol will be explained to each subject, and informed written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <measure>Central endocannabinoid level as determined by Activity of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) in platelets</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>The endocannabinoid system is involved in descending central pain control and can be modulated by other neurostimulation techniques as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. The investigators suppose that one of the major effect of sDCS is to modulate supraspinal central pain control through activation of endocannabinoid system inducing the analgesic effect. Alteration of endocannabinoid system activity is also involved in other pathological aspects of Multiple Sclerosis as spasms, spasticity and incontinence and to acute and chronic neurodegeneration (anti-oxidant activity and inhibition of glutamate release and signalling). Activity of Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase (FAAH) in platelets will be quantify.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spasticity as determined by Ashworth Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>30 days</time_frame>
    <description>As sDCS reduces NWR area and as it may modulate endocannabinoid system, the investigators could suppose other positive effects of this treatment in Multiple Sclerosis patients as reduction of painful spasms and spasticity. The investigators will evaluate the effect of sDCS on spasticity, if present, investigating its effect on validate ad hoc scales (Ashworth scale) and on neurophysiological acquisitions (H reflex).</description>
