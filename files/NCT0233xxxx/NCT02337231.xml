      A randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial of borage oil vs soybean oil to determine&#xD;
      whether the metabolism and/or impact of medium chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (MC-PUFAs)&#xD;
      in botanical oil supplements are changed in relationship to specific genotypes in a SNP&#xD;
      (rs174537) strongly associated with FADS1 activity and PUFA metabolism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a randomized, controlled, cross-over clinical trial of borage oil and&#xD;
      soybean oil to determine whether the metabolism and/or impact of MC-PUFAs in botanical oil&#xD;
      supplements are changed in relationship to specific genotypes in a SNP (rs174537) strongly&#xD;
      associated with FADS1 activity and PUFA metabolism. Subjects previously genotyped at rs174537&#xD;
      will be given supplements and both blood PUFA (serum and erythrocyte membranes), urinary&#xD;
      eicosanoids and eicosanoid release from whole blood (leukocyte generation) will be measured&#xD;
      as biochemical determinants of genotype impact on supplement metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of genotype at the rs174537 locus on the metabolism of MC-PUFAs in&#xD;
      borage and soybean oil to long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), including&#xD;
      arachidonic acid, the investigators will utilize a double blind, randomized, crossover&#xD;
      design. There will be three study groups based on the genotype of the healthy volunteer at&#xD;
      rs174537. Individuals within each genotype will be consented and screened up to 8 weeks prior&#xD;
      to randomization and the start of the intervention. Subjects will be randomized to begin with&#xD;
      4 weeks of either borage oil or soybean oil followed by an 8 week washout period, and then&#xD;
      another 4 week period in which they take the second oil. Study visits will occur at 0, 2, and&#xD;
      4 weeks during each oil supplementation period, in addition to the consenting visit, for a&#xD;
      total of 7 visits during the study.&#xD;
