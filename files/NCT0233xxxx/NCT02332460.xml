      Infliximab is the active ingredient in a drug currently sold by the trade names Remicade,&#xD;
      Remsima and Inflectra. Infliximab neutralizes tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, a chemical&#xD;
      messenger (cytokine) in the immune system, and belongs to a class of drugs called &quot;TNF&#xD;
      inhibitors&quot;. 8-55% of patients receiving infliximab have an infusion reaction. Infusion&#xD;
      reactions are unintended reactions that occur during infusion of the drug and up to 14 days&#xD;
      after. The incidence varies widely in different studies and seems difficult to determine due&#xD;
      to variations in reporting of reactions, different definitions of reactions and retrospective&#xD;
      data collection. The aim of this study is to estimate the incidence of infusion related&#xD;
      reactions and investigate risk factors and immunological mechanisms of infusion reactions to&#xD;
      infliximab in patients with a chronic inflammatory disease.&#xD;

      Background: Infliximab is the active ingredient in a drug currently sold by the trade names&#xD;
      Remicade, Remsima and Inflectra. Infliximab neutralizes tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α, a&#xD;
      chemical messenger (cytokine) in the immune system, and belongs to a class of drugs called&#xD;
      &quot;TNF inhibitors&quot;. This class of drug comprises effective, biological agents used in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. The use of TNF inhibitors is increasing, and&#xD;
      infliximab is the third bestselling drug by value in Norway in 2013. By being a recombinant&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody with a murine region, infliximab is associated with infusion reactions.&#xD;
      8-55% of patients receiving infliximab have an infusion reaction. Infusion reactions are&#xD;
      unintended reactions that occur during infusion of the drug and up to 14 days after. The&#xD;
      incidence varies widely in different studies and seems difficult to determine due to&#xD;
      variations in reporting of reactions, different definitions of reactions and retrospective&#xD;
      data collection. Protective factors, risk factors and the causes of the reactions are not&#xD;
      well known. Different treatment strategies are being used, but evidence of efficacy varies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The aim of this study is to estimate the incidence of infusion related reactions and&#xD;
      investigate risk factors and immunological mechanisms of infusion reactions to infliximab in&#xD;
      patients with a chronic inflammatory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimate the incidence of infusion reactions in patients with chronic inflammatory disease&#xD;
      receiving infliximab&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the correlation between infusion reactions and the formation of antibodies to&#xD;
           infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify individual risk factors for infusion reactions to infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify immunological mechanisms of infusion reactions to infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify immunomodulatory effects and immunological changes in the patients during&#xD;
           treatment with infliximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study will be a prospective, longitudinal study where all departments&#xD;
      with patients starting infliximab or switching infliximab from one supplier to another in the&#xD;
      Western Norway Health Region (Helse Vest RHF) are invited to participate.&#xD;
