  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn-related pain is severe and often difficult to manage. Healthcare workers struggle with&#xD;
      keeping burn patients comfortable, especially when these patients undergo dressing changes of&#xD;
      their burn wounds of their skin since these procedures often cause severe pain. Patients with&#xD;
      burn wounds frequently require high doses of opioids (narcotics) and calming (anxiolytic)&#xD;
      agents to the extent that clinicians must weigh the risks associated with these doses against&#xD;
      achieving adequate analgesia and comfort. The biggest risk is over-sedation to cause&#xD;
      breathing troubles. Inadequate pain control during these procedures heightens pain&#xD;
      perception, anxiety, and fear surrounding the experience and may lead to patients&#xD;
      experiencing additional psychological disorders like depression, acute stress disorder (ASD),&#xD;
      and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, therapeutic options for better&#xD;
      management of pain and anxiety during these procedures need to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address whether the addition of ketamine during dressing changes improves&#xD;
      patients' pain control and comfort and whether this leads to favorable psychological&#xD;
      outcomes. The study is designed to compare ketamine with placebo when they are added to usual&#xD;
      care (opioids and anxiolytics) during dressing changes. The main outcomes of the study will&#xD;
      be the amount of opioid and anxiolytic agents each group receives during their procedure; the&#xD;
      presence of pain-related anxiety shortly after the procedures; blood markers of stress during&#xD;
      the procedures; and the presence of depression, anxiety and stress disorders prior to&#xD;
      discharge. This study will assess whether the early administration of ketamine reduces pain&#xD;
      and anxiety to prevent the need for high doses of opioids and anxiolytics. A total of 30&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled.&#xD;

      Research Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Outcome Measure(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of ketamine&#xD;
      versus placebo in addition to usual care used during dressing changes in 30 thermally injured&#xD;
      subjects. The primary outcomes are the opioid and benzodiazepine requirements surrounding&#xD;
      dressing changes, pain profiles, hemodynamic changes, and pain-related anxiety scores related&#xD;
      to ketamine use versus placebo. Secondary outcomes are exploratory and will evaluate the&#xD;
      inflammatory markers, IL-1β and IL-6, and their presence in regards to ketamine versus&#xD;
      placebo as well as their associations with ASD, depression, and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Description of Population to be Enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study methodology will follow the CONSORT guidelines. A total of 30 critically ill burn&#xD;
      patients with a total body surface area (TBSA) ≥ 5% requiring dressing changes that will be&#xD;
      performed in the hydro procedure room will be enrolled over 18-24 months from the 9-bed&#xD;
      burn-trauma ICU (B-TICU) at the UCH. Patients will only be enrolled if they can receive&#xD;
      dressing changes in the burn treatment room because these patients are alert and oriented,&#xD;
      not sedated, and are able to communicate with health care providers and respond to questions&#xD;
      regarding their perceptions of pain and anxiety. Subjects will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blind manner to receive placebo (n=15) or ketamine (n=15) in addition to usual care&#xD;
      used before, during, and after dressing changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Assessment of Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis 1: Adjunctive ketamine safely reduces short-term pain and anxiety&#xD;
      surrounding dressing change events in conscious thermally injured patients compared to usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: Comparatively evaluate the opioid and benzodiazepine requirements before, during, and&#xD;
      after dressing changes between placebo and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, the subject's&#xD;
      active medication list will be evaluated for analgesic, anxiolytic, and neuropathic&#xD;
      medications. Every hour, starting 4 hours prior to the beginning of the dressing change&#xD;
      procedure, each drug, dose, and route will be recorded for administered medications. Opioid&#xD;
      medications will be converted to fentanyl equivalents and benzodiazepine medications will be&#xD;
      converted to midazolam equivalents as fentanyl and midazolam represent the most commonly&#xD;
      administered agents. Documentation will continue every hour up to 4 hours after the end of&#xD;
      the procedure. This will be repeated for every dressing change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: Comparatively evaluate patients' perceived pain levels before, during, and after&#xD;
      dressing changes between placebo and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to rate their pain score using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) [anchored by 0&#xD;
      representing no pain and 10 being the worst pain the patient has ever experienced]. The VAS&#xD;
      instrument will be administered by the investigator or designee within 4-12 hours prior to&#xD;
      the dressing change procedure. Subjects will then be asked to rate their pain using the VAS&#xD;
      within 4-12 hours after the end of the procedure. This will be repeated for every dressing&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1c: Comparatively evaluate patients' pain-related anxiety surrounding dressing changes&#xD;
      between placebo and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, the subject&#xD;
      will be asked to rate their pain-related anxiety score using the Burn Specific Pain Anxiety&#xD;
      Scale (BSPAS). The BSPAS instrument will be administered by the investigator or designee&#xD;
      within 4-12 hours prior to the dressing change procedure. Subjects will then be asked to rate&#xD;
      their pain-related anxiety score using BSPAS again within 4-12 hours after the end of the&#xD;
      procedure. The BSPAS is a 5-item assessment with questions relating to: feeling of worry,&#xD;
      emotions surrounding dressing changes, anticipation or anxiety related to pain surrounding&#xD;
      procedures, and feelings of being &quot;on edge&quot; due to experiencing pain. Each question is scored&#xD;
      on a visual analog line starting at 0 and ends at 100, two anchors of reference for the&#xD;
      subject. This tool was designed to detect anticipatory anxiety in burn patients and has been&#xD;
      used in studies with the ability to distinguish acute anxiety in burn patients related to&#xD;
      dressing changes. This will be repeated for every dressing change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1d: Comparatively evaluate the occurrence of hypo- or hypertension, tachycardia,&#xD;
      neurologic agitation / disassociation, over-sedation, and the need for open-label ketamine&#xD;
      between placebo and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure and heart rate will be monitored hourly for four hours before, during, and&#xD;
      after the end of the procedure. Hypotension will be defined as a systolic blood pressure ≤90&#xD;
      mmHg or a decrease of systolic blood pressure of ≥40 mmHg, hypertension will be defined as a&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure ≥180 mmHg or an increase of systolic blood pressure of ≥40 mmHg, and&#xD;
      tachycardia is defined as a heart rate ≥120 beats/minute or an increase of ≥20 beats/minutes.&#xD;
      The administration of fluid boluses or vasopressor therapy will also be recorded. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that these therapies will not be required. The Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale&#xD;
      (RASS) score will be used to determine neurologic disassociation (RASS score of +2 to +4&#xD;
      indicating agitation or combative) and over-sedation (RASS score of -3 to -5 indicating&#xD;
      moderate to deep sedation). The RASS score is performed as routine care every hour and it&#xD;
      will be recorded for four hours before and after the end of the procedure. Open label&#xD;
      ketamine may be administered by the burn ICU physician if patients have received both doses&#xD;
      of study drug and subjects report pain scores of ≥7 (out of 10) despite the administration of&#xD;
      ≥400 mcg fentanyl equivalents (this represents the 75th percentile of fentanyl required in&#xD;
      the medication usage evaluations conducted at UCH) or a RASS score of -4 to -5, indicating&#xD;
      levels of sedation deep enough to warrant caution against administering additional doses of&#xD;
      opioids or anxiolytics. The use of open label ketamine will be recorded and comparatively&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 2: Adjunctive ketamine administration alters cytokine levels,&#xD;
      specifically interleukins IL-1β and IL-6, during dressing changes compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a: Comparatively evaluate the magnitude of change in serum concentrations of IL-1β and&#xD;
      IL-6 levels during dressing changes between placebo and ketamine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject is scheduled for a dressing change in the burn treatment room, venous blood&#xD;
      samples of 10 mL will be obtained from an indwelling catheter 4-12 hours before and after the&#xD;
      procedure to evaluate the level of IL-1β and IL-6 in the serum. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      centrifuged for 15 minutes at 3000rpm with plasma immediately separated and stored at -80°F.&#xD;
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) will be used to determine IL-1β and IL-6&#xD;
      concentrations after all subjects have completed the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis 3: Ketamine when used as an adjunct during burn dressing changes reduces&#xD;
      the incidence of long-term psychometric outcomes when compared to usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3a: Comparatively evaluate the incidence of ASD between placebo and ketamine after&#xD;
      dressing changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within seven days of the final dressing change procedure, an investigator will facilitate the&#xD;
      completion of the Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Scale (SASRS). The SASRS instrument will be&#xD;
      administered by the investigator or designee. The SASRS consists of 30 items. Ten questions&#xD;
      are related to dissociation, six to re-experiencing of trauma, six to anxiety and increased&#xD;
      arousal, six to avoidance of the trauma, and two to impairment in functioning. The questions&#xD;
      can be modified to pertain to a specific event (i.e. burn dressing changes). Each question is&#xD;
      scored from 0 to 5. Also, the instrument contains an additional three questions specifically&#xD;
      associated to ASD. They involve an event description, how traumatic the event was, and for&#xD;
      how long the subject had his or her most severe symptoms in relation to the event. In order&#xD;
      to have a positive score for ASD, the subject must score a 3 or higher for at least three of&#xD;
      the dissociative symptoms and at least one symptom of each of the following: re-experiencing,&#xD;
      increased anxiety and arousal, avoidance, and impairment of functioning. This scale has&#xD;
      demonstrated reliability and validity and has been used in burn-related studies to assess for&#xD;
      ASD with positive results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3b: Comparatively evaluate the incidence of anxiety and depression between placebo and&#xD;
      ketamine prior to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3-7 days prior to the projected date of discharge, the investigator or designee will&#xD;
      administer the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS instrument will be&#xD;
      administered by the investigator or designee only. The HADS consists of 14 questions, seven&#xD;
      for anxiety and seven for depression. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, with a cut-off&#xD;
      cumulative score of 11 for both subscales indicative of anxiety or depression. This scoring&#xD;
      tool has been used for 30 years, possesses excellent reliability and validity, and avoids&#xD;
      reliance conditions that are also common somatic symptoms of illness such fatigue, insomnia,&#xD;
      and hypersomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3c: Comparatively evaluate the incidence of PTSD between placebo and ketamine prior to&#xD;
      hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3-7 days prior to the projected date of discharge, the investigator or designee will&#xD;
      administer the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R). The IES-R instrument will be&#xD;
      administered by the investigator or designee only. The IES-R evaluates subjective distress&#xD;
      caused by traumatic events and will be used to assess manifestations of PTSD. It is not&#xD;
      diagnostic but possesses excellent reliability and validity for manifestations of PTSD. The&#xD;
      IES-R has three subscales (eight items on intrusion, eight items on avoidance, and six items&#xD;
      on hyperarousal). Each item is scored on a four point scale: 0 = &quot;not at all,&quot; 1 = &quot;a little&#xD;
      bit,&quot; 2 = &quot;moderately often,&quot; 3 = &quot;quite a bit,&quot; and 4 = &quot;extremely often.&quot; The total score&#xD;
      of each subscale may be averaged and a cumulative score of 30 is indicative of the presence&#xD;
      of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3d: Assess possible associations between the cytokine levels and ASD, anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, and PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical associations between IL-1β and IL-6 values with SASRS, HADS, and IES-R will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 subjects will be evaluated (15 in each study group) based on a power of 0.8 and&#xD;
      a significance level of 0.05. Data obtained from medication usage evaluations at the UCH were&#xD;
      used to estimate the mean and standard deviations for the change in cumulative fentanyl&#xD;
      equivalent doses for the four hour period before vs. after dressing changes. Using standard&#xD;
      deviations of 130mcg, 12 subjects are required in each study group to show a desired&#xD;
      difference of 150mcg between groups when comparing the magnitude of change in the fentanyl&#xD;
      dose before vs. after the procedure. While all dressing changes will be evaluated, it was&#xD;
      assumed for this analysis that only one dressing change per subject will occur. An additional&#xD;
      three subjects per study group will be enrolled to ensure a total of 24 subjects assuming an&#xD;
      upper limit of 20% for a possible drop-out rate. Thirty subjects provides power of 0.8 at a&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05 to detect a 50% decline in patients reporting moderate pain (by&#xD;
      VAS or BSPAS) or anxiety (by SASRS) assuming the baseline rates exceed 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean, median, standard deviation, and interquartile ranges will be determined for all&#xD;
      continuous data. The primary analyses will include all randomized subjects based on intent to&#xD;
      treat regardless of whether they completed the study. Additional analyses will be conducted&#xD;
      based on subjects completing the protocol (i.e. those withdrawn from the study prior to&#xD;
      completing the protocol or receiving open-label ketamine will be excluded) and those&#xD;
      completing treatment. Statistical analysis of continuous data between groups will use the&#xD;
      student T test or the Mann-Whitney U for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively.&#xD;
      Statistical analyses of continuous data within a study group will use the paired student T&#xD;
      test or the Wilcoxan Rank test for parametric and nonparametric data, respectively.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis of proportions will use the Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test for&#xD;
      parametric and nonparametric data, respectively, with appropriate corrections for small&#xD;
      sample size. Pearson product or Spearman Rank Order will be used for correlation analyses of&#xD;
      IL-1β or IL-6 with the results of the psychometric scoring tools. The study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the primary hypothesis and the related specific aims. All secondary hypotheses&#xD;
      are exploratory to investigate consistency of data and analyses will be interpreted&#xD;
      cautiously.&#xD;
