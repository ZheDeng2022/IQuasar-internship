      The IMPROVA study is designed to identify novel predictors of vascular access success or&#xD;
      failure. Clinical assessment complimented by Doppler ultrasound is the only currently&#xD;
      employed methods of assessing suitability for placement of arteriovenous fistulae (AVF).&#xD;
      These techniques are not capable of predicting vascular access outcomes suggesting that other&#xD;
      potentially measurable factors may play a part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite efforts to improve placement of AVF in both the haemodialysis incident and prevalent&#xD;
      population, many patients continue to dialyse through a central venous catheter (CVC),&#xD;
      exposing them to higher risks of infection, co morbidity and mortality than dialysing via an&#xD;
      AVF. Furthermore, AVF primary failure rates are reportedly as high in 20-50% in published&#xD;
      series confirming that ultrasound cannot inform the clinician sufficiently to accurately&#xD;
      predict success or failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to perform enhanced assessments of arterial health preoperatively&#xD;
      and correlate these measurements with early AVF outcome. We intend to perform pulse wave&#xD;
      analysis and velocity; measure advanced glycation end products and assess endothelial&#xD;
      function using a vascular occlusion test. We also aim to assess whether patient reported&#xD;
      symptoms of hand function can predict AVF outcome. These non-invasive measurements will&#xD;
      provide a more accurate picture of overall vascular health prior to AVF formation with the&#xD;
      ultimate intention of informing the clinician as to the likelihood of success or failure.&#xD;

      Purpose of proposed investigation The IMPROVA study will utilise novel non-invasive methods&#xD;
      of arterial health assessment and correlate these measurements with the early outcomes of AVF&#xD;
      formation. The development of new techniques to inform the clinician pre-operatively will aid&#xD;
      in a more tailored approach to fistula planning, predict inevitable failures and consequently&#xD;
      improve success rate. The ultimate aim is to identify novel methods of predicting fistula&#xD;
      failure to prevent patients from developing into a cycle of consecutive failure, catheter&#xD;
      dependence and therefore worse overall outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Despite the merits of autologous arteriovenous fistulas (AVF), failure rates&#xD;
      remain high with 20-50% failing to mature. As a consequence many patients will suffer&#xD;
      multiple attempts at establishing arteriovenous access and initiate dialysis on a Central&#xD;
      Venous Catheter (CVC) thereby extending this risk of subsequent failure and increasing the&#xD;
      risk of mortality and serious comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictors of maturation have been reported in a number of studies. The mainstay is&#xD;
      pre-operative vascular mapping by duplex ultrasonography (DUS) which relies on vessel size&#xD;
      and site. Whilst this has demonstrated improved patency and decreased early failure rate&#xD;
      vascular measurements are unable to independently predict outcome of fistula success&#xD;
      suggesting other contributing factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process of maturation can be modelled around changes in blood flow, flow patterns and&#xD;
      subsequent vessel dilatation and remodelling. The ability of the artery and vein to dilate is&#xD;
      essential to fistula maturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that influence vessel remodelling following fistula formation have been under&#xD;
      investigated in this important aspect in the management of kidney disease. Arterial stiffness&#xD;
      refers to the distensability, compliance and elastic modulus of the arterial vascular system.&#xD;
      It is found to increase with age, diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis and end stage renal&#xD;
      disease. Aortic pulse wave velocity is considered the gold standard for assessing arterial&#xD;
      stiffness and the pulse wave Vicorder©Skidmore Medical is a non-invasive, easy to learn and&#xD;
      reproducible method of assessing stiffness. Increased aortic pulse wave velocity has been&#xD;
      independently associated with adverse cardiovascular outcome in large prospective studies&#xD;
      including specifically patients with end stage renal failure. Advanced glycation end products&#xD;
      (AGEs) have also been implicated in the development of vascular pathology resulting in AVF&#xD;
      failure. The measurement of advanced glycation end products, using the AGE reader©Diagnoptics&#xD;
      Technologies, offers a new avenue to establish the association between AGE levels and AVF&#xD;
      outcomes. Furthermore, potential therapeutic options exist for improving the AGE-related&#xD;
      vascular biology of AVFs with evidence that aminoguanine, ALT-946, ALT-711, statins,&#xD;
      pyrodoxamine and dietary modifications can reduce AGE levels. Endothelial function is another&#xD;
      aspect of arterial health that has been under reported in vascular access research. The&#xD;
      INVOS® spectra machine uses near infrared spectroscopy to measure the mixed arteriovenous&#xD;
      saturations of deep tissues as a reflection of perfusion. Manipulation of this environment&#xD;
      using a vascular occlusion test can provide invaluable information regarding endothelial&#xD;
      responsiveness. Patient reported symptoms of vascular health may also provide important&#xD;
      information in the search for novel predictors of AVF outcomes. Many vascular diseases have&#xD;
      associated symptoms that reflect severity and direct questioning of patients regarding the&#xD;
      vascular health of their upper limbs may offer further guidance in the placement of AVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of these non-invasive, easy to learn and reproducible tests offers an&#xD;
      exciting opportunity to identify predictors of and improve outcomes in AVF formation.&#xD;
