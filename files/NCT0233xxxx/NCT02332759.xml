  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Materna device aims to prevent pelvic tissue damage by preventing overstretching of&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle fibers during delivery. The device is a single use, disposable,&#xD;
      mechanical dilator that penetrates the first 4 cm or Â½ of the vaginal canal and gradually&#xD;
      expands the vagina from a resting diameter of 2-3 cm to the fully expanded size of a&#xD;
      delivering fetus, roughly 8-10 cm. The Materna device will be used during the first stage of&#xD;
      labor, for roughly 1-2 hours, in a hospital Labor and Delivery unit, under the supervision of&#xD;
      trained clinical labor and delivery providers&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 80% of women who deliver vaginally will sustain a vaginal tear, and roughly half of all&#xD;
      women will suffer from permanent pelvic muscle damage that may lead to pelvic disorders later&#xD;
      in life.(1-8) The consequences of vaginal tearing are acute and chronic pain, longer recovery&#xD;
      times, sexual dysfunction and permanent disfigurement.(1-4) Additionally, women often say&#xD;
      that the prospect of tearing is one the things they fear most regarding childbirth. Tearing&#xD;
      during childbirth is well documented as occurring during most deliveries, however there is&#xD;
      additional damage now being discovered that occurs internally to the pelvic muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has long been thought that childbirth is the leading factor contributing to the&#xD;
      development of pelvic floor disorders such as pelvic organ prolapse, urinary and fecal&#xD;
      incontinence. (6,9,10) In the last 10 years, new imaging studies have shown that&#xD;
      approximately 20-30% of women will have their pelvic muscles permanently separated from the&#xD;
      pelvic bone during vaginal delivery.(5-11) In an additional 20-30% of cases, the muscles may&#xD;
      remain attached to the pelvic bone but have been stretched to the point of becoming&#xD;
      functionally compromised&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most promising ideas to prevent this damage is to slowly prepare the pelvic&#xD;
      muscles, during labor while the cervix is dilating, in order to maximize their stretch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous data and preliminary findings of Materna suggest the following overall working&#xD;
      hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vaginal lacerations and pelvic floor muscle damage lead to increased incidence of pelvic&#xD;
           floor disorders and other negative sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vaginal lacerations and pelvic floor muscle damage are caused by over straining of&#xD;
           pelvic muscles and vaginal tissues without maximizing the tissue strain using&#xD;
           appropriate viscoelastic relaxation during the second phase of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The incidence and severity of vaginal lacerations and pelvic floor muscle damage can be&#xD;
           reduced by inducing a more gradual strain of the vaginal tissues using a device-based&#xD;
           approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there are no devices available in the U.S. to protect the pelvic muscles from&#xD;
      damage during childbirth. The Materna device takes advantage of well-proven biomechanical&#xD;
      data in the fields of sports medicine and orthopedics showing that tissue is viscoelastic,&#xD;
      meaning that the more slowly it is stretched the easier it is to stretch. Materna aims to&#xD;
      take advantage of this biomechanical phenomena as well as the length of the first phase of&#xD;
      labor to reduce the tension in the tissue, slowly maximizing the stretch of the tissue in&#xD;
      order to prepare it for a delivery with less injury. There is also evidence showing that&#xD;
      reducing the tension in the pelvic muscles could lead to a shorter delivery time, resulting&#xD;
      in a less stressful and healthier delivery for the baby&#xD;
