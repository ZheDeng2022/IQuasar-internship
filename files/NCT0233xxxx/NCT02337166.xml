      BACKGROUND: Periodontal disease is an infection that results in progressive loss of dental&#xD;
      support, which may lead to tooth loss.. The goal of the present study was to evaluate if&#xD;
      recombinant human Fibroblast Growth Factor type 2 (rhFGF-2) applied in periodontal intrabony&#xD;
      defects in a hyaluronic acid (HA) carrier would enhance the clinical paramenters of&#xD;
      regeneration of the periodontal attachment apparatus and the long-term maintenance of the&#xD;
      results obtained. METHODS: Thirty adult patients were evaluated. Initial treatment consisted&#xD;
      in plaque control measures executed previously to the experimental phase. Two intra-bony&#xD;
      defects in each patient were ramdomly allocated for each of the treatment methods employed.&#xD;
      Control group (n=30) were treated by open debridement with the papilla preservation flaps,&#xD;
      while the text group (n=30) also received a topical application of rhFGF-2/HA in the&#xD;
      intrabony defect. The parameters evaluated were, probing depth (PD), gingival recession&#xD;
      (REC), probing attachment level (PAL) and probing bone level (PBL). Clinical measurements&#xD;
      obtained at baseline and 1, 5 and 10 years after the surgical procedure were compared.&#xD;

      Study Population and Experimental Design The study was designed as a randomized, prospective,&#xD;
      split-mouth, controlled clinical trial. It was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of&#xD;
      the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki (version VI, 2002), after approval of&#xD;
      the study design and consent by the Faculty of Medicine, Ethical Committee of Medical&#xD;
      Research, Federal Fluminense University (Approval protocol CEP-HUAM/CCM 21/03). Written&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from all subjects. Systemically healthy patients with moderate&#xD;
      to advanced chronic periodontitis referred to the Department of Periodontology, Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry, Federal Fluminense University for periodontal treatment of advanced periodontitis&#xD;
      were recruited for and treated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria of the study were: (a) adult subjects with chronic periodontitis&#xD;
      presenting (b) radiographic evidence alveolar bone loss at the proximal aspect of the tooth,&#xD;
      (c) intrabony defect deeper than 4mm, (d) probing pocket depth &gt;6 mm at the site, (e)&#xD;
      unremarkable general health according to medical history and clinical judgment, (f) no&#xD;
      medications taken for at least six months and no antibiotics taken for twelve months before&#xD;
      the beginning of the study. Subjects who have quit the habit of smoking for at least one year&#xD;
      before the beginning of the study were considered as non-smokers and, if the other included&#xD;
      criteria were met, were included in the present sample. Exclusion criteria for the study&#xD;
      were: (a) subjects with &quot;early onset&quot; or aggressive forms of periodontitis, (b) current&#xD;
      smokers, (c) presence of significant systemic diseases (i.e., cancer, AIDS, diabetes), (d)&#xD;
      clinical evidence of furcation defects, (e) presence of apical radioleucency and (f) previous&#xD;
      lack of cooperation with the maintenance program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two defects were selected from each patient, and were randomly assigned, immediately before&#xD;
      each surgical appointment, by computer generated random sequence allocation to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment modalities employed: (a) Control: open instrumentation of the root surfaces and&#xD;
      bone defects via flap modified papilla preservation flap; (b) Test: open instrumentation of&#xD;
      the root surfaces and bone defects via flap modified papilla preservation flap and&#xD;
      application of a rhFGF-2/HA in the intrabony defect. Treatment allocation was registered in&#xD;
      an allocation table sheet that was unavailable to the clinical examiner throughout the study.&#xD;
      Both the control and test sites were treated at the same surgical appointment and no&#xD;
      information on treatment allocation was provided to the patient. All surgical procedures were&#xD;
      performed by a single operator, which became aware of the site allocation only after&#xD;
      completed root planning and conditioning, and immediately before the application of the&#xD;
      growth factor in the test sites. A strict surgical protocol emphasizing careful hard- and&#xD;
      soft-tissue management, root debridement, wound stability and infection control was employed&#xD;
      (Santana et al 2009; Miranda et al 2013). Nonsurgical infection control was performed in the&#xD;
      context of cause- related periodontal therapy and consisted of oral hygiene instructions,&#xD;
      scaling and root planing, tooth polishing and plaque control measures performed six months&#xD;
      prior to regenerative surgery. Patients were re-evaluated three and six months after the&#xD;
      completion of the non-surgical cause-related periodontal therapy and enrolled following the&#xD;
      later evaluation appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Recordings Clinical parameters were assessed using the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ)&#xD;
      or, when applicable, another defined landmark, as a fixed reference point. All measurements&#xD;
      were recorded using an UNC #15 periodontal probe (PCP-UNC 15, Hu-Friedy, Chicago, IL, USA) by&#xD;
      a blinded, trained and calibrated examiner (CMMS), unaware of the treatment provided at&#xD;
      baseline and one year after treatment. Measurements were recorded to the nearest mm. Full&#xD;
      mouth plaque score (FMPS) was recorded dichotomously as the percentage of total surfaces&#xD;
      (four sites per tooth) (O'Leary et al. 1972). BOP was also assessed dichotomously at the same&#xD;
      sites, and a full mouth bleeding score was calculated. Recession (REC) was measured as the&#xD;
      distance from the CEJ to the gingival margin (GM). Probing depth (PD) was measured as the&#xD;
      distance from the GM to the bottom of the gingival sulcus. PD and REC were used to calculate&#xD;
      the vertical clinical attachment level (PAL). Under local anesthesia, transgingival probing&#xD;
      was performed and the distance between the CEJ and the bottom of the defect (distance CEJ-BD)&#xD;
      was also recorded. Clinical measurements obtained at baseline (immediately before surgery)&#xD;
      and at twelve months are reported. After debridement of the surgical site, the bottom of the&#xD;
      defect (BD) was defined as the distance between cemento-enamel junction and base of the&#xD;
      defect. Bone crest level (BC) was measured as the distance between the cementoenamel junction&#xD;
      and crest of the defect and the intra-bony defect depth (INTRA) was measured as the&#xD;
      subtraction of BC from BD measurements (BD-BC). Moreover, the depth of the three, two and&#xD;
      one-wall sub-components of the bony defect were also measured. The primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcome variables of the present study were, respectively, change in PAL and bone gain&#xD;
      (change in distance CEJ-BD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to ensure the reproducibility and consistency of pre- and post-intervention&#xD;
      measurements, examiner calibration was performed before the beginning of the study. Fourteen&#xD;
      sites, in seven patients, with probing depths &gt;6 mm were evaluated by the examiner on two&#xD;
      separate occasions, 48h apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flap Design Intracrevicular incisions were made and buccal and lingual mucoperiosteal flaps,&#xD;
      including at least one tooth mesial and another distal the tooth being treated, were elevated&#xD;
      by blunt dissection. Extreme care was taken to preserve the marginal gingiva and inter-dental&#xD;
      tissue to achieve better closure of the treated sites. Thus, the defect-associated&#xD;
      inter-dental papilla was accessed with papilla preservation ï¬‚ap techniques (Takey 1985,&#xD;
      Cortellini et al. 1995, Cortellini et al. 1999) according to indications. A vertical&#xD;
      releasing incision was performed at the mesial aspect of the flap whenever necessary to&#xD;
      obtain optimized, tensionless, access to the surgical area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root and bone defect debridement The bone defect was meticulously debrided with surgical&#xD;
      curettes and ultrasonic instruments with special effort to remove all the inflammatory&#xD;
      granulation tissue, but with no intention to perforate the cortical bone walls. Thorough root&#xD;
      planing was performed with hand (Hu-Friedy, IL, USA), rotary (Intensiv, Grancia, Switzerland)&#xD;
      and ultrasonic instruments (Cavitron, Dentisply, USA), to remove subgingival plaque and&#xD;
      calculus until all root surfaces attained a hard glassy surface. During the instrumentation,&#xD;
      the ï¬‚aps were slightly elevated, carefully protected with periosteal elevators, and&#xD;
      frequently irrigated with saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Root conditioning and rhFGF-2 application After instrumentation, the root surfaces were&#xD;
      washed with saline solution to remove any remaining detached fragments from the defect and&#xD;
      surgical field. Then, a freshly prepared tetracycline hydrochloride paste in saline was&#xD;
      applied with gentle circular movements on the instrumented and dried root surfaces of both&#xD;
      test and control groups for three minutes. After that, the defect area was carefully rinsed&#xD;
      with saline. Finally, on the experimental sites, 0.2ml of a gel containing 4mg/ml rhFGF-2 in&#xD;
      sodium hyaluronate MW 1.3 x 106 was applied on the dried root surfaces and bone defect. The&#xD;
      flaps were then repositioned and tension-free primary flap closure was obtained using&#xD;
      internal mattress, and single interrupted sutures (5.0 Ethicon Sutures, Johnson &amp; Johnson,&#xD;
      NJ, USA or Gore-tex Sutures, W.L Gore, AZ, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Operative Treatment The patients were prescribed systemic antibiotic therapy consisting&#xD;
      of 200mg of doxycycline***** the day before surgery, followed by 100 mg daily continued until&#xD;
      the 20th day after surgery. No surgical dressing was used. The patients were instructed to&#xD;
      continue their regular home hygiene care, except in the operated area, which was cleaned by&#xD;
      means of gentle topical applications of 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (PerioxidinÂ®, Lacer,&#xD;
      Barcelona, Spain) in saturated cotton swabs. Patients were instructed not to brush or ï¬‚oss&#xD;
      the surgical area for 4 weeks, when mechanical plaque control was re-instituted. The sutures&#xD;
      were removed two weeks after surgery. Hyper-mobile teeth were splinted either before or&#xD;
      immediately after the surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Schedule Patients were enrolled in a stringent post-operative supportive care&#xD;
      programme following surgery (Santana et al 2009). All patients were seen weekly during the&#xD;
      first three months and bi-weekly for the next three months. Thereafter, the patients were&#xD;
      seen once monthly for the last six-month period of the study. After 1 year, the patients were&#xD;
      recalled and re-instructed on proper oral hygiene. Sites were rescaled when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic assessments Radiographs were taken with a parallel, standardized, technique at&#xD;
      baseline (Eickholz et al. 2004). Radiographs were digitized and analysed using NIH Image&#xD;
      Analysis software. The anatomical landmarks for the study included cementum-enamel junction&#xD;
      (CEJ), alveolar crest (AC) and base of the defect (BD) (Schei et al. 1959). Radiographic&#xD;
      defect depth was measured along the root surface, parallel to the root axis, as the distance&#xD;
      between CEJ and BD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses Quantitative data were recorded as mean and standard deviations. No data&#xD;
      points were missing. Sample size was determined by Power analysis, assuming a standard&#xD;
      deviation of the difference of 0.5, which indicated that with a sample of 20 subjects, the&#xD;
      study would have &gt;90% power to detect a 1-mm difference in the primary outcome measures PAL&#xD;
      gain and CEJ-BD reduction between the two groups. In order to verify the normality of the&#xD;
      data, the kurtosis and skewness curves were used. Because all data were considered to be&#xD;
      normal for the parameters analysed, Student's paired t-test was used for intra-group&#xD;
      (baseline versus 12 months) and inter-group (test versus control) comparisons. The level of&#xD;
      significance set at 5% was used in all statistical comparisons performed in the software&#xD;
      ProStat (Poly Software International, Pearl River, NY, USA) .&#xD;
