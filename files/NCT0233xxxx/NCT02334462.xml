      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Malaria is a severe infection caused by a parasite. People can get malaria if a mosquito&#xD;
      that carries the parasite bites them. Malaria infection does not happen in the United States,&#xD;
      but many people in Africa, Asia, and South America are at risk for it. Researchers want to&#xD;
      test two vaccines that may help decrease malaria infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if two vaccines (Pfs25M-EPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs230DIM-EPA/Alhydrogel ) are safe in&#xD;
      humans and cause an immune response that will prevent malaria parasites from correctly&#xD;
      growing in the mosquito.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy adults ages 18 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There are several groups in this study. Each group will receive a different dose of the&#xD;
           vaccine and some groups will received both vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccinations will be given on two days about 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive each vaccine as an injection into the arm. Blood will be drawn&#xD;
           on the day of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In the 4 weeks after receiving a vaccination, participants will have at least 3 clinic&#xD;
           visits and 1 phone contact. They will have at least 3 more visits and 3 phone contacts&#xD;
           over the next 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At each visit, participants will be evaluated for side effects to the vaccine and any&#xD;
           new health changes or problems. They will be asked how they are feeling and if they have&#xD;
           taken any medicine. Blood and urine samples may be taken at the visit. More follow-up&#xD;
           visits may be needed to follow up on changes or problems.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission would be a valuable tool for local elimination or&#xD;
&#xD;
      eradication of this disease. Pfs25 and Pfs230, surface antigens of zygotes and ookinetes in&#xD;
      the mosquito stage of Plasmodium falciparum, are the lead candidates for a malaria&#xD;
      transmission blocking vaccine. Recombinant Pfs25M and recombinant Pfs230D1M have each been&#xD;
      conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA) and adjuvanted with Alhydrogel . This&#xD;
      dose-escalating phase 1 study will determine safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines in&#xD;
      US adults and subsequently in Malian adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 260 subjects will be enrolled at sites in the US and Mali to receive escalating&#xD;
      doses of Pfs25M- EPA/Alhydrogel , Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel , or simultaneous&#xD;
      Pfs25MEPA/Alhydrogel and Pfs230D1M-EPA/Alhydrogel . Enrollment within each group will be&#xD;
      staggered for additional safety, and subjects will only be enrolled into the simultaneous&#xD;
      administration group once each individual dose has been administered and reviewed for safety.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for at least 6 months after the last vaccination. Safety outcomes&#xD;
      will be local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
      Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by ELISA against recombinant&#xD;
      Pfs25, Pfs230, and EPA, and B cell responses. Functional activity of the induced antibodies&#xD;
      will be assessed by membrane feeding assays conducted at the National Institute of Allergy&#xD;
      and Infectious Diseases in the US.&#xD;
