      The purpose of the study is to investigate the extent of ischemia and left ventricular&#xD;
      function in cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), as well as patency of coronary arteries&#xD;
      and grafts in coronary computed tomography angiography at 12 months follow up in patients&#xD;
      with advanced coronary artery disease treated with percutaneous coronary intervention with&#xD;
      the implantation of bioresorbable scaffolds or coronary artery bypass graft surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the clinical results of the two methods of revascularization will be carried&#xD;
      out annually up to 5 years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death among adult population in&#xD;
      developed countries. Optimal method of revascularization of patients with multivessel CAD is&#xD;
      still the matter of debate. Currently, there are two recognized methods: percutaneous&#xD;
      coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Both methods were&#xD;
      compared in a number of studies, including several randomized trials. Most trials have left&#xD;
      some doubts. First of all, none of them used functional evaluation of the stenosis. The&#xD;
      decision regarding revascularization was based on angiographic results alone. The trials that&#xD;
      have used fractional flow reserve (FFR) show no clear correlation between the degree of&#xD;
      stenosis assessed angiographically, in the range of 50-90%, and its functional significance.&#xD;
      In a randomized FAME trial, out of 1329 significant stenosis assessed anatomically, nearly&#xD;
      40% revealed no functional significance. The study showed that coronary revascularization&#xD;
      guided by FFR in multivessel stable CAD resulted in a smaller number of vessels stented, and&#xD;
      hence fewer stent implantations. Such a strategy has improved patient clinical outcomes. In&#xD;
      the group of patients undergoing revascularization based on fractional flow reserve&#xD;
      significant reduction in major adverse cardiac events (MACE) was observed in 1- and 2-year&#xD;
      follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another weakness of former studies was the use of first-generation drug eluting stent (DES)&#xD;
      showing an increased risk of restenosis and late and very late stent thrombosis. Many&#xD;
      randomized studies documented superiority of new generation DES, with more biocompatible or&#xD;
      bioresorbable polymer in terms of the incidence of MACE (SPIRIT, LEADERS). Recently, fully&#xD;
      bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) have been introduced into routine clinical practice.&#xD;
      Preliminary results of the ABSORB EXTEND trial demonstrated similar efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      the Absorb BVS, as compared with the best-in-class its metallic counterpart XIENCE. Since the&#xD;
      complete resorption of the scaffold requires two-three years, the greatest clinical benefit&#xD;
      will be observed a couple of years after implantation. Total bioresorption of the scaffold&#xD;
      not only allows to restore the physiological function of the vessel, but also eliminates a&#xD;
      number of adverse events associated with the presence of permanent metallic prosthesis in the&#xD;
      vessel wall, such as very late stent thrombosis and the neo-atherosclerosis development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular imaging with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) is widely considered the gold standard for scaffold optimal implantation, although&#xD;
      currently it is not routinely used. The use of intravascular imaging techniques before and&#xD;
      after BVS implantation may help to avoid inadequate expansion and apposition of the scaffold&#xD;
      struts. Subintimal calcifications detected with IVUS or OCT require adequate lesion&#xD;
      preparation before stent deployment. This is particularly crucial for patients receiving BVS,&#xD;
      where the goal of lesion preparation is to facilitate scaffold delivery, reduce plaque shift&#xD;
      and to allow optimal scaffold expansion. OCT with its greater resolution enables to assess&#xD;
      the scaffold integrity, apposition and the presence of thrombus or edge dissections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the ABSORB EXTEND trial there are some suggestions for longer dual antiplatelet&#xD;
      therapy duration and more potent agents than clopidogrel (i.e. ticagrelor) regardless of&#xD;
      clinical presentation, particularly in the first months after BVS implantation. Ticagrelor in&#xD;
      the PLATO trial has been shown to reduce the rate of a combined endpoint of cardio-vascular&#xD;
      death, myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to clopidogrel. In patients treated with&#xD;
      PCI, it also reduces the rate of stent thrombosis. Statins are the most widely used&#xD;
      LDL-lowering drugs in high-risk patients. It is recommended to achieve a greater than 50%&#xD;
      reduction in LDL levels. Treatment goal for fasting LDL-cholesterol is &lt; 70 mg/dl (1.8&#xD;
      mmol/l). In comparison with other lipid-lowering agents, rosuvastatin is the most potent&#xD;
      agent to achieve the required reduction of LDL. Rosuvastatin in maximal tolerated dose is&#xD;
      indicated to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and revascularization procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEASE-BVS study is the first trial that takes into account all of the following important&#xD;
      aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stable advanced coronary artery disease: 3-vessel disease or significant left main (LM)&#xD;
           stenosis, suitable for either PCI or CABG with proven ischemia in stress CMR;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  coronary revascularization (PCI) guided by functional assessment of stenosis (iFR/FFR);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the use of a bioresorbable everolimus-eluting scaffolds (Absorb) and PCI optimization&#xD;
           with intracoronary imaging techniques (OCT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  long-term post-procedural management with potent antiplatelet drug (ticagrelor) and&#xD;
           optimal lipid-lowering therapy with maximal tolerated dose of rosuvastatin.&#xD;
