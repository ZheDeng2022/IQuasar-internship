    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and immune response to two doses of a&#xD;
      dengue vaccine (TV003) given 6 months apart to healthy adults, adolescents, and children in&#xD;
      Thailand.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dengue infection is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics. The&#xD;
      infection is caused by any one of four types of the dengue virus. This study will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of and immunogenicity to a vaccine (called TV003) against all four types of the&#xD;
      dengue virus in healthy adults, adolescents, and children aged 12 months to 50 years in&#xD;
      Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled sequentially in four age groups (adults, adolescents, children,&#xD;
      and young children), and researchers will evaluate safety data before enrolling each&#xD;
      subsequent cohort. Each participant will be in the study for approximately 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry (Day 0), participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the TV003&#xD;
      vaccine or a placebo vaccine for TV003. All participants will receive two doses of TV003 or&#xD;
      placebo-the first dose at study entry (Day 0) and the second dose 6 months later on Day 180.&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur on Days 6, 9, 12, 15, 28, 56, 72, 186, 189, 192, 195, 208,&#xD;
      236, 252, and 360.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will include a medical history review and a physical exam. Select study&#xD;
      visits will also include blood collection and a urine pregnancy test for participants of&#xD;
      childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the vaccination study visits, participants will remain in the clinic for approximately 30&#xD;
      minutes after each vaccination for observation and monitoring. For 20 days after each&#xD;
      vaccination, participants will take their temperatures and record any symptoms. Throughout&#xD;
      the entire study period, study researchers will monitor participants for suspected dengue&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
