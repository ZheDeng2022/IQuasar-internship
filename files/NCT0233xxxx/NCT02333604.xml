      The Cancer Experience RegistryÂ®: An Online Initiative to Understand the Experiences of Those&#xD;
      Impacted By a Cancer Diagnosis.The Registry is a web-based platform to distribute&#xD;
      cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys. Study surveys are designed based on input from&#xD;
      advisor experts, including patients and caregivers, and focus on the social, emotional,&#xD;
      physical, financial and decision-making experiences of those who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      cancer and their caregivers. Findings contribute toward enhancing care for patients,&#xD;
      survivors and caregivers via programming and policy initiatives.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aims of the Registry are to: 1) better understand the psychosocial experiences and needs&#xD;
      of people who have been impacted by cancer, including patients, survivors and caregivers; 2)&#xD;
      inform the research community, healthcare providers, patient advocates and policy makers&#xD;
      around gaps in care and the psychosocial challenges of people affected by cancer; 3) use the&#xD;
      findings to develop and disseminate tailored (data-guided) programs and services that will&#xD;
      address the emotional and social needs and ultimately improve the long-term quality of life&#xD;
      of people affected by cancer; 4) link registrants to cancer related resources and programs&#xD;
      via an online, modifiable platform; and 5) provide collaborating sites (e.g.,&#xD;
      hospitals/health networks/CSC affiliates) with aggregated reports on quality and needs of&#xD;
      members or customers to enhance or improve quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the Registry are disseminated online at&#xD;
      www.CancerSupportCommunity.org/RegistryIndexReport2017&#xD;
