  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Operative vaginal delivery (with forceps or vacuums) is frequently performed secondary to&#xD;
      maternal exhaustion, which leads to an inability to push effectively; 40% of operative&#xD;
      vaginal deliveries at Prentice are for maternal exhaustion. The risk of severe birth trauma&#xD;
      is increased three to four fold with operative delivery. This randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      will compare rates of operative vaginal delivery and severe birth trauma in two groups of&#xD;
      women: (1) an intervention group who will participate in the antepartum Total Control®&#xD;
      fitness and education program modified for pregnancy; and (2) a control group. Women will be&#xD;
      recruited and followed from the second trimester until 6 weeks postpartum; all will complete&#xD;
      validated questionnaires regarding their (1) level of worry and knowledge about their&#xD;
      birthing experience (2) pelvic floor symptoms and quality of life (3) sexual function (4)&#xD;
      satisfaction with their birthing experience and (5) level of depressive symptoms at various&#xD;
      time points during and after their pregnancy. Obstetrical data will also be collected.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized controlled trial of primiparous women with singleton pregnancies&#xD;
      who plan on delivering at Prentice Women's Hospital. Women will be recruited during their&#xD;
      first trimester by their obstetrician as well as through standardized Northwestern Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital flyers and ads. Demographic and delivery information will be obtained from the&#xD;
      Northwestern Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW), as well as by the attending midwife or&#xD;
      physician at the time of delivery using a standardized Delivery Information Form. Women will&#xD;
      also be asked about their other physical activities (including other forms of daily/weekly&#xD;
      exercise) as well as whether or not they are participating in other birthing classes at the&#xD;
      time of their first Total Control class (intervention group) or 2nd trimester visit with&#xD;
      their providers (controls). All women will wear pedometers to track daily general activity.&#xD;

    <description>Women will be enrolled in Total Control, which is a fitness and education program. Specifically, Total Control is a comprehensive pelvic fitness and wellness program designed by board-certified female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) practitioners as well as physical therapists that combines pelvic floor and core muscle strengthening. Subjects will participate in 1 standardized class per week during their second trimester for a total of 6 weeks. Women will also participate in a weekly educational session which will include keynote speakers who are experts in various aspects of the labor and delivery process. Women in this group will complete questionnaires and consent to use of their delivery outcomes. Women will also wear pedometers to track daily general activity.</description>
