    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if drinking extra water helps people lose or&#xD;
      maintain weight loss and reduce hunger and, if so, what volume of water is most effective and&#xD;
      when is it best to drink it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem. Observational data suggest that drinking water is&#xD;
      associated with a healthier weight. Indeed advice to drink extra water to help with weight&#xD;
      control is widespread (eight 8oz glasses or 2L of water a day is a common recommendation).&#xD;
      The public spends billions of dollars on bottled water in the belief that it works and people&#xD;
      are increasingly carrying water with them throughout the day. However, a systematic review of&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials looking at the effectiveness of drinking extra water to help&#xD;
      reduce weight or weight gain or produce changes in surrogate markers such as appetite or&#xD;
      caloric intake undertaken by our group showed that currently there is an absence of reliable&#xD;
      evidence to support the recommendation to drink water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to establish whether drinking extra water is indeed helpful for weight&#xD;
      control and, if so, what is the optimal quantity to recommend, as this could have an&#xD;
      important impact of public health and public health policies if it is indeed effective. Tap&#xD;
      water is so readily available in this country that even if the improvement in weight&#xD;
      maintenance or reduction is small, this will be a cost-effective intervention. If it is not&#xD;
      effective, then it is important that people know this so that they can make an informed&#xD;
      choice about buying bottles of water for their health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical question the study will address is does drinking extra water prevent or&#xD;
      reduce weight gain?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary clinical questions it will ask are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does drinking water reduce hunger or increase satiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does drinking water increase participants' sense of well-being&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the effect of the different volumes of water on nocturnal urination patterns?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once participants decide to take part in this trial, they will be asked to drink a specific&#xD;
      amount of water at particular times of the day for 6 months. A computer will decide by chance&#xD;
      the amount of water they will be asked to drink each day of the trial and the times at which&#xD;
      to drink this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different amounts and different times that people will be asked to drink water,&#xD;
      this is so that investigators can find out if there is an optimal volume of water to drink,&#xD;
      and a best time to drink water to reduce headaches or hunger. The least amount of water the&#xD;
      computer could ask participants to drink is half a glass (that is 4oz or 120ml). The largest&#xD;
      volume of water the computer could ask a participant to drink would be eight glasses of water&#xD;
      a day (a total of 64oz or 2L) spread across the day (that is not all at once). Once the&#xD;
      computer has assigned participants to a particular volume and times to drink water, these&#xD;
      will remain the same for every day throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be asked to provide some brief information about themselves at the beginning&#xD;
      of the study (for example, age, sex, height and whether they exercise, smoke or not). During&#xD;
      the study they will be asked to weigh themselves and record this, their dietary habits and&#xD;
      the amount they drink will be stored on a private and confidential page on the study website.&#xD;
      They will be asked to fill in [2] confidential short surveys about how they feel and their&#xD;
      views, one at the start and one at the end of the study&#xD;
