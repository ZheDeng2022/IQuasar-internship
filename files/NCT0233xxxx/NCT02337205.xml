    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study to access the safety and tolerability of KX2-391 ointment in subjects&#xD;
      who have Actinic Keratosis. This study will also access the amount of KX2-391 drug that&#xD;
      enters the blood stream through dermal application of the ointment.&#xD;
