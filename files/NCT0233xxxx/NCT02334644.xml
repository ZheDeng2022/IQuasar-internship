      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of 12-weeks of probiotic treatment in adults with&#xD;
      primary Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder and whether this treatment will alter the microbiota&#xD;
      composition in these patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a prospective, randomized, double blind placebo-controlled trial. The study&#xD;
      population will include males and females, ages 18-65, who fulfill criteria for primary DSM-5&#xD;
      OCD as determined by a structured interview. At screening, patients must have a YBOCS score&#xD;
      ≥20 and a MADRS score ≤18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If deemed eligible, patients will provide a stool sample for microbiome profiling and a blood&#xD;
      sample for the inflammatory marker analysis. They will return for their first visit where&#xD;
      clinician and self-rated symptom severity scales will be completed and patients will begin&#xD;
      their randomly assigned treatment condition. Contents of two sachets (probiotic or placebo)&#xD;
      will be consumed daily with or just after breakfast.The participants will attend 3 additional&#xD;
      study visits, once every 4 weeks and one phone visit at week 6. During these visits, the same&#xD;
      clinician and self-reported questionnaires will be completed. At week 6, patients will be&#xD;
      contacted by phone to complete the YBOCS and will also provide a midpoint stool sample. At&#xD;
      the final visit (week 12) patients will provide a third stool sample for microbiome profiling&#xD;
      and a blood sample for inflammatory marker analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI)&#xD;
      to determine whether criteria for a primary OCD diagnosis is met alongside any additional&#xD;
      comorbid disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete a number of clinician and self-rated symptom severity scales as&#xD;
      listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) - Clinician-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) - Clinician-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R) - Self-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) - Self-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Dutch Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DDOCS) - Self-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) - Self- rated&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Quality of Life and Enjoyment Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF),&#xD;
           Self-rated&#xD;
&#xD;
           They will also complete additional questionnaires pertaining to their diet and bowel&#xD;
           functioning:&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Short-form Leeds Dyspepsia Questionnaire (SF-LDQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Rome III criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Assessment of diet using the EPIC-Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be asked to provide background information regarding travel in the past 4&#xD;
      months and current place (and duration) of residence as these factors may potentially affect&#xD;
      the microbiome profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be weighed and their height measured to determine body mass index (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those who meet study criteria will be provided with a collection kit and instructed on&#xD;
      appropriate fecal sample collection. Participants will also be given a lab requisition and&#xD;
      instructed to have blood drawn at a local lab. This blood sample will examine serum levels of&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, IFNγ, TNF- α and CRP. Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)&#xD;
      will be used for a kynurenine/tryptophan analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fecal Sample Collection Patients and healthy controls will collect fecal samples at home&#xD;
      using our well-established protocol. During the recruitment visit, the subjects will be&#xD;
      provided a kit containing a single 50-ml sterile vial with an air-tight sachet, and a cooling&#xD;
      pad. The stool sample will be brought to the MacAnxiety Research Centre, where it will be&#xD;
      stored in -80ºC freezer until the samples are analyzed. All participants will be asked to&#xD;
      freeze their samples and deliver them to the MacAnxiety Research Centre 2 weeks following&#xD;
      sampling, or earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visits will be organized as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline Visit (visit 1): once blood and stool samples have been collected the patients&#xD;
           will be randomized to probiotic or placebo treatment. At this visit patients will begin&#xD;
           their randomly assigned treatment condition to probiotic (Lactobacillus helveticus R0052&#xD;
           and Biﬁdobacterium longum R0175) or placebo. The patients will be provided with 60&#xD;
           sachets (probiotic or placebo) and instructed to consume 2 daily sachets with or just&#xD;
           after breakfast. At each of the following visit they will be provided with additional 60&#xD;
           sachets.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this visit the clinician will also complete the following scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) - Clinician-rated ii. Clinical&#xD;
           Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) - Clinician-rated iii. Y-BOCS iv. MADRS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will complete the following scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dutch Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DDOCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Q-LES-Q - short form&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the 12 week period of probiotic treatment, subjects will attend 3 additional&#xD;
           visits, once every 4 weeks. During each visit (visits 2-4) participants will be assessed&#xD;
           by the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In each visit the clinician will also complete the following scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I) - Clinician-rated ii. Clinical&#xD;
           Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S) - Clinician-rated iii. Y-BOCS iv. MADRS&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will complete the following scales:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory - Revised (OCI-R)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dutch Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DDOCS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Q-LES-Q - short form&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At week 6, patients will provide a midpoint stool sample as per the sample collection&#xD;
           protocol outlined above. A member from the research team will also contact the patient&#xD;
           via telephone to complete the YBOCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Visit 4 (week 12): Participants will undergo usual assessment, treatment response will&#xD;
           also be determined at this visit (CGI-I score ≤ 2 as well as a 30% drop in YBOCS score).&#xD;
           Participants will also complete the Quality of Life and Enjoyment Satisfaction&#xD;
           Questionnaire. Patient diet will be assessed using the EPIC-Norfolk Food Frequency&#xD;
           Questionnaire. At visit 3, participants will be provided with a collection kit and&#xD;
           instructed on appropriate fecal sample collection (as outlined above). The sample should&#xD;
           be collected on the prior day to visit 4. Blood samples will be drawn again be drawn at&#xD;
           a local lab to examine levels of IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, IFNγ, TNF- α and CRP. Liquid&#xD;
           Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) will again be used for a kynurenine/tryptophan&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
