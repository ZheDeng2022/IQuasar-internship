  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) in pediatric participants who have any of&#xD;
      the following types of cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advanced melanoma (6 months to &lt;18 years of age),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advanced, relapsed or refractory programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive malignant&#xD;
           solid tumor or other lymphoma (6 months to &lt;18 years of age),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (rrcHL) (3 years to &lt;18 years of age),&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advanced relapsed or refractory microsatellite-instability-high (MSI-H) solid tumors (6&#xD;
           months to &lt;18 years of age), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  advanced relapsed or refractory tumor-mutational burden-high ≥10 mutation/Mb (TMB-H)&#xD;
           solid tumors (6 months to &lt;18 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose (MAD), confirm&#xD;
      the dose, and find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for pembrolizumab therapy. Part 2 will&#xD;
      further evaluate the safety and efficacy at the pediatric RP2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis of this study is that intravenous (IV) administration of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      to children with either advanced melanoma; a PD-L1 positive advanced, relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumor or other lymphoma; advanced, relapsed or refractory MSI-H solid tumor; or rrcHL,&#xD;
      will result in an Objective Response Rate (ORR) greater than 10% for at least one of these&#xD;
      types of cancer. The 10% assessment does not apply to the MSI-H and TMB-H cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With Amendment 8, enrollment of participants with solid tumors and of participants aged 6&#xD;
      months to &lt;12 years with melanoma were closed. Enrollment of participants aged ≥12 years to&#xD;
      ≤18 years with melanoma continues. Enrollment of participants with MSI-H and TMB-H solid&#xD;
      tumors also continues.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR is assessed by RECIST 1.1 per site assessment. The ORR is defined as the percentage of participants who have a response (complete response, CR or partial response, PR) prior to disease progression. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

    <description>Disease Control Rate is defined as the percentage of participants with a response of CR, PR, or SD. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters. Stable Disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study. Progressive Disease is least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
