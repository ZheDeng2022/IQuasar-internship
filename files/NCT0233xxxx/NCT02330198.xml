      The purpose of this study is to validate the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure in Finnish.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to translate and adapt The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure tool&#xD;
      (FAAM) in Finnish language and to evaluate the validity and reliability of the Finnish&#xD;
      version of the Foot and ankle ability measure tool (FAAM-Fi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is prospective. It is done by interviewing the patients to gather self-reported&#xD;
      information of about their ability to perform different activities of daily living and&#xD;
      sports. The study has no consequence to the patients, nor to the treatment aimed to solve the&#xD;
      problem. This study includes cross-cultural adaptation of the FAAM to Finnish language and&#xD;
      validation of the Finnish version of the FAAM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The forward translation will be done with the method of used by the American Association of&#xD;
      Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) Outcomes Committee. Two native Finnish-speakers and fluent in&#xD;
      English translators, T1 and T2, translate the original version of the FAAM to Finnish&#xD;
      language. T1 is aware of the items being examined in in the questionnaire being translated,&#xD;
      but not a healthcare professional. T2 is so called naïve translator. A synthesis of T1 and T2&#xD;
      versions, T-12, is conducted under the supervision of a medical linguistic methodologist. The&#xD;
      T-12 version is translated back to English by two native, English as their mother tongue&#xD;
      speaking translators BT1 and BT2, neither aware nor informed of the items explored nor with&#xD;
      medical background.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expert committee (the medical linguistic professional, the investigator as an orthopedic&#xD;
      specialist and the translators) consolidate all the versions and consider the pre-final&#xD;
      version of the questionnaire. The expert committee will be in close contact with developers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-final version is pre-tested with 40 persons with foot and ankle disorders. They will&#xD;
      complete the questionnaire and will be interviewed about the meaning of the questions and the&#xD;
      response in order to ensure that the adapted version is retaining its equivalence in an&#xD;
      applied situation. Possible missing responses are looked for. The last step is submitting the&#xD;
      final version, the FAAM-Fi and all the written reports to the committee keeping track of the&#xD;
      translated version and the developers of the final version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process for validating the FAAM-Fi includes testing it for reliability, validity and its&#xD;
      responsiveness. 80 patients receiving either conservative or operative treatment for foot and&#xD;
      ankle disorders are recruited from Turku University Hospital and Physiotherapy Consults,&#xD;
      Helsinki. 40 patients are treated operatively and 40 conservatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients who will receive operative treatment at the Turku University Hospital Foot and&#xD;
      ankle unit are asked to answer the questions of the Finnish version of the FAAM, the modified&#xD;
      AOFAS foot and ankle scale and the 15-D instrument by a paper or by an electrical version. At&#xD;
      the outpatient clinics of Turku University Hospital and Physiotherapy Consults Helsinki 40&#xD;
      foot and ankle patients who will get physiotherapy fill in these forms. 20 of these patients&#xD;
      are recruited from Turku University Hospital and 20 from Physiotherapy Consults Helsinki.&#xD;
      Those patients who will be treated operatively fill in the questionnaires at the preoperative&#xD;
      interview and in the morning of the surgery. The diagnoses are written down as well as the&#xD;
      procedures of the operated patients. The patients will re-fill the questionnaires again at&#xD;
      the post-operative control at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is an interview study there will be no randomizing or blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start in October 2014 and the required information should be gathered in six&#xD;
      months. Statistical analysis and first results should be ready in June 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source population is foot and ankle patients at the outpatient clinic of Artro process of the&#xD;
      Turku University Hospital and Physiotherapy Consults, Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects will be 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test-retest repeatability is evaluated statistically by the agreement of repeated tests.&#xD;
      Cronbach´s coefficient alpha is calculated to assess internal consistency. Content validity&#xD;
      is assessed by floor and ceiling effects. Criterion validity is tested by correlation to the&#xD;
      modified AOFAS foot and ankle scale and 15-D. Construct validity is assessed by creating five&#xD;
      hypotheses for convergent validity and one for discriminate. Responsiveness is assessed by&#xD;
      calculating the effect size and the standardized effect mean.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data for this study is collected from patient files and hospitals´ electronic patient&#xD;
      registry (Artux, BCB Medical Finland). All data is stored and secured in a specific&#xD;
      electronic study subject register. Paper data is stored in a locker in the principal&#xD;
      investigators office room at the Turku University Hospital. Patient data is accessible to&#xD;
      investigators only.&#xD;
