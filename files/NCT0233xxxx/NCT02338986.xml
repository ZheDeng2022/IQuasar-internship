      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - There are more emerging infectious diseases recently. Some could affect many people. Some&#xD;
      like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) are&#xD;
      caused by new germs. Sometimes known germs suddenly infect new and large areas, like Ebola.&#xD;
      Many of these diseases don t have good treatments available. Researchers may be able to&#xD;
      develop a treatment by using antibodies against these infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect antibodies from people with high levels of antibodies to the diseases being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Ages 18-70 years old who weigh at least 110 pounds. They may have been infected with or&#xD;
      vaccinated for one of the new infections researchers are studying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and blood tests. Researchers will&#xD;
           determine if the participant can have apheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have apheresis. First, they will be interviewed. Then, a needle will&#xD;
           be placed in a vein. Blood will be drawn, and a machine will separate the blood cells&#xD;
           from the antibodies and protein. The blood cells will then be returned to the&#xD;
           participant through another vein. It takes about 60 minutes for the actual collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to have the procedure at least 3 times. They can participate&#xD;
           in up to 20 sessions total as part of this study. There must be at least 7 days between&#xD;
           sessions.&#xD;

      The administration of convalescent plasma is often used for treatment of emerging infectious&#xD;
      diseases. This natural history protocol will collect plasma from subjects that were&#xD;
      vaccinated to or recovered from an emerging infectious disease of interest, in a manner that&#xD;
      the plasma can be given to other subjects as a therapeutic. Any administration of plasma to&#xD;
      subjects will be under a separate protocol.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Provide written informed consent before initiation of any study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age &gt;=8 years old, and &lt;=70 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. History of a known infection or vaccination towards emerging infectious diseases&#xD;
                  of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For convalescent subjects, the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 28 days since the subject was symptomatic from the infection&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Afebrile (subjective history acceptable) for at least 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Enrollment must occur within 24 months of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For vaccinated subjects, the following criteria must be met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects must be at least 14 days after vaccination&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If vaccinated on a blinded study, the study must be unblinded and the subject&#xD;
                  received active product.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Enrollment must occur within 24 months of the last vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  (The above represent the minimum criteria - more restrictive criteria may be&#xD;
                  listed under disease specific criteria noted in Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4) Weight &gt;=110 pounds (50 kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5) Adequate peripheral venous access for plasma donation (as judged by the&#xD;
                  examiner)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6) Willingness to have samples stored&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any sign of active infection (as judged by the investigator), including but not&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Cough&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

             criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects that have participated in previous plasma collection or other cell component&#xD;
             collection procedures within the last 3 months may have restrictions to participation&#xD;
             based on the site plasma collection standard operating procedure (SOP). In this&#xD;
             scenario, discussion should occur with the blood establishment to ensure eligibility&#xD;
             to donate plasma.&#xD;
