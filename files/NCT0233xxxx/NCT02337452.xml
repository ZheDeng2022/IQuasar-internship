      This trial develops a patient-driven self-navigated web-based family outreach program for&#xD;
      cancer prevention in high-risk families. Creating the family outreach program may help to&#xD;
      improve the way in which genetic test results are communicated within families and increase&#xD;
      the number of at-risk relatives who become aware of their risks.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To develop a secure, web-based program for family outreach in Clinical Cancer Genetics&#xD;
      (CCG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. The long-term goals of this program are expected to include, but are not limited to the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. To enable families with inherited cancer susceptibility and/or at increased familial&#xD;
      risk of cancer to provide personal and family history of neoplasia through a convenient and&#xD;
      self-directed program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. To enable communication of possible inherited cancer susceptibility with and among&#xD;
      family members through the web-based portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIc. To facilitate genetic testing, screening and prevention strategies in those at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IId. Establish high-risk cohort for optional participation in research and clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients communicate with at-risk family members to share genetic test results and other&#xD;
      relevant information, as well as to learn more about their disease via family outreach&#xD;
      program website. At risk family members are then contacted by a study coordinator or genetic&#xD;
      counselor for further follow-up. At-risk relatives receive resources to facilitate&#xD;
      understanding of their at-risk status and to facilitate predictive testing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who have been diagnosed with a hereditary cancer-causing mutation.&#xD;
             Individuals may be identified through clinical testing as patients at MD Anderson or&#xD;
             patients whose mutation was identified at an outside institution who contact the&#xD;
             registry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals that have clinical suspicion for syndromic cancer susceptibility, but in&#xD;
             whom mutational testing has been nondiagnostic (depending on condition in question,&#xD;
             nondiagnostic testing may be as little as 10%, as in familial adenomatous polyposis&#xD;
             [FAP], or as high as 70% in suspected hereditary diffuse gastric cancer or HDGC)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At-risk family members of individuals with a cancer causing mutation or of individuals&#xD;
             with nondiagnostic testing notwithstanding presence of likely syndromic cancer. Such&#xD;
             patients will in most cases not be MD Anderson patients. Note: The enrollment,&#xD;
             consenting, and evaluation process anticipates and addresses this.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Index patients who test negative for a cancer causing mutation, except for those&#xD;
             agreeing to provide family history (FH) that is informative for at-risk individuals&#xD;
             when no other source of such information is available&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unwilling or are unable to provide informed consent&#xD;
