      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical benefit and safety of two different&#xD;
      Dose-Intense temozolomide regimens（one-week on/one-week off regimen versus continuous&#xD;
      dose-intense regimen）in patients with glioblastoma at first relapse.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participants must have histopathologically-confirmed, supratentorial, glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participants must have received first-line treatment regimen consisting of RT plus&#xD;
             concomitant temozolomide followed by adjuvant temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants must be first recurrence or progression of glioblastoma after first-line&#xD;
             treatment regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants must have demonstration of recurrent disease on MRI following prior&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants must have bi-dimensionally measurable disease with a minimum measurement&#xD;
             of 1 cm in one dimension on MRI performed within 14 days prior to first treatment. If&#xD;
             receiving corticosteroids, participants must be on a stable or decreasing dose of&#xD;
             corticosteroids for at least 5 days prior to baseline MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants must have developed progressive disease after receiving prior therapy and&#xD;
             must have an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiation and&#xD;
             concomitant temozolomide therapy to study entry (unless progressive tumor growth is&#xD;
             outside the radiation field or there is histopathological confirmation of recurrent&#xD;
             tumor)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Age 18-75 years old.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Participants must be able to adhere to the dosing and visit schedules, and agree to&#xD;
             record medication times, concomitant medications, and adverse events (AEs) accurately&#xD;
             and consistently in a daily diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. 20 paraffinsections of glioblastoma tissue must be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes&#xD;

             accepted method of adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Treatment with any chemotherapy other than temozolomide prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Progressive or recurrent glioblastoma documented by MRI earlier than 12 weeks after&#xD;
             completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
