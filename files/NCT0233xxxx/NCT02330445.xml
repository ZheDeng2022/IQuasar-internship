    <textblock>
      Although the majority of RA patients achieve an amelioration of their RA with older disease&#xD;
      modifying agents such as methotrexate and leflunomide, all of these agents provoke adverse&#xD;
      events. The newer more active biological agents have a distinct safety profile that includes&#xD;
      an increased risk of serious infections. They have an annual treatment expense in the tens of&#xD;
      thousands of dollars a year. PRTX-100 may be able to modify the disease course of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis with an improved safety profile compared to available agents and a dosing regimen&#xD;
      comparable to the therapies currently available. This study is done to describe the adverse&#xD;
      event profile of 6 μg/kg of PRTX-100 administered IV for longer periods of treatment that&#xD;
      might be required for RA therapy. Secondary objectives include: evaluation of the clinical&#xD;
      response of subjects with previous administration of PRTX-100; evaluation of anti-PRTX&#xD;
      antibody presence and effect on activity; evaluation of &quot;Power Doppler&quot; ultrasound in the&#xD;
      assessment of joint inflammation; and evaluation of biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assay development is an intrinsic part of drug and biological development. The current assay&#xD;
      for anti-PRTX-100 antibodies depends on a very limited supply of serum available from&#xD;
      individuals in early trials. It will be necessary to obtain adequate antisera to provide&#xD;
      immunological reagents for this assay. It is not known whether the character of anti-PRTX-100&#xD;
      antibodies from volunteers is similar to those produced by patients with immunological&#xD;
      disorders on cytotoxic therapy. Antisera will be developed in normal volunteers. The&#xD;
      anti-PRTX-100 antibody assay will need to be standardized with a new anti-PRTX-100 antibody&#xD;
      source compared to the present human reagent.&#xD;

    <description>Up to 12 Part A recipients will have rheumatoid arthritis since this was an entry criterion for Study 104. All subjects will be allocated to the single treatment group at a fixed dose of 6 μg/kg of IV PRTX-100. Subjects will receive four weekly doses followed by 5 monthly doses of PRTX-100. Since subjects will be followed for 28 days after their last dose, the total duration of the study is approximately 8 months. Subjects will be evaluated for adverse events, rheumatoid arthritis activity and the development of anti-PRTX-100 antibodies. The feasibility of different assessment methods of disease activity may be explored. Novel methods of joint evaluation will be explored. Adverse events will be evaluated for at least four weeks after the last dose of PRTX-100.</description>
