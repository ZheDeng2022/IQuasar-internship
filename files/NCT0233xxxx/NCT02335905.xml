  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is looking at an antibiotic medicine, Ceftaroline Fosamil (Ceftaroline),&#xD;
      which fights infections like the one the subject has. Ceftaroline is effective against&#xD;
      S.aureus germs including those that are called Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      (MRSA.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ceftaroline has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in&#xD;
      adults and children with Community-Acquired Bacterial Pneumonia [a type of lung infection]&#xD;
      and Acute Bacterial Skin and Skin Structure Infections. Ceftaroline is not yet approved for&#xD;
      treatment in subjects with hematogenous osteomyelitis, therefore, the use of Ceftaroline in&#xD;
      this research study is considered &quot;investigational&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this research study is to find out what side effects there may be when children&#xD;
      are taking Ceftaroline and to study how effective Ceftaroline is in treating bone infections&#xD;
      due to Staphylococcus aureus in children. The investigators are also studying what the body&#xD;
      does to the study drug, Ceftaroline, and if the doses the investigators use result in blood&#xD;
      levels that the investigators think are going to be effective against bone infections in&#xD;
      children. This is called pharmacokinetics (PK).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, single-center study to determine safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Ceftaroline in pediatric subjects 1 to 17 years of age (inclusive) with signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      acute hematogenous osteomyelitis at the end of intravenous therapy. After informed&#xD;
      consent/assent is obtained, Ceftaroline will be administered intravenously. After the subject&#xD;
      has been afebrile for at least 48 hours, has negative blood cultures, is clearly improving in&#xD;
      general, is able to eat and drink, and is able to use or move the involved extremity, the&#xD;
      subject may be switched to oral antibiotic administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of subject participation from signing the informed consent form will be up to 14&#xD;
      months [(includes screening period (1 Day), study IV drug administration (approximately 2-14&#xD;
      Days), Standard of Care Oral Drug Administration (4-5 weeks) (the total maximum treatment&#xD;
      period is typically 6 weeks), and a follow-up visit 12 months after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug)]. Baseline assessments for study eligibility will occur within 24 hours before the&#xD;
      first dose of study drug. A minimum of 2 days (48 hours) of study drug administration is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the tests and procedures completed during this study may be part of regular care for&#xD;
      the subject's condition. Some tests and procedures will be done only for study purposes. Some&#xD;
      regular procedures may also be completed more often as part of the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Past and Current Medical History: A detailed review of the subject's medical history,&#xD;
           including demographics, concomitant medication review, medical/surgical history will be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vital Signs: Weight, height, blood pressure, pulse rate, and body temperature, will be&#xD;
           recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical Exam: Physical exam will include, evaluation of subject's overall health,&#xD;
           examination site of infection, and assessment of subject's ability to move affected&#xD;
           limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety Laboratory Assessments: Routine laboratory monitoring including liver function&#xD;
           tests will be done 24 hours prior to enrollment and weekly during Ceftaroline treatment,&#xD;
           and the completion of Ceftaroline treatment and at the follow-up visit. Isolate&#xD;
           susceptibility testing will be done at baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pregnancy testing: For females of child-bearing potential, urine pregnancy will be&#xD;
           performed prior to and after completing antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pharmacokinetics Assessment: One PK blood sample will be obtained from all subjects who&#xD;
           receive Ceftaroline fosamil.&#xD;
