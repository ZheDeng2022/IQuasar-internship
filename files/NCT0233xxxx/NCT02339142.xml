  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 50% of individuals with&#xD;
      autoimmune thyroid diseases resulting in enlargement of ocular muscles and may lead to&#xD;
      congestion of the eyelids and ocular surface, ocular movement restriction and double vision,&#xD;
      and optic nerve compression and loss of vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First line medical therapy is oral or intravenous corticosteroids (CS), which several studies&#xD;
      have shown results in reduction of soft tissue congestion, but some studies suggesting that&#xD;
      ocular restriction or visual loss may still occur in spite of CS therapy.i&#xD;
&#xD;
      External beam radiotherapy (XRT) is second line therapy but is controversial, with some&#xD;
      studies suggesting benefit in preventing onset of double vision or optic nerve compression&#xD;
      while other studies suggest it has no benefit. Most proponents of XRT for TED believe that it&#xD;
      is most effective early in the disease evolution. XRT has been shown to be a safe therapy&#xD;
      with few side-effects, although retinopathy changes have developed in a small percentage of&#xD;
      diabetics and its use is avoided for diabetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined oral prednisone and XRT has been shown to be more effective in reducing soft tissue&#xD;
      inflammation and motility complications than either monotherapy in two different studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there have been no trials comparing combined XRT and iv CS with iv CS alone for early&#xD;
      progressive TED to identify potential benefit in reducing the severity of motility disorders&#xD;
      or preventing the onset of dysthyroid optic neuropathy. That is the purpose of this study.&#xD;

      1. Purpose: To demonstrate that combined Radiotherapy (RT) and intravenous corticosteroid&#xD;
           (CS) is more effective than iv CS alone in preventing severe motility disruption&#xD;
           (including strabismus and primary diplopia) and new-onset dysthyroid optic neuropathy in&#xD;
           early progressive thyroid orbitopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis: Combined RT and iv CS are more effective than iv CS alone in preventing&#xD;
           motility problems (reduced field of single binocular vision, reduced ductions,&#xD;
           strabismus and worsening diplopia) and in preventing new-onset dysthyroid optic&#xD;
           neuropathy in patients with early progressive thyroid orbitopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Justification: Standard therapy for progressive TED is iv CS, occasionally supplemented&#xD;
           with RT if complications develop in spite of appropriate iv CS therapy. A single&#xD;
           retrospective study suggested that early combined treatment may prevent more serious&#xD;
           visual complications; this would be the first randomized controlled prospective trial to&#xD;
           see if this finding is true.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Objectives: Demonstrate a statistically significant reduced rate of new onset optic&#xD;
           neuropathy and double vision in patients with progressive TED with combined therapy&#xD;
           versus traditional monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Research Method: Multicentre, institutional based, randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 100 patients with early progressive TED randomized equally into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Therapy: iv MP 500 mg iv weekly for 6 weeks, then 250 mg iv weekly for 6 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           + XRT 100 Rads to each orbit x 10 doses&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control: Same iv MP dose + no XRT&#xD;
