  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves have been proven in animal and pilot clinical studies to induce&#xD;
      local growth of new blood vessels. Small single-center clinical trials with shockwave therapy&#xD;
      showed promising results in reducing angina symptoms, improving perfusion and contractility&#xD;
      in patients with refractory angina and stress-induced ischemia on imaging test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that shockwave therapy could improve angina symptoms and&#xD;
      exercise tolerance in broader population of patients with stable angina regardless of imaging&#xD;
      test results Study aims to demonstrate anti-anginal efficacy of Extracorporeal Shockwave&#xD;
      Myocardial Revascularization Therapy (ESMR), on top of stable optimal medical treatment in&#xD;
      patients with stable angina.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low intensity shockwaves (0.09 millijoule/mm2) are delivered to myocardial tissue. Shockwaves&#xD;
      are created by a special generator and are focused using a shockwave applicator device. The&#xD;
      treatment is guided by standard echocardiography equipment. The shockwaves are delivered in&#xD;
      synchronization with Patient R-wave (ECG) to avoid arrhythmias. The treatment is painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first, the patient undergoes modified Bruce treadmill test, to assess exercise induced&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise induced ECG ischemia is defined as the new development of horizontal or down -&#xD;
      sloping ST segment depression (≥1 mm at 60 ms after J point) versus baseline tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment consists of 9 sessions, with 3 sessions per week 1, 5 and 9. 100 shocks are&#xD;
      delivered per spot, 1200 shocks per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 1st treatment week ESMR will be delivered 3 times (every other day) to basal segments&#xD;
      (2 spots in each wall in apical 4-, 2-, 3- chamber positions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 2nd treatment week ESMR will be delivered 3 times (every other day) to middle segments&#xD;
      (2 spots in each wall in apical 4-, 2-, 3- chamber positions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 3rd treatment week ESMR will be delivered 3 times (every other day) to apical segments&#xD;
      (2 spots in each wall in apical 4-, 2-, 3- chamber positions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spots are localized by the ultra-sound device and the shockwaves are focused to this&#xD;
      area. Several treatments are required for optimal results.&#xD;
