      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of metformin hydrochloride when&#xD;
      given together with enzalutamide in treating patients with prostate cancer that has not&#xD;
      responded to previous treatment with hormones. Hormone therapy using enzalutamide may fight&#xD;
      prostate cancer by lowering the amount of androgens the body makes and blocking the use of&#xD;
      androgens by the tumor cells. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes, may also help kill&#xD;
      tumor cells. Giving enzalutamide together with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor&#xD;
      cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of enzalutamide when given in combination&#xD;
      with metformin (metformin hydrochloride) to patients with castration resistant prostate&#xD;
      cancer (CRPC), where fewer than 33% of patients experienced dose limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      attributable to the study regimen and to recommend a phase II dose for the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response in patients with CRPC with given&#xD;
      enzalutamide in combination with metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine PSA progression in patients with CRPC with given enzalutamide in combination&#xD;
      with metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To investigate the feasibility and safety of enzalutamide when given in combination with&#xD;
      metformin hydrochloride to patients with CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy for this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To collect computed tomography (CT)-guided biopsies of metastatic soft tissue or bone&#xD;
      tumor tissue for analysis of androgen receptor (AR) gene signature as an integrated biomarker&#xD;
      (University of California San Francisco [UCSF] to conduct analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To collect serum samples for the measurement of PSA levels and bone re-absorption&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of metformin hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) and metformin hydrochloride PO&#xD;
      twice daily (BID). Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4, 8, and 12 weeks.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer with a&#xD;
             Gleason score available or interpretable; patients must have prostate cancer deemed to&#xD;
             be castration-resistant by one or more of the following criteria (despite androgen&#xD;
             deprivation and anti-androgen withdrawal when applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of unidimensionally measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Progression of evaluable but not measurable disease assessed within 28 days prior&#xD;
                  to initial administration of drug for PSA evaluation and within 42 days for&#xD;
                  imaging studies (e.g, bone scans)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: rising PSA, defined as at least two consecutive rises in PSA to be&#xD;
                  documented over a reference value (measure 1); the first rising PSA (measure 2)&#xD;
                  should be taken at least 7 days after the reference value; a third confirmatory&#xD;
                  PSA measure (2nd beyond the reference level) should be greater than the second&#xD;
                  measure, and it must be obtained at least 7 days after the 2nd measure; if this&#xD;
                  is not the case, a fourth PSA is required to be taken and be greater than the&#xD;
                  second measure; measurable disease is not required&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have measurable disease must have had X-rays, scans or physical&#xD;
             examinations used for tumor measurement completed within 28 days prior to initial&#xD;

             that the lesion has progressed following radiation; patients must have at least one&#xD;
             measurable lesion outside the previously irradiated region in order to be considered&#xD;
             to have measurable disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated; if the method of castration&#xD;
             was luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists (leuprolide or goserelin),&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  If the patient has been treated with non-steroidal anti-androgens (flutamide,&#xD;
             bicalutamide or nilutamide) or other hormonal treatment (such as ketoconazole), these&#xD;
             agents must have been stopped at least 28 days prior to enrollment for flutamide or&#xD;
             ketoconazole, and at least 42 days prior to enrollment for bicalutamide or nilutamide;&#xD;
