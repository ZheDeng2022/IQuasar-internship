      3VM1001 is a topical cream that may be useful for the treatment of chronic osteoarthritis of&#xD;
      the knee. This proof of concept study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study&#xD;
      to compare treatment with 3VM1001 cream to an inactive cream placebo. Subjects will&#xD;
      self-treat for 30 days with investigational drug or placebo. Rescue medication with&#xD;
      acetaminophen, up to 2g daily, is permitted. This study is intended to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of 3VM1001 topical cream, a copper-containing cream. Subjects will self treat&#xD;
      with drug or placebo three times daily for 30 days. All subjects will have a total of three&#xD;
      visits to the clinic and will complete a daily diary each day for the 30 days of treatment.&#xD;
