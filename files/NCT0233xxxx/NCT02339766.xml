  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most women having planned cesarean section receive spinal anesthetic for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, spinal opioids are administered during the same time as a component of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia to provide pain relief in the 16-24 hr period postoperatively. However, spinal&#xD;
      opioids are frequently associated with adverse effects such as nausea, pruritus, sedation and&#xD;
      occasionally respiratory depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quadratus lumborum (QL) block is a regional analgesic technique which blocks T5-L1 nerve&#xD;
      branches and has an evolving role in postoperative analgesia for lower abdominal surgeries&#xD;
      and is a potential alternative to spinal opioids. There is some evidence that it may provide&#xD;
      visceral along with somatic pain relief. It is a simple and safe technique that has been&#xD;
      studied in lower abdominal surgeries, but has not been studied for pain relief after cesarean&#xD;
      section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If found effective, it will have the advantage of a reduction in opioid associated adverse&#xD;
      effects while providing similar quality of analgesia. This block has evolved from the&#xD;
      previously known transversus abdominis plane block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to undertake a study that will compare the relative efficacy of QL block with&#xD;
      local anesthetic to spinal morphine. We will also study if it provides any incremental&#xD;
      benefit when administered in addition to spinal morphine.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized controlled double blinded trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy five female patients belonging to American Society of Anesthesiologists status 1-3,&#xD;
      age 18-45 yrs undergoing elective caesarean delivery will be included in this prospective&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, they will be randomized to one of the three groups by a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization. All patients will receive standard spinal anesthetic. They&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the three groups (n=25 per group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1 and 3 will receive intrathecal morphine in addition to the spinal anesthestic. Group&#xD;
      2 will receive equal volume of saline added to the intrathecal mixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided Quadratus Lumborum block will be done. Following negative aspiration, 25 mL&#xD;
      of Ropivacaine 0.5% (Groups 2 and 3), or the same amount of saline (Group 1) will be injected&#xD;
      in each side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive routine postoperative analgesia, including analgesics and oral&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed postoperatively by a blinded investigator at 6, 12 and 24h&#xD;
      post-operatively.&#xD;
