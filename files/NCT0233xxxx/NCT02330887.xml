  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In rural Nepal, the major drivers of underutilization of skilled birth attendance are&#xD;
      poverty, poor social support and inadequate birth planning. Drawing from similar programs&#xD;
      that have been shown to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes, we have designed a group&#xD;
      antenatal care program that uses a participatory learning and action process to engage women&#xD;
      in identifying and solving problems accessing maternity care services and create a supportive&#xD;
      social network. We plan to test a group antenatal care program that will change antenatal&#xD;
      care in three major ways: 1) conduct care in a group setting with women matched by&#xD;
      gestational age, 2) incorporate participatory learning and action, and 3) provide expert and&#xD;
      facilitated peer counseling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The group antenatal care intervention aims to improve rates of institutional birth and ANC&#xD;
      care completion via improving acceptability of group care, maternal and neonatal health&#xD;
      knowledge, self-efficacy, social support, and birth planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 1: Assess the effect of group antenatal care on institutional birth rates through a&#xD;
      prospective study using community household census data. Secondary outcomes will be&#xD;
      completion of basic ANC package; neonatal mortality rate; percentage of preterm births;&#xD;
      percentage of stillbirths; and percentage of small-for-gestational age (SGA) births.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Group ANC will increase institutional birth rates by 5% over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Group ANC will increase completion of 4 ANC visits by 5% over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3: Group ANC will reduce infant mortality rate by 5% over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 4: Group ANC will reduce the postpartum contraceptive prevalence rate by 5%&#xD;
           over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 5: Group ANC will reduce the stillbirth rate by 5% over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 6: Group ANC will reduce the perinatal mortality rate 5% over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 7: Group ANC will reduce the combined infant mortality and stillbirth rate by&#xD;
           5% over one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 2: Assess the mechanisms of implementation of group antenatal care through&#xD;
      quantitative participant survey measures, qualitative focus group discussions and key&#xD;
      informant interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Group antenatal care will be acceptable to participants and providers, and&#xD;
           preferred to individual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Group antenatal care will increase pregnant patients' access to and&#xD;
           utilization of delivery services through improved knowledge, self-efficacy, social&#xD;
           support and birth planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective 3: Report on key aspects of the implementation process: costs, human resources,&#xD;
      logistics, and fidelity of the group antenatal program to model content and participatory&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
