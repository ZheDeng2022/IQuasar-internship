      The hypothesis of the investigators' project is that comprehensive primary preterm birth&#xD;
      prevention, inclusive of maternal oral health with xylitol chewing gum (the intervention),&#xD;
      will reduce the rate of periodontal disease and caries, preterm birth prevalence, and&#xD;
      neonatal mortality.&#xD;

      Significance and Impact: Adverse birth outcomes related to the length of gestation (preterm&#xD;
      birth) are recognized as one of the most significant disorders in maternal-child health at a&#xD;
      global scale. In the developed world, the preterm birth rate approximates 7%. In Malawi, the&#xD;
      investigators have recently demonstrated that this rate more than triples to approximate&#xD;
      26.1%. Of the 4 million newborn deaths annually, nearly 1/3 (27%) are directly attributable&#xD;
      to prematurity with another 36% secondary to related opportunistic infections (sepsis,&#xD;
      pneumonia, gastrointestinal). 75% of the 4 million deaths occur within the first week of&#xD;
      life, with the vast majority occurring in the first 48 hours. For those that do survive,&#xD;
      there are persistent and lifelong risks due to stunted growth, chronic infection, retinopathy&#xD;
      of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. The link between maternal oral health&#xD;
      (periodontal disease in particular) and risk of preterm birth has been demonstrated across&#xD;
      all populations (rural and urban, in both industrialized and developing regions) studied to&#xD;
      date. However, in multiple randomized controlled trials treatment of active periodontal&#xD;
      disease with scaling and planning during pregnancy has failed to demonstrate a significant&#xD;
      benefit in preventing preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Why would maternal oral health impact preterm birth? In rodents, subcutaneous inoculations&#xD;
      with periodontal pathogens cause dose-dependent decreases in pup weights, and elicit&#xD;
      inflammatory responses that can trigger preterm birth when present in amniotic fluid.&#xD;
      Periodontitis (defined as a destructive inflammation of the periodontium) has a prevalence of&#xD;
      30% or greater in women of child bearing age. By definition, it involves microbial&#xD;
      infiltration of the periodontium, which stimulates a chronic inflammatory response, recurrent&#xD;
      bacteremia, and the production of cytokines and prostaglandins which trigger risk of preterm&#xD;
      birth. It is the same production of prostaglandins which are felt to mediate the risk of&#xD;
      preterm birth. So if the investigators know that there is biologic evidence that&#xD;
      periodontitis is related to preterm birth, but treating active periodontitis does not reduce&#xD;
      these morbidities, is it possible that preventing periodontitis might prevent preterm birth&#xD;
      and low birth weight? If so, what are the least expensive efficacious preventative measures?&#xD;
      The investigators' overarching hypothesis is that comprehensive primary preterm birth&#xD;
      prevention, inclusive of maternal oral health with xylitol chewing gum (the intervention),&#xD;
      will reduce the rate of periodontal disease and caries, preterm birth prevalence, and&#xD;
      neonatal mortality.&#xD;
