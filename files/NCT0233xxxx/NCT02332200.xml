      This is a retrospective chart review with a short follow-up phone questionnaire for our&#xD;
      patients who have been treated by Nationwide Children's Hospital physical therapy and sports&#xD;
      medicine for a spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no research exists to guide referral for safe physical therapy rehabilitation for&#xD;
      patients with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis injuries. By performing this retrospective&#xD;
      study the investigators can gain information to better guide physical therapy referral time.&#xD;
      This may also serve as foundation for a future prospective randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Nationwide Children Hospital physicians vary from immediate referral to physical&#xD;
      therapy to 3 + months of rest prior to beginning therapy. By performing a retrospective chart&#xD;
      review assessing time to referral to therapy and patient outcomes the investigator can gain&#xD;
      some guidance for when it is safe to prescribe physical therapy rehabilitation for patients&#xD;
      with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with an active spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis injury who are referred to&#xD;
      physical therapy early will return to activity/sport sooner without increased risk of adverse&#xD;
      reaction.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spondylolysis is as stress fracture in the pars interarticularis of the vertebral arch most&#xD;
      commonly occurring in the lower lumbar spine. Spondylolisthesis is the forward displacement&#xD;
      of a vertebra, especially the fifth lumbar vertebra, most commonly occurring after a break or&#xD;
      fracture. These injuries to the spine are extremely common in adolescent athletes and some&#xD;
      research reports that spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis account for over 40% of all&#xD;
      adolescent athletes' low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these injuries are common in the adolescent population there is very little research to&#xD;
      guide treatment of these patients, particularly with rehabilitation. Conservative standard of&#xD;
      care with the treatment of spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis injuries are to rest from&#xD;
      sport, brace the lumbar spine, and begin physical therapy and return to sport as the patient&#xD;
      is able. There is some evidence to show that patients should rest for 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
      returning to sport, otherwise there is an increased risk of injury (El Rassi, 2013). There&#xD;
      currently is no research to suggest when to begin physical therapy. Physical therapy for&#xD;
      rehabilitation and return to sport is a part of standard of care, but recommendations for&#xD;
      beginning therapy vary widely and are not supported by evidence. A concern for beginning&#xD;
      physical therapy too soon is that the fracture will not have adequate time to heal and&#xD;
      re-injury can occur. While a concern for waiting too long to begin therapy is increased&#xD;
      muscle atrophy, high fear avoidance beliefs, and unnecessarily long avoidance of activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, Nationwide Children Hospital physician's vary from immediate referral to physical&#xD;
      therapy to 3 + months of rest prior to beginning therapy. By performing a retrospective chart&#xD;
      review assessing time to referral to therapy and patient outcomes we can gain some guidance&#xD;
      for when it is safe to prescribe physical therapy rehabilitation for patients with&#xD;
      spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no research exists to guide referral for safe physical therapy rehabilitation for&#xD;
      patients with spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis injuries. By performing this retrospective&#xD;
      study we can gain information to better guide physical therapy referral time. This may also&#xD;
      serve as foundation for a future prospective randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The are two primary objectives of this study: (1) Does time to referral to physical therapy&#xD;
      affect time to full return to activity. (2) To assess the safety of an early referral to&#xD;
      therapy compared with a long rest period prior to therapy. Safety will be determined by&#xD;
      relative risk of adverse reaction and percent of patients able to fully return to activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing pain with early and later referral to therapy. Number of physician visits Number of&#xD;
      physical therapy visits Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform a chart review of all spondylolysis and spondylolisthesis patients who have&#xD;
      been treated by Nationwide Children's Hospital Sports Medicine physicians and physical&#xD;
      therapists since 12/2009 when electronic charting on these patients began. As we are unable&#xD;
      to track the outcomes for this study of those patients referred to outside physical therapy,&#xD;
      they will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chart review will begin by running a report for all patients with a spondylolysis or&#xD;
      spondylolisthesis diagnosis from 2009 to 2013.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables that will be automatically pulled in the report will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age at time of diagnosis Gender Treating physician Pain Compliance Sports Played **Any&#xD;
      missing variable from the report will be gathered by reviewing the patients chart.**&#xD;
      Variables that will be gathered from reviewing the patients chart Diagnosis Level of injury&#xD;
      Type of imaging Brace Results of imaging Rest before Physical Therapy Rest before cleared for&#xD;
      return to sport Treating physical therapist Number of physical therapy visits Number of&#xD;
      physician visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables that will be gathered in a short follow-up survey by contacting the patients.&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by phone, or mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrence of symptoms Michelli Function Score Modified Odom's criteria Current level of&#xD;
      sport participation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 2 groups: Early referral to therapy and late referral to&#xD;
      therapy by physician. To account for the fact that patients who are referred to physical&#xD;
      therapy sooner may have a less severe injury we will be sub-grouping patients by physician.&#xD;
      Patients of a physician with a median referral rate &lt; 10 weeks to therapy will be sub-grouped&#xD;
      into Early referral to therapy and patients of a physician with a median referral time &gt;10&#xD;
      weeks will be sub-grouped into Late referral to therapy. To account for possible changes in&#xD;
      the way a particular physician treats their patients with a spondylolysis or&#xD;
      spondylolisthesis physician referral rate will be assessed yearly and patient grouped based&#xD;
      on that calendar year referral rate. For example if a doctor has a median referral rate of 12&#xD;
      weeks to therapy in 2009, but 9 weeks in 2010, their 2010 patients will be placed into the&#xD;
      late referral to therapy while there 2010 patients will be placed into the early referral&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis To assess the first primary object we will assess if there is a between group&#xD;
      difference (early vs late referral to PT) for time to return sport. We will assess between&#xD;
      group differences using a t-test if the data are parametric and a Mann-Whitney U test if the&#xD;
      data are nonparametric.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of an early referral to therapy compared with a long rest period prior&#xD;
      to therapy. We will examine the relative risk between groups for experiencing a significant&#xD;
      recurrence of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes for the following variables will be assessed by t-test (parametric) or&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U (nonparametric) for continuous data and chi-square analysis for categorical&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PT visits&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physician visits Michelli Function Score Compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be reported for all other variables&#xD;
