    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the two phase PERMAD trial is the evaluation of the impact of a&#xD;
      personalized marker-driven treatment approach with early detection of progression and&#xD;
      modification of treatment on cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAF) and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regard of the two parts, the primary objective of the run-in phase (n=50 patients) with&#xD;
      conventional switch of chemotherapy together with the anti-angiogenic agent is the&#xD;
      determination of a distinct cytokines and angiogenic factor (CAF) profile during treatment&#xD;
      with FOLFOX and bevacizumab, which allows early detection/prediction of progressive disease.&#xD;
      The primary objective of the marker-driven randomized part (n=150 patients) with&#xD;
      marker-driven switch of antiangiogenic agent and maintenance of chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      evaluation of the efficacy of an early marker-driven switch of anti-angiogenic treatment&#xD;
      (bevacizumab to aflibercept)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicentre, multinational, open labeled, prospective, randomized, controlled phase&#xD;
      II study designed to assess the clinical utility of an early marker driven change of&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic treatment (bevacizumab to aflibercept) maintaining the chemotherapy backbone&#xD;
      until definite radiological progression in first line treatment of patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. After completing the run in phase of the study, with at least 30 patients&#xD;
      completing their first line treatment (due to progression, secondary resection or toxicity)&#xD;
      and being evaluable for CAF analyses, the results will be reviewed by an Independent Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (IDMC). Based on that review the decision to continue with, modify or&#xD;
      cancel the randomized part will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the run-in phase with conventional switch of chemotherapy together&#xD;
      with the anti-angiogenic agent is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Progression free survival (PFS1) of first line treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the randomized part with marker-driven switch of antiangiogenic agent&#xD;
      and maintenance of chemotherapy is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Progression free survival rate at 6 months (PFSR@6) after first cycle after randomization.&#xD;
