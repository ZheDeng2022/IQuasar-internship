      A phase I/II study of pazopanib in combination with temozolomide in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme after surgery and RT-CT (PAZOGLIO study)&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastoma (GBM), the most common and most malignant primary brain tumor, represents a&#xD;
      major medical challenge considering its extremely poor prognosis (Wen 2008). Current standard&#xD;
      of care includes maximal surgical resection, followed by concomitant radio-chemotherapy&#xD;
      (temozolomide - TMZ) (RT-CT) followed by 6 months of maintenance TMZ, with a median overall&#xD;
      survival (mOS) of 14.6 vs. 12.1 months with RT alone (Stupp 2005). Non operable GBM,&#xD;
      represents around 30% of cases of GBM, with a poorer prognosis, a median PFS of 3-4 months&#xD;
      and a median OS between 6-9 months (Chinot 2007, Stupp 2009), with concomitant RT-CT&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore, innovative treatment strategies are urgently needed and new treatment&#xD;
      combinations evaluated in phase I studies are highly encouraged (Wen 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since GBM is one of the most vascularised cancers, antiangiogenic agents have been tested and&#xD;
      used firstly in recurrent GBM. Among them, Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), has shown high response rate between 19%&#xD;
      and 62% in several Phase 2 and multiple retrospective studies, alone or in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy (Chamberlain 2011). Two randomized phase III trials, AVAGLIO and RTOG 0825,&#xD;
      investigating the efficacy of Bevacizumab added or not to the Stupp protocol in patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed GBM, have been presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of&#xD;
      Clinical Oncology (ASCO 2013). While both studies exhibited a significant progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) improvement (RTOG 0825:10.7 vs. 7.3m, p=0.007; AVAGLIO: 10.6 vs. 6.2m,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.0001), there was no gain in overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other antiangiogenic agents have been studied in GBM patients (Sathornsumetee 2009, Van Meir&#xD;
      2010, Wick 2011), with encouraging results but still insufficient when used as single agents.&#xD;
      Among them, pazopanib is thought to be promising. It is an orally tyrosine kinase inhibitor&#xD;
      with potently inhibition of VEGFR-1, -2, -3, c-kit and PDGFR-α, -β (Castaneda 2009, Schutz&#xD;
      2011). Interestingly, these 2 PDGFR subtypes are overexpressed in malignant gliomas (Verhaak&#xD;
      2010). Furthermore, pazopanib is already validated in patients with advanced renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and soft-tissue sarcomas (Sleijfer 2009, Sternberg 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A phase II trial evaluated efficacy and safety of pazopanib in 35 patients with recurrent GBM&#xD;
      (Iwamoto 2010). Two patients had a partial radiographic response by standard bidimensional&#xD;
      measurements, whereas 9 patients (6 at the 8-week point and 3 only within the first month of&#xD;
      treatment) had decreased contrast enhancement, vasogenic edema, and mass effect but &lt;50%&#xD;
      reduction in tumor. The median PFS was 12 weeks and mOS was 35 weeks. Pazopanib was&#xD;
      reasonably well tolerated with a spectrum of toxicities similar to other anti-VEGF/VEGFR&#xD;
      agents and with unexpected toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the emerging concern that pure anti-VEGF inhibition may promote malignant glial cell&#xD;
      invasiveness (Keunen 2011), we consider essential to combine a multitargeted antiangiogenic&#xD;
      agent, such as pazopanib, with the current standard treatment. TMZ was chosen not only&#xD;
      because it represents the current standard of care but because of its very good penetration&#xD;
      in the brain parenchyma and its low hepatic metabolism, making very unlikely the occurrence&#xD;
      of a pharmacokinetic interaction with pazopanib (Friedman 2000). Indeed, phase I trials of&#xD;
      TMZ in combination with molecules such as RAD001, cilengitide, gefitinib or irinotecan showed&#xD;
      no need for dose modification of TMZ. Similarly, the Phase I trials of pazopanib association&#xD;
      with paclitaxel or FOLFOX6 have been conducted up to a dose of 800 mg daily, the recommended&#xD;
      dose of pazopanib in monotherapy, with standard doses of chemotherapy (Tan 2010, Brady 2009).&#xD;
      Finally, the study of the toxicity profile of pazopanib and TMZ does not suggest a specific&#xD;
      limiting dose escalation adverse event, except perhaps asthenia, thrombocytopenia or ALAT&#xD;
      elevation. However, considering the high level of potential toxicity when an ITK is&#xD;
      administered with radiations, pazopanib should not be administered in the induction phase of&#xD;
      the Stupp protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, based on a strong synergy rational, the study coordinator aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of pazopanib in combination with TMZ in the maintenance phase of the&#xD;
      Stupp protocol. The study coordinator hopes that this strategy could significantly improve&#xD;
      the poor prognosis of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter Phase I/II trial, which aims to determine the Recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      Dose (RP2D) of pazopanib in combination with TMZ. The study coordinator will associate a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary approach involving translational pharmacokinetic studies, and research on&#xD;
      potential predictive biomarkers of response through pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic&#xD;
      approachs. This study will include patients with not previously treated GBM, candidates for a&#xD;
      complete or partial surgical resection and who are eligible for adjuvant treatment based on a&#xD;
      combination of TMZ and radiotherapy.&#xD;
