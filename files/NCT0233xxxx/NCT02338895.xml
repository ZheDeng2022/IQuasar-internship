      BACKGROUND &amp; INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) develops in 88% to 30% of critically ill patients admitted to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit. While AKI of any severity is a strong predictor of mortality (1-4), both&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality increase with increasing severity of renal injury(2). Therefore any&#xD;
      management strategy that prevents progression of renal risk to injury or failure has the&#xD;
      potential to improve outcomes in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional management of acute oliguria in shock has been to blindly 'push' fluids to&#xD;
      improve renal perfusion or to give loop diuretics once fluid loading has been considered as&#xD;
      accomplished. However both volume overload and 'blind' attempts at fluid removal can worsen&#xD;
      renal injury and have been associated with higher mortality by venous overcongestion (5) and&#xD;
      inappropriate hypovolemia (6-8). It seems reasonable to assume that a bedside test to&#xD;
      visualize volume status and renal perfusion may assist in improving outcomes in this cohort.&#xD;
      Intensive care unit (ICU) bedside ultrasound has become the standard of care for critically&#xD;
      ill patients(9-18). In patients with shock, inferior vena cava ultrasonographic evaluation&#xD;
      for 'fluid responsiveness' is routinely used to direct resuscitation (19-21) by direct&#xD;
      measurement of IVC diameter and respiratory variation or by the response to a noninvasive&#xD;
      fluid bolus from a passive leg raise (22). Doppler ultrasound of intrarenal vessels has also&#xD;
      been described as a tool to assess renal perfusion (23-27).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators developed a goal-directed ultrasonographic protocol to provide immediate&#xD;
      hemodynamic information in acutely oliguric patients with shock as well as a management&#xD;
      algorithm for guiding therapy. The investigators incorporated IVC diameter measurement,&#xD;
      respiratory variation and response to a passive leg raise to assess whether further fluid&#xD;
      boluses were required and a measurement of renal perfusion to determine whether diuretics or&#xD;
      renal replacement therapy were indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to measure the effects of this management protocol on the rates of AKI in&#xD;
      the study participants as compared to prior to the implementation of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Study Design: Prospective, Observational 2. Study Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: Critically ill, adult patients AND with acute oliguric renal failure&#xD;
           AND within 6 hours of presentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Patients with pre-existing chronic renal failure ii. Patients on renal replacement&#xD;
           therapy/ Dialysis iii. Patients with poor sonographic windows&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Variables to be measured:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dependent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Demographic identifiers; age, gender, comorbidity, admitting diagnosis, APACHE II&#xD;
           scores, b. Renal perfusion as measured by color Doppler c. Daily fluid balance, d. Mean&#xD;
           hourly urine output, e. Vasopressor use, f. Daily serum Creatinine g. Response to&#xD;
           diuretics h. Dose of diuretic that resulted in urine output&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Incidence of renal failure (classified into RIFLE categories; Risk, Injury,&#xD;
                Failure, Loss of Function, End-Stage: see Appendix 1),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. ICU length of Stay,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. ICU mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials &amp; Methodologies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening &amp; Enrollment of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. All ICU patients admitted to the ICU will be screened for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Those meeting inclusion criteria will have their Demographic information entered in&#xD;
                Case Record Forms (Appendix 2: Sample CRF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Ultrasound examinations will be carried out and results entered into the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
                o For patients found to be intravascularly dehydrated (those with &gt; 2 cm IVC&#xD;
                diameter (IVCd) or &gt;15% variation in IVCd or an increase of &gt; 15% in IVCd with a&#xD;
                passive leg raise maneuver), the results will be communicated to the managing ICU&#xD;
                team for fluid resuscitation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  For patients found to be adequately hydrated, renal perfusion will be assessed&#xD;
                     by observing flow in the interlobar and arcuate vessels by colour Doppler and&#xD;
                     the renal resistive index will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  The results of no perfusion or perfusion present will be communicated to the&#xD;
                     managing ICU team for recommendation of high dose diuresis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ultrasonographic assessment of Inferior Vena Cava Measurement of the inferior vena cava&#xD;
           diameter, and respiratory variation by ultrasound&#xD;
           (http://www.criticalecho.com/content/tutorial-4-volume-status-and-preload-responsiveness&#xD;
           -assessment) Ultrasonographic assessment of the IVC will be done using a transthoracic,&#xD;
           subcostal approach. The transducer will be positioned just below the xiphisternum 1-2cms&#xD;
           to the right of the midline, with the marker dot pointing towards the sternal notch.&#xD;
           After obtaining a 2-D image of the IVC entering the right atrium and verifying that the&#xD;
           IVC visualization is not lost during movements of respiration, an M-mode line will be&#xD;
           placed through the IVC 1 cm caudal from its junction with the hepatic vein, and an&#xD;
           M-mode tracing obtained. This placement ensures that the intrathoracic IVC is not&#xD;
           measured during any part of the respiratory cycle. The M-mode tracing will be recorded&#xD;
           through 3- 4 respiratory cycles, the image frozen and using calipers, the maximum and&#xD;
           minimum diameters of the IVC tracing measured. IVC variation will be quantified by&#xD;
           measuring the difference between the maximum and minimum diameters on the M-mode&#xD;
           tracing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasonographic assessment of Renal Perfusion by color Doppler&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vessel localization and a semi-quantitative evaluation of renal perfusion will be&#xD;
           carried out using the following staging method.&#xD;
           (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-10286-8_31 - page-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stage Quality of Renal Perfusion by color Doppler 0 Unidentifiable vessels 1 Few vessels&#xD;
           in vicinity of hilum 2 Hilar and intralobar vessels in most of renal parenchyma 3 Renal&#xD;
           vessels identifiable until the arcuate arteries in the entire field of view&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Statistical Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Sample size &amp; Sampling: Consecutive admissions to the ICU will be enrolled. Since&#xD;
                this is a proof of concept study, the projected sample size is 40 patients. An&#xD;
                interim analysis will be carried out after 20 patients are enrolled and a further&#xD;
                20 will be enrolled as necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Analysis: Categorical variables will be reported as proportions or percentages,&#xD;
                continuous variables as means or medians. Differences between groups will be&#xD;
                estimated using CHI2, student t test or Mann-Whitney U test, as appropriate. Rates&#xD;
                of renal injury from historical controls will be compared to rates measured using t&#xD;
                test for paired samples. A p value =0.05 will be considered significant. SPSS&#xD;
                version 22.0 will be used for all analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed Consent for ultrasonographic examination. The use of use of ultrasound for the&#xD;
           assessment and management of critically ill patients in the ICU and emergency room is&#xD;
           considered as standard of care and is routinely practiced in ICUs around the world.&#xD;
           Since ultrasound evaluation has become incorporated into usual ICU practice, written&#xD;
           consent is not required in its routine use. We therefore ask for a waiver of informed&#xD;
           consent since we will not be performing any deviation from usual ICU care and our study&#xD;
           is simply a collection of practice into a protocolized form.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (Please see References 9-27)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research Advisory Committee (RAC) Review This protocol will be reviewed and approved by&#xD;
           the hospital Research Advisory committee responsible for oversight of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Subject Confidentiality &amp; Protection of Rights of Control Subjects All case record forms,&#xD;
      reports and other records will be identified only by the Study Identification Number (SID) to&#xD;
      maintain subject confidentiality. All records will be kept in a password-protected file. All&#xD;
      computer entry and networking programs will be done using SIDs only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Study Modification/Discontinuation The study may be modified or discontinued at any time&#xD;
      by the primary investigators and or Research Advisory Committee as part of their duties to&#xD;
      ensure that research subjects are protected.&#xD;
