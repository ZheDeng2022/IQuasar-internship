  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in conventional imaging (abdominal ultrasound, CT scan, MRI) are so great that&#xD;
      chance to discover a incidental solid or cystic pancreatic lesion is becoming usual.&#xD;
      Endocrine tumors have variable malignant potential depending on their size, some malignancy&#xD;
      for lesions larger than 2 cm and indefinite for a smaller size. The branch-duct like IPMN&#xD;
      (intraductal papillary mucinous pancreatic tumor) involving the pancreatic secondary ducts&#xD;
      represent half of pancreatic cystic tumors and may degenerate into 5 to 10% of cases. Signs&#xD;
      and risk of degeneration are the presence of mural nodules greater than 5 mm and size &gt; 3 cm,&#xD;
      although the latter criterion is discussed. Mucinous cystadenomas could degenerate between 30&#xD;
      and 50% of cases even though the role of size is much discussed (&lt;4 cm). The follow-up&#xD;
      imaging is performed using MRI and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS). A fine needle aspiration&#xD;
      for cytology and histology is possible and determination of biological markers is useful. But&#xD;
      cytology is often unprofitable due to the poor cellular profile of the cystic pancreatic&#xD;
      tumor. Once the diagnosis of suspected malignancy, the patient should be referred to the&#xD;
      surgeon for pancreatic resection more or less extensive. But this attitude is facing a&#xD;
      significant operative risk with up to 30% of morbidity and mortality between 1 and 3 % for&#xD;
      cephalic resections. Some patients with high post operative risks are inoperable. For these&#xD;
      reasons, some teams have proposed the destruction of the walls of the cyst under EUS, US or&#xD;
      CT control by washing with absolute alcohol content of cystic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interesting alternative endoscopic destruction would be the use of radio frequency&#xD;
      ablation technique (RFA). RFA is a recognized technique for local tumor destruction by&#xD;
      delivering thermal energy to obtain coagulation necrosis of the lesion. Taewong Medical ™&#xD;
      recently developed a radiofrequency needle EUSRA® coupled with a combo VIVA ™ generator for&#xD;
      applying RFA sub EUS control. But no prospective study is available at this date regarding&#xD;
      the treatment of the cystic or solid tumoral pancreatic lesion with this technique. The&#xD;
      primary endpoint of the present study is to investigate the feasibility and safety of this&#xD;
      guided radiofrequency probe EUS for the treatment of pancreatic endocrine tumors or&#xD;
      inoperable pancreatic cystic tumors. The secondary objective will be the efficiency.&#xD;
