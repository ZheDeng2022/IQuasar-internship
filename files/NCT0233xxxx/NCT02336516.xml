      Post diarrheal hemolytic and uremic syndrome (D+HUS) is the first etiology of acute renal&#xD;
      failure in children less than 5 years old in France. Previous works highlighted a mortality&#xD;
      rate of 2 % and a prevalence of renal sequelae at one year after D+HUS onset in 25 % of&#xD;
      patients D+HUS is a consequence of a gastrointestinal infection with shiga toxin (Stx)&#xD;
      producing E.coli (STEC). The most frequent straight is E.coli O157H7. The sequence of STEC&#xD;
      induced HUS is now well known. Typically, digestive symptoms appear five days following STEC&#xD;
      ingestion. STEC colonize the intestinal mucosa, adhere to the enterocyte and cause a typical&#xD;
      attaching/effacing lesion and inflammation. Then, diarrhea and vomiting occurred. D+HUS&#xD;
      occurs in about 10% of patients and is a consequence of Stx systemic absorption. Indeed, Stx&#xD;
      are released in the gastrointestinal tract, then after transferred to the systemic&#xD;
      circulation. At the cellular level, Stx binds the globotriosylceramide (Gb3Cer) localized at&#xD;
      the surface of the endothelial and epithelial cells of target organs. Following binding to&#xD;
      Gb3Cer, the A subunits of Stx are internalized and trigger the activation of the apoptotic&#xD;
      program leading to cell death. In addition, Stx are also able to enhance the production and&#xD;
      the release of pro inflammatory factor (IL-1, TNFα, IL-6). Cytokines locally produced by&#xD;
      Stx-stimulated cells can amplify the inflammatory processes and the prothrombotic state&#xD;
      leading to the constitution of the microangiopathic lesions of HUS. To this day, management&#xD;
      of D+HUS involves supportive care mainly based on fluid management, dialysis and red blood&#xD;
      cells transfusions. Specific therapies used in D+HUS (plasma infusion, antithrombotic and&#xD;
      anti inflammatory agents) failed to improve the course of D+HUS. The use of antibiotics&#xD;
      remains not recommended while meta-analysis clearly showed that the use of bactericidal&#xD;
      antibiotics could worse the course of D+HUS. In vitro experimentations highlighted that some&#xD;
      classes of antibiotics like fluoroquinolones dramatically increase the production and the&#xD;
      release of Stx before bacterial lysis and worsen the outcome of D+HUS in animal models. By&#xD;
      contrast, azythromycin, a bacteriostatic antibiotic of the macrolides family blocking the&#xD;
      protein synthesis in bacteria, has a strong inhibitory effect on Stx production and release&#xD;
      by STEC as well as it inhibits the in vitro growth of STEC strains. In addition, azithromycin&#xD;
      is able to inhibit the Stx-induced production of inflammatory cytokines which are considered&#xD;
      to be essential for the development of D+HUS. Consistently the use of azithromycin in animal&#xD;
      models of D+HUS dramatically improved the survival rate. Preliminary data on humans with&#xD;
      D+HUS treated with azithromycin highlighted a lower prevalence of severe gastrointestinal&#xD;
      involvement than in control patients. All these data supported the hypothesis that&#xD;
      azithromycin should have a beneficial effect on D+HUS and should improve the short and long&#xD;
      term outcome and deserves to be formally demonstrated in human with D+HUS.&#xD;

      Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) is defined by the combination of microangiopathic hemolytic&#xD;
      anemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. The underlying lesion is thrombotic&#xD;
      microangiopathy (TMA) affecting arteriole and capillary walls, with endothelial cells&#xD;
      swelling and detachment and thrombi obstructing vascular lumina. Post- diarrheal HUS (D+HUS)&#xD;
      is induced by an infection due to E. coli (STEC) producing a Shiga -like toxin (Stx) which is&#xD;
      responsible of TMA. Serotype O157:H7 represents 63-97 % of STEC causing D+HUS. Other&#xD;
      serotypes frequently implicated in outbreaks are O26:H11, O103:H2, O111:H8, O145:H28 (Mariani&#xD;
      - Kurkdjian P et al, 2001) (Espié et al, 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The D+HUS mainly affects children under 3 years and occurs after a prodromal bloody diarrhea.&#xD;
      The onset of HUS surrounds 3 to 5 days after the onset of diarrhea. D+HUS is the leading&#xD;
      cause of acute renal failure in children under 5 years (Decludt et al. 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, 100 to 120 pediatric cases of D+HUS are reported each year. STEC infection was&#xD;
      demonstrated in 85 % of cases. In 50 % of cases, one or more persons of the same family have&#xD;
      STEC diarrhea without HUS. The death rate in the acute phase is about 2% and 50% of D+HUS&#xD;
      requires dialysis. The predictive factors of a poor outcome are an anuria for more than 8&#xD;
      days a neutrophil count&gt;20000/mm3, a severe bowel disease or central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
      involvement (Scheiring et al. 2008). In 65-80 % of cases, a seemingly ad integrum recovery of&#xD;
      renal function was observed within the first year after D + HUS onset. However, D+HUS is&#xD;
      responsible for a nephron loss that could lead to hypertension, proteinuria and chronic renal&#xD;
      failure in the long term. A study performed on 218 patients undergoing D+HUS in the chidhood,&#xD;
      highlighted the presence of renal sequelae in nearly 65 % of them with a median follow-up of&#xD;
      nearly 20 years. (Fila et al, submitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, humans are infected by contaminated food (minced meat undercooked products,&#xD;
      unpasteurized milk and cheese...), by the animal environment (especially cattle) or by&#xD;
      transmission from person to person. EHEC virulence is associated with the presence of toxins&#xD;
      called Shigatoxins (Stx) and the presence of the eae gene, responsible for damage attachment&#xD;
      - clearing in the colon and caecum. Two major types of Shigatoxin, Stx1 and Stx2, and many&#xD;
      Stx1 or Stx2 variants were identified: three variants for Stx1 and at least, six variants for&#xD;
      Stx2. The determination of different profiles variants Stx is considered as predictive of the&#xD;
      severity of STEC infections with progression to HUS, especially Stx2d activated and Stx2c&#xD;
      After ingestion of contaminated food, STEC are able to withstand the acidity of the stomach&#xD;
      and colonize the digestive tract. Toxins produced by the bacteria go through the intestinal&#xD;
      epithelium, join the circulatory system and reach their target organs, mainly kidneys and&#xD;
      CNS. Indeed, toxins bind to a specific glycolipid receptor, globotriosylceramide (Gb3) on the&#xD;
      surface of endothelial cells of target organs (digestive tract, kidney, CNS, pancreas)&#xD;
      driving on the one hand, the release of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF- α, IL6, IL8) involved&#xD;
      in the formation of lesions of microangiopathy and leading to apoptosis of the target cells&#xD;
      (Hurley et al. 2001) (Thorpe et al, 1999) (Zoja et al.2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this day, management of D+HUS requires only supportive care. All specific therapies&#xD;
      (antithrombotic and anti inflammatory agents, specific antibodies against Shigatoxin, plasma&#xD;
      transfusion and plasma exchange) did not show efficacy (Scheiring et al. 2008) (Loirat et al.&#xD;
      2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several retrospective and prospective studies suggest that antibiotics increase the risk of&#xD;
      HUS by release of Stx during bacterial lysis but also to certain types of antibiotics,&#xD;
      increased synthesis of Shiga toxin. The meta-analysis performed by Wang et al on the use of&#xD;
      antibiotics in patient with STEC diarrhea and D+HUS highlighted an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing D+HUS in patients treated with antibiotics (Wang et al. 2000). A second&#xD;
      meta-analysis bringing together 20 studies, that compared the risk of HUS occurrence in&#xD;
      patients with STEC diarrhea treated or not with antibiotics, has not concluded (Panos et al.&#xD;
      2006). According to these results, antibiotherapy is actually not recommended for patients&#xD;
      with diarrhea EHEC and patients with D+HUS (Scheiring et al. 2008). However, these studies&#xD;
      did not distinguish between different classes of antibiotics, bringing together all the&#xD;
      bacteriostatic antibiotics as well as bactericidal. But, in vitro studies have clearly shown&#xD;
      that certain classes of antibiotics such as quinolones induced the production of Shigatoxin&#xD;
      (multiplying production by a factor of 100 for ciprofloxacin) while others had a strong&#xD;
      inhibitory action as the azithromycin (Ohara et al. 2002 ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Azithromycin, an antibiotic of the macrolide family, binds to the 50S subunit of the&#xD;
      bacterial ribosome and inhibits protein synthesis by blocking transpeptidation. This&#xD;
      mechanism inhibits the production and the release of Shiga toxin in STEC (Ohara et al. 2002).&#xD;
      Studies on animal models of D+HUS (mice, piglet) showed a drastic reduction in mortality.&#xD;
      Moreover, in addition to its inhibitory action on the synthesis of Stx, azithromycin has a&#xD;
      modulating effect on the inflammatory reaction on the vascular endothelium induced by the&#xD;
      Shigatoxin that contribute to thrombotic microangiopathy. Indeed, azithromycin dramatically&#xD;
      decreased secretion of IL6, IL1 and TNFα (Gantzhorn et al. 2009) (Ohara et al. 2002) (Zhang Q&#xD;
      et al. 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a recent work from Amran et al performed in a mouse model of D+HUS highlighted a&#xD;
      protective effect of azithromycin on the occurrence of neurological inhibition of&#xD;
      inflammatory mechanism induced by Shigatoxin in the vascular endothelium brain and neurons&#xD;
      (Amran et al. 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the human being, the German outbreak of D+HUS in O104H4 helped highlight the importance of&#xD;
      an early treatment with azithromycin on the eradication of carriage of the bacteria as well&#xD;
      as the eradication of Stx in stool (Nitschke et al. 2012). In addition, preliminary data from&#xD;
      a retrospective study of D+HUS in Robert Debré hospital showed a lower incidence of severe&#xD;
      digestive tract impairment in patients with D+HUS who received treatment with azithromycin&#xD;
      compared to the control group (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of a prospective study on patients with D+HUS treated with azithromycin will be&#xD;
      to prove its beneficial effects on renal, hematological, digestive tract and neurological&#xD;
      impairment seen in D+HUS and to reduce the potential sequelae.&#xD;
