      This study evaluates the effect of a training intervention after thoracoabdominal resection&#xD;
      of the oesophagus. Half of the patients scheduled for thoracoabdominal oesophagus surgery&#xD;
      were randomized to an intervention group while the other half a control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that thoracoabdominal oesophageal resection for cancer is a procedure with&#xD;
      high risks for complications. Earlier trials have shown that respiratory restrictions persist&#xD;
      after the operation as well as lower physical function, range of motion in the rib-cage and&#xD;
      limitations in activities in daily living. There are, however, only two clinical studies that&#xD;
      evaluate postoperative breathing exercises and none evaluating any other rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In other types of extensive surgery that may affect mobility with trauma to muscles and bone&#xD;
      structures in the thorax and thoracic spinal column, there is strong evidence that speaks for&#xD;
      an active rehabilitation approach in favour of a less active one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention evaluated was a rehabilitation program including exercises to restore lung&#xD;
      function, range of motion in the thoracic spine and shoulders and strength exercises for the&#xD;
      back extensors, shoulders and legs.&#xD;
