      Patients will be randomized to receive diclophenac sodium or placebo two hours before&#xD;
      diagnostic colonoscopy. Intensity of pain as measured on a 10-point Likert scale will be the&#xD;
      primary outcome. Patients will be followed until hospital discharge, an average of 10 days.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the effectiveness of oral diclophenac sodium on the quality of colonoscopy and&#xD;
      pain control during diagnostic colonoscopy in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: there is no statistically significant difference between diclophenac sodium&#xD;
      and placebo on parameters of quality of colonoscopy and pain control in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      undergoing diagnostic colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of total mean pain index by 2 points (as measured on a 10-point Likert scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of pain in the subgroup of patients with high pain index (defined as patients that&#xD;
      report 7-10, inclusive, on a 10-point Likert scale) Reduction of pain in the subgroup of&#xD;
      patients with moderate pain index (defined as patients that report 3-6, inclusive, on a&#xD;
      10-point Likert scale) Proportion of patients that are willing to repeat the procedure, if&#xD;
      necessary Need for sedation or analgesia during colonoscopy Time to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total complications (as recorded from the beginning of colonoscopy to hospital discharge)&#xD;
      Colonoscopy-related complications (defined as any vasovagal, hypoxemic, bleeding or&#xD;
      perforation event) Total mortality (defined as any lethal outcome from the beginning of&#xD;
      colonoscopy to hospital discharge) Patients will be followed until hospital discharge, an&#xD;
      average of 10 days. Sample size calculation To be able to detect a 2-point difference in mean&#xD;
      pain index with standard deviation of 3, with alpha=0.05 and power=0.80, the investigators&#xD;
      calculated the required total sample size of 72 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods This is a single-center, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind&#xD;
      clinical trial of diclophenac sodium versus placebo for colonoscopy. The investigators plan&#xD;
      to enroll a total of 72 patients that are referred for diagnostic colonoscopy for any&#xD;
      indication during their hospital stay. The trial will be conducted in a university hospital&#xD;
      in Croatia (University hospital Rijeka, Department of Gastroenterology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: all inpatients that are referred for colonoscopy for any indication&#xD;
      during their hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      refusal to sign informed consent age &lt;18 years pregnancy lactation allergy to any&#xD;
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs patients that have taken any nonsteroidal&#xD;
      antiinflammatory drug in the previous seven days before randomization (except acetylsalicylic&#xD;
      acid in doses up to 300 mg/day) patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy (except&#xD;
      acetylsalicylic acid in doses up to 300 mg/day) history of gastric or duodenal ulcer history&#xD;
      of GI bleeding or perforation history of or active inflammatory bowel disease severe liver&#xD;
      disease (defined as presence of history of ascites and/or esophageal varices) severe kidney&#xD;
      disease (defined as glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 ml/min) history of myocardial infarction&#xD;
      or cerebrovascular disease history of peripheral arterial disease congestive heart failure&#xD;
      (NYHA III-IV) history of systemic lupus erythematosus Protocol: Patients referred for&#xD;
      colonoscopy during their hospital stay will be informed about the trial protocol and possible&#xD;
      risks and adverse events, after which they will be offered to accept to be included in the&#xD;
      trial by signing the informed consent form. Upon inclusion, patients will be randomized by&#xD;
      computer random number sequence generation to either 'Group 1' (diclophenac) or 'Group 2'&#xD;
      (placebo). Patient allocation will be withheld from all participants in the trial and stored&#xD;
      at a secure central location.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive peroral diclophenac sodium in the dose of 100mg (two 50mg tablets), two&#xD;
      hours before colonoscopy, on an empty stomach with one glass of water. Diclophenac sodium&#xD;
      tablets will be provided by the hospital pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive two tablets of placebo that are same shape, size, colour and in no other&#xD;
      way different from diclophenac tablets. Placebo will be provided by a collaborating pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients, attending physicians, endoscopists, data assessors and data analysts will all&#xD;
      be blinded to the patients' allocation. Allocation will be kept at a central location and&#xD;
      will be known only to the person who will randomize patients. On the day of colonoscopy all&#xD;
      patients will be accompanied with a trial form where all relevant data will be entered. First&#xD;
      part will be filled by the attending physician who refers the patient to colonoscopy, the&#xD;
      second part will be filled by the endoscopist and the third part will be filled by trial&#xD;
      associates on the day of discharge (appendix 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be assessed before randomization by history and physical examination,&#xD;
      laboratory tests that will include complete blood count, plasma glucose, urea, creatinine,&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate, Na, K, total and direct bilirubin, aspartate transaminase,&#xD;
      alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, albumin, serum protein&#xD;
      electrophoresis, coagulogram (prothrombin time and INR), urinalysis, chest radiogram and&#xD;
      electrocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The investigators will use two-tailed Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test for&#xD;
      means and two-tailed Fisher's exact test for proportions. The investigators will use&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves for construction of time to discharge graphs and Mann-Whitney U test for&#xD;
      statistical difference between the curves. The investigators will perform multivariate&#xD;
      analysis of different characteristics to test for effect of those characteristics on the&#xD;
      result of mean pain index as reported by the patient. If any of the characteristic shows&#xD;
      statistically significant effect, the investigators will perform univariate analysis on those&#xD;
      covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financial support This trial will be supported from the Department of Gastroenterology's own&#xD;
      resources, considering that the drug investigated is routinely administered to patients with&#xD;
      indications.&#xD;
