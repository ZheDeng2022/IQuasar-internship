  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to compare the use of ultrasound and electrophysiologic techniques to target&#xD;
      muscles for the treatment of spasticity and focal dystonia of the limbs. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the use of two ways of locating the muscle for botulinum toxin (BoNT)&#xD;
      injection for the treatment of focal hand dystonia and upper limb spasticity.&#xD;
      Electrophysiologic guidance, using electrical stimulation, and ultrasound are the standard&#xD;
      ways of locating muscles during a treatment of BoNT injection.&#xD;

      This is a study to investigate the use of two targeting techniques for botulinum toxin (BoNT)&#xD;
      injection for the treatment of focal hand dystonia and upper limb spasticity:&#xD;
      Electrophysiologic guidance, using electrical stimulation, and ultrasound. Subjects will be&#xD;
      selected from the clinical programs of both Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health who are already receiving onabotulinum toxin A injections&#xD;
      clinically. The study will consist of four visits. Visit one consists of screening subjects&#xD;
      who will then be consented and randomized to one of the two treatment techniques for their&#xD;
      ona-BoNT injection: 1) Electrophysiologic guidance using electrical stimulation or 2)&#xD;
      ultrasound. Visit 2 will occur at week 4 where the subjects will return for a follow up visit&#xD;
      to have blinded evaluator measurements of efficacy and strength and capture safety data.&#xD;
      Visit 3 will be at week 12 when subjects will cross over and have the alternate treatment&#xD;
      technique during their ona-BoNT injection. Visit 4 will occur at week 16 as the final&#xD;
      assessment where subjects will have measurements of efficacy and strength and capture safety&#xD;
      data by the blinded evaluator.&#xD;
