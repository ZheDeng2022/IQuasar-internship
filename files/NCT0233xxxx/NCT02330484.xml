  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on patients' HbA1c improvement, this study aims to establish an incentive strategy to&#xD;
      family physicians and patients respectively to evaluate the affect on the adherence to&#xD;
      medication among patients with type2 diabetes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First step: In this study, the investigators will conduct an open-label controlled randomized&#xD;
      cluster trial to enroll 400 eligible and voluntary patients with type 2 diabetes from the&#xD;
      community. 16 physicians will be involved in this study for patient management. Each&#xD;
      physician will care at least 20 patients as a random unit which will be divided into 4 groups&#xD;
      for baseline assessment including demographic characteristics, diabetes diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment, complication, biochemical indexes and self-management. The involved patients and&#xD;
      physicians will receive related training. The patients will sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second step: This study aims to give incentives to physicians or patients or both the&#xD;
      physicians and patients based on HbA1c improvement. All the patients will sign the informed&#xD;
      consent form. Regarding to the control group, health courses and community management will be&#xD;
      given as usual. the investigators will evaluate the condition of patients' medication&#xD;
      adherence after giving the incentives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third step: MEMS will be used in the intervention to monitoring patients' medication&#xD;
      adherence. As a monitoring instrument, MEMS (Aardex, Zurich, Switzerland) is a plastic&#xD;
      container with a spring-loaded device in the cap. Each time the bottles is opened for at&#xD;
      least 3 seconds, the time and date of opening are recorded and saved. Based on the research&#xD;
      data and the HbA1c improvement, this study will analyze the other factors which affect the&#xD;
      patients' adherence to medication. Meanwhile, the investigators will collect patients'&#xD;
      information such as blood pressure, biochemical index, complications related to diabetes,&#xD;
      life quality, self-management, life style, health behavior, medications, health expenditure&#xD;
      so as to evaluate the affect of incentive strategy on the adherence to medication among&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be ended in 12 months, endpoint measurement indicators are listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The study will be ended in 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient's drop out of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stopping taking oral hypoglycemic drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The diabetic condition worsen, needs surgery or hospitalization treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Frequency of severe hypoglycemia or other complications that can not continue the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Death of the patient&#xD;
