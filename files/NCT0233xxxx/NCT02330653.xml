  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of this phase I/II, randomized, placebo controlled study are the assessment&#xD;
      of safety and tolerability of universal donor FMT compared to placebo in pediatric and young&#xD;
      adult subjects (ages 5 years through 30 years) with active ulcerative colitis (UC) or active&#xD;
      Crohn's colitis (CD) who have failed, are intolerant to, or have refused traditional&#xD;
      first-line maintenance therapy. Secondary objectives include the identification biomarkers in&#xD;
      both donor and recipient that may confer a clinical response and to establish whether or not&#xD;
      ongoing FMT maintenance therapy is required for maintenance of clinical benefit in pediatric&#xD;
      UC or pediatric CD.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center pilot, phase I/II, randomized, prospective, double-blinded,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study of FMT in the treatment of active pediatric UC and active pediatric&#xD;
      CD. The primary aim is to assess safety and feasibility of a weekly FMT maintenance therapy.&#xD;
      A total of 10 patients with active UC (as defined by PUCAI score of &gt;9) and 10 patients with&#xD;
      active CD (as defined by PDCAI score of &gt;10) will be enrolled and randomized to receive FMT&#xD;
      or placebo-FMT (study treatment) by retention enema for 1 week and oral, frozen encapsulated&#xD;
      inocula/placebo for 7 weeks. After the first 8 weeks, subjects on FMT who improve or subjects&#xD;
      on placebo-FMT who do not improve will have the option to continue on study treatment or&#xD;
      switch to open-label FMT until the end of 4 months from study initiation. Subjects will be&#xD;
      followed by telephone to assess adverse events for a total of 6 months after their last FMT&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial subset of no more than 20 subjects will be enrolled in the study (will be limited&#xD;
      to only those patients 12 years of age or older and to those who have mild to moderate&#xD;
      disease) and randomized to receive FMT or placebo. We'd expect short term adverse events to&#xD;
      occur within 7 days of FMT administration. Individual subject safety data will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the PI to assess whether FMT appears to be safe in the subject before continuing the subject&#xD;
      towards open-label use of FMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient metadata and stool samples will be collected at key time points. The patient-reported&#xD;
      metadata collection technique will allow for numerous clinical correlations to be parsed out&#xD;
      using the random forest machine learning capabilities of synthetic learning in microbial&#xD;
      ecology (SLiME) to identify taxonomic features associated with important clinical parameters.&#xD;
