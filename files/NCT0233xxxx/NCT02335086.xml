      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the association between stable and unstable coronary artery disease (CAD)&#xD;
           with markers of DNA damage and repair,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the association between plaque morphology as assessed by frequency-domain&#xD;
           optical coherence tomography (FD-OCT) and markers of DNA damage and repair in order to&#xD;
           identify potential markers of plaque instability,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the association between markers of DNA damage and repair and major adverse&#xD;
           cardiovascular events defined as death, MI and unplanned percutaneous or surgical&#xD;
           revascularization,&#xD;

      Hypotheses ----------------&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesise that defective DNA damage response is an important aetiological factor in the&#xD;
      development of CAD, underlying CAD severity and development. If this hypothesis is true, then&#xD;
      we predict that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There is differential expression of markers of DNA damage and repair in patients with&#xD;
           stable angina, a model of stable CAD, and patients with non ST-elevation myocardial&#xD;
           infarction (NSTEMI), a model of unstable CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Differential expression of markers of DNA damage and repair correlate with plaque&#xD;
           morphology and stability as defined by FD-OCT,&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Markers of DNA damage and repair can serve as distinguishing markers of stable and&#xD;
           unstable CAD,&#xD;
&#xD;
           Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
           ------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
           Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients presenting with stable angina undergoing percutaneous revascularization at&#xD;
           Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals Foundation Trust will be prospectively enrolled. Data&#xD;
           regarding demographic, clinical, and procedural characteristics of patients will be&#xD;
           collected by the Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals Foundation Trust research personnel&#xD;
           and entered into a secure, encrypted, dedicated database.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pre-defined clinical and angiographic inclusion and exclusion criteria will be met as&#xD;
           per the DECODE study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FD-OCT (St. Jude Medical ILUMIEN OCT System) will be performed in all the three main&#xD;
           epicardial coronary arteries prior to target vessel PCI after administration of glyceryl&#xD;
           trinitrate. Data will be acquired in a designated, secure compute and sent to a corelab&#xD;
           for analysis. Quantitative measurements will include endoluminal area, plaque area, as&#xD;
           well as plaque parameters including thin- capped fibroatheromas (TCFA), fibrous tissue,&#xD;
           lipid core and calcium. TCFA will be defined by lipid-rich plaque with cap thickness ≤&#xD;
           65μm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Culprit lesions will be defined according to electrocardiographic criteria (ST-segment&#xD;
           shift or T-wave inversion) and angiographic appearances (luminal irregularities&#xD;
           consistent with lesion ulceration, filling defect(s) consistent with thrombus, or point&#xD;
           of angiographic maximal stenosis) in patients with NSTEMI and angiographic stenosis ≥&#xD;
           70% in patients with stable angina not responding to at least two anti-anginal&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood will be drawn immediately prior to percutaneous coronary intervention. In addition&#xD;
           to routine haematological and biochemical parameters (complete blood count, white cell&#xD;
           count, platelet count, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium, cholesterol, glucose,&#xD;
           troponine I, creatinine phosphokinase, liver function tests and clotting screen) one&#xD;
           additional blood sample will be taken and separated into plasma and serum.&#xD;
           Polymorphonuclear leukocytes will be used for measurements of DNA damage and repair&#xD;
           proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical follow-up will occur at 30-day and 12-month from enrolment by telephone&#xD;
           interview and clinic visits. A repeat blood sample will be taken for analysis of DNA&#xD;
           damage and repair proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DNA Damage&#xD;
&#xD;
           ------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
           DNA damage will be analysed by measuring DNA strand breaks in cell pellets using the&#xD;
           comet assay. Serum oxidised purines will also be measured using an ELISA based assay.&#xD;
           The transcriptional activation of DNA damage proteins will be assessed by real time PCR.&#xD;
           For this, RNA will be isolated using a Roche High Pure Isolation kit. The RT2 First&#xD;
           Strand Kit (SABioscience) will be utilised for reverse transcription of total RNA.&#xD;
           Automated PCR will be set up and the raw data will be normalised using the average cycle&#xD;
           threshold (ct) value of four housekeeping genes (B2M, RPL13A, GAPDH, and ACTB).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Whether differential gene expression leads to differential protein expression will be&#xD;
           determined by Western blotting. Moreover, the phosphorylation status of DNA damage&#xD;
           proteins will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DNA repair activity will also be assessed for several DNA repair enzymes important for&#xD;
           the repair of base damage generated by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. DNA repair&#xD;
           activity will be measured by using in-vitro oligonucleotide-based cleavage assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Finally, we will then correlate measures of DNA damage and repair with patient&#xD;
           presentation (stable angina vs. NSTEMI), MACE, and FD-OCT derived parameters including&#xD;
           the number of TCFA, plaque volume and percentage of plaque components.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           -------------------------&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS institute Inc., Cary,&#xD;
           North Carolina). Biomarker parameters will be tested for an association with patient&#xD;
           presentation (stable angina vs. NSTEMI) and MACE using a log-rank test. OCT derived&#xD;
           parameters will be tested for an association with biomarkers using univariate Cox&#xD;
           proportional hazard regression. Parameters with a significance level of ≤0.1 on&#xD;
           univariate analysis will undergo multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. A p&#xD;
           value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recruitment period is anticipated to last 15-18 months, with data collation and&#xD;
           interpretation throughout recruitment and analysis anticipated to be complete by 24&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
