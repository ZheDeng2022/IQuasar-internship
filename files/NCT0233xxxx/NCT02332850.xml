    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose of isatuximab when given together&#xD;
      with carfilzomib with or without dexamethasone and lenalidomide in treating patients with&#xD;
      multiple myeloma that has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or has not&#xD;
      respond to previous treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      isatuximab, may induce changes in the body's immune system and may interfere with the ability&#xD;
      of tumor cells to grow and spread. Carfilzomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      dexamethasone and lenalidomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Giving isatuximab and carfilzomib with or without dexamethasone and lenalidomide&#xD;
      may be a better treatment for patients with multiple myeloma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR650984 in combination with&#xD;
      standard carfilzomib (Arm 1 is complete).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: To determine the safety AND efficacy (objective response rate (ORR)) of adding&#xD;
      SAR650984 10mg/kg weekly x 4 doses then every other week in combination with weekly&#xD;
      carfilzomib (70 mg/m2) and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.&#xD;
      ORR will be defined using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) uniform response&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the safety, including immunogenicity (ARM 1), of SAR650984 in combination&#xD;
           with carfilzomib, in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma after receiving 1+&#xD;
           prior lines of therapy. The severity, frequency and incidence of all toxicities will be&#xD;
           assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of SAR650984 and carfilzomib when administered in&#xD;
           ARM 1 (completed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the relationship between clinical (adverse event and/or tumor response)&#xD;
           effects and pharmacologic parameters (PK/PD), and/or biologic (correlative laboratory)&#xD;
           results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To estimate the activity (ORR) using the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)&#xD;
           defined response criteria of SAR650984 plus carfilzomib (ARM 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe progression free survival (PFS), time to disease progression (TTP) and&#xD;
           1-year overall survival (OS) in patients treated with SAR650984 plus standard&#xD;
           carfilzomib, and SAR650984 with weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPANSION COHORTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To further evaluate safety, PK, PD and to estimate the anti-tumor activity (response&#xD;
      rates) using IMWG defined response criteria of study therapy (SAR650984 plus carfilzomib).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1 and 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To describe progression-free survival, 1-year OS, and TTP in patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory myeloma treated with these combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of isatuximab. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1,&#xD;
      and orally (PO) or IV on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Patients receive isatuximab IV&#xD;
      over 4-6 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles,&#xD;
      and carfilzomib IV over 10 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for up to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients may continue treatment after 8 cycles if clinical benefit is present at the&#xD;
      investigator's discretion (carfilzomib may be switched to days 1, 2, 15, and 16 per&#xD;
      investigator discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV or PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, isatuximab IV over&#xD;
      4-6 hours on 1, 8, 15, and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles, and&#xD;
      carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 60 days and then&#xD;
      every 3 months for up to 3 years.&#xD;
