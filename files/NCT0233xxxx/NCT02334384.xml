    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to demonstrate safety and tolerability of a novel antimicrobial&#xD;
      wound dressing, Antimicrobial TheraGauze. The unique microvillous structure of TheraGauze is&#xD;
      ideal for the development of an antimicrobial wound dressing. In vitro testing has&#xD;
      demonstrated that tobramycin is an ideal compound for integration into TheraGauze providing&#xD;
      excellent killing of MRSA and other organisms that commonly cause wound infections.&#xD;
      Tobramycin is a non-absorbable aminoglycoside that will be contained solely to the wound bed&#xD;
      preventing any potential for systemic toxicities. In vivo testing of tobramycin-impregnated&#xD;
      TheraGauze used in mouse wound models has confirmed no systemic absorption of tobramycin as&#xD;
      demonstrated by undetectable blood levels. TheraGauze has been commercially available for 10&#xD;
      years as a wound dressing. Tobramycin has been available for many years as a topical&#xD;
      antibiotic as eyedrops and as an inhaled antibiotic for patients with cystic fibrosis,&#xD;
      demonstrating excellent safety in both cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase I trial will test Antimicrobial TheraGauze (ATG) as an antimicrobial wound packing&#xD;
      for patients presenting to an Emergency Department with skin abscess (furunculosis). Subjects&#xD;
      will either receive ATG or standard of care wound packing (cotton wick or iodoform wick).&#xD;
      Subjects will return to the ED in 2 days for wound packing removal and reassessment of their&#xD;
      wounds and symptomatology. A final followup will be performed by a physician and study&#xD;
      coordinator in an outpatient setting on day 7.&#xD;

      Primary Endpoint. The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety of and identify&#xD;
      side effects of TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing compared with standard of care management&#xD;
      for cutaneous abscesses requiring incision and drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a proof-of-concept, prospective, randomized clinical trial for safety of&#xD;
      TheraGauze-tobramycin in adult subjects who present to Emergency Department settings for care&#xD;
      of skin abscess requiring incision and drainage. A control, standard of care, arm is included&#xD;
      to provide some data with respect to the side effect profile of current furunculosis&#xD;
      management for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two arms are proposed for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incision + TheraGauze+tobramycin packing (no systemic antibiotics)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incision + standard iodoform wick or plain cotton wick packing (± p.o. antibiotics)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-microbial TheraGauze (saturated tobramycin solution at 3 mg/ml) will be packed into the&#xD;
      drained wounds of the subjects in the study arm. The control arm will receive current&#xD;
      standard of care wound packing with a choice of iodoform wick or plain cotton wick, based on&#xD;
      the preference of the ED physician. After packing, the wound excess TheraGauze or wick will&#xD;
      be cut away. The ED physicians have the option to prescribe an oral antibiotic or not,&#xD;
      according to their preference. The following oral antibiotic choices are available for&#xD;
      subjects in the control arm only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bactrim (TMP/SMX)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vibramycin (doxycycline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cleocin (clindamycin) Antibiotics will be purchased by subjects from their local&#xD;
           pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraGauze-tobramycin. We plan to use TheraGauze saturated with tobramycin at 3 mg/ml, the&#xD;
      same dose used in the ophthalmic preparations (e.g., Tobrex) and much smaller concentration&#xD;
      than the concentration in tobramycin bone cement (50 - 60 mg/ml). The decades of efficacy and&#xD;
      safety with tobramycin eye drops justifies using the 3 mg/ml concentration. In vitro testing&#xD;
      with TheraGauze/tobramycin (0.9 mg/ml), shows excellent broad-spectrum antibacterial activity&#xD;
      against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including all clinical MRSA&#xD;
      strains tested (Echague, Hair et al. 2010). We expect that &gt;85% of the cutaneous abscesses&#xD;
      (furuncles) will be infected with MRSA (Demos, McLeod et al. 2012). Additionally, tobramycin&#xD;
      is a non-absorbable antibiotic and thus an excellent choice for achieving local antimicrobial&#xD;
      activity with minimal risk of systemic side effects, which it is why it is the most common&#xD;
      antibiotic bone cement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing will be placed after the incision and drainage of the&#xD;
      abscess and removed at the day 3 (± 1) follow up visit in the Emergency Department.&#xD;
      TheraGauze/tobramycin will only be placed in the wound a single time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects from the Hampton Roads region of southeastern Virginia will be recruited from the&#xD;
      hospital emergency department site staffed by EVMS physicians at Sentara Norfolk General&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We anticipate screening 200 patients in order to enroll and randomize 100 subjects. Subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized 2:1 to the TheraGauze+tobramycin or iodoform wick/ plain cotton wick,&#xD;
      respectively. We anticipate 50 participants completing the study. The 50% retention rate is&#xD;
      typical for emergency department populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Retention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who present to Emergency Department setting for care of skin abscess requiring&#xD;
      incision and drainage will be approached by on-site Study Coordinators for enrollment. Upon&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria and willingness to participate, subjects/LARs will provide&#xD;
      informed consent. A medical information release will be obtained from the subject so that&#xD;
      outcomes data can be collected related to additional unscheduled visits or adverse events&#xD;
      cared for outside the emergency department setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women and minority participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults up to 65 years of age will be enrolled regardless of gender and minority status as&#xD;
      long as they are fluent in English.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study subject identification number will be assigned. Subjects will then be sequentially&#xD;
      randomized to one of two treatment arms upon enrollment in a 2:1 ratio, using a prepared&#xD;
      list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatments&#xD;

           for routine Gram stain, bacterial culture and susceptibility testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If patient is to receive iodoform wick/plain cotton wick then the care provider will&#xD;
           have the option of prescribing a p.o. antibiotic, as is frequently done in these&#xD;
           clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 - Day 3 ±1: (ED)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects' wound status will be evaluated. The following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bacterial burden in wound bed - Wound culture performed using quantitative methods for&#xD;
           culturing wound base (Gardner, Frantz et al. 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Schedule follow-up visit in EVMS Clinical Research Unit in 5 ± 1 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 - Day 7 ± 1: (EVMS Clinical Research Unit):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up on subjects' wound status. The following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wound assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan The data will be analyzed using SAS 9.4 software. All statistical&#xD;
      tests will be two-sided with a significance level of 0.05. Patients who withdraw while on&#xD;
      treatment will be included in the data analysis for each time point before withdrawal.&#xD;
      Baseline and follow-up measurements of safety, tolerability, numbers of pathogenic bacteria,&#xD;
      wound infection persistence or worsening, and gross effects on the rate of wound healing will&#xD;
      be summarized using descriptive statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation,&#xD;
      interquartile range, frequency, and percentage where appropriate. Normality assessments for&#xD;
      the continuous variables will be completed using Shapiro-Wilk tests and stem-and-leaf plots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of equivalence between the TheraGauze + tobramycin and standard iodoform wick packing&#xD;
      treatment groups will establish statistical significance if the two-sided 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval for the difference falls within the limits (-δ, δ), where δ is the margin of&#xD;
      clinically accepted difference. This analysis will determine whether the outcomes are&#xD;
      equivalent between the TheraGauze+tobramycin and standard iodoform wick packing treatment&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection of Human Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research involves the recruitment, enrollment and management of human subjects&#xD;
      participating in research. Adults up to age 65 years at enrollment are being studied because&#xD;
      adults commonly suffer skin abscesses. Study oversight by the investigators will assure&#xD;
      compliance with all regulatory requirements for Institutional Review Board approval prior to&#xD;
      the initiation of the study, and will obtain annual re-approval for study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks and benefits to subjects and procedures to mitigate risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical/Medical&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Serious/Adverse Events - will be reported to EVMS IRB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confidentiality/PHI o All PHI will be maintained in an encrypted and password protected&#xD;
           electronic file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Subjects must be seen by a physician or an appropriately trained&#xD;
      healthcare professional at every study visit, and the evaluation must be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events. An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject&#xD;
      administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal&#xD;
      relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign&#xD;
      (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally&#xD;
      associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the&#xD;
      medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Causality Assessment. For all AEs, the PI will provide an assessment of causal relationship&#xD;
      to the study drug. Causal relationship must be assessed by answering the following question:&#xD;
      Is there a reasonable possibility the study drug caused the event?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Reaction. An AE assessed as likely having a causal relationship with the intervention&#xD;
      (i.e., TheraGauze/tobramycin). Specifically focusing on local-toxicity adverse reactions, we&#xD;
      will evaluate for increasing redness, increasing pain or a new rash at the site of the packed&#xD;
      wound. Increasing pain or redness could be due to progression of the infection&#xD;
      (cellulitis/abscess) or local toxicity or reaction to the tobramycin in the&#xD;
      TheraGauze/tobramycin packing. This will be assessed by an Investigator. Increasing purulent&#xD;
      drainage or the identification of new areas of fluctuance requiring an additional incision&#xD;
      and drainage procedure will be assessed as progression of the infection rather than evidence&#xD;
      of local toxicity or reaction to the tobramycin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity Assessment. The PI must provide an assessment of the severity of each AE by&#xD;
      recording a severity rating, which will be assessed as described below. Severity, which is a&#xD;
      description of the intensity of manifestation of the AE, is distinct from seriousness, which&#xD;
      implies a subject outcome or AE-required treatment measure associated with a threat to life&#xD;
      or functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines for Adverse Event Severity Assessments Mild. Minor awareness of signs or symptoms&#xD;
      that are easily tolerated without specific medical intervention. Moderate. Discomfort that&#xD;
      interferes with usual activities and may require minimal intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe. Significant signs or symptoms that are incapacitating with an inability to work or&#xD;
      perform routine activities and/or that require medical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Events. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: is life&#xD;
      threatening, requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization,&#xD;
      results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Important medical events may be&#xD;
      considered serious when, based on appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the&#xD;
      subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes&#xD;
      listed in this definition. If a serious and unexpected AE occurs for which there is evidence&#xD;
      suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event the event must be reported as&#xD;
      a serious and unexpected suspected adverse reaction. SAE will be reported to the local IRB&#xD;
      and the FDA within 5 calendar days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules. Adverse reactions, including local-toxicity adverse reactions, or SAEs will&#xD;
      lead to immediate return to the SNGH ED for assessment and removal of the&#xD;
      TheraGauze/tobramycin wound packing. The investigator will assess the need for treatment of&#xD;
      the adverse reaction or SAE and, if necessary, either treat or refer for treatment, as&#xD;
      appropriate. The subject will continue with their scheduled follow up: Day 3 visit in the ED,&#xD;
      Day 6 phone follow up, and Day7 visit in the EVMS Clinical Research Unit.&#xD;
