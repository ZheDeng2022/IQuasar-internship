      This study proposes to assess whether a modified Antiretroviral Treatment Access Study&#xD;
      intervention, proved to be effective in the U.S. and based on the nurse case management&#xD;
      approach, can impact the enrollment in HIV care of recently detected HIV-positive patients in&#xD;
      specialized health care clinics in three regions in Ukraine, using the existing local&#xD;
      infrastructure. The proposed study addresses a significant public health issue of non-/late&#xD;
      enrollment of HIV-positive persons in HIV care and treatment.&#xD;

      Individual, parallel, two-arm, 1:1 RCT. The study participants were recruited between October&#xD;
      2015 and December 2016 at 9 clinics located in Dnipropetrovsk region (Dnipropetrovsk Regional&#xD;
      Narcological Dispensary; Dnipropetrovsk Regional Dermatovenereologic Dispensary; Kryvyi Rih&#xD;
      Infectious Disease Clinic No. 1), Mykolaiv region (Mykolaiv Regional Narcological Dispensary;&#xD;
      Mykolaiv Regional Dermatovenereologic Dispensary; Mykolaiv Regional Infectious Disease&#xD;
      Clinic), and Odesa region (Odesa Regional Dermatovenereologic Dispensary; Odesa Infectious&#xD;
      Disease Clinic; Odesa Regional Center of Mental Health). These three types of clinical sites&#xD;
      (treating addiction, sexually transmitted infections [STIs], and infectious diseases [IDs])&#xD;
      were located in the regions with the highest HIV prevalence in Ukraine, but were not&#xD;
      co-located with HIV care facilities. Participants assigned to the standard of care (SOC) arm&#xD;
      and the MARTAS arm received referrals to the local AIDS Centers (Dnipropetrovsk Regional AIDS&#xD;
      Center, Kryvyi Rih AIDS Center, Mykolaiv Regional Center for Palliative Care and Integrated&#xD;
      Services (former Mykolaiv AIDS Center), and Odesa Regional AIDS Center) or their departments&#xD;
      (&quot;Trust&quot; offices) located in each study region. Investigators affiliated with The Ukrainian&#xD;
      Institute on Public Health Policy (UIPHP) were responsible for all aspects of study design,&#xD;
      management, and analysis.&#xD;
