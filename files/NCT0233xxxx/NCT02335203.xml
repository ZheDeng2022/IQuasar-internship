      Objective: To compare pre- and post-treatment glandular cellularity in women with complex&#xD;
      atypical hyperplasia or grade 1-2 endometrial adenocarcinoma who are treated with&#xD;
      intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) versus placebo injection prior to&#xD;
      hysterectomy. The secondary objective is to compare various other outcomes including&#xD;
      molecular, histologic, pathologic and clinical endpoints in women treated with DMPA versus&#xD;
      placebo prior to hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Patients treated with DMPA will have significantly decreased glandular&#xD;
      cellularity post-treatment when compared to patients treated with placebo injection. Patients&#xD;
      treated with DMPA will exhibit previously described changes in molecular tumor marker&#xD;
      expression patterns and other characteristic histologic changes. Patients treated with DMPA&#xD;
      will report less bothersome vaginal bleeding prior to surgery when compared to patients&#xD;
      treated with placebo injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Double blinded randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: Women being treated at the Women and Infants Program in Women's Oncology who have&#xD;
      a biopsy-proven diagnosis of complex atypical hyperplasia or grade 1-2 endometrial&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma with disease clinically confined to the uterus, with a plan to undergo&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND/INTRODUCTION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, multiple modalities of progesterone analogues have been investigated and&#xD;
      successfully used to treat complex atypical hyperplasia (CAH) and stage 1A, grade 1&#xD;
      endometrial adenocarcinoma. This body of research focuses on pre-menopausal women with the&#xD;
      primary goal of preserving fertility by delaying or avoiding surgical therapy. Across&#xD;
      multiple case series, the average time to complete response (CR: typically defined as the&#xD;
      absence of hyperplasia, atypia or neoplasia on a follow-up biopsy specimen) is 5-9 months&#xD;
      with 60-70% overall complete response rate and approximately 50% durable complete response&#xD;
      rate (defined as complete histologic response with no relapse of disease over the period of&#xD;
      time studied). There have been no published randomized controlled trials to evaluate which&#xD;
      modality of progesterone therapy is the most efficacious, and there is no consistent&#xD;
      retrospective data to suggest superiority of any given progesterone analogue or method of&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple pathologic predictors of complete response to progesterone therapy have been&#xD;
      identified. In a recent study, Gunderson found that an interval decrease in glandular&#xD;
      cellularity on endometrial biopsy after treatment with progesterone therapy was an&#xD;
      independent predictor of future complete response. While both decreased mitotic index and&#xD;
      decreased glandular cellularity were significant findings in this study, only decreased&#xD;
      glandular cellularity was independently predictive of future complete response on&#xD;
      multivariate analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this growing body of evidence supporting the safety and feasibility of progesterone&#xD;
      analogues as medical management for CAH and early-stage endometrial adenocarcinoma, little is&#xD;
      known about its potential role as neoadjuvant chemotherapy. A recent multicenter&#xD;
      collaborative trial coordinated by the Gynecologic Oncology Group evaluated the effect of&#xD;
      400mg intramuscular medroxyprogesterone acetate administered 21-24 days prior to scheduled&#xD;
      hysterectomy for endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus. Upon comparing patients'&#xD;
      post-hysterectomy slides to pre-treatment slides, this study found a partial histologic&#xD;
      response rate of 63% among the 59 study subjects using pre-defined criteria modified from&#xD;
      Wheeler 2007. A down-regulation of progesterone receptor, progesterone receptor beta, Bcl-2,&#xD;
      and Ki-67 was also noted in post-hysterectomy specimens, with lower pre-treatment levels of&#xD;
      Ki-67 being significantly associated with increased likelihood of histologic response. No&#xD;
      clinical data such as patient characteristics, final tumor stage, or specific surgical&#xD;
      procedure (ie lymphadenectomy) were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of progesterone analogues as neoadjuvant chemotherapy is especially important&#xD;
      given recent data showing that delayed time to surgery for endometrial cancer (defined as&#xD;
      greater 12 weeks) was significantly associated with decreased 5-year survival rates. The same&#xD;
      group of authors also found, alarmingly, that wait times in their province of Ontario, Canada&#xD;
      more than doubled between 2000 and 2009. In this study, more than half of hysterectomies&#xD;
      performed for endometrial cancer were not within the recommended limit of six weeks from&#xD;
      diagnosis to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the above data, treatment with a progesterone analogue prior to hysterectomy can&#xD;
      be viewed as either a maintenance therapy or a temporizing measure, with the primary goal of&#xD;
      preventing disease progression in those awaiting surgery rather than curative intent. This&#xD;
      potential application of progesterone analogues may be particularly relevant in settings&#xD;
      where women can expect a long wait time prior to definitive surgical management. There is&#xD;
      empiric basis for this usage of DMPA, as one particularly intriguing study found that in vivo&#xD;
      injection of MPA elevated the expression of a known metastasis suppressor gene in a murine&#xD;
      breast cancer model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is a safe, well-studied and well-tolerated method of&#xD;
      contraception that has been used globally since the 1960s. It does not require refrigeration&#xD;
      and can be safely administered in remote settings with poor infrastructure, as demonstrated&#xD;
      by its widespread use as contraception in the developing world. A history of using DMPA for&#xD;
      contraception is believed by the World Health Organization to reduce the prevalence of&#xD;
      endometrial cancer by 80%, with a protective period of at least 8 years after cessation.&#xD;
      Apart from GOG 211, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate's role as a potential neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapeutic agent has not been studied in isolation; rather it has been grouped with&#xD;
      other progesterone analogues in retrospective trials of fertility-sparing agents for CAH or&#xD;
      endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is used in the 150mg dose for contraception, however it has&#xD;
      been used at higher doses of up to 1000mg weekly for several months in the setting of&#xD;
      malignancy with no short-term side effects noted in these studies. More recently, a single&#xD;
      dose of 400mg DMPA was compared to venlafaxine to treat women with bothersome hot flashes; at&#xD;
      6 weeks DMPA was superior at reducing hot flashes and associated with less short-term&#xD;
      toxicity. GOG 211 used a one-time 400mg dose for maximal progestin effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA COLLECTION/INTERPRETATION: All data will be collected by the research assistant or study&#xD;
      physician. The study drug will be administered during the patient's first visit at the&#xD;
      Program in Women's Oncology after the decision is made to undergo hysterectomy for complex&#xD;
      atypical hyperplasia or grade 1 or grade 2 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. Prior to injection&#xD;
      with the study drug, a questionnaire will be completed by the patient to identify any factors&#xD;
      that may influence histologic response to depot medroxyprogesterone acetate as well as&#xD;
      baseline demographic information: age, race/ethnicity, education level, gravidity and parity,&#xD;
      height/weight and body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, polycystic ovarian syndrome,&#xD;
      history of irregular menses, history of oral contraceptive use, menopausal status, age at&#xD;
      menarche, family history of uterine or ovarian malignancy, family history of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, smoking history, personal history of malignancy and type, history of abnormal uterine&#xD;
      bleeding and duration, recent weight loss, recent symptoms of abdominal distension, and&#xD;
      recent symptoms of nausea/vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FACILITIES: All patient related aspects of the study will transpire in the Women and Infants&#xD;
      Program in Women's Oncology outpatient clinic, Women and Infants Hospital inpatient&#xD;
      facilities, and the Women and Infants Pathology Department. Data will initially be collected&#xD;
      at the patient's first visit with the Women and Infants Program in Women's Oncology when the&#xD;
      decision is made to proceed with hysterectomy. Data will be collected one more time while the&#xD;
      patient is being prepared for surgery as an inpatient at Women and Infants Hospital. Biopsy&#xD;
      specimens and hysterectomy specimens will be reviewed by two study pathologists at the Women&#xD;
      and Infants Hospital Department of Pathology. Data processing and interpretation will take&#xD;
      place at Women and Infants Hospital in conjunction with the Division of Research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONFIDENTIALITY: The patients enrolled in the study will be asked permission for access to&#xD;
      their medical records. To ensure patient confidentiality, all forms will be marked with only&#xD;
      the participant ID number, with a key containing identifying information kept separately in a&#xD;
      locked cabinet that only research personnel will have access to. Electronic data will be&#xD;
      stored on the Care New England file server, a file server that is located in a physically&#xD;
      secured data center. Access to Care New England data center is card-controlled and all access&#xD;
      to the server room is recorded. Care New England computer account management policies and&#xD;
      practices ensure that computer access to the study database will be limited to key study&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY: Study personnel will meet to review safety issues and logistics at 25%, 50% and 75%&#xD;
      recruitment. Adverse events and complications will be recorded on the data collection sheet&#xD;
      which will be reviewed by the PI on a rolling basis. Any adverse events associated with depot&#xD;
      medroxyprogesterone acetate use will be reported to the IRB and the FDA by the PI or&#xD;
      co-investigators. Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate is a routinely used medication for birth&#xD;
      control and as medical treatment for uterine fibroids and early endometrial cancer.&#xD;
