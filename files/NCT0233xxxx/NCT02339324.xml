    <textblock>
      This study plans to to estimate the safety profile of the combination biotherapy regimen&#xD;
      consisting of standard-dose interferon alpha-2b (HDI) and anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody,&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab, for the neoadjuvant therapy of locally/regionally advanced/recurrent melanoma.&#xD;
      Also, the objectives of this trial include the evaluation of prognostic and predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers, radiologic preoperative response rate, pathologic response rate, progression free&#xD;
      survival and overall survival. Up to 30 evaluable patients will be accrued.&#xD;

      The study has 3 main phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab I.V. infusion every 3-4 weeks for 2 doses (starting first week of HDI&#xD;
      administration) given concurrently with HDI I.V. x 5 consecutive days out of 7 every week for&#xD;
      4 weeks, followed by S.C. every other day 3 times each week for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is followed by definitive surgery (week 6-8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase (following recovery from surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab I.V. infusion every 3 weeks given concurrently with HDI S.C. QOD TIW every week&#xD;
      for 46 additional weeks.&#xD;
