    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple&#xD;
      doses of BI 655064 following weekly subcutaneous injection for 4 weeks in healthy Chinese&#xD;
      male volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is the exploratory evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of multiple doses of BI 655064 following weekly subcutaneous injection for 4&#xD;
      weeks in healthy Chinese male volunteers.&#xD;

&#xD;
         22. Subjects who in the investigator's judgement are perceived as having an excessive risk&#xD;

             thromboembolism, including but not limited to deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary&#xD;
             embolism, cortical sinus thrombosis, coronary and cerebrovascular events, and&#xD;
             peripheral arterial insufficiency.&#xD;
