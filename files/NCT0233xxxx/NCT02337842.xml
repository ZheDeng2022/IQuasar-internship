  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is phase I, double blind, placebo-controlled safety and infectivity study of&#xD;
      experimental human Norovirus genogroup GII.4 administered to healthy adults 18-49 years of&#xD;
      age. Subjects susceptible to the human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain. The challenge study&#xD;
      will be conducted in 2-3 cohorts of approximately 20 subjects each.Subjects will remain in&#xD;
      the inpatient facility for at least four days following challenge and assessed daily for&#xD;
      clinical and virologic evidence of norovirus infection. The primary objectives are to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the norovirus GII.4 (CIN-1; 031693) challenge stock&#xD;
      and to determine a safe and optimal challenge dose of Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock&#xD;
      norovirus to achieve illness in &gt; /=50% of subjects. Illness is defined as: diarrhea (&gt;3&#xD;
      loose or liquid stools or &gt;300 gm of loose or liquid stool /24h), and/or vomiting during the&#xD;
      inpatient period, in a participant with evidence of infection.&#xD;

      This is phase I, double blind, placebo-controlled safety and infectivity study of&#xD;
      experimental human Norovirus genogroup GII.4 administered to healthy adults 18-49 years of&#xD;
      age. The unblinded pharmacist will assign treatments. Subjects will be admitted to an&#xD;
      inpatient nursing unit, challenged with live GII.4 Norovirus strain by oral administration,&#xD;
      remain in the unit for at least 4 days following challenge and then followed for&#xD;
      post-challenge safety and efficacy with multiple clinical assessments and collection of blood&#xD;
      and stool specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects susceptible to the human norovirus GII.4 challenge strain, CIN-1 (i.e. presence of a&#xD;
      functional FUT-2 gene), regardless of ABO blood type, will be housed in the Cincinnati Center&#xD;
      for Clinical Research (CCCR) inpatient facility and challenged orally with different doses of&#xD;
      the virus. The challenge study will be conducted in 2-3 cohorts of approximately 20 subjects&#xD;
      each, with the initial cohort receiving 103 RT-PCR units or placebo (9 &quot;challenge&quot; and 1&#xD;
      &quot;placebo&quot; per 10 subjects). Based on the illness rate of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in the&#xD;
      initial cohort, the second cohort will be enrolled to receive a challenge dose based on the&#xD;
      results of the previous studies. Additional cohorts may be necessary. Illness is defined as&#xD;
      infection accompanied by vomiting and/or diarrhea during the inpatient stay.Two to three&#xD;
      additional subjects per cohort will serve as alternates in the event that any of the study&#xD;
      subjects are unavailable or become ineligible at the time of the inpatient study.Subjects&#xD;
      will remain in the inpatient facility for at least four days following challenge and assessed&#xD;
      daily for clinical and virologic evidence of norovirus infection. Subjects will return to the&#xD;
      investigational site for evaluation on Day 6 (6-8 days) and about 15 (14-16 days) and 30 days&#xD;
      (28-35 days), and 45 (40-45 days), and (55-65) post challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the norovirus GII.4&#xD;
      (CIN-1; 031693) challenge stock and to determine a safe and optimal challenge dose of&#xD;
      Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock norovirus to achieve illness in &gt; /=50% of subjects. Illness&#xD;
      is defined as: diarrhea (&gt;3 loose or liquid stools or &gt;300 gm of loose or liquid stool /24h),&#xD;
      and/or vomiting during the inpatient period, in a participant with evidence of infection. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to determine the rate of infection in study participants by; virus&#xD;
      detection in stool by Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific qRT-PCR and anti- Norovirus&#xD;
      GII.4 Challenge Stock serum IgG by ELISA (&gt; /=4 fold rise from baseline to Day 30), determine&#xD;
      the quantity and duration of virus shedding in stool by qRT-PCR, conduct Time-to-event&#xD;
      analysis to estimate the median time to cessation of shedding using Kaplan-Meier methods,&#xD;
      determine the modified Vesikari score as a measure of gastroenteritis severity, determine&#xD;
      Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific immunoglobulin titers by ELISA before and after the&#xD;
      challenge; Serum IgA and IgG, Serum Blockade IgG, Salivary IgA, determine the effect of&#xD;
      preexisting Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific Immunoglobulin in serum and saliva on&#xD;
      the rate of infection, determine total and Norovirus GII.4 Challenge Stock-specific IgA- and&#xD;
      IgG-Secreting Cells in circulation by ELISpot assay.&#xD;
