      CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND THE BENEFIT OF BYPASSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considerable advances in medicine, cardiovascular diseases remain the number one&#xD;
      cause of death globally. In industrialized countries, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death, consequence of myocardial infarction (MI). Artificial - or natural -&#xD;
      bypasses exert a protective effect by providing an alternative source of blood flow to a&#xD;
      myocardial territory potentially affected by an acute coronary occlusion. Coronary&#xD;
      collaterals represent pre-existing inter-arterial anastomoses and as such are the natural&#xD;
      counter-part of surgically created bypasses. In patients with chronic CAD, sufficient&#xD;
      coronary collaterals have been shown to confer a significant benefits in terms of overall&#xD;
      mortality and cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXTRACARDIAC-TO-CORONARY COLLATERAL SUPPLY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly, coronary collaterals are implicitly understood to exist between coronary artery&#xD;
      branches. However, the structural existence of coronary collaterals with an extracardiac&#xD;
      connection has been confirmed by anatomical investigations. Pathophysiologically and with&#xD;
      regard to a potential for arteriogenic stimulation, the connections from the internal mammary&#xD;
      arteries, are of special interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published work the investigators have investigated the effect of temporary&#xD;
      balloon occlusion of the distal IMA on coronary collateral function. There were equivocal&#xD;
      findings for the left circumflex coronary artery: CFI was increased by ipsilateral IMA&#xD;
      occlusion, but the level of myocardial ischemia was unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MYOCARDIAL STEAL VIA INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the investigators' previous study, the coronary occlusion with simultaneous distal IMA&#xD;
      occlusion was always performed first as a conservative measure against false-positive&#xD;
      detection of internal-mammary-to-coronary artery connections. Repetitive coronary occlusions&#xD;
      per se result in higher collateral flow by collateral recruitment and reduced ischemia by&#xD;
      ischemic preconditioning and augmented collateral function. Conversely, the sensitivity of&#xD;
      the employed method was reduced and might have contributed to the equivocal findings in case&#xD;
      of the left circumflex artery. Moreover, the hypothesize d mechanism of localized pressure&#xD;
      augmentation was not investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to further characterize the prevalence and function of natural ipsilateral&#xD;
      IMA-to-coronary connections, as well as to investigate the hemodynamic mechanisms of coronary&#xD;
      collateral function augmentation by distal IMA occlusion. In the investigators' last study,&#xD;
      the increased coronary collateral function in response to manipulation of a potential&#xD;
      coronary collateral donor (in this case, the IMA) was taken as indirect evidence for the&#xD;
      existence of IMA-to-coronary-artery connections. Thus, the employed distal IMA occlusion&#xD;
      served as a positive stimulus. Conceptually, additional evaluation with a negative stimulus&#xD;
      could heighten the discriminatory power of the investigation. This could be in the form of a&#xD;
      hyperemic stimulus affecting the collateral donor, ie in analogy to myocardial or coronary&#xD;
      steal (ie, a reduction in coronary collateral supply to a collateral recipient).&#xD;

      CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE AND THE BENEFIT OF BYPASSES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite considerable advances in medicine, cardiovascular diseases remain the number one&#xD;
      cause of death globally. In industrialized countries, coronary artery disease (CAD) is the&#xD;
      leading cause of death, consequence of myocardial infarction (MI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with acute coronary syndrome, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been&#xD;
      shown to improve outcomes.2 However, in stable CAD, PCI has not been demonstrated to reduce&#xD;
      the incidence of myocardial infarction or death. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was&#xD;
      superior to PCI in patients with diabetes and multivessel coronary artery disease. CABG&#xD;
      significantly reduced rates of death and myocardial infarction compared to PCI, but with a&#xD;
      higher rate of stroke. Furthermore, in patients with advanced coronary artery disease, rates&#xD;
      of myocardial infarction were more than 60% lower with CABG compared to PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptually, the benefit of CABG over PCI is not surprising as PCI targets significant&#xD;
      coronary lesions thought to be responsible for causing ischemia. However, the deleterious&#xD;
      effects of atherosclerosis are not typically preceded by significant luminal vascular&#xD;
      narrowing. The vulnerable plaque eventually becoming the culprit plaque (causing myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or sudden cardiac death) is typically relatively nonstenotic. Furthermore, due to&#xD;
      being multifocal and widespread, plaque vulnerability is not a target for, nor amenable to&#xD;
      PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conversely, artificial - or natural - bypasses exert a protective effect by providing an&#xD;
      alternative source of blood flow to a myocardial territory potentially affected by an acute&#xD;
      coronary occlusion. Coronary collaterals represent pre-existing inter-arterial anastomoses&#xD;
      and as such are the natural counter-part of surgically created bypasses. In patients with&#xD;
      chronic CAD, sufficient coronary collaterals have been shown to confer a significant benefits&#xD;
      in terms of overall mortality and cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXTRACARDIAC-TO-CORONARY COLLATERAL SUPPLY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly, coronary collaterals are implicitly understood to exist between coronary artery&#xD;
      branches. However, the structural existence of coronary collaterals with an extracardiac&#xD;
      connection has been confirmed by anatomical investigations. Pathophysiologically and with&#xD;
      regard to a potential for arteriogenic stimulation, the connections from the internal mammary&#xD;
      arteries, are of special interest. Indeed, before the advent of coronary bypass surgery,&#xD;
      several clinical studies examined the usefulness of a minimally invasive surgery to augment&#xD;
      collateral flow to the heart via these internal-mammary-to-coronary-artery connections in&#xD;
      patients with angina pectoris. The performed distal bilateral ligation of the internal&#xD;
      mammary arteries was thought to improve flow over naturally pre-existing anastomoses between&#xD;
      the internal mammary arteries and the coronary circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recently published work the investigators have investigated the effect of temporary&#xD;
      balloon occlusion of the distal IMA on coronary collateral function. 180 pairs of&#xD;
      measurements were performed in 120 patients electively referred for coronary angiography.&#xD;
      Levels of collateral function and myocardial ischemia were determined during two coronary&#xD;
      balloon occlusions, the first with, the second without distal IMA balloon occlusion. Coronary&#xD;
      collateral function, determined by collateral flow index (CFI) was consistently increased by&#xD;
      ipsilateral, but not contralateral IMA balloon occlusion in the left anterior descending&#xD;
      (LAD) coronary artery and the right coronary artery (RCA). Furthermore, these findings were&#xD;
      corroborated by the observed reduction in ischemia as assessed by the sensitive tool of&#xD;
      intracoronary ECG. However, there were equivocal findings for the left circumflex coronary&#xD;
      artery: CFI was increased by ipsilateral IMA occlusion, but the level of myocardial ischemia&#xD;
      was unchanged.&#xD;
