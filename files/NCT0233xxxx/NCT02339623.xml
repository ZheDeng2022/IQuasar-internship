      If we could prove that three -dimensional ultrasound measurement of fetal adrenal gland&#xD;
      volume can accurately predict the likelihood of preterm birth in patients having symptoms and&#xD;
      signs of PTL , we would be able to use it as a valuable component for assessment and early&#xD;
      management of high risk pregnant women for PTB which can be positively reflected on the risk&#xD;
      of neonatal morbidity and mortality in those patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth ( PTB) is one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      (Goldenberg et al., 2008) Early PTB (≤ 34 weeks' gestation) carries a 7-fold increased risk&#xD;
      of Neonatal death . Following PTB, survivors can experience significant long term cognitive,&#xD;
      behavioral, emotional, sensory, and motor deficits. Hence, there is growing interest in the&#xD;
      identification of women who are at Risk for spontaneous PTB. Many biophysical and biochemical&#xD;
      markers have been discovered to identify those women who are at risk for spontaneous PTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Honest et al., 2009)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, none of the various maternal and fetal biomarkers such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      cytokines, CRH, C-reactive protein, fetal fibronectin ,…. etc. are sufficiently sensitive or&#xD;
      specific to be used alone or in combination to help decrease the rate of preterm births.&#xD;
      (Ozhan et al., 2007) Obviously, there's a need for an accurate method with high sensitivity&#xD;
      and specificity for prediction of preterm labor. So that an appropriate management or&#xD;
      referral to a higher center can be done to women likely to have PTB. Whereas unnecessary&#xD;
      tocolytic therapy can be avoided in women who are unlikely to have PTB. (Rengaraj et al.,&#xD;
      2009) Convincing data have shown that 2-dimensional (2D) ultrasound measurement of cervical&#xD;
      length (CL) can identify women at risk for PTB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, CL is now widely used in clinical practice for risk estimation. ( Crane et al.,&#xD;
      1997) However, as understanding of the mechanisms of preterm labor (PTL) have evolved,&#xD;
      obstetricians have learned that, in some women, cervical shortening is a phenomenon that&#xD;
      carries no increased risk for prematurity. Therefore, the search for early and accurate&#xD;
      markers that distinguish between physiologic processes and abnormal activation of the labor&#xD;
      cascade has been ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature has suggested that activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis&#xD;
      play a crucial rule in commencement of labor. (Norwitz et al, 1999) A previous study&#xD;
      demonstrated that three -dimensional ultrasound measurement of fetal adrenal gland volume&#xD;
      (AGV) may identify women at risk for impending PTB. (Turan et al, 2007) In a more recent&#xD;
      study receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curve analysis revealed that three -dimensional&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement of (AGV) was superior to two-dimensional ultrasound measurement of&#xD;
      (AGV) for anticipation of PTB within 7 days of the scan. (Turan et al, 2012) The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to investigate the utility of 3D fetal adrenal gland volume measurement in the early&#xD;
      prediction of PTB and to determine whether these measurements could be combined with 2D&#xD;
      ultrasound cervical assessment to improve the early prediction of PTB.&#xD;
