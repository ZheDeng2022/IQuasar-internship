  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of a single infusion of tocilizumab versus placebo, administered in addition to standard&#xD;
      premedications (antipyretic, antihistamine, and corticosteroid) prior to the first infusion&#xD;
      of obinutuzumab administered in combination with oral chlorambucil to participants with&#xD;
      previously untreated B-CLL who have comorbidities. All eligible participants will be treated&#xD;
      with a total of 6 cycles of obinutuzumab + chlorambucil (cycle length = 28 days).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    This study was terminated early because premedication with tocilizumab was unlikely to reduce&#xD;
    the risk of IRR.&#xD;
