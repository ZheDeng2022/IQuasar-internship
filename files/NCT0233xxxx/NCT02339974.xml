      The goal of this study is to determine the short term safety (&lt;30 days) and efficacy (6&#xD;
      months) of the heterotopic implantation of the Edwards-Sapien XT valve in the inferior vena&#xD;
      cava for the treatment of severe tricuspid regurgitation in patients who are inoperable or at&#xD;
      a very high surgical risk for tricuspid valve replacement.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be at least 21 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient must have severe, symptomatic (ACC/AHA Stage D symptoms) tricuspid&#xD;
             regurgitation (TR) as assessed by 2D echocardiogram with evidence of peripheral and&#xD;
             central venous congestion (specifically lower extremity edema and abdominal ascites&#xD;
             requiring diuretics.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient must be evaluated by a &quot;heart team&quot; of physicians including an&#xD;
             interventional cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, heart failure specialist, and&#xD;
             imaging specialist, and presented for review at a local multi-disciplinary conference.&#xD;
             By consensus, the heart team must agree (and verify in the case review process) that&#xD;
             valve implantation will likely benefit the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The heart team must agree that medical factors preclude operation, based on a&#xD;
             conclusion that the probability of death or serious, irreversible morbidity exceeds&#xD;
             the probability of meaningful improvement. Also, other factors which may increase the&#xD;
             patients perceived surgical risk for inclusion in the trial will be clearly delineated&#xD;
             if they are present. These include, but are not limited to the following as defined by&#xD;
             VARC 2: Frailty, Hostile chest, porcelain aorta, IMA or other critical conduit&#xD;
             crossing the midline or adherent to the posterior table of sternum, severe right&#xD;
             ventricular (RV) dysfunction. The surgeons' consultation notes shall specify the&#xD;
             medical or anatomic factors leading to that conclusion. At least one of the cardiac&#xD;
             surgeon assessors must have interviewed and examined the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The study patient provides informed consent and agrees to comply with all required&#xD;
             post-procedure follow-up visits, including annual visits up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Heart Team assessment of operability (the heart team considers the patient to be a&#xD;
             good surgical candidate).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of an acute myocardial infarction ≤ 1 month (30 days) before the intended&#xD;
             treatment [defined as: Q wave MI, or non-Q wave MI with total CK elevation of CK-MB ≥&#xD;
             twice normal in the presence of MB elevation and/or troponin level elevation (WHO&#xD;
             definition)].&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Untreated, severe, left sided valvular heart disease including mitral regurgitation or&#xD;
             stenosis, and aortic regurgitation or stenosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Mean pulmonary artery pressures ≥40mmHG and PVR &gt;4 woods units as assessed by right&#xD;
             heart catheterization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any therapeutic invasive cardiac procedure resulting in a permanent implant that is&#xD;
             performed within 30 days of the index procedure. Examples of permanent implant would&#xD;
             include any new heart valve. Implantation of a permanent pacemaker is excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with planned concomitant surgical or transcatheter ablation for Atrial&#xD;
             Fibrillation.&#xD;

             50,000 cell/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Hemodynamic or respiratory instability requiring inotropic support, mechanical&#xD;
             ventilation or mechanical heart assistance within 30 days of screening evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Need for emergency surgery for any reason.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus or vegetation.&#xD;
&#xD;

         14. Recent CVA clinically confirmed (by neurologist) or neuroimaging confirmed stroke or&#xD;
             transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 6 months (180 days) of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Estimated life expectancy &lt; 1 year from conditions other than TR.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of tricuspid regurgitation&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Currently participating in another investigational cardiac device study or any other&#xD;
             clinical trial, including drugs or biologics. Note: Trials requiring extended&#xD;
             follow-up for products that were investigational, but have since become commercially&#xD;
             available, are not considered investigational trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Active bacterial endocarditis within 6 months (180 days) of procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Patients with signs or symptoms of SVC syndrome, or hepatic cirrhosis not felt due to&#xD;
             passive congestion from TR.&#xD;
