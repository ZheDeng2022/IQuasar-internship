  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anal fistulas are the main etiology of perianal abscesses and suppurations. They are common&#xD;
      and generally associated with pain, anal incontinence, impaired quality of life and work&#xD;
      incapacity. The therapeutic management of this disease has a double objective: heal the&#xD;
      suppuration and preserve the sphincter function. Each year, anal fistulas affect 1 in 10 000&#xD;
      in the normal population, with a difference in prevalence between men and women (1.23 per 10&#xD;
      000 men and 0.56 per 10 000 women). The average age of the patients was 40 years (Simpson et&#xD;
      al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In about 80% of cases, anal fistulas are secondary to an infection of Hermann and Desfosses'&#xD;
      anal glands (cryptogenic or cryptoglandular). Infection of the anal gland can result in an&#xD;
      abscess between the internal and external sphincters, which in turn can spread to other parts&#xD;
      of the perianal region. The infection can follow many directions from this point in the&#xD;
      intersphincteric plan. When the pus reaches the skin, the fistula is formed. Anal fistula&#xD;
      therefore has always an intraductal origin, cryptic, with a primary port at this level, and&#xD;
      the disregard of which causes the recurrence of the fistula; and usually a secondary port in&#xD;
      the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fistulas are usually divided into two groups. The first group contains fistulas called&#xD;
      &quot;simple&quot;, which are intersphincteric fistulas or trans-sphincteric involving only the lower&#xD;
      third of the sphincter complex. Fistulas usually didn't affect any muscle. The second group&#xD;
      contains fistulas called &quot;complex&quot;. These are intersphincteric, trans-sphincteric, or even&#xD;
      suprasphincteric, extrasphincteric fistulas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, the treatment of choice was to open the fistula (fistulotomy), but this&#xD;
      procedure was associated with a risk of incontinence, the consequences could be potentially&#xD;
      devastating. Other surgical treatments include setons, fibrin glue, collagen plugs and&#xD;
      advancement flap technique to cover internal opening of the fistula. The success of these&#xD;
      therapies remains variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advancement flap technique remains a strategy of choice in the treatment of anal fistulas&#xD;
      and particularly in the case of complex fistulas. The success rate of the advancement flap&#xD;
      technique remains variable across studies but a recent meta-analysis finds a success rate of&#xD;
      around 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new technique for closing anal fistula is currently in development with the use of a&#xD;
      closure clip nitinol (OTSC® Proctology Laboratory: OVESCO and French Distributor: Life&#xD;
      Partners). This new technique has been validated in a porcine model of anal fistula, ensuring&#xD;
      the safety of the device. A first case was published in a patient with complex anal fistula&#xD;
      (high trans-sphincteric). After erosion fistula tract with a special brush, a nitinol clip&#xD;
      (OTSC® Proctology) was deposited on the internal opening of the fistula. Eight months after&#xD;
      surgery, the fistula was healed and the clip was removed by cutting with special pliers. This&#xD;
      technique is currently being broadcast and dozens of patients were treated with this clip&#xD;
      without any further scientific validation of the process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, this innovative technique of the closure clip has not yet been assessed in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial. It is therefore essential to carry out a prospective evaluation&#xD;
      in order to determine the effectiveness and safety of this new device in the case of complex&#xD;
      anal fistulas.&#xD;

      After validation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients included in this&#xD;
      clinical trial will be randomized between the two arms of the study for the closure of the&#xD;
      anal fistula:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: advancement flap technique Experimental group: closure clip (OTSC®&#xD;
           Proctology Laboratory: OVESCO and French Distributor: Life Partners)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up of the patients will be performed until 1 year after the intervention.&#xD;
