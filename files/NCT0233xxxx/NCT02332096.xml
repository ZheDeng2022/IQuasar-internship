    <textblock>
      Diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      therapy has been shown to decrease arrhythmia recurrence in patients with AF following&#xD;
      ablation. However, patients with AF undergoing ablation are not routinely screened for sleep&#xD;
      apnea, despite an estimated sleep apnea prevalence of 25% in the general population, and&#xD;
      perhaps higher among patients with AF. Home sleep testing is frequently used for evaluation&#xD;
      of sleep apnea.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Sleep Medicine considers atrial fibrillation (AF) to be high risk for&#xD;
      sleep disordered breathing, and recommends that those with AF be evaluated for sleep apnea in&#xD;
      its clinical guidelines. However, this has not yet become standard practice. The primary&#xD;
      reasons for this are that sleep apnea remains under-suspected and under-diagnosed by&#xD;
      electrophysiology physicians treating patients with AF, overnight sleep studies are&#xD;
      cumbersome and are frequently associated with patient discomfort and high cost, and a&#xD;
      mechanism for coordinating sleep apnea screening and treatment referral has not been&#xD;
      established in electrophysiology clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard for the diagnosis of sleep apnea is overnight polysomnography, typically&#xD;
      conducted in a sleep laboratory, which can be costly and cumbersome for patients. Home sleep&#xD;
      studies are FDA-approved for the diagnosis of sleep apnea and offer patients the opportunity&#xD;
      to be assessed in a more natural sleep environment, and often in a more timely manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated that diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea reduces the risk of&#xD;
      arrhythmia recurrence following AF ablation to a level comparable to those without sleep&#xD;
      apnea. The goal of this study is to examine the feasibility of screening all patients&#xD;
      undergoing AF ablation for sleep apnea, and to refer those patients with sleep apnea for&#xD;
      evaluation and treatment by a sleep specialist.&#xD;
