  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) for advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma; pembrolizumab will be given as monotherapy to participants who have had&#xD;
      previous treatment or who are treatment-naïve; pembrolizumab will also be evaluated as&#xD;
      combination therapy with cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) or (Japan only) capecitabine in&#xD;
      treatment-naïve participants. The primary study hypothesis is that pembrolizumab will provide&#xD;
      a clinically meaningful Overall Response Rate (ORR).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will have 3 cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 will run simultaneously; Cohort 3 will start&#xD;
      when biomarker assay validation is complete. In Cohort 1, participants who have received at&#xD;
      least two prior therapies for their advanced disease will receive monotherapy with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. In Cohort 2, participants who have not received any previous therapy for their&#xD;
      disease will receive pembrolizumab in combination with cisplatin and 5-FU or (Japan only)&#xD;
      capecitabine. In Cohort 3, participants who have not received any previous therapy and who&#xD;
      have programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive tumors will receive pembrolizumab&#xD;
      monotherapy.&#xD;
