      There is an urgent need to develop hand transplant programs in this country. To this end, the&#xD;
      University of Michigan Hospital and Health Systems is developing such an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      program. The Transplant Center would like to track the patient experience from pre-operative&#xD;
      care through surgery and post-operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information will be collected from the patient medical records, including:&#xD;
      Pre-operative screening, demographics, medications; Surgical information ; Post-operative&#xD;
      inpatient and out-patient care; laboratory and other test results; physical assessments,&#xD;
      psychological assessments and quality of life assessments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Vascularized composite tissue allotransplantation (VCA) is the transplantation of multiple&#xD;
      tissues containing skin, muscle, bone, joint, cartilage, nerve, tendon, vessels. VCA is&#xD;
      useful for functional restoration of patients with severe tissue loss as encountered with&#xD;
      massive burns, traumatic injuries, congenital anomalies, and following tumor resection. VCA,&#xD;
      and specifically hand transplantation, combines the technical excellence of hand&#xD;
      surgery/microsurgery with the complex multidisciplinary care rendered in modern solid organ&#xD;
      transplantation. The technical demands of hand transplantation, enhanced donor antigen burden&#xD;
      of the hand allograft, and complex psychosocial issues pertaining to the recipient account&#xD;
      for much of the discrepancy between these 2 related fields.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed information will be collected from the patient medical records, including:&#xD;
      Pre-operative screening, demographics, medications; surgical information ; post-operative&#xD;
      inpatient and out-patient care; laboratory and other test results; physical assessments,&#xD;
      psychological assessments and quality of life assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific outcomes will include allograft survival, allograft rejection, allograft&#xD;
      functionality, and quality of life from transplant through 5 years.&#xD;
