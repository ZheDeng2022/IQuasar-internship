      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five - 15 % of patients with concussion continue to experience impairing physical, cognitive&#xD;
      and emotional symptoms longer than 3 months post-injury. Currently, no standardised treatment&#xD;
      is available for patients with persistent post-concussional symptoms (PCS) and systematic&#xD;
      treatment studies remain limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop an early intervention programme based on principles from&#xD;
           cognitive-behavioural therapy and graded exercise for young patients with PCS lasting&#xD;
           more than 3 months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention on PCS in a randomised, controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 15 - 30 years diagnosed with concussion at hospitals in Central Denmark Region&#xD;
      will be screened for persistent symptoms two months post-injury. Those with impairing&#xD;
      symptoms will be invited to participate in a randomised controlled trial comparing the early&#xD;
      intervention programme with enhanced usual care. We expect to include 120 patients from&#xD;
      2015-2016. Treatment will be interdisciplinary and will begin approximately 3 - 5 months&#xD;
      after concussion. All patients will complete self-report measures at baseline and 3, 6 and 15&#xD;
      months after randomisation. The primary outcome is severity of PCS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Concussion is an important public health concern. Debilitating and persistent&#xD;
      post-concussional symptoms are associated with considerable long-term sickness and markedly&#xD;
      reduced health-related quality of life in industrialized countries. In Denmark, approximately&#xD;
      25000 people are diagnosed with concussion each year. Although complete resolution of typical&#xD;
      post-concussional symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and fatigue normally occur within the&#xD;
      first days or weeks after a concussion, a significant proportion corresponding to five to15 %&#xD;
      of patients continue to experience symptoms longer than 3 months post-injury. These patients&#xD;
      are at risk of long-term sickness, reduced health-related quality of life as well as&#xD;
      permanently reduced working ability, which is particularly disastrous for adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults. Currently, no standardised treatment is available for patients with persistent&#xD;
      post-concussional symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aetiology of persistent post-concussional symptoms is only partly elicited, and no&#xD;
      consensus exists whether post-concussional symptoms constitute a true syndrome linked to&#xD;
      neurobiological disturbances caused by accident or head trauma. Nevertheless, the term&#xD;
      post-concussional syndrome is widely used to describe a set of persistent somatic and&#xD;
      emotional symptoms often observed in concussed individuals. We use the abbreviation 'PCS' as&#xD;
      a purely descriptive term for post-concussional symptoms. The literature suggest, that PCS&#xD;
      are best understood in a complex, multifactorial model, where both biological and&#xD;
      psychological factors contribute to persistent symptoms and associated disability. Moreover,&#xD;
      PCS overlap considerably with symptoms of other trauma-related conditions such as&#xD;
      whiplash-associated disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder. On this background, a&#xD;
      number of trials have tested the effect of various psychosocial interventions, including&#xD;
      cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), on persistent PCS. Although preliminary, there is some&#xD;
      promising evidence that treatment based on the cognitive-behavioural model may be effective&#xD;
      in treating PCS and prevent permanent suffering and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the cognitive - behavioural mechanisms that have been found to play an important role&#xD;
      in the maintenance of PCS are unhelpful illness perceptions, maladaptive coping strategies&#xD;
      and all-or-nothing behaviour. The all-or-nothing behaviour refers to a behavioural response,&#xD;
      where patients overdo things when they believe symptoms are abating and then spend prolonged&#xD;
      periods recovering when symptoms reappear. Other patients report a gradual restriction of&#xD;
      activity over time, because they fear worsening of symptoms. A promising avenue for treatment&#xD;
      seems to be focusing on making sustainable, gradual increases in levels of activity (in&#xD;
      intensity and / or duration) over time, and to avoid extreme oscillations. This is often&#xD;
      referred to as Graded Exercise Therapy (GET), a treatment that can effectively reduce&#xD;
      impairment and suffering in chronic fatigue and persistent pain and that can be provided by&#xD;
      physiotherapists and hence delivered in a primary care or municipality setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, systematic studies of psychosocial interventions for patients with persistent PCS&#xD;
      remain limited. A recent review concludes that more rigorous, large-scale randomised&#xD;
      controlled trials (RCT) evaluating the effectiveness of CBT for persistent PCS are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop an early intervention programme based on CBT and GET principles for young&#xD;
           patients aged 15 - 30 years with PCS lasting more than three months, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to evaluate the efficacy of this intervention programme on PCS in a RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses Primary hypothesis Patients in the early intervention group will 6 months after&#xD;
      randomisation report a statistically and clinically significantly greater reduction of&#xD;
      post-concussional symptoms compared to patients who receive enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients in the early intervention group will 6 months after randomisation report a&#xD;
           statistically and clinically significantly higher health related quality of life and&#xD;
           overall daily functioning compared to patients who receive enhanced usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients in the early intervention group will during the 12 months after treatment have&#xD;
           less consumption of health care (based on register-data) and less illness-related&#xD;
           absence from school or work (based on self-reported data) compared to patients, who&#xD;
           receive enhanced usual care.&#xD;
