  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial wherein subjects with breast cancer will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive either 20 mg oral melatonin or placebo the night before their first RT,&#xD;
      nightly throughout their RT, and for an additional 2 weeks following the completion of their&#xD;
      RT. After informed consent is obtained from eligible subjects, they will then be&#xD;
      electronically randomized on a 1:1 ratio to melatonin treatment or placebo. The subjects will&#xD;
      be stratified according to treatment duration (less than 3 weeks; equal to or greater than 3&#xD;
      weeks) and prior chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either melatonin or placebo. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      20-mg oral melatonin or placebo the night before their first RT treatment, each night&#xD;
      throughout the course of RT treatment, and for 2 weeks following the completion of RT.&#xD;
      Patients with localized breast cancer will receive standard-of-care RT as determined by the&#xD;
      treating physician. The RT regimens include: (1) 1 week of APBI; (2) 3-4 weeks of an&#xD;
      accelerated hypofractionation RT schedule; and (3) 6-8 weeks of a standard RT schedule. No&#xD;
      additional concomitant medication or supportive care guidelines are required for this study.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive daily melatonin or placebo beginning the night before their course of&#xD;
      RT and for an additional 2-week period that extends beyond the conclusion of their RT.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a Study Diary to record their use of study medication. Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 60 days after removal from the study treatment or until death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. Patients removed from the study treatment for unacceptable AEs will be followed&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
