      The purpose of this study is to determine whether immersive virtual reality technology is an&#xD;
      effective intervention tool for HIV Prevention with adolescents.&#xD;

      The project will examine the use of immersive virtual reality technology as an intervention&#xD;
      tool for HIV Prevention with adolescents. Adolescents are at risk for contracting HIV while&#xD;
      affect dysregulation is common among adolescents. Research has demonstrated connections&#xD;
      between poor affect management abilities and risky sexual behavior among adolescents. This&#xD;
      research suggests that the ability to regulate one's emotions is key to avoiding risk&#xD;
      behaviors and that adolescents are at greater risk for poor affect management skills.&#xD;
      Fortunately, these skills can be taught via teaching and modeling, making them an excellent&#xD;
      target for intervention, which has previously been approached through role-playing. Immersive&#xD;
      virtual reality offers many advantages over group based role-plays, used in HIV prevention&#xD;
      interventions for adolescents, in its ability to simulate real-world environments and enhance&#xD;
      the impact of HIV prevention interventions. Immersive virtual reality is a promising&#xD;
      technology for giving teens the opportunity to experientially practice using effective affect&#xD;
      regulation skills in a highly realistic, context specific virtual environment. Additional&#xD;
      benefits of this technology will likely be increased engagement and retention in HIV&#xD;
      prevention interventions among young adolescents. The overall aims of Phase I and Phase II of&#xD;
      this project are to develop, refine, and evaluate virtual reality environments for&#xD;
      adolescents targeting affect management. In Phase I, the research team developed and refined&#xD;
      an immersive virtual environment that elicited affect in a high-risk situation. The final&#xD;
      immersive virtual reality environments (completed in Phase II) can be used by health&#xD;
      promotion interventionists in conjunction with an HIV prevention intervention manual as a&#xD;
      means to elicit affect and provide adolescents with a &quot;real world&quot; environment in which to&#xD;
      practice emotion regulation skills related to substance use and HIV prevention. These aims&#xD;
      will be achieved through the collaboration of researchers at Rhode Island Hospital/Brown and&#xD;
      Virtually Better, Inc. a small business that specializes in creating immersive virtual&#xD;
      reality environments for treatment, education, and training purposes. This tool will&#xD;
      represent a significant advance in the way in which affect regulation skills are practiced&#xD;
      and honed, currently achieved via role plays or imaginal exposure, by increasing the salience&#xD;
      of cues used to elicit affect, thus making it highly marketable to interventionists, schools,&#xD;
      and mental health clinicians.&#xD;
