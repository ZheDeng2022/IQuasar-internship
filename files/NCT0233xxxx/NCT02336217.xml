  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the utility of an algorithm for better&#xD;
      glucose control in diabetic patients communicated via an App to help improve outcomes and&#xD;
      reduce urgent care and ER visits as well as improve A1C and quality of life.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to determine the impact of GEM (glycemic emergency management&#xD;
      device-app) in reducing the frequency and severity of hypoglycemia episodes in persons with&#xD;
      diabetes. Other objectives include: to determine whether the GEM system leads to improved&#xD;
      glucose control (as measured by HbA1c) during participation in the pilot, to determine&#xD;
      whether the GEM can be used as a cost effective solution in reducing ER and urgent care&#xD;
      visits, to determine the difference in ADDQOL scores between persons with a functioning GEM&#xD;
      system and those with a placebo device. The Study hypothesis is as follows: There wil be&#xD;
      significant differences in number of hypoglycemic events, ER and urgent care visits, A1C, as&#xD;
      well as quality of life as measured by the ADDQOL scores between persons with diabetes who&#xD;
      have the functioning GEM device in their smart phones and those that do not have such a&#xD;
      device installed in their smart phones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the utility of this application to help&#xD;
      improve outcomes and reduce urgent care and ER visits as well as improve A1C and quality of&#xD;
      life in persons with diabetes. This approach may be a paradigm shift in the rapidly&#xD;
      detecting, monitoring, intervening and managing the acute diabetic complications of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. Spiraling health care costs are a&#xD;
      major concern to the economy of the US. New measures have been introduced in the Affordable&#xD;
      Care Act to improve the efficiency of the health care delivery system. There is more emphasis&#xD;
      on preventive health care services. Our study is a step in that direction since it utilizes&#xD;
      existing smart phone technology and converts it into a medical device which can be of&#xD;
      invaluable help to the patient.&#xD;
