  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited during their hospitalization for either heart attack or&#xD;
      unstable angina and will be randomly assigned to either a text message program (Txt2Prevent)&#xD;
      or usual care. They will be texted for the first 60-days after discharge. Texts will include&#xD;
      topics regarding self-management and discharge protocols such as reminders to make an&#xD;
      appointment with their general practitioner or to refill medication prescriptions. After 60&#xD;
      days, the two groups will be compared for hospital readmission rates, quality of life,&#xD;
      medication adherence, and self-management.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes for hospitalization and death in Canada.&#xD;
      Being discharged is often a challenging and overwhelming time. Sometimes patients are&#xD;
      readmitted to the hospital shortly in the months following their discharge. Some of these&#xD;
      readmissions are due to information transfer being poor or insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have looked at whether text messaging can be a simple, cost-effective way to&#xD;
      help patients. Therefore, we wish to investigate the effectiveness of using text messaging to&#xD;
      help heart patients after they are discharged from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to determine the impact of a pilot text-messaging intervention&#xD;
      program (Txt2Prevent) that supports coronary syndrome (heart attack and unstable angina)&#xD;
      patients for 60 days after their hospital discharge. The program will include information&#xD;
      about follow-up care, medication use, and healthy lifestyle behaviours. The texts will be&#xD;
      sent at relevant times during the patients' recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is compare self-management between the usual care patients versus the&#xD;
      Txt2prevent patients. We hypothesize that the Txt2Prevent group will have better&#xD;
      self-management than the usual care group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is compare medication adherence, and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      as well as readmission and mortality rates between the two patient groups. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that the Txt2Prevent group will have better outcomes for these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population is acute coronary syndrome patients at St. Paul's hospital who are&#xD;
      discharged. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups-a usual care group&#xD;
      and the usual care plus the Txt2Prevent text messaging program group. All participants will&#xD;
      undergo a baseline assessment that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics, medical history, medication use and technology use information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-management skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 60 days, participants will be contacted again to perform a follow up assessment that&#xD;
      includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Information on readmission, medication use, the use of health services such as cardiac&#xD;
           rehab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-management skills&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medication adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the baseline and follow-up assessments, information may be obtained from the&#xD;
      patient's medical chart or records (e.g. medical history) or self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention, some intervention participants will be contacted to complete a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview about their experiences with the Txt2Prevent program.&#xD;

    <description>The treatment group will receive all the usual discharge treatment, instructions and information for acute coronary syndrome patients as well as the Txt2Prevent text-messaging program. The program will include a variety of topics such as standard follow-up care reminders as well as general self-management and healthy living texts. There will be two streams, one for current/recent smokers and one for non-smokers. Texts will be sent out every 1-3 days for 60 days. All participants in the same stream will receive the same texts in the same order.</description>
