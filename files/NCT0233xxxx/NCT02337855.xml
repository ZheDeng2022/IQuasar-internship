      This is a Phase I, first-in-human study of a vaccine against S. mansoni infection.The study&#xD;
      will recruit 72 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females from a single clinical center to&#xD;
      test two formulations of Sm-TSP-2 vaccine (using the Alhydrogel® only, and using Alhydrogel®&#xD;
      plus GLA-AF), each at 3 different doses: 10ug, 30ug, and 100ug. The primary objective is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and reactogenicity of ascending doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10ug, 30ug,&#xD;
      or 100ug) with or without GLA-AF vaccine given as three doses administered on Days 1, 57, and&#xD;

      This is a Phase I, first-in-human study of a vaccine against S. mansoni infection.The study&#xD;
      will recruit 72 healthy adult males and non-pregnant females from a single clinical center to&#xD;
      test two formulations of Sm-TSP-2 vaccine (using the Alhydrogel® only, and using Alhydrogel®&#xD;
      plus GLA-AF), each at 3 different doses: 10ug, 30ug, and 100ug. The study will use a&#xD;
      dose-escalation cohort design, in which escalation to the next dose cohort will be determined&#xD;
      based on evaluation of pre-defined escalation criteria requiring 7 day safety data to be&#xD;
      examined after all subjects in the current cohort have received their first dose of vaccine.&#xD;
      For each Cohort (1-3), an initial 5 subjects (2 Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®, 2&#xD;
      Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF, and 1 placebo) will be enrolled, randomized, vaccinated, and&#xD;
      have completed Visit 2 (Day 3), before enrolling the rest of the cohort. As with&#xD;
      dose-escalation decisions, evidence of significant reactogenicity will require further review&#xD;
      prior to proceeding.Recruitment and enrollment into the study will occur on an ongoing basis,&#xD;
      with each cohort being recruited and vaccinated in sequence. All subjects will be assigned&#xD;
      investigational vaccine or placebo by randomization, and a double-blind design will be used&#xD;
      (i.e., neither the subject nor the investigator will be aware of the study product assigned:&#xD;
      Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®, Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF, or placebo). Each subject will receive 3&#xD;
      vaccinations at Days 1, 57, and 113, and will be followed for a total of 12 months after the&#xD;
      third dose. The study duration will be approximately 24 months, and subject participation&#xD;
      duration will be approximately 16 months. The primary objective is to assess the safety and&#xD;
      reactogenicity of ascending doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10ug, 30ug, or 100ug) with or&#xD;
      without GLA-AF vaccine given as three doses administered on Days 1, 57, and 113. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives include: (1) to assess the IgG antibody response using an indirect&#xD;
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at Day 127; (2) to assess the IgG antibody response&#xD;
      using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at 14 days after dose one and two&#xD;
      and Day 203 and 293 (3 and 6 months after the third dose) of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10ug,&#xD;
      30ug, or 100ug) with or without GLA-AF; (3) To assess the duration of the IgG antibody&#xD;
      response using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) following receipt of&#xD;
      three doses of Sm-TSP-2/Alhydrogel® (10ug, 30ug, or 100ug) with or without GLA-AF.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must meet all of the following inclusion criteria in order to be eligible for&#xD;
        participation in this study. 1. Provide written informed consent prior to any study&#xD;
        procedures. 2. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures and be available&#xD;
        for all study visits. 3. Male or non-pregnant female aged 18 to 50, inclusive. 4. Are in&#xD;
        good health, as determined by vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure),&#xD;
        medical history, and targeted physical examination based on medical history.1 Existing&#xD;
        medical diagnoses or conditions (except those in the Subject Exclusion Criteria) must be&#xD;
        deemed as stable chronic medical conditions. A stable chronic medical condition is defined&#xD;
        as no change in prescription medication, dose, or frequency of medication in the last 3&#xD;
        months (90 days) and health outcomes of the specific disease are considered to be within&#xD;
        acceptable limits in the last 6 months (180 days). Any change due to change of health care&#xD;
        provider, insurance company, or that is done for financial reasons, as long as in the same&#xD;
        class of medication, will not be considered a violation of this inclusion criterion. Any&#xD;
        change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by&#xD;
        the site principal investigator or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a&#xD;
        violation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn)&#xD;
        medications if, in the opinion of the site principal investigator or appropriate&#xD;
        sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of&#xD;
        reactogenicity and immunogenicity. Topical, nasal, and inhaled medications (with the&#xD;
        exception of steroids as outlined in the Subjects Exclusion Criteria), vitamins, and&#xD;
        contraceptives are permitted. 5. Vital signs (oral temperature, pulse, and blood pressure)&#xD;
        are all within normal protocol-defined ranges. Note: The normal protocol-defined ranges for&#xD;
        vital signs include (a) oral temperature less than 100.0°F, (b) pulse 50 to 100 bpm,&#xD;
        inclusive, (c) systolic blood pressure 85 to 150 mmHg, inclusive, and (d) diastolic blood&#xD;
        pressure 55 to 90 mmHg, inclusive. 6. Laboratory tests (alanine aminotransferase,&#xD;
        creatinine, white blood cells, hemoglobin, and platelets) are all within normal&#xD;
        protocol-defined reference ranges.33 The normal protocol-defined ranges for laboratory&#xD;
        tests include (a) alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 32 IU/L or less for females or 44 IU/L&#xD;
        or less for males, (b) creatinine 1.0 mg/dL or less for females or 1.27 mg/dL or less for&#xD;
        males, (c) white blood cells (WBC) between 3.4 x10^3/uL and 10.8 x10^3/uL, inclusive, (d)&#xD;
        hemoglobin 11.1 g/dL or greater for females or 12.6 g/dL or greater for males, (e)&#xD;
        platelets between 150 x10^3/uL and 379 x10^3/uL, inclusive. Laboratory test results for 2nd&#xD;
        and 3rd vaccinations may be at Grade 1 if considered unrelated to study product. 7.&#xD;
        Urinalysis with no greater than trace protein and negative for glucose. 8. Female subjects&#xD;
        of childbearing potential4 must agree to practice highly effective contraception5 for a&#xD;
        minimum of 30 days prior to study product exposure and through 30 days after last&#xD;
        vaccination.4 Female subjects who are surgically sterile via tubal sterilization, bilateral&#xD;
        oophorectomy or hysterectomy or who have been postmenopausal for greater than 1 year are&#xD;
        not considered to be of childbearing potential.5 Note: Highly effective methods of&#xD;
        contraception are defined as having low failure rates (i.e. less than 1% per year) when&#xD;
        used consistently and correctly and may include, but are not limited to, abstinence from&#xD;
        intercourse with a male partner, monogamous relationship with a vasectomized partner, mal e&#xD;
        condoms or diaphragm with spermicide, intrauterine devices, and licensed hormonal methods.&#xD;
        9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test&#xD;
        within 24 hours prior to study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria at baseline will be excluded&#xD;
        from participation in the study. 1. Has had known infection due to S. mansoni or has&#xD;
        traveled to an endemic area for S. mansoni infection and, during that travel, was&#xD;
        potentially exposed to S. mansoni. 2. Has a positive urine pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
        vaccination (if female of childbearing potential), or has the intention to become pregnant&#xD;
