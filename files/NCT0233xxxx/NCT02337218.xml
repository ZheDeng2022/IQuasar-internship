  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind randomized clinical trial. Both patients and the podiatrist that will&#xD;
      evaluate and monitor study patients will be blinded to electrical stimulation application.&#xD;
      The manufacturer of the units will be asked to not inform which patient received which unit.&#xD;
      Each unit will be coded with a unique identification number, and the manufacturer units&#xD;
      revealed their status, placebo or electric stimulation, only at the end of data collection&#xD;
      for the last patient. Subsequently, the investigators could match the status of the&#xD;
      identification numbers with the corresponding units to start analyzing the data. Patients&#xD;
      that receive an activated electrical stimulation unit will receive a standard dose of 50&#xD;
      volts as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will enroll a cohort of 80 diabetes (type II) patients with peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (see section 6 for sample size justification). The diagnosis of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      will be based on World Health Organization criteria.(World-Health-Organization 1999). The&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria are described in table III. The clinical assessments are&#xD;
      described in table IV. The investigator will discuss the study design, duration, and its&#xD;
      risks with potential subjects asked to participate. The participant will be provided with a&#xD;
      consent form to read at their leisure. The investigator will be available to answer questions&#xD;
      or provide more explanation as requested by potential participants and their family.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be a total of five study visits required for each patient. There will be one&#xD;
      scheduled visit for baseline evaluation and four additional visits at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 6&#xD;
      weeks during treatment and 8 weeks (2 weeks post stopping the treatment). The baseline visit&#xD;
      will involve completion of a standardized intake form, which will include pertinent&#xD;
      demographics such as age, height, weight, education level, occupation, and comorbidities of&#xD;
      the study patient (see Table IV). Several clinical assessments will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      as well as at each study visit to evaluate severity of neuropathy and skin perfusion as&#xD;
      described in the table IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments Baseline Medical History: This will include: duration and type of&#xD;
      diabetes, type of diabetes medication (insulin, oral, combination therapy, diet), previous&#xD;
      history of foot ulcers, previous history of falls, amputation (toe, foot), lower extremity&#xD;
      bypass, lower extremity angioplasty, Coronary artery bypass surgery, cardiac angioplasty,&#xD;
      arthritis, liver disease, osteoporosis, malignancy, and bone tumors. The Kaplan co-morbidity&#xD;
      index will be used to record disease severity. The New York Heart Association criteria will&#xD;
      be used to classify congestive heart failure, and the National Kidney Foundation Disease&#xD;
      Outcomes Quality Initiative Clinical Practice Guidelines for chronic kidney disease to stage&#xD;
      kidney disease. Research staff will document all prescription and over-the-counter&#xD;
      medications. Research staff will measure height and weight to determine body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Social Factors: Marital status, years of education, type of work, tobacco history&#xD;
      (pack years, current smoker, current use of chewing tobacco, previous smoker, no tobacco&#xD;
      history), drug history (current, previous history, no drug history), education, occupation,&#xD;
      and alcohol history will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Test for frailty assessment: Fried Frailty Criteria: Weight loss &gt;10 pounds in&#xD;
      preceding year; Grip strength; Low levels of physical activity; 15 foot walk time;&#xD;
      Exhaustion[13] Screening for cognitive problem: MMSE score [15] Foot questionnaire and foot&#xD;
      exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline &amp; each 2- week follow-up (week 2, week 4, week 6, and week 8):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral Neuropathy: Research staff will evaluate Vibration Perception Threshold (VPT)&#xD;
      Testing to evaluate large fiber neuropathy Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, and the Modified&#xD;
      Neuropathy Disability Score. (Armstrong and Lawrence 1998) will be done. Research staff will&#xD;
      assess light touch and pressure sensation at nine sites on each foot using 4, 10, 26, and 60&#xD;
      Semmes-Weinstein gram monofilaments. (Diamond, Mueller et al. 1989) The Modified Neuropathy&#xD;
      Disability Score is a scored clinical examination that includes Achilles deep tendon reflex,&#xD;
      pressure, vibration sensation and temperature sensation in both feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain: Visual Analogue Scale Gait test: 8 sensors will be attached to the legs and lower back&#xD;
      using comfortable straps and will be asked to walk 20 meters on a flat surface, two times. A&#xD;
      third 20 meter walk will be performed with an additional distractive cognitive task (counting&#xD;
      -1). The 4th test will be fast walking. Walking performance (e.g., speed, cadence, and&#xD;
      stability) and spatio-temporal parameters of gait (e.g., velocity, stride time, gait&#xD;
      inter-cycle variability, double support, and gait initiation) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance test: The BalanSensTM kinematic sensor will be attached to the legs and lower back&#xD;
      and will be used to measure the variation of subject's center of mass measured by the Romberg&#xD;
      protocol including double stance, semi-tandem, and full-tandem tests. Patients will be asked&#xD;
      to stand straight, feet together, hands crossed for 30 seconds, 20 seconds, and 15 seconds&#xD;
      respectively for double stance test, semi-tendem, and full tandem tests with eyes open and&#xD;
      closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and 6 weeks follow-up Activity Monitoring: Spontaneous daily physical activity will&#xD;
      be monitored in home environment for 2 days using PAMSysTM Removal log: participants will be&#xD;
      asked to note the time off, time on, and reason for removal if the PAMSysTM is removed during&#xD;
      the 2 day collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life questionnaire: SF12 Other assessment Fall log: participant will receive a log&#xD;
      and agree to call the study overseer in the event of a fall during the 4 weeks study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other patient information: if it was available patients record including medical history,&#xD;
      neurological exam results, and physical examination may be gathered from patient record after&#xD;
      authorization of the subject (see form T504a). In addition, subject photograph or video&#xD;
      during experiment may be taken after subject's authorization.&#xD;

        <description>8 sensors will be attached to the legs and lower back using comfortable straps and will be asked to walk 20 meters on a flat surface, two times. A third 20 meter walk will be performed with an additional distractive cognitive task (counting -1). The 4th test will be fast walking. Walking performance (e.g., speed, cadence, and stability) and spatio-temporal parameters of gait (e.g., velocity, stride time, gait inter-cycle variability, double support, and gait initiation) will be measured at weeks 2, 4, 6 and 8.</description>
