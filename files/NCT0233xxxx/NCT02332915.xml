  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing neurorehabilitation literature suggests that intense treatment may be desired to&#xD;
      maximize the effects of therapy following neurologic injury. This investigation is designed&#xD;
      to facilitate the development of efficacious, clinically applicable treatment for acquired&#xD;
      apraxia of speech by examining the effects of intensity of treatment (e.g., 9 hours per week&#xD;
      vs. 3 hours per week, while holding total number of sessions constant) with a group of&#xD;
      speakers who have chronic apraxia of speech and aphasia.&#xD;

      This research was designed to examine the effects of treatment intensity on outcomes&#xD;
      associated with an established treatment for acquired apraxia of speech (AOS). Intensity in&#xD;
      the form of dose frequency and total intervention duration was evaluated with Sound&#xD;
      Production Treatment (SPT). The investigators examined the effects of intense dose frequency&#xD;
      (nine, one-hour sessions per week) and traditional dose frequency (three, one hour sessions&#xD;
      per week). Total number of treatment sessions was held constant allowing for comparison of&#xD;
      total intervention duration (27 sessions over 3 weeks versus 27 sessions over 9 weeks). A&#xD;
      two-phase, group cross-over design was used. Thirty-six participants with chronic aphasia and&#xD;
      AOS were recruited. Twenty-four participants completed then entire study and were&#xD;
      quasi-randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups - intense first or traditional first&#xD;
      (12 per group). One group received SPT applied with intense dose frequency (SPT-I) followed&#xD;
      by SPT applied with traditional dose frequency (SPT-T). The other group received the&#xD;
      treatments in the reverse order (SPT-T followed by SPT-I). A two week no treatment interval&#xD;
      separated the treatment phases. The outcomes of interest addressed changes in trained and&#xD;
      untrained speech behaviors.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Pre treatment, 2 weeks following the first treatment phase, 2 weeks following the second treatment phase</time_frame>
    <description>Accuracy of articulation of sounds in words, phrases, sentences designated for treatment. Assessed in nontreatment probes with productions elicited through repetition. Change in accuracy of articulation of trained items was measured from baseline to 2 weeks post treatment using effect size calculations as the indicator of magnitude of change. Percent accuracy was calculated for each probe (maximum = 100%, minimum = 0% correct). Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment. Positive effect sizes = increases in accuracy &amp; negative effect sizes = decreases in accuracy.</description>

    <description>Change in accuracy of articulation of untrained items as measured by effect sizes reflecting magnitude of change. Production of words designated to not receive treatment (i.e., generalization items) was measured repeatedly in non treatment probes prior to treatment, throughout all study phases, and at 2 weeks post treatment with percent accuracy calculated for each probe (0% to 100% correct). Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment.</description>

    <description>Measure of how well an unfamiliar listener can understand speech. The Assessment of Intelligibility of Dysarthric Speech will be employed. The participant will repeat words which will be audiorecorded. A trained, but unfamiliar listener will orthographically transcribe the words that are produced. The transcriptions will be compared to the list of target (intended words) to determine a percentage of words that are correctly understood.</description>

        <title>Accuracy of Articulation of TREATED ITEMS Measured as Effect Size - Change From Baseline to End of Treatment Phase</title>
        <description>Accuracy of articulation of sounds in words, phrases, sentences designated for treatment. Assessed in nontreatment probes with productions elicited through repetition. Change in accuracy of articulation of trained items was measured from baseline to 2 weeks post treatment using effect size calculations as the indicator of magnitude of change. Percent accuracy was calculated for each probe (maximum = 100%, minimum = 0% correct). Effect size calculations involved calculating the difference between post- and pre-treatment probe accuracy percentages with corrections made for variability (standard deviations in performance). The larger the effect size, the greater the change in performance from pre-treatment. Positive effect sizes = increases in accuracy &amp; negative effect sizes = decreases in accuracy.</description>

          <title>SPT - Traditional (Non-intense): All Participants</title>
          <description>All participants received Sound Production Treatment (SPT). Half the participants received SPT applied in a non-intense manner (SPT- Traditional; SPT-T) first for 27 sessions. Following a 2 week washout period, those participants then received SPT applied in an intense fashion (SPT-Intense; SPT-I) for 27 sessions. The other half of the participants received the treatments in the opposite order. All 24 administrations of SPT-Intense were analyzed relative to all 24 administrations of SPT-Traditional.&#xD;
