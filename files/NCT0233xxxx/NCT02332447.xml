  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) primarily affects young adults with&#xD;
      drug-resistant epilepsy, with an incidence of about 0.4%/year. The diagnosis of SUDEP&#xD;
      requires that anamnestic data and post-mortem examination do not reveal a structural or&#xD;
      toxicological cause for death. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) are the main risk&#xD;
      factor for SUDEP, which they appear to trigger in most instances. Indeed, experimental and&#xD;
      clinical data strongly suggest that most SUDEP result from a postictal respiratory&#xD;
      dysfunction progressing to terminal apnea, later followed by cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postictal apnea could partly derive from a seizure-induced massive release of endogenous&#xD;
      opioids. Animal studies suggest that such seizure-related release of endogenous opioid&#xD;
      peptides participate to termination of seizures. In patients with epilepsy, functional&#xD;
      imaging studies have confirmed that seizures induce release of endogenous opioids. The&#xD;
      brainstem respiratory centers contain the highest density in opioid receptors, accounting for&#xD;
      respiratory depression being one of the cardinal symptoms of opioid overdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that SUDEP partly results from a post-ictal apnea promoted by&#xD;
      a GTCS-induced massive release of endogenous opioids, and that an opioid antagonist could&#xD;
      represent an effective preventive treatment of SUDEP. This could be achieved by chronic&#xD;
      administration of Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist that has been used in a large population&#xD;
      of patients with chronic alcoholism at high risk of seizures, without showing any&#xD;
      pro-convulsant effect. This is a crucial feasibility issue since antagonising a mechanism&#xD;
      thought to participate to seizure termination could theoretically aggravate seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before evaluating the efficacy of chronic administration of naltrexone, it is legitimate to&#xD;
      perform a proof of concept study by testing the acute effect of an equivalent injectable&#xD;
      treatment (Naloxone) in the immediate aftermath of GTCS recorded inhospital during video-EEG&#xD;
      monitoring of patients with refractory epilepsy. One third of these patients develop&#xD;
      postictal respiratory dysfunction and hypoxemia, which should be reduced by the investigators&#xD;
      intervention if the investigators hypothesis is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of 0.4 mg intravenous naloxone,&#xD;
      versus placebo, administered in the immediate aftermath of a GTCS, in reducing the severity&#xD;
      of the postictal central respiratory dysfunction occurring after the end of the seizure, as&#xD;
      measured by pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 25% of patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy who undergo long-term video-EEG&#xD;
      monitoring develop at least one partial secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure. However,&#xD;
      these patients cannot be individualized a priori. Therefore, all adult patients with&#xD;
      drug-resistant epilepsy who will undergo long-term video-EEG monitoring in one of the&#xD;
      participating centres, will lack all exclusion criteria, and will give their written informed&#xD;
      consent to participate to the study if they develop GTCS, will be included in the study. They&#xD;
      will all benefit from continuous monitoring of pulse oximetry (together with video, EEG, and&#xD;
      respiration recordings), and will be equipped with a peripheral venous catheter throughout&#xD;
      the video-EEG. The modalities of the video-EEG monitoring will be consistent with the current&#xD;
      practices and similar across the 8 centres (apart from the venous catheter which is not&#xD;
      standard practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of occurrence of a generalized tonic-clonic seizure, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      (1:1) to receive intravenous naloxone (0.4 mg) or placebo. Placebo will be isotonic sodium&#xD;
      chloride which preparation and packaging will be centralized to ensure its&#xD;
      indistinguishability from naloxone. Randomization will be centralized and stratified by&#xD;
      centre. The evolution from a partial seizure to a GTCS being gradual, and the total duration&#xD;
      of the seizure ranging from 2 to 3 minutes, the injection will be prepared during the course&#xD;
      of the seizure. Given the assumptions about the role of endogenous opioids release in the&#xD;
      spontaneous termination of seizures, naloxone will be administrated immediately after the end&#xD;
      of the GTCS and not before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All digital data (video, EEG, respiration, SpO2) will be centralized and evaluated blind to&#xD;
      other data by the PI of the study who will not be involved in the video-EEG monitoring of the&#xD;
      included patients. The same automatic and objective analysis of SpO2 data than the one&#xD;
      already developed in the PHRC REPOMSE will be performed.&#xD;

      Sample size was revised using a log rank test with a two-sided alternative hypothesis. For a&#xD;
      significance level of 5% (two-tailed), assuming a hazard ratio of 2.414 calculated, i.e based&#xD;
      on an effect size similar to the effect size of oxygenotherapy in a delay of 60 seconds&#xD;
      (Rheims et al., 2019), 40 events should be observed to reject the null hypothesis in 80% of&#xD;
      cases,. A proportion of 89% of patients being expected to recover SpO2 ≥ 90% 120 seconds&#xD;
      after the end of the seizure and considering a proportion of unusauble records for technical&#xD;
      reasons of 20%, at least 54 patients should be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming that about 10% of patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy who undergo&#xD;
      long-term video-EEG monitoring develop at least one partial secondary generalized&#xD;
      tonic-clonic seizure, a total of 554 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
