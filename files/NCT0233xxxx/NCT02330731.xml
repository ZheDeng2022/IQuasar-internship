      AIM: To compare between n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate, iso-amyl-2-cyanoacrylate and mixture of 72%&#xD;
      chromated glycerin with hypertonic glucose solution in management of gastric varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: Ninety patients with gastric varices presented to Endoscopy Unit of Ain Shams&#xD;
      University Hospital were included. They were randomly allocated into three groups; each group&#xD;
      included 30 patients treated with intravariceal sclerosant injections in biweekly sessions&#xD;
      till complete obturation of gastric varices; Group I (n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate; Histoacryl®),&#xD;
      Group II (iso-amyl-2-cyanoacrylate; Amcrylate®) and Group III (mixture of 72% chromated&#xD;
      glycerin; Scleremo® with glucose solution 25%). All the procedures were done electively&#xD;
      without active bleeding. Recruited patients were followed up for 3 months.&#xD;

      • Study Design &amp; Sampling: This prospective randomized study is conducted on ninety patients&#xD;
      with gastric varices presented to Endoscopy Unit of Ain Shams University Hospital. Patients&#xD;
      with non-variceal causes for upper GIT bleeding and those with severe co-morbidity are&#xD;
      excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are randomly allocated into three groups; each group includes 30 patients who will&#xD;
      be treated with sclerosant injections in biweekly sessions till complete obturation of&#xD;
      gastric varices, with follow up for 3 months:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group I (Histoacryl® Group),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group II (Amcrylate® Group) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group III (Scleremo® with Glucose 25% Group). The three groups are matching as regards&#xD;
           age, gender, cause of liver cirrhosis (viral hepatitis B or C), Child score and&#xD;
           endoscopic findings (including number, grade of EV and size of GV).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tools of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory investigations: CBC, liver profile, viral markers (HBs Ag, HB core Ab, HCV&#xD;
           Ab) by ELISA technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Child classification according to the modified Child Pugh's criteria [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Abdominal ultrasonography: liver and spleen size, portal vein diameter and ascites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy: using Pentax video endoscope EG 3440. Esophageal&#xD;
           varices are classified according to their size at the gastroesophageal junction into 4&#xD;
           grades according to Westaby et al. [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Gastric varices are classified into: gastro-esophageal varices (GEV) and isolated&#xD;
           gastric varices (IGV) according to Sarin et al. [15].&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Therapeutic interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravariceal technique of injection is done according to Soehendra et al. [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histoacryl® is diluted as 0.5 ml histoacryl: 0.8 ml lipidol as a contrast agent to dilute the&#xD;
      adhesive material to fill the whole varix and to prevent rapid hardening and obstruction of&#xD;
      the needle. The mixture is injected slowly to minimize the risk of embolization followed by&#xD;
      injection of 2 ml of distilled water. The first ml of water is injected to push the material&#xD;
      into the varix and the second ml is injected during withdrawal of the needle to prevent its&#xD;
      obstruction [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amcrylate® is injected slowly followed by injection of 2 ml distilled water without mixing&#xD;
      with any other substances [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scleremo® is mixed with glucose 25% in a ratio of 1:1. The mixture is injected very slowly&#xD;
      and with the waiting for moments inside the variceal lumen after injection to give enough&#xD;
      time for the sclerosing material to be in contact with the vessel wall that helps&#xD;
      haemostasis. There is no need for distilled water injection [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent was obtained from all included patients and the study protocol was approved&#xD;
      from the ethical guidelines committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the procedures are done electively without active bleeding. The primary end point of this&#xD;
      study is the obturation of gastric varices. The secondary endpoint is the occurrence of&#xD;
      bleeding whether from the puncture site during or immediately after injection or delayed&#xD;
      (in-hospital or after discharge) and mortality.&#xD;
