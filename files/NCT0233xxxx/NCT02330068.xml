  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of developing a microbiome probe of&#xD;
      depression and to evaluate the microbiome change in a preliminary analysis of treatment&#xD;
      response (n=20) vs. non response (n=20) to the antidepressant citalopram. This study is a 12&#xD;
      week open trial that will enroll approximately 80 participants (anticipated 40 study&#xD;
      completers with paired biomarker data) with an episode of major depression, Bipolar I or&#xD;
      Bipolar II and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study will be conducted at Mayo Clinic Jacksonville Department of Psychiatry (recruit up&#xD;
      to 10 patients and 10 controls with paired data) and Mayo Clinic Depression Center in&#xD;
      Rochester (recruit up to 30 patients and 30 controls with paired data). Patients with major&#xD;
      depression, Bipolar Disorder I or Bipolar Disorder II confirmed by structured diagnostic&#xD;
      interview (SCID) and moderate symptom severity (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology&#xD;
      or S-C16) will be enrolled in the 12 week study. We will explore the gut microbiome (and its&#xD;
      genetic material) and gut-brain markers of inflammation (cortisol, cytokines) from stool&#xD;
      specimens and serum samples, respectively. Collections will be at baseline, week 2, and week&#xD;
      12 of the study. Healthy controls matched for age, sex (including menopausal status of female&#xD;
      subjects), and body-mass index (BMI) will have only baseline stool and serum collections.&#xD;
      Statistical t-tests will be used to assess baseline differences between patient and controls&#xD;
      in microbiome and inflammatory markers. Treatment response (50% reduction in QIDS), treatment&#xD;
      remission (QIDS-C16 &lt; 6) will be analyzed with change in microbiome and inflammation markers.&#xD;
      Correlational analysis with multiple testing corrections will be conducted between depression&#xD;
      symptom severity and measures of cortisol, cytokines, and gut microbiome composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on early translation of Dr. Fryer and Dr. Chia's research and will&#xD;
      bring the gut-brain interface to the field of individualizing treatment to patients who&#xD;
      struggle with depression. This project will provide insight into how gut microbiota may be&#xD;
      implicated in depression, how antidepressant treatments alter microbiota composition, and how&#xD;
      these factors impact key physiologic mediators of depression (i.e. cortisol and cytokine&#xD;
      levels). The public health implications of more focused drug development and treatment for&#xD;
      depression are substantial.&#xD;

        The investigators will enroll 80 participants, both male and female with the goal of having&#xD;
        20 paired data of responders and 20 non-responders each. Forty age-matched healthy controls&#xD;
        will also be recruited. The investigators will recruit 100 subjects anticipating drop outs&#xD;
        or inability to participate fully with microbiome sample collection and /or at least paired&#xD;
        biological specimens before and after treatment. The Mayo Clinic Jacksonville patients&#xD;
        (n=10) will be matched with Mayo Clinic Jacksonville controls (n=10) and the Mayo Clinic&#xD;
        Rochester patients (n=30) will be matched with the Mayo Clinic Rochester controls (n=30).&#xD;
