  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 120 binge-drinking MSM to 12 weeks of&#xD;
      naltrexone 50mg, to be taken in anticipation of heavy drinking. Ethnically and racially&#xD;
      diverse participants will be recruited using Respondent Driven Sampling as well as active&#xD;
      field recruitment. MSM will be seen weekly for alcohol-metabolite urine testing, study drug&#xD;
      dispensing, and brief counseling for alcohol use. Safety assessments and behavioral surveys&#xD;
      will be completed monthly.&#xD;
