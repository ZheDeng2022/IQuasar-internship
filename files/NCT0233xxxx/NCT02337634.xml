      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of silymarin in&#xD;
      individuals with gambling disorder. The hypothesis to be tested is that silymarin will be&#xD;
      more effective and well tolerated in subjects with gambling disorder compared to placebo. The&#xD;
      proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that&#xD;
      currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gambling disorder is a significant public health problem that often results in a distinctive&#xD;
      pattern of persistent and disabling psychological symptoms. Although once thought to be&#xD;
      relatively uncommon, studies estimate that gambling disorder has a lifetime prevalence among&#xD;
      adults of 1.6% and past-year prevalence of 1.1%. Patients with gambling disorder also&#xD;
      experience significant social and occupational impairment as well as financial and legal&#xD;
      difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with gambling disorder report chronically high levels of stress, and&#xD;
      vulnerability to gambling addiction is enhanced by stressful events (4), particularly as&#xD;
      stress may result cognitive problems leading to impulsive and unhealthy decisions. A stress&#xD;
      response is elicited when sensations and Observations do not match existing or anticipated&#xD;
      expectations. A primary endocrine response to stress is the secretion of glucocorticoids&#xD;
      through the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Although their release&#xD;
      serves to maintain homeostasis during acute episodes of stress, prolonged stress responses&#xD;
      have been associated with structural brain damage both in humans and animals. In humans,&#xD;
      stress also enhances addictive craving, and relapse to addiction is more likely to occur in&#xD;
      individuals exposed to high levels of stress. Since oxidative stress may be implicated in the&#xD;
      etiology of addictive behaviors, use of antioxidants to reduce relapse, improve cognitive&#xD;
      functioning, and reduce addictive urges may be a sensible step.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silymarin, a flavonoid and a member of the Asteraceae family, is extracted from the seeds of&#xD;
      milk thistle (Silybum marianum) and is known to own antioxidative and anti-apoptotic&#xD;
      properties. Silymarin has been reported to decrease lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, it has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that its anti-oxidative activity is related to the scavenging of free&#xD;
      radicals and activation of anti-oxidative defenses: increases in cellular glutathione content&#xD;
      and superoxide dismutase activity. Milk thistle has been used for a range of psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders including methamphetamine abuse and obsessive compulsive disorder, two psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders with similarities to gambling disorder. The flavanoid complex silymarin in&#xD;
      preclinical studies has been found to increase serotonin levels in the cortex, and ameliorate&#xD;
      decreases in dopamine and serotonin in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus associated with&#xD;
      methamphetamine abuse. In the frontal cortex one of the functions of dopamine is to increase&#xD;
      the signal to noise ratio, increased dopamine correlating with increased frontal performance.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the higher cortical dopamine levels are associated with improved&#xD;
      frontal cortical cognitive performance. Cortical inhibition is felt to be the basis for&#xD;
      top-down control of motivated behaviors. A recent randomized controlled study with milk&#xD;
      thistle was conducted in Iran Thirty five participants with moderate OCD were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to 200 mg of milk thistle leaf extract or 10 mg of fluoxetine three times daily for&#xD;
      eight weeks. Results revealed no significant difference in treatment effects between milk&#xD;
      thistle and fluoxetine from baseline to endpoint as both interventions provided a highly&#xD;
      significant reduction in symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Silymarin or Milk Thistle may therefore offer promise for the treatment of individuals with&#xD;
      gambling disorder. Pharmacological management of gambling symptoms has produced mixed&#xD;
      results, with some studies showing a superiority of medication to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current pilot study examines the tolerability and efficacy of milk thistle in the&#xD;
      treatment of gambling disorder. We hypothesize that milk thistle will reduce the severity of&#xD;
      gambling symptoms and improve patients' overall functioning.&#xD;
