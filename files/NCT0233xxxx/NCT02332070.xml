      Background: Despite advances in cardiac surgical techniques, modern anesthesia, and&#xD;
      adjunctive medical therapies, cardiac-surgery associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI)&#xD;
      remains a frequent and important complication. With advancing age and more severe&#xD;
      comorbidities present in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, multivariate scores (e.g.&#xD;
      Thakar Acute Renal Failure [ARF] score) would anticipate future higher rates of CSA-AKI that&#xD;
      resolve, lead to progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), require renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      (RRT), and are associated major adverse cardiac events with early and later mortality. Mehta&#xD;
      and colleagues in a study of 2441 cases suggested that CSA-AKI was associated with the time&#xD;
      between the diagnostic coronary angiogram and the subsequent surgery. This suggested that&#xD;
      superimposed risk of contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI) followed by cardiac surgery was a serial&#xD;
      insult to the kidneys producing the clinical syndrome of CSA-AKI. However, Andersen and&#xD;
      coworkers, in a study of 285 consecutive patients concluded that cardiac surgery within 1-3&#xD;
      days of coronary angiography was safe and not associated with CSA-AKI. Attempts at evaluating&#xD;
      CSA-AKI risk prediction models have been limited by small sample sizes. For example, Kiers et&#xD;
      el attempted to evaluate 8 CSA-AKI risk models in 1388 patients and found several scores&#xD;
      could not be computed due to lack of information and those that could have unstable point&#xD;
      estimates for C-statistics and other measures. As a result, CSA-AKI risk scores and attempts&#xD;
      to improve quality of care have not been applied in a widespread manner to cardiac surgical&#xD;
      cases. Thus we propose to evaluate these key concepts in a large dataset which captures&#xD;
      important clinical events such as CI-AKI and type of contrast used followed by CSA-AKI and&#xD;
      associated major adverse renal and cardiac events (MARCE) including the need for RRT,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure, hospitalizations (cardiac or renal) and death.&#xD;
      We aim to derive a practical approach in determining the optimal waiting period from the time&#xD;
      of angiography to cardiac surgery according to risk for CSA-AKI in subjects who have received&#xD;
      iso-osmolar contrast media (IOCM) with preoperative angiography, as that agent has been shown&#xD;
      to have the lowest risk of CI-AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine two main predictor variables independently and then jointly in stratified and&#xD;
           multivariate analyses for the outcomes of CSA-AKI, MARCE, need for RRT, and inpatient&#xD;
           mortality, and the composite, as well as the outcomes of 30 day rehospitalization or&#xD;
           death, and finally for the days out of hospital and alive adjusted to person-year of&#xD;
           time&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Days from coronary angiogram performed with IOCM to cardiac surgery (1, 2, 3, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Thakar Acute Renal Failure (ARF) score (1 to 17)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the interrelationships between time in days between angiogram and surgery and&#xD;
           the ARF Score with the Society of Thoracic Surgery (STS) Risk score for mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Retrospective cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Using the Texas Quality Initiative cardiothoracic surgery database, patients who&#xD;
      have recorded one preoperative and at least one postoperative serum creatinine (mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded Cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Use of contrast agent other than IOCM with the preoperative angiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preoperative use of ventricular assist devices and intraaortic balloon counterpulsation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operations where there is implantation of mechanical assist devices or cardiac&#xD;
           transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CI-AKI will be assessed by several methods during the period from angiography to cardiac&#xD;
           surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Kidney Disease International Global Initiative (KDIGO) as a rise in serum&#xD;
                creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours of surgery or ≥1.5 X baseline serum&#xD;
                creatinine within seven days after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Conventional composite CI-AKI definition of ≥25% or ≥0.5 mg/dl rise in serum&#xD;
                creatinine from baseline to peak&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Conventional singular CI-AKI definition of ≥25% rise in serum creatinine from&#xD;
                baseline to peak&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Conventional singular CI-AKI definition of ≥0.5 mg/dl rise in serum creatinine from&#xD;
                baseline to peak&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CSA-AKI will be defined by several methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Kidney Disease International Global Initiative (KDIGO) as a rise in serum&#xD;
                creatinine ≥0.3 mg/dl within 48 hours of surgery or ≥1.5 X baseline serum&#xD;
                creatinine within seven days after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Conventional composite derived from CI-AKI definition of ≥25% or ≥0.5 mg/dl rise in&#xD;
                serum creatinine from baseline to peak&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Conventional singular derived from CI-AKI definition of ≥25% rise in serum&#xD;
                creatinine from baseline to peak&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Conventional singular derived from CI-AKI definition of ≥0.5 mg/dl rise in serum&#xD;
                creatinine from baseline to peak&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. MARCE will be the composite of RRT, myocardial infarction, stroke, heart failure,&#xD;
           hospitalizations for cardiac reasons, hospitalization for renal reasons, and death&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. RRT will include at least one session of peritoneal dialysis ultrafiltration,&#xD;
           hemodialysis, or other form of extracorporeal blood purification&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All-cause hospitalization, emergency room, and observation unit visits at 30 days, and&#xD;
           one-year will be obtained from the Dallas-Fort Worth Hospital Council Education and&#xD;
           Research (DFWHC) connected a regional enterprise master person index (REMPI) database&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. All-cause mortality will be reported as inpatient, 30-day, and one-year&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Days out of the hospital and alive will be derived as the converse of death and&#xD;
           hospitalized days and will be adjusted to 100 PY of time exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Baseline eGFR will be calculated using the CKD-EPI formula&#xD;
&#xD;
           GFR = 141 X min(Scr/κ,1)α X max(Scr/κ,1)-1.209 X 0.993Age X 1.018 [if female] X 1.159&#xD;
           [if black]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Where Scr is serum creatinine (mg/dL), κ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, α is&#xD;
           -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males, min indicates the minimum of Scr/κ or 1, and&#xD;
           max indicates the maximum of Scr/κ or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Clinical factors: age, diabetes, Hb, heart failure, operative variables (bypass time,&#xD;
           coronary bypass with valve surgery, on-pump, off-pump) and other predictors of CSA-AKI&#xD;
           will be reported in baseline characteristics and considered as candidates for&#xD;
           multivariable models&#xD;
