  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decade the paradigm of care in oncology has evolved with the advent of&#xD;
      personalized medicine. Yet, despite this exciting prospect, there are currently only a few&#xD;
      disease subtypes where therapeutic approaches with proven benefit exist such as EGFR targeted&#xD;
      therapies in EGFR-mutant lung tumours. With the increasing number of novel molecularly&#xD;
      targeted agents available, the importance of building our understanding of cancer biology is&#xD;
      critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Challenges to implement personalized medicine include the limitations of molecular testing,&#xD;
      tumour heterogeneity and molecular evolution, costs, and the quality and morbidity associated&#xD;
      with tumour biopsies. Sequential biopsies are essential to better understand biological&#xD;
      markers of response and resistance, and identify predictive or prognostic markers. Despite&#xD;
      the scientific rationale for biopsies, incorporating them into practice can be challenging,&#xD;
      as in many cases there is no direct advantage to the patient. This project aims to understand&#xD;
      the effect of research biopsies on the patient. The Investigator hypothesize by learning more&#xD;
      and gaining a better appreciation of the impact on the patient, Investigators will increase&#xD;
      the likelihood of achieving serial biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability to obtain serial biopsies is dependent on the patient's experience. To understand&#xD;
      the clonal progression of cancer and validate predictive and prognostic markers of response,&#xD;
      studies now target biopsies both at enrollment and at progression. As Investigators strive to&#xD;
      achieve this, improving our understanding of the patient's experience will help us identify&#xD;
      factors that positively and negatively impact on patient participation and influence the&#xD;
      probability of successfully obtaining sequential samples.&#xD;

      Both primary and secondary objectives will be assessed in a questionnaire. Primary Objectives&#xD;
      To assess the impact of research biopsies on patients quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To assess the impact of diagnostic biopsies on quality of life in&#xD;
      comparison to research biopsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the true complication rates associated with biopsies. To compare types of biopsies&#xD;
      - surgical versus radiological with respect to implications on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the individual potentially modifiable factors of reason for biopsy; perceived risk;&#xD;
      perceived benefit; wait time for biopsy; wait time for results; complications; and altruism&#xD;
      and association with anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine which factors are associated with a higher and lower likelihood of achieving&#xD;
      serial biopsies.&#xD;
