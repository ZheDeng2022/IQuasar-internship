  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center study of the safety and efficacy of Juvedérm Voluma for the treatment&#xD;
      of hypognathism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each qualified subject will undergo treatment with Juvedérm Voluma in the anterior and&#xD;
      lateral chin for volume correction. Prior to treatment, the principal investigator will&#xD;
      evaluate the severity of chin recession using a 90 degree image and a goniometer to measure&#xD;
      the angle from the glabella to the chin. Subjects will be eligible for injection if the angle&#xD;
      measures between 145 - 160 degrees. Facial digital photography will be captured prior to&#xD;
      treatment and at each subsequent visit. The subject will complete a safety and injection site&#xD;
      response (ISR) diary beginning on the evening of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return at Day 3 and Day 14 after initial treatment, at which time the&#xD;
      subject will undergo photography and the investigator will rate treatment improvement (GAIS).&#xD;
      An independent image analysis technician will assess the degree of correction. The&#xD;
      investigator will evaluate the treatment area for any adverse events (AEs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will return 30 days after initial treatment, and the principal investigator will&#xD;
      determine if a touch-up treatment is warranted. If deemed necessary, a touch-up treatment may&#xD;
      be administered. Facial digital photography will be captured prior to treatment and following&#xD;
      treatment. The subject will return 3 days after the touch-up to undergo digital photography&#xD;
      and for the principal investigator to assess safety/improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial or touch-up treatment, whichever is last, routine follow-up visits for safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness will occur at 1 (30 days), 2, 4, 6, 9 (telephone call only) and 12 months.&#xD;
      At all follow-up visits, facial digital photography will be captured and the investigator&#xD;
      will rate treatment improvement (GAIS).. At screening and at Months 1, 2, 4, 6 and month 12&#xD;
      subjects will complete the satisfaction of face overall module of the FACE-Q questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study will be to assess the feasibility of Voluma XC for the treatment of&#xD;
      hypoplastic chins&#xD;

      Primary Objective: To evaluate efficacy of Voluma XC for the treatment of hypoplastic chins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To evaluate patient satisfaction and improvement of GAIS following&#xD;
      treatment with Voluma for hypoplastic chins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected outcome following deep (dermal and/or supra periosteal) injection of Voluma when&#xD;
      used to treat hypognathism is significant improvement in the facial angle of the chin.&#xD;
      Significant improvement defined as the mean change in the facial angle of the face measured&#xD;
      by the blinded digital image analysis technician. A secondary effectiveness measure will be&#xD;
      patient and treating investigator measure of improvement using the FACE-Q questionnaires as&#xD;
      well as the mean change in the GAIS score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will span a total of approximately 15 months: an estimated 2 months for recruitment&#xD;
      and 12 months for follow-up. Each subject's participation will encompass a screening/baseline&#xD;
      visit, Day 3 and a Day 14 visit with a possible 1 month touch up (if touch up occurs then a&#xD;
      day 3 and a day 14 and a month 1 will occur following the touch up then followed by study&#xD;
      visits at 2, 4, 6, month and a 9 month telephone safety visit and a 12 month clinic visit&#xD;
      (end of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      JUVÉDERM® Voluma XC Injectable Gel No control treatment will be used. The primary&#xD;
      effectiveness endpoint will be one month after optimal correction has been attained according&#xD;
      to the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The image analysis technician performing the evaluation will be blinded as to the amount of&#xD;
      product injected. All digital photos will be analyzed in a batched, randomized format&#xD;
      (including the pre-treatment photos) in order to blind the technician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment Criteria (if applicable) Study subjects will return for possible touch up 1 month&#xD;
      following initial injection. At this time, the investigator and the subject will evaluate the&#xD;
      outcome of the initial treatment. In the event that both the subject and the investigator&#xD;
      concur that additional treatment is indicated because of a suboptimal aesthetic correction, a&#xD;
      repeat injection of Voluma XC will be performed. If a repeat treatment does take place then&#xD;
      the subject will then be followed at Day 3 and Day 14 and Day 30. In the event that the&#xD;
      subject does not want retreatment the subject will remain in the study and followed through&#xD;
      the course of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will undergo treatment and return for follow-up visits throughout the study&#xD;
      period. At each visit, the Principal Investigator or designee will record AEs and concomitant&#xD;
      medications, therapies, and treatments. All reported AEs will be documented. The procedures&#xD;
      to be performed at each visit are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections of Voluma will be accomplished using a serial puncture and fanning technique with&#xD;
      the needle inserted to the periosteal plane as well as in the subcutaneous plane. The&#xD;
      treatment area will include the medial and lateral chin as defined: lateral chin landmark is&#xD;
      the depressor anguli oris.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photography will be mandatory to participate in this clinical trial. Subjects will consent to&#xD;
      allow Kenneth R. Beer, M.D., PA permission to use photographs for FDA advisory panel&#xD;
      meetings, scientific journals and conferences, advertising, publicity, and promotional&#xD;
      purposes as one option. Additional options will be given to the subject to allow Kenneth R.&#xD;
      Beer, M.D., PA to only use photographs for FDA advisory panel meetings and scientific&#xD;
      journals and conference, but does NOT have permission to use the photographs for advertising,&#xD;
      publicity, or promotional purposes as option 2. The third and final option allows the subject&#xD;
      to have photographs taken, but subject does NOT give permission to use photographs for FDA&#xD;
      advisory panel meetings, scientific journals and conferences, advertising, publicity, and&#xD;
      promotional purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The photographs will be taken with 3D photography system and will be analyzed by a third&#xD;
      party which is hired by the sponsor. Full confidentiality cannot be maintained due to the&#xD;
      entire face will be photographed. Confidentiality will try to be maintained by only using&#xD;
      subject identifiers. If at a later date the subject does not want photos used for other&#xD;
      purposes that were consented to the subject at any time during the course of the study will&#xD;
      be allowed to change and update the photograph consent. If subject withdraws all photo&#xD;
      consent the subject will be discontinued from the study since photographs are mandatory to&#xD;
      participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator will ensure that each subject meets the eligibility criteria. The&#xD;
      Principal Investigator will capture a 90 degree angle photo and using a goniometer to&#xD;
      manually measure the angle between the glabella and the mentalis and subjects with angles&#xD;
      between 145-160° will be included in the study. The Principal Investigator or designee will&#xD;
      record reasons for those subjects who withdraw consent prior to randomization or who do not&#xD;
      meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal Investigator or designee will collect and record the subject's demographic&#xD;
      information, medical and surgical history, cosmetic procedures history, and Fitzpatrick skin&#xD;
      phototype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Treatment Visit (Day 0) If Screening and Day 0 visit are on the same day, all&#xD;
      procedures performed at Screening will be performed at Screening will be performed once,&#xD;
      prior to treatment administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment, vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate, and&#xD;
      temperature only) will be measured. Study staff will attain subject demographics, medical,&#xD;
      cosmetic, and dental history. A negative UPT test will be confirmed prior to randomization.&#xD;
      Photos will be taken with the Canfield Vectra 3D system. Subjects will be asked to complete&#xD;
      the FACE-Q questionnaire licensed by Memorial Sloan Kettering (3). Concomitant medications&#xD;
      will be captured. A subject diary will be given to each subject to complete for 30 days. A&#xD;
      Investigator assessment of chin function will be completed prior to injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 (+/- 2days) Subject will return to clinic for Day 3 follow up. Subject will be&#xD;
      photographed with the Canfield Vectra 3D system and the investigator will rate the&#xD;
      improvement using the GAIS score and Investigator Assessment of chin function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 14 (+/-3 days) Subject will return to clinic for Day 14 follow up. Subject will be&#xD;
      photographed with the Canfield Vectra 3D system and the investigator will rate the&#xD;
      improvement using the GAIS score and Investigator Assessment of chin function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 30 retreatment visit or Month 1 visit (+/-7days) Subject will be assessed by investigator&#xD;
      to determine if retreatment is needed. If no retreatment occurs then visit will become the&#xD;
      one month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 1 Visit Subject will be photographed with the Canfield Vectra 3D system, investigator&#xD;
      GAIS score and FACE Q questionnaire completed, adverse events captured, collection of diary,&#xD;
      and concurrent procedures documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retreatment Visit If retreatment is needed the visit schedule will be as follows from the&#xD;
      date of retreatment day 3 (+/- 2 days), day 14 (+/- 3 days) and then day 30 (+/- 7 days).&#xD;
      Subject and investigator will then complete Month 1 visit requirements as documented above.&#xD;
      (Same procedures will be followed from initial injection) Month 2 (+/- 14 days) Subject will&#xD;
      be photographed with the Canfield Vectra 3D system, investigator GAIS score, and Investigator&#xD;
      Assessment of chin function, Face Q questionnaire, adverse events and concurrent procedures&#xD;
      captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 4 (+/- 14 days) Subject will be photographed with the Canfield Vectra 3D system,&#xD;
      investigator GAIS score, and Investigator Assessment of chin function, Face Q questionnaire,&#xD;
      adverse events and concurrent procedures captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 6(+/- 14 days) Subject will be photographed with the Canfield Vectra 3D system,&#xD;
      investigator GAIS score, and Investigator Assessment of chin function, Face Q questionnaire,&#xD;
      adverse events and concurrent procedures captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Month 9 (+/- 14 days) telephone safety call Subject will be called to review any new&#xD;
      concomitant medications or any new adverse events since month 6 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10 Month 12 (+/-14 days) End of Study Visit Subject will be photographed with the Canfield&#xD;
      Vectra 3D system, investigator GAIS score, and Investigator Assessment of chin function, Face&#xD;
      Q questionnaire, adverse events and concurrent procedures captured. End of Study page&#xD;
      completed Instructions for the Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following injection with Voluma, application of ice for 10 minutes per hour while awake&#xD;
           may help to reduce swelling and this may be used for a period of 3-5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discomfort may be treated with acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gentle massage may also be used to minimize lumps and bumps which are more common during&#xD;
           the first 7 days following treatment.&#xD;
