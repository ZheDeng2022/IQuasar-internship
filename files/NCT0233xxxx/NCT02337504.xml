  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tremendous efforts and resources have been expended by the global community to ensure that&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) is available and accessible to all that need it. Despite these,&#xD;
      less than a half of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected patients requiring ART in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are receiving it. Some of the most significant barriers to attaining&#xD;
      universal access to ART in this region include large distances that patients have to travel&#xD;
      to clinic, time spent in accessing care and a significant shortage of human resources. In&#xD;
      order to address these challenges the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates alternative&#xD;
      care models especially those that incorporate task-shifting to lower cadre health care&#xD;
      workers and lay persons. Unfortunately, few such alternative care models have been identified&#xD;
      and very little data exist on their long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project we will develop and assess an alternative care model that is established on&#xD;
      the platform of a HIV-infected peer-group (ART Co-op) and facilitated by community health&#xD;
      workers (CHW's). This model of care is intended to decentralize ART services and bring them&#xD;
      closer to the patients. Specifically, we will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Develop an acceptable and sustainable model for extending HIV care and treatment into&#xD;
           the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform a pilot study comparing the outcomes of patients enrolled in the ART Co-ops&#xD;
           program to those receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the cost savings and cost effectiveness of ART Co-ops.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Universal Access to ART: Since 2003 there has been a concerted international effort to&#xD;
      increase access to ART for HIV-infected individuals living in low and middle income&#xD;
      countries.[1-6] Despite the substantial increase in the number of people receiving ART in&#xD;
      SSA, by the end of 2010 only 49% of the 10,400,000 persons in need of ART were receiving&#xD;
      treatment.[7-8] This is far short of the universal ART access goal of ≥80% of those in need&#xD;
      of treatment.[2] Given that SSA commands only 3% of the world's health care providers and&#xD;
      contributes to only 1% of the global health care expenditures, a significant barrier to&#xD;
      meeting this goal is the profound shortage of infrastructure resources, most specifically,&#xD;
      trained medical personnel.[9-10] With regard to Kenya, WHO estimates that the country will&#xD;
      only be able to provide 25% of the 240,000 physicians needed to serve the country's&#xD;
      population by 2015.[11] New initiatives under consideration such as &quot;Test and Treat&quot;, Option&#xD;
      B+ (ART for all pregnant women with lifelong maintenance) and treatment of index partners&#xD;
      within HIV-discordant relationships will further tax the already strained health care work&#xD;
      force.[12-22] As such, unless new care models can be developed that require fewer health care&#xD;
      provider resources while maintaining optimal patient outcomes, the goal of universal access&#xD;
      is unachievable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention in Care: The high program attrition rates in SSA make achieving universal access&#xD;
      even more complex. A meta-analysis of HIV-care programs in resource-constrained settings&#xD;
      estimated one and two-year attrition rates (defined as death or lost to follow up (LTFU)) to&#xD;
      be 22.6% (range 7-45%) and 25% (11-32%), respectively.[23] Of these approximately 41% were&#xD;
      confirmed dead and 59% were LTFU. Patients LTFU represent heterogeneous outcomes including&#xD;
      death, in care elsewhere, and disengaged from care.[24] Patients disengaged from care are at&#xD;
      high risk of morbidity, mortality and transmitting HIV.[25-29] Despite the desirability of&#xD;
      providing outreach to all patients LTFU, the cost of such programs frequently comes at the&#xD;
      expense of expanding ART access. Geographic accessibility (distance to clinic and&#xD;
      transportation costs) and shortages in health care personnel (excessive clinic waiting times)&#xD;
      are documented barriers to retention.[24-25,30-35] As such, the optimal ART care model in&#xD;
      resource constrained settings should minimize LTFU through reductions in transport time and&#xD;
      costs as well as reducing clinic waiting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Task Shifting: In response to the severe shortage of health care workers in SSA, WHO and&#xD;
      other organizations have advocated task shifting to lower cadre health care workers and lay&#xD;
      individuals, including persons living with HIV (PLWHIV), in order to maximize patients'&#xD;
      access to ART.[36-39] Such strategies decrease physician resource requirements, allow for&#xD;
      decentralized ART delivery, and improve patient retention.[26,40-50] Médecins Sans Frontières&#xD;
      (MSF) has developed a model of care which allows PLWHIV to become active participants in&#xD;
      their own care and the care of other community members.[49]They successfully formed Community&#xD;
      ART Groups (CAGs) to facilitate ART distribution, promote adherence, provide social support&#xD;
      and monitor clinical status. During monthly group meetings a CAG member was chosen to&#xD;
      represent each group at the clinic where each member's status was discussed and the group's&#xD;
      monthly ART supply was picked up. Retention was exceptionally high with 97.5% patients&#xD;
      remaining in care for a median follow-up period of 12.9 months (range 8.5-14 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost Effectiveness: Site-level cost studies of HIV care services have shown that human&#xD;
      resource costs are a major determination of treatment scale-up costs and, as such, support&#xD;
      the recommendations for task-shifting.[51-53] Despite this, only a few cost and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness studies have assessed alternative ART-delivery models.[54-59]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Justification for study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to refine and test a HIV-care model which utilizes CHWs and PLWHIV&#xD;
      participating in their own care. The traditional ART-care model requires that patients attend&#xD;
      monthly to every 4 monthly clinic visits conducted by a physician, clinical officer (CO) or a&#xD;
      nurse. This model utilizes significant health worker and patient time resources,patient&#xD;
      monetary resources for travel,and is a care-model disconnected from the local community. This&#xD;
      proposal shifts the paradigm from intensive clinic-based supervision of ART-delivery to&#xD;
      monitoring by community-based cooperative groups(ART Co-ops). We believe this innovative&#xD;
      model will:1)decrease the amount of healthcare worker resources required to provide&#xD;
      HIV-care;2)decrease costs;3)improve retention in care;and 4)increase access to ART and 5)&#xD;
      maintain the durability of a patients ART regimen with limited health encounters.Given that&#xD;
      this model utilizes systems and stakeholders already present in the community we believe that&#xD;
      it is scalable to other resource constrained environments.ART Co-ops would provide a logical&#xD;
      gateway from the community to HIV-clinics for HIV-infected individuals identified during&quot;&#xD;
      Test and Treat&quot;initiatives and a community-based health resource for all HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals(i.e., index partners in a discordant relationship and pregnant women).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended/potential use of study findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By achieving the specific aims we anticipate that we will develop a model of HIV-care that&#xD;
      will minimize the number of health care providers needed to deliver HIV care while maximizing&#xD;
      patient outcomes including durability of ART regimen and engagement and retention in care.We&#xD;
      anticipate that such a model will be scalable to other settings in SSA as the resources&#xD;
      necessary for this model exist in most communities within the region. Adoption of such models&#xD;
      has the potential to allow for more cost effective delivery of ART-care in&#xD;
      resource-constrained settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design/locations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct formative research (assessment of secondary data, FGDs and KIIs) to guide the&#xD;
      development and refinement of the ART Co-ops model as proposed in Specific Aim 1. A&#xD;
      randomized prospective trial will compare the outcomes of subjects enrolled in the ART Co-ops&#xD;
      Model to those receiving standard of care in Specific Aim 3. This study will be conducted at&#xD;
      the AMPATH Partnership clinic in Kitale, Kenya, part of an HIV care and treatment program&#xD;
      currently operating in 108 clinics in western Kenya [60-61]. The AMPATH clinic in Kitale&#xD;
      currently has over 19,000 patients enrolled with &gt;12,000 on ART. This is one of AMPATHs most&#xD;
      rapidly growing clinic populations which makes it an ideal site for studying and implementing&#xD;
      the use of a community care model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long term goal is the development and successful implementation of an HIV care system&#xD;
      that can facilitate the achievement of universal access to and maximize retention in ART&#xD;
      programs in SSA. The major objective of this proposal is to develop and assess a&#xD;
      community-based ART delivery model established on the platform of a HIV-infected peer-group&#xD;
      (ART Co-op) and facilitated by CHWs. Our central hypothesis is that the durability of the&#xD;
      patient's ART regimen (requiring no change to second line for failure) will remain equivalent&#xD;
      to those seen in clinic regularly and that clinic outcomes (such as adherence to visits&#xD;
      (clinic visits for the control group and ART Co-ops for the intervention group), retention in&#xD;
      care (receiving care or being seen in an ART Co-op group within 3 months of the last&#xD;
      scheduled visit), adherence to ART(&gt;90s% ART taken on time))will be similar between this&#xD;
      community-based model and the standard of care. We base this hypothesis on our previous&#xD;
      studies utilizing task-shifting to provide ART care as well as recent data from&#xD;
      Mozambique[49]on the use of community ART-Groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims/Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1: Develop an acceptable model for extending HIV care and treatment into the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Information gathered through FGDs and KIIs will allow refinements in the ART Co-op model&#xD;
      that will promote community and patient acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA2: Develop a sustainable model for extending HIV care and treatment into the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: ART Co-ops can be assembled and managed with the assistance of CHWs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA3: Perform a pilot study comparing the outcomes of patients enrolled in the ART Co-ops&#xD;
      program to those receiving standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3a: Adherence to HIV-care visits (Co-op group meetings and /or clinic visits) and retention&#xD;
      in care will be better in the ART Co-ops group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3b: Adherence to ART will be equivalent between the groups. H3c: Durability of the ART&#xD;
      regimen will be equivalent between the groups. H3d: Patient perceived quality of life will be&#xD;
      better in the ART Co-op group participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA4: Determine the cost savings and cost effectiveness of ART Co-ops. H4a: ART Co-ops will&#xD;
      generate cost savings to patients as well as the HIV care program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4b: ART Co-ops will be more cost effective than the standard of care when viewed from the&#xD;
      program perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General approach: A variety of approaches are used in the Specific Aims and their respective&#xD;
      hypotheses. Specific Aim 1 is qualitative, utilizing the information gathered from KIIs and&#xD;
      FGDs to inform refinements in the ART Co-op model necessary to promote community and patient&#xD;
      acceptance and to prove its' sustainability within the community. Specific Aim 2 is process&#xD;
      oriented, allowing for the assembly of ART Co-ops. Specific Aim 3 is comparative, allowing&#xD;
      for an assessment of the ART Co-op groups as compared to the standard of care in their&#xD;
      anticipated ability to improve adherence to HIV-care visits and patient's perceived quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL), while maintaining an equivalent level of adherence and durability of ART&#xD;
      regimen. Specific Aim 4 is descriptive, evaluating the interventions cost effectiveness.&#xD;
