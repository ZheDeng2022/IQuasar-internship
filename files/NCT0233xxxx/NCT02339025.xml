      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers at the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense are trying to&#xD;
      learn more about what causes cancer, heart disease, and other health problems. To do this,&#xD;
      they gather data on risk factors and biological markers. They get these data from large&#xD;
      groups of people in long-running studies. As these groups of people age, researchers must&#xD;
      form new groups. TRICARE is a health insurance program for uniformed service members and&#xD;
      their families. It is a major part of the Military Health System. Researchers hope to form a&#xD;
      new study group from TRICARE members. This study will test if TRICARE members will take part&#xD;
      in a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test if TRICARE members will take part in a research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - TRICARE members aged 35 74 with military primary care providers at Walter Reed National&#xD;
      Military Medical Center. They must not have a prior diagnosis of cancer other than&#xD;
      non-melanoma skin cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out a survey. It will ask about their risk factors for cancer and&#xD;
           other chronic diseases. Their medical records will be reviewed. They will give a blood&#xD;
           sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a larger study is formed, then participants data will be used in the larger study.&#xD;
           They may be asked to give more samples.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      DCEG has a long history of developing and running major cohort studies, and these form the&#xD;
&#xD;
      backbone of the research portfolio in the Division. Existing cohorts, including but not&#xD;
      limited to&#xD;
&#xD;
      AARP, PLCO and USRT, have been extremely productive and have generated a wealth of&#xD;
&#xD;
      information about potential cancer risk factors and biological markers. In the next decade,&#xD;
      these cohorts will reach the end of their natural lifetime due to the length of time since&#xD;
      the baseline questionnaire, the average age of the participants, and the depletion of&#xD;
      biological samples. There is the need, therefore, to start planning for the next generation&#xD;
      of cohorts that will be able to continue to address current and future hypotheses about the&#xD;
      etiology of cancer. A working group within DCEG was formed to discuss potential settings, and&#xD;
      a cohort study within the US military setting was selected as one of the promising&#xD;
      possibilities. Attractive features conducive to conducting a cohort study using the TriCare&#xD;
      health insurance system was the possibility of linkage to numerous electronic databases,&#xD;
      including those that maintain addresses and enrollment status, pharmacy databases, medical&#xD;
      records databases, and cancer registry and mortality databases. Tricare is a health care&#xD;
      insurance program for uniformed service members (active, Guard/Reserve, retired) and their&#xD;
      families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching, long-term, objective is to build a new prospective multi-center adult cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      among the membership of the Tricare insurance plan. The cohort will have rich exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
      information and accurate outcome information that will be used as a Divisionwide resource to&#xD;
&#xD;
      investigate novel hypotheses about the etiology of cancer, using questionnaire data, medical&#xD;
&#xD;
      records, tumor tissue and serial biospecimens. Given the large-scale nature of the&#xD;
      anticipated cohort study, we plan to begin the work by conducting a feasibility study at&#xD;
      military treatment facility, Walter Reed National Medical Center (WRNMMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the feasibility study is to help us determine what will be possible in a larger&#xD;
      effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several other feasibility studies are being conducted by other groups in DCEG. Depending on&#xD;
      the outcome of these studies, DCEG senior leadership will make a decision on whether one&#xD;
      large cohort or several smaller cohorts should move forward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will have two parts: Part 1) we will randomly select and invite to&#xD;
      participate, by post, a stratified sample of 1,000 eligible beneficiaries aged 35-74 years&#xD;
      old. All participants will be asked to access a study website, complete an on-line consent&#xD;
      form which includes consent for access to electronic health records, complete an on-line&#xD;
      questionnaire, and provide a blood specimen within three months of enrolling in the study.&#xD;
      The letter will offer a paper-based option for consent and questionnaire completion for those&#xD;
      unwilling or unable to access the website. The following outcomes will be evaluated: %&#xD;
&#xD;
      enrollment, % questionnaire completion, % agreement to blood draw, % completion of blood&#xD;
      draws, the time between enrollment and blood draw, duration of enrollment in Tricare, % with&#xD;
&#xD;
      supplemental civilian insurance, feasibility of linking electronic patient databases to each&#xD;
      other and to the questionnaire data, and available characteristics of the participants and&#xD;
      the non-participants; Part 2) Using MDR files, the Defense Health Agency (DHA) will provide&#xD;
      frequencies on place of cancer diagnosis and treatment (military treatment facility vs.&#xD;
      civilian hospital) and availability of treatment data for eligible beneficiaries with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of cancer other than nonmelanoma skin cancer within the past 12 months. No&#xD;
      individual level data will be collected. The protocol is formatted for submission to the&#xD;
      WRNMMC.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be selected according to the MTF, gender, age, and race/ethnicity.&#xD;
        Beneficiaries aged 35-74 years with military primary care providers at WRNMMC or FBCH or&#xD;
        beneficiaries living in these catchment or service areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Beneficiaries less than 35 years of age will be excluded because cancer incidence at these&#xD;
        ages is low and therefore it is unlikely to be feasible from a cost/information perspective&#xD;
        to include them. Beneficiaries 75 years of age or older will be excluded because it is&#xD;
        unlikely they will have long-term follow-up.&#xD;
