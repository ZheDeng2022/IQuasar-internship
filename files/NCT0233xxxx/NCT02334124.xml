    <textblock>
      Many children every year present to the Emergency Department (ED) at The Royal Children's&#xD;
      Hospital (RCH) with cellulitis (skin infection). If it is mild, the children can go home with&#xD;
      oral antibiotic treatment. If it is complicated and severe, these children are admitted to&#xD;
      hospital for intravenous (IV, through a drip) antibiotic treatment. There is a middle group&#xD;
      with uncomplicated moderate/severe cellulitis who require IV antibiotics but who are not&#xD;
      acutely unwell. In order to determine whether it is just as effective for children with&#xD;
      uncomplicated moderate to severe cellulitis to receive antibiotic treatment at home (via&#xD;
      Hospital-In-The-Home) as it is to receive antibiotic treatment in hospital, there is a need&#xD;
      to conduct a larger study and randomly assign children to receive either HITH or hospital&#xD;
      ward care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research question to be addressed is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In children with moderate/severe uncomplicated cellulitis, is the failure rate at 2 days&#xD;
      following the first dose of antibiotic non-inferior for children treated with IV antibiotics&#xD;
      at home compared to the failure rate at 2 days following the first dose for children treated&#xD;
      with IV antibiotics in hospital?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND Adults with cellulitis commonly have IV antibiotics administered&#xD;
      as outpatients, whereas most children are admitted to hospital. Based on a small amount of&#xD;
      literature, it is known that some children with moderate/severe cellulitis can also be safely&#xD;
      be treated at home.This study will include all children with uncomplicated moderate/severe&#xD;
      cellulitis and will therefore demonstrate whether all children with uncomplicated&#xD;
      moderate/severe cellulitis can be effectively treated at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the study demonstrates that it is just as effective to treat these children in the home,&#xD;
      it has the potential to impact on the child and family's quality of life (QOL) as well as&#xD;
      hospital resource management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To compare the failure rate of IV antibiotic treatment of children treated&#xD;
      at home (iv ceftriaxone) with those treated in hospital (iv flucloxacillin) in the first 2&#xD;
      days of treatment following the first dose given in the ED in children with moderate/severe&#xD;
      cellulitis (Moderate/severe: defined in this study, as those assessed by ED doctor to need iv&#xD;
      antibiotics)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time to no progression of cellulitis Time to discharge: number of days (including fractions&#xD;
      of days) from the time of arrival in ED to the time the patient no longer needs&#xD;
      hospital-based interventions/care, whether in hospital or at home Readmission rate&#xD;
      Representation to ED Length of stay in ED Duration of IV antibiotics Rates of IV cannula&#xD;
      needing at least one resiting Complications of cellulitis: development of abscess requiring&#xD;
      drainage after starting IV antibiotics, bacteraemia Adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of ceftriaxone susceptibility in bacteria isolated from a nasal or skin swab of the&#xD;
           affected area&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of S. aureus nasal carriage (methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant)&#xD;
           collected within 48 hours, after 7-14 days, 3 months and 1 year after starting&#xD;
           antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rate of resistant bacteria present in stool samples collected within 48 hours, after&#xD;
           7-14 days, 3 months and 1 year after starting antibiotics. Rates of clinical infection&#xD;
           with resistant organisms up to 1 year after starting antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differential effect of narrow spectrum (flucloxacillin) and broad spectrum (ceftriaxone) on&#xD;
      the nasal and gastrointestinal microbiome from nasal swabs and stool samples collected within&#xD;
      48 hours, after 7-14 days, 3 months and 1 year after starting antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs of hospital versus HITH treatment: including costs of beds, consumables, nursing and&#xD;
      medical time, and overheads including administrative time, information technology, use of&#xD;
      hospital cars Quality of life (QOL) indicators Clinical assessments of cellulitis in terms of&#xD;
      presence of systemic features, surface area affected (longest length axis multiply by the&#xD;
      longest perpendicular axis measured in cm2), severity of swelling (judged by clinician as any&#xD;
      one of the following: mild, moderate or severe), intensity of erythema (judged by clinician&#xD;
      from a scale of 0 to 5, 0=no erythema and 5=severe and whether the function of the affected&#xD;
      area is impaired&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODOLOGY ED clinicians (senior doctors, junior doctors or nurse practitioners) will&#xD;
      identify patients with moderate/severe cellulitis presenting to RCH ED, at the point of&#xD;
      triage or during clinical assessment. The consent will be for randomization, data collection&#xD;
      and follow up which is not part of routine practice. Randomisation to the location of&#xD;
      treatment is the essential difference from normal clinical practice. Where parents do not&#xD;
      give consent, the ED clinician will make the decision on where the patient should be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS Although in this proposed study the intervention is treating children at home,&#xD;
      currently, based on the prospective observational study, 50% of children with uncomplicated&#xD;
      moderate/severe cellulitis are already being sent home by ED clinicians to receive daily IV&#xD;
      antibiotics at home. The only new intervention is the randomisation process which will&#xD;
      provide a high level of evidence for this practice which has become a standard practice in&#xD;
      ED. The researcher or ED clinician will have access to randomization software and perform the&#xD;
      randomisation process. Patients who are randomised to HITH will be prescribed iv ceftriaxone&#xD;
      (50mg/kg once daily) as per current practice and those randomised to the ward will be&#xD;
      prescribed iv flucloxacillin (50mg/kg 6 hourly). On insertion of the IV cannula, the ED&#xD;
      clinician will obtain a blood culture. If there is skin breakdown, a skin swab would be done&#xD;
      as per routine clinical practice. Prior to commencing IV antibiotics. In addition, the&#xD;
      researcher or ED clinician will ask parents to take 2 photos of the cellulitis area using&#xD;
      their own camera/phone (if available) after the affected area is demarcated with indelible&#xD;
      ink with a tape measure placed along side the area affected. This will be helpful for the&#xD;
      reviewing doctor the following day to judge whether there is an improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first dose of antibiotics will be commenced in ED. For children assigned to hospital ward&#xD;
      treatment, the child will be transferred to the ward and the IV infusion continued. Children&#xD;
      assigned to the HITH will complete their first dose in ED before going home. The management&#xD;
      after this point will be as per usual practice. The responsible ward doctor will review and&#xD;
      make all management decisions for patients admitted to the ward whereas the HITH registrar&#xD;
      will review the patients on HITH. The research assistant (RA) (a paediatric registrar) will&#xD;
      meet with the child and their parent(s) within 24 hours of consent being obtained to answer&#xD;
      any further questions parents or participants may have about the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no guidelines on when to start IV antibiotic in cellulitis. The&#xD;
      investigators' recommendation is provided under section 'Inclusion criteria' and this&#xD;
      reflects consensus among RCH ED clinicians. Some patients who did not require IV antibiotics&#xD;
      may be recruited but they will exist in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nasal swab and stool sample will be requested at four different time points: 1) within 48&#xD;
      hours of the first antibiotic dose; 2) 7-14 days after starting antibiotics; 3) 3 months&#xD;
      after starting antibiotics; and 4) 1 year after starting antibiotics. At each time point,&#xD;
      additional information will be collected: previous overseas travel, previous hospital&#xD;
      admissions, household member who has been admitted to hospital overseas, other antibiotic&#xD;
      use, other infections, medical visits or hospital admissions. These samples are optional and&#xD;
      do not affect participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per normal practice, patients will be switched to oral therapy after 2-4 days of IV&#xD;
      antibiotics, when there is clinical improvement of the cellulitis. Based on the current&#xD;
      prospective study, both HITH patients and ward patients are switched to oral antibiotics when&#xD;
      there is a reduction in fever, swelling, erythema and improvement of function of affected&#xD;
      area (eg. Previously limping, now walking). Once changed to oral antibiotics (as per RCH&#xD;
      clinical practice guidelines; cephalexin 25mg/kg 6 hourly, total dose may be combined and&#xD;
      divided to twice daily), patients are usually discharged from hospital care and normally not&#xD;
      followed up any further in hospital. In this study, the investigators are offering all&#xD;
      participants a follow up in clinic 7-14 days (by the RA who is a paediatric registrar) after&#xD;
      discharge from hospital. Parents will be requested to bring a stool sample from the patient&#xD;
      to the clinic review but this is not mandatory.&#xD;
