    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been pivotal in accomplishing image guided radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IGRT) in patients with pancreatic cancer by allowing precise contouring and identification&#xD;
      of target lesions in the pancreas via placement of fiducials using fine needle aspiration&#xD;
      (FNA) needles. Currently, back-loading the fiducials is the only option for preparing&#xD;
      delivery of fiducials via the EUS approach. A prototype 22-Gauge EUS needle preloaded with&#xD;
      four fiducials has recently been developed, and used in a porcine models with successful&#xD;
      results. There are no randomized controlled trials comparing total duration of time needed&#xD;
      for placement of fiducials using technical success of the traditional back- loading technique&#xD;
      of fiducial markers to the new preloaded needles in regards to EUS based fiducial marker&#xD;
      placement for IGRT in pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a 22 G preloaded needle for EUS guided fiducial marker placement in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Be delivered in at least require 60% less of the procedure time that it takes for&#xD;
           traditional back-loaded 22G needles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve overall procedure efficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintain comparable technical success and adverse event rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To compare the procedure time of 22G needle placement of three Visicoil (brand of flexible&#xD;
      linear back-loaded fiducial markers) fiducial markers and 22G needle preloaded fiducial&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare adverse event rates in 22G needle placement of Visicoil fiducial markers and&#xD;
           22G needle preloaded fiducial markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare endpoints of technical success defined as proper placement of two to three&#xD;
           fiducial markers in a pancreatic neoplasm in 22G needle placement of Visicoil fiducial&#xD;
           markers and 22G needle preloaded fiducial markers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the twelfth most common cancer worldwide. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma has become standard&#xD;
      of care and is associated with higher rates of complete resection ultimately with improvement&#xD;
      of overall survival in this patient population. Radiation therapy to a soft tissue organ such&#xD;
      as the pancreas can be difficult, as it is not readily visualized radiographically. Image&#xD;
      guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is a commonly implemented modality for delivering high doses&#xD;
      of radiation directed at cancer tissue, while reducing collateral damage to adjacent healthy&#xD;
      tissue. Fiducials, which are inert radiographic markers typically made from gold or carbon,&#xD;
      can be placed in and around the tumor to delineate tumor margins to allow for IGRT Endoscopic&#xD;
      ultrasound (EUS) has been pivotal in accomplishing IGRT by allowing precise contouring and&#xD;
      identification of target lesions in the pancreas via placement of fiducials. This has&#xD;
      traditionally been accomplished with the use of 19-gauge or 22-gauge fine needle aspiration&#xD;
      (FNA) needles. To prepare the needle for fiducial placement, one to two fiducials are&#xD;
      manually back-loaded into the tip of the needle after the stylet has been removed. In order&#xD;
      to hold the fiducials within the needle, sterile lubrication or bone wax can be applied. Once&#xD;
      the pancreatic mass has been targeted, fiducial injection can be accomplished via stylet&#xD;
      reinsertion or sterile water injection. Currently, back-loading the fiducials is the only&#xD;
      option for preparing delivery of fiducials via the EUS approach. Difficulties associated with&#xD;
      fiducial loading and deployment can increase procedure duration due to cumbersome fiducial&#xD;
      back-loading, fiducial misplacement &amp; migration, as well as inability to pass the fiducial&#xD;
      marker through the needle due to endoscope angulation. Observational studies have sited a&#xD;
      technical success rate of 86-100% using 19 and/or 22 gauge needles with average procedure&#xD;
      time between 7-12 minutes using the fiducial back-loading technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new mode of fiducial delivery has recently been developed that hopes to circumvent some of&#xD;
      the technical issues inherent to traditional fiducial marker loading and deployment. A&#xD;
      prototype 22-Gauge EUS needle preloaded with four fiducials has been used in a porcine models&#xD;
      with successful deployment 95.6% of the time all accurate on predetermined targets. They were&#xD;
      deemed easy to pass, relatively easy to deploy, and easily visualized on EUS, with excellent&#xD;
      fluoroscopic and CT visualization. In addition, time for deployment was on average less than&#xD;
      60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there is no randomized controlled trials comparing total duration of time needed for&#xD;
      placement of fiducials using technical success of the traditional back- loading technique of&#xD;
      fiducial markers to the new preloaded needles in regards to EUS based fiducial marker&#xD;
      placement for IGRT in pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Randomization be performed and&#xD;
      patients will undergo Linear EUS and have fiducial marker placement via a traditional 22G&#xD;
      back-loaded needle (Visicoil) or the new 22G preloaded needle (PreLoad4). Multiple endpoints&#xD;
      will be recorded, including total length of procedure, how many markers are successfully&#xD;
      deployed, and technical success (Ease of passage of delivery system, ease of deployment of&#xD;
      fiducials, EUS visualization of delivery system needle, EUS visual appearance of fiducials,&#xD;
      and time for fiducial placement defined as starting at time of removing the needle from its&#xD;
      packaging and ending time as removal of needle after final marker deployment). Fiducial&#xD;
      marker location will be confirmed via fluoroscopy at time of placement and on 4D treatment&#xD;
      planning CT ordered by the radiation oncologist for simulation. Patients will be discharged&#xD;
      home after post procedure recovery. Patients will be contacted at home by a research&#xD;
      coordinator or endoscopy staff 24-48 hours and 7-10 days after the procedure to document any&#xD;
      immediate and delayed complications. Patients will return for their IGRT visit, and any&#xD;
      evidence of fiducial marker migration will be recorded by the radiation oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of a 22 G preloaded needle for EUS guided fiducial marker placement in patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Be delivered in at least require 60% less of the procedure time that it takes for&#xD;
           traditional back-loaded 22G needles&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve overall procedure efficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Maintain comparable technical success and adverse event rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) To compare the procedure time of 22G needle placement of three Visicoil fiducial markers&#xD;
      and 22G needle preloaded fiducial markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare adverse event rates in 22G needle placement of Visicoil fiducial markers and&#xD;
           22G needle preloaded fiducial markers&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare endpoints of technical success defined as proper placement of two to three&#xD;
           fiducial markers in a pancreatic neoplasm in 22G needle placement of Visicoil fiducial&#xD;
