  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AC0010 is a novel, potent, small molecule irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that&#xD;
      selectively targets mutant forms of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) while sparing&#xD;
      wild-type (WT) EGFR. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      safety profile of oral AC0010; to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or&#xD;
      recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of oral AC0010; to assess the safety and efficacy of AC0010&#xD;
      in previously treated mutant EGFR in NSCLC patients with EGFR T790M mutation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer remains the most common cancer worldwide with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      accounting for 85% of cases. Molecularly targeted therapies have proven to be superior to&#xD;
      chemotherapy for NSCLC patients whose tumors have mutations in EGFR. Recent studies have&#xD;
      established tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as the gold standard for treating&#xD;
      EGFR-mutation-positive NCSLC. However, patients on TKIs eventually progress, and in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of cases, progression is due to development of an additional mutation&#xD;
      called T790M. AC0010 may provide an effective therapy for a patient population with few&#xD;
      alternative treatment options. Pre-clinical data demonstrated that AC0010 inhibits T790M. It&#xD;
      is anticipated that AC0010 may promote cell death in tumor cells with the T790M mutation,&#xD;
      thus providing possible therapeutic benefit in patients who have developed T790M-mediated&#xD;
      resistance to previous TKIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two-part, open-label study of oral AC0010 administered twice-daily in previously&#xD;
      treated NSCLC patients who have documented evidence of an activating mutation in the EGFR&#xD;
      gene and have failed treatment with an EGFR inhibitor such as erlotinib, gefitinib or&#xD;
      afatinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will include 2 parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      phase 1 : Dose-escalation Period with 28-day cycles; Optional Treatment Extension Period&#xD;
      starting on Day 29&#xD;
&#xD;
      phase 2 : Evaluation of activity and safety in patients with the EGFR T790M mutation&#xD;
