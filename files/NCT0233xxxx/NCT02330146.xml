  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to assess the safety profile of RCT-01 injections as&#xD;
      compared to placebo injections. This study will also measure the impact these injections will&#xD;
      have on tendon structure and function and the symptoms of Achilles tendinosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      28 participants will be selected for this study based on their health status, current/past&#xD;
      medications, and ability to adhere to protocol-related requirements. Prior to entering the&#xD;
      screening phase of the study, all potential study participants will have had to have at least&#xD;
      3 months of therapy for their unilateral, chronic (symptoms &gt;6 months) Achilles tendinosis&#xD;
      directed by a certified physiotherapist without a clinical response. At the first visit and&#xD;
      after providing informed consent participants are evaluated against the study&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria and provide blood samples for screening assessments (including&#xD;
      virology). If suitable for study participation, participants will provide a biopsy from the&#xD;
      scalp from which RCT-01 will be prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluations of participants' overall health and tendinosis, in particular, will be&#xD;
      performed on the day of injection. Once all baseline assessments have been completed, the&#xD;
      tendon to be treated will be anesthetized and will receive ultrasound-guided injections of&#xD;
      either placebo (cryomedium) or RCT-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return to the clinic for repeat assessments of their unilateral&#xD;
      Achilles tendinosis and overall health at seven (7) visits over the following 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants will also complete an eccentric training physiotherapy program under the&#xD;
      guidance of a certified physiotherapist for two (2) months after receipt of injections. Total&#xD;
      duration of patient participation is approximately eight (8) months.&#xD;
