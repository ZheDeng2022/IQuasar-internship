      This study evaluates the effectiveness of personalized physical activity coaching combined&#xD;
      with the use of a physical activity monitor to support increased levels of daily physical&#xD;
      activity in individuals with multiple sclerosis. All five participants will receive the&#xD;
      intervention over the four week intervention phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with multiple sclerosis engage in less daily physical activity than the general&#xD;
      population for a variety of reasons. This research project is intended to evaluate whether&#xD;
      individualized coaching combined with the use of a Fitbit physical activity wristband monitor&#xD;
      will improve physical activity levels in individuals with multiple sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following admission into the study, participants will be visited once a week for four weeks&#xD;
      at home by a physical therapist. The participants in consultation with the physical therapist&#xD;
      will set daily physical activity goals for the following week and the participants will be&#xD;
      taught how to monitor their daily activity using a Fitbit physical activity wristband.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to determine whether this intervention is effective in helping&#xD;
      participants increase their levels of daily physical activity and their confidence that they&#xD;
      can successfully engage in daily physical activity. In addition, there will be an evaluation&#xD;
      of changes from pre-intervention to post-intervention in quality of life measures.&#xD;

    <description>The &quot;Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale&quot; is the participant's self-reported confidence in their ability to engage in exercise throughout the day. Each of the 6 items is scored from 0% confidence to 100% confidence. All items are summed and the score is divided by 6 Minimum score: 0 Maximum score:100 Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Multiple Sclerosis Self-Efficacy Scale&quot; is a self-report of impact of multiple sclerosis on quality of life. The 14 statements are answered by selecting one of six options from strongly disagree to strongly agree.&#xD;
Minimum value: 14 Maximum value: 84 Higher scores reflect mean a better outcome.</description>

    <description>The &quot;Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale&quot; is a self-report on how multiple sclerosis has impacted day-to-day life during the past 2 weeks. The 29 items are graded by the participants on a 5 point scale rating from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;extremely&quot;.&#xD;
Minimum score: 29 Maximum Score:145 Higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>

    <description>All five participants in the study will receive this intervention. The participants will be visited in their homes by a physical therapist once a week. The physical therapist will use a coaching technique called motivational interviewing to help the participant develop personal physical activity goals. The participant will discuss their physical activity challenges, and with the help of the physical therapist the participant will set up personal physical activity goals for the following week. The participant will be given a wristband physical activity monitor to wear during the day for four weeks to track their progress in meeting their activity goals.</description>

    <description>The participant will describe their unique physical activity challenges and their physical activity goals with the physical therapist. Using the technique of motivational interviewing, the physical therapist will work with the participant to help identify potential solutions to challenges and set realistic activity goals for the next week. Each week, the participant and the physical therapist will review the previous week's activity data, and the participant's reports of any challenges or problems they encountered in meeting their physical activity goals the previous week. The participant will identify new activity goals for the next week.</description>

          <title>Exercise Self-Efficacy</title>
          <description>The Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale contains 6 statements asking respondents to indicate their level of confidence that they can exercise three times per week for a period of one month, two months, three months, four months, five months and six months. For each of these 6 statements, the respondent selects one answer from 10% increments from 0% to 100%. The responses for all statements are summed and the number is divided by 6.&#xD;
The minimum score is 0, the maximum score is 100. Higher values represent a better outcome.</description>
