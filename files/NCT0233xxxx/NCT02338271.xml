           before the transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in the VAS at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplantation of autologous&#xD;
           adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells, compared to before the transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in the ODI at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplantation of autologous&#xD;
           adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells, compared to before the transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Change in the Short Form (SF)-36 at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the transplantation&#xD;
           of autologous adipose derived mesenchymal stem cells, compared to before the&#xD;
           transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Assessment of the overall improvement in the Disc Height Index (hereinafter referred to&#xD;
           as DHI) at 6 and 12 months after the transplantation of autologous adipose derived&#xD;
