  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Passive flexion of the trunk (relative to the legs) may be accompanied by contraction of the&#xD;
      psoas muscles, even when the subject has been told not to contract any muscles. The psoas&#xD;
      contraction is involuntary and cannot be controlled by the subject. This lack of passivity&#xD;
      might be concomitant with lower back pain: the impairment may be present when lower back pain&#xD;
      is present and/or absent when lower back pain is absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary objective is thus to determine the sensitivity and/or specificity of a&#xD;
      clinical test for impaired hip flexor passivity in cases of lower back pain during passive&#xD;
      flexion of the trunk (from the supine position,).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to show that a negative test (after administration of correcting&#xD;
      measures) is correlated with a decrease in pain (i.e. pain intensity and the functional&#xD;
      repercussions of pain).&#xD;

    <description>Description of the test: the subject lies in the supine position on an exercise mat with his/her feet together. The subject is told to let his/her arms rest loosely by his/her side (as if they were ropes) and to keep the head aligned with the back. The examiner pulls the subject into the sitting position by pulling on the subject's wrists, with passive flexion of the trunk until the hip joint is fully flexed..</description>
