  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab alone or with idelalisib or ibrutinib&#xD;
      works in treating patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other low-grade B-cell&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphomas that have returned after a period of improvement (relapsed) or have not&#xD;
      responded to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Idelalisib and ibrutinib may stop the growth&#xD;
      of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving pembrolizumab&#xD;
      alone or with idelalisib or ibrutinib may be an effective treatment in patients with chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia or other low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Test the efficacy (overall response rate) of single-agent MK-3475 (pembrolizumab) in&#xD;
      relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) (Arm A) other&#xD;
      low grade B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Test the safety of single-agent MK-3475 in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A), other low grade B-NHL&#xD;
      (Arm B), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Test the overall survival, progression free survival, treatment free survival, duration&#xD;
      of response and time to next therapy of single-agent MK-3475 in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A),&#xD;
      other low grade B-NHL (Arm B), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Test the complete response rate of single MK-3475 in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A), other low&#xD;
      grade B-NHL (Arm B), and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Test the safety of MK-3475 in combination with the signal inhibitor (either idelalisib or&#xD;
      ibrutinib) in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A) and CLL with Richter's transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Test the progression-free survival, treatment-free survival, duration of response and time&#xD;
      to next therapy, as well as overall survival of MK-3475 in combination with the signal&#xD;
      inhibitor (either idelalisib or ibrutinib) in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A) and CLL with Richter's&#xD;
      transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Test the overall and complete response rates of MK-3475 in combination with the signal&#xD;
      inhibitor (either idelalisib or ibrutinib) in relapsed CLL/SLL (Arm A) and CLL with Richter's&#xD;
      transformation (Arm C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the potential association between programmed cell death ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1)/programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)/PD-L2 expression on tumor and T cells and/or PD-L1&#xD;
      soluble levels in plasma with clinical efficacy of PD-1 blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To investigate the effects of MK-3475 on selected markers of immune modulation and immune&#xD;
      profiles in peripheral blood and tumor samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Examine T-cell immune synapse function and expression/location of co-stimulatory and&#xD;
      co-inhibitory molecules (including effector molecules) as potential biomarkers to response&#xD;
      for anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL PATIENTS (ARMS A, B, and C): Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving benefit may continue to&#xD;
      receive treatment for an additional 12 months at the discretion of the investigator. Patients&#xD;
      with CLL or CLL with Richter's transformation experiencing stable disease without partial&#xD;
      remission or progressive disease at 3 months of treatment with pembrolizumab proceed to the&#xD;
      treatment continuation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTINUATION PHASE (ARMS A and C): Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day&#xD;
      1. Patients also receive idelalisib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 OR ibrutinib&#xD;
      PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 12 or 24 months in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receiving benefit may&#xD;
      continue to receive treatment for an additional 12 months at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.&#xD;
