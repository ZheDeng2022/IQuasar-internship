    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial of the combination of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and AKT inhibitor&#xD;
      AZD5363.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parts to this study. Part A: dose escalation, and Part B: dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will investigate the combination of 300 mg bd of olaparib with intrapatient ascending&#xD;
      doses of AZD5363 administered for either 4-days-on, 3-days-off, and 2-days-on, 5-days-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is reached for both arms (or under the advice from the&#xD;
      Safety Review Committee (SRC) one of the schedules will be discontinued), the schedule with&#xD;
      the optimum safety and PK/PD profile will be taken forward to a dose expansion phase (Part&#xD;
      B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will evaluate the optimized dose/schedule identified in Part A of the study in&#xD;
      patients with (1) BRCA1/2 mutant cancers (with previous disease progression on PARP inhibitor&#xD;
      monotherapy), or (2) advanced sporadic tumours (e.g. TNBC, CRPC, HGSOC and tumours with&#xD;
      somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated PI3K-AKT pathway).&#xD;

      Part A: The starting doses for both intermittent schedules will be 300 mg bd of olaparib and&#xD;
      either AZD5363 given at 320 mg bd 4-days-on, 3-days-off, or 480 mg bd 2-days-on, 5-days-off.&#xD;
      These starting doses are based on available data from the first-in-human studies&#xD;
      [D0810C00002] (AstraZeneca) and [D3610C00001] (AstraZeneca) of both drugs, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general schema for 3 potential dose levels to be pursued on the 4-days-on, 3-days-off&#xD;
      AZD5363 schedule (Schedule A) and 2-days-on, 5-days-off AZD5363 schedule (Schedule B) in Part&#xD;
      A of the study are listed below. The starting dose of olaparib will be fixed at 300mg bd in&#xD;
      both schedules. These schema only provide general guidance; it will be possible for doses of&#xD;
      one or both drugs to be escalated or de-escalated in a &quot;seesaw&quot; fashion contingent on the&#xD;
      toxicity and/or PK/PD data reported. This may create dose cohort combinations not listed&#xD;
      below. Both PK and PD data will be taken into consideration if available. With the exception&#xD;
      of dose level 1, actual dose escalation/de-escalation will be determined following a&#xD;
      discussion with the SRC during dose escalation teleconferences. Dose escalation will continue&#xD;
      until MTD(s) are reached. Patients will be dosed on a flat scale and not by body weight or&#xD;
      body surface area. Both schedules will be carried out in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1: Schema for dose escalation in schedule A (4-days-on, 3-days-off AZD5363) Dose level&#xD;
      (DL) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 4d-on, 3d-off&#xD;

&#xD;
             3. 300mg 480mg&#xD;
&#xD;
                *An intermediate dose of 250mg bd of olaparib may be considered depending on&#xD;
                drug-related toxicities observed and patient tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
                Table 2: Schema for dose escalation in schedule B (2-days-on, 5-days-off AZD5363)&#xD;
                Dose level (DL) olaparib bd AZD5363 bd 2d-on, 5d-off&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 200mg* 400mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 300mg 480mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 300mg 560mg&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. 300mg 640mg&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  An intermediate dose of 250mg bd of olaparib may be considered depending on&#xD;
                     drug-related toxicities observed and patient tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      After careful review of the clinical toxicity data, if the DLT is deemed to be caused by one&#xD;
      of the agents, the responsible drug may be dose decreased and if well tolerated, the other&#xD;
      agent maybe be increased in subsequent cohorts. If necessary, both drugs can also be dose&#xD;
      de-escalated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A of the study, olaparib will be administered continuously with intermittent AZD5363&#xD;
      in 21-day cycles. Intrapatient dose escalation of AZD5363 will be utilised to evaluate&#xD;
      different dose levels. The optimal dose schedule selected based on toxicity, PK-PD and/or&#xD;
      efficacy data will be taken forward into two expansion cohorts in Part B of the study. Cohort&#xD;
      1 will comprise patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutated tumours, while Cohort 2 will comprise&#xD;
      advanced sporadic cancers that may harbour HR defects (e.g. TNBC, CRPC and HGSOC) or those&#xD;
      with somatic mutations or other aberrations known to result in a hyperactivated&#xD;
      phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway.&#xD;
