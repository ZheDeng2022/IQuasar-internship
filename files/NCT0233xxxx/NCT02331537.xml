      The purpose of this study is to examine if an internet-based exposure therapy is effective in&#xD;
      reducing excessive worry amongst patients who suffer from this problem.&#xD;

      Trial Objectives: Primary objective is to investigate whether an Internet-based exposure&#xD;
      therapy can effectively reduce the degree of excessive worry. The secondary objective is to&#xD;
      a) investigate whether imagery based exposure is more effective than verbal exposure. b)&#xD;
      investigate the cost-effectiveness of this treatment and c) to study if any variables could&#xD;
      moderate/mediate the treatment outcome, such as metacognitions, degree of rumination or&#xD;
      degree of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: Randomized controlled trial with waitlist control, who also will recieve&#xD;
      treatment after the first group has finished.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Ten weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Change in worry symptoms from baseline to Week 10. Long term follow-up is&#xD;
      also investigated (baseline to 4-months after treatment completion and baseline to 12-months&#xD;
      after treatment completion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Parameters: Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Parameters: Adverse Events is assessed weekly via the internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Trial Subjects: Patients &gt; 18 years old with a PSWQ score more than 56 points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: 140&#xD;
