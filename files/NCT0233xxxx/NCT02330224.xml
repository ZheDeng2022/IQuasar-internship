    <textblock>
      High blood pressure (BP) is a serious public health problem responsible for heart attack,&#xD;
      stroke and kidney failure. One in four adults in Singapore has hypertension. We propose a&#xD;
      pilot study in 2 polyclinics in Singapore, 1 deliver a structured multi-component&#xD;
      intervention and another usual care. A total of 100 adults with uncontrolled high blood&#xD;
      pressure will be followed for 3 months. The intervention includes 1) algorithm-driven&#xD;
      antihypertensive treatment for all patients using fixed-dose combination and lipid lowering&#xD;
      for high risk patients, 2) motivational conversation for high risk patients; and 3) telephone&#xD;
      based follow-ups of all patients by a team of physician supervised nurse practitioners and&#xD;
      nurses. The change in BP will be compared between intervention and control groups. The&#xD;
      structured care including the above mentioned components is likely to be more effective than&#xD;
      usual care in lowering BP levels of patients with uncontrolled high blood pressure. Such a&#xD;
      program is also likely to be more cost effective in terms of money spent for improving&#xD;
      quality of patients' life. The findings of the pilot will inform the design of a larger&#xD;
      cluster randomized trial in eight polyclinics in Singapore. If the main study is successful,&#xD;
      the findings will be informative for policymakers to roll out intervention in all polyclinics&#xD;
      and primary care centers across Singapore, and other countries with similar healthcare&#xD;
      infrastructure.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of disability and death in&#xD;
           Singapore, and consume substantial healthcare resources. Uncontrolled hypertension&#xD;
           confers the highest attributable risk of CVD. About one in four adults suffer from&#xD;
           hypertension in Singapore, 50% of them have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), and&#xD;
           management is especially sub-optimal among those with concomitant diabetes or&#xD;
           dyslipidemia. Evidence suggests that well structured programs of care delivery are&#xD;
           effective in lowering BP and preventing CVD. However, there is lack of empirical data on&#xD;
           such strategies in Singapore.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The findings of the pilot will inform the design of a larger cluster randomized trial in&#xD;
           eight polyclinics in Singapore. If proven effective in the main study, the information&#xD;
           will be valuable in convincing the policy-makers to upscale strategies for enhancing&#xD;
           management of hypertension and cardiovascular health within the primary health&#xD;
           infrastructure of Singapore, and possibly neighbouring Southeast Asian countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific aim 1: To explore logistics for delivery of provider training in intervention&#xD;
           algorithm and motivational counselling while maintaining optimal efficiency of ongoing&#xD;
           clinical work at the polyclinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific aim 2: To establish recruitment of participants in the intervention and usual&#xD;
           care groups, and uptake of each component of the multicomponent intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific aim 3: To establish mechanism for capture and retrieval of the relevant clinic&#xD;
           visit data (physician and nurses records, pharmacy and laboratory including costs) at&#xD;
           the polyclinic, and telephone follow-ups, hospitalization and related costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific aim 4: To explore impact of intervention vs usual care on change in BP in the&#xD;
           short term.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific aim 5: Identify appropriate methods for capturing potential adverse events and&#xD;
           safety endpoints related to intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Design: It is a non-randomized community intervention trial designed to test&#xD;
           feasibility of structured multi-component intervention in polyclinic setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Setting: The study involves two polyclinics in Singapore. One delivers intervention and&#xD;
           one delivers usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study population: The polyclinics have a system in place such that all patients with&#xD;
           hypertension get a &quot;panel&quot; of fasting blood and urine tests at subsidized cost at the&#xD;
           time of initial diagnosis and then annually. The individuals visiting polyclinic for&#xD;
           their initial (or annual) panel of laboratory tests marked as &quot;hypertension panel&quot; will&#xD;
           be screened for eligibility and recruited if eligible. One hundred patients (50 per&#xD;
           polyclinic) will be recruited and followed for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Intervention: Orientation training sessions will be organized for all physicians, nurse&#xD;
           practitioners (NP) and nurses in the polyclinic assigned the intervention which is&#xD;
           comprised of 3 components&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Structured treatment algorithm with fixed dose antihypertensives for high risk&#xD;
                patients: The training curriculum including treatment algorithm has been prepared&#xD;
                by a team of nephrologists, cardiologists and pharmacologists in consultation with&#xD;
                primary care physicians and Clinical Cardiovascular Work Group, using the case&#xD;
                method, aiming for global cardiovascular risk reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Motivational conversation by NPs and nurses for high risk patients at baseline:&#xD;
                Separate training sessions will be conducted for NP and nurses. NP and nurses will&#xD;
                receive training on motivational conversation techniques and communication&#xD;
                strategies from a trainer skilled in communication in health care. These nurse and&#xD;
                nurse practitioners will provide motivational conversation sessions to high CVD&#xD;
                risk patients at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Structured follow-up over telephone and in Clinics: NPs and nurses in intervention&#xD;
                polyclinic will be proactive in follow-up of their patients for self-monitoring of&#xD;
                BP and providing advice for adherence to treatment every 4 weeks for the duration&#xD;
                of the project (3 months). A communication checklist for the follow-up will be&#xD;
                incorporated to the existing follow-up system. Information on adverse events will&#xD;
                be obtained and action plan will be communicated with patients (discontinue the&#xD;
                suspected drug and arrange visit to clinic, as appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Usual Care: The health providers in the polyclinic with usual care will continue their&#xD;
           existing practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Outcomes assessment: Final outcome assessment will take place three months after&#xD;
           baseline. The outcomes assessors will also call the patients over telephone for outcomes&#xD;
           assessment at week 6 after baseline. Information on self-monitoring of BP, recommended&#xD;
           life style change, self-care, and medication use (including herbal and traditional&#xD;
           Chinese) will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The outcome assessors will also extract process outcomes measures from the general&#xD;
           practitioner (GP) and nurses' notes. These will include number and duration of contact&#xD;
           with the patient (whether in person or by phone), changes in prescribed medication and&#xD;
           dose, and reporting of any adverse events from medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Sample size calculation: Sample size was calculated using Stata version 12. A sample&#xD;
           size of 90 (45 in each group) achieves 80% power to detect 5 mmHg difference in systolic&#xD;
           BP change from baseline to end of follow-up in intervention group compared to usual care&#xD;
           group, with an estimated standard deviation (SD) of 9.5, significance level of 0.05&#xD;
           using a two-sided two-sample t-test. Assuming that there could be 10% drop out rate, we&#xD;
           plan to take the total sample size of 100 subjects. At least 152 eligible subjects (72&#xD;
           in each group) would be necessary to attain at least 66% recruitment rate.&#xD;
