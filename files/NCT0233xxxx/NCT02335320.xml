  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute or chronic HCV infection can lead to liver complications, including liver failure,&#xD;
      cirrhosis or liver cancer. For patients with hepatitis C infection, the major clinical&#xD;
      question remains the terms of treatment initiation. In Europe, new treatments are available&#xD;
      since the approval of three direct acting antivirals. However with the high cost of these&#xD;
      treatments, they are currently only available for critically ill patients. Other molecules&#xD;
      are currently in advanced clinical development phases. The use of clinical predictors remains&#xD;
      relevant for the selection of a suitable treatment for each patient, in particular to limit&#xD;
      the adverse effects and reduce costs. Currently the quantification of viral load is a measure&#xD;
      of response to treatment; with the recommendation to stop treatment in patients who fail to&#xD;
      achieve an undetectable level of viral load. Genetic factors have also been identified as&#xD;
      predictors of response to treatment, in particular polymorphisms of the IL-28B gene.&#xD;
      Genotyping of this gene is currently performed using classical PCR amplification applied to&#xD;
      DNA extracted from blood, with a time to result of 2-3 weeks. We propose in this protocol to&#xD;
      test a non-invasive method and rapid test for IL-28B genotype which could be used for point&#xD;
      of caring testing, and ultimately better patient management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a monocenter, cross-sectional study among HCV chronic patients. The study will be&#xD;
      conducted in 250 HCV patients, all viral genotypes combined, at Cochin Hospital (Paris,&#xD;
      France).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The principal objective is to assess the accuracy of the newly developed&#xD;
      Point-of-Care genotyping assay (Genedrive® IL-28B Assay) to detect in HCV patients the&#xD;
      genotype CC versus non CC (i.e. CT and TT) against the TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay as&#xD;
      gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the concordance between the genotype results of the&#xD;
      Genedrive and the gold standard regarding the three genotypes CC, CT and TT.&#xD;
