  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are often used in the standard treatment for patients with&#xD;
      metastasized renal cell carcinoma. In addition to their ability to specifically inhibit tumor&#xD;
      growth, TKIs also interfere with the vascularisation of the tumor. Unfortunately, most&#xD;
      patients do not obtain long-lasting clinical benefit from this treatment. The goal of the&#xD;
      current study is to enhance the effect of TKIs by combining them with stereotactic&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment of one of the metastases. This type of radiotherapy allows us to&#xD;
      precisely irradiate the tumor with minimal effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. Recently&#xD;
      it has been demonstrated that this type of radiotherapy stimulates the immune system to&#xD;
      attack the tumor. By combining stereotactic radiotherapy with TKIs we expect to observe a&#xD;
      reduction of metastases in a bigger population of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first part of our study we focus on the safety of the combination therapy. In the&#xD;
      second part we will evaluate the combined treatment response.&#xD;

    <description>A first line TKI will be administered according to the standard dosing of the drug for metastatic RCC during a 1-week run-in period after which SBRT will be delivered to the largest metastatic lesion concurrently with the TKI. The SBRT dose will be escalated in 3 dose levels, starting at 24Gy (8 Gy per fraction), followed by 30 Gy (10 Gy per fraction) and 36 Gy (12 Gy per fraction).</description>
