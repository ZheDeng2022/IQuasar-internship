      This is a pilot, randomized, open-labelled study. Eligible patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 into &quot;anticoagulation&quot; arm or &quot;anticoagulation plus atorvastatin&quot; arm, with&#xD;
      atorvastatin given at 40 mg orally daily for 3 months. The targeted total accrual is 80&#xD;
      patients, with 40 in each arm. Patients will be recruited from the hospitals and clinics at&#xD;
      The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Follow up visits are planned at enrollment,&#xD;
      3 months, and 9 months after randomization. At each follow up, blood will be obtained and&#xD;
      assessments will include structured interviews of signs and symptoms of recurrent venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding, post thrombotic syndrome, and adverse events from study&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VTE is a potentially life-threatening disease, with an estimated incidence of 1-2 per 1000.&#xD;
      Despite anticoagulation as standard of care, many patients still suffer from its&#xD;
      complications: 30% will have VTE recurrence after an unprovoked VTE, and 25-50% will develop&#xD;
      post-thrombotic syndrome. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective therapies to&#xD;
      reduce long-term VTE morbidities. Limitations in our understanding of the underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology of VTE and the absence of accurate biomarkers are significant problems.&#xD;
      Without this knowledge, improvement in treatment is unlikely. Therefore, the overall&#xD;
      objective of the study is to determine important biomarker changes in acute VTE and the&#xD;
      actions of innovative adjunct therapy on those biomarkers. The rationale of the study is&#xD;
      that, once the biomarker changes following acute VTE and the actions of therapies are&#xD;
      established, treatment for acute VTE could be improved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins are effective in the prevention of arterial thrombosis. Recently, arterial and venous&#xD;
      thromboses are shown to share common pathophysiological mechanisms, and effective therapies&#xD;
      for arterial thrombosis could provide benefits in VTE. Several observational studies and the&#xD;
      JUPITER trial, a large, randomized, placebo-controlled study, have demonstrated that statins&#xD;
      significantly reduce the risk of first VTE by 40%. Additionally, as few as 3 days of&#xD;
      atorvastatin increase plasma fibrin clot permeability and susceptibility to lysis. Statins&#xD;
      have been commonly prescribed for many other medical conditions such as coronary artery&#xD;
      diseases and hyperlipidemia, and have demonstrated good safety profiles. These promising&#xD;
      results, as well as their safety profiles, make statins an attractive potential addition to&#xD;
      the standard anticoagulation for treating acute VTE, in an effort to reduce long-term&#xD;
      morbidity. The effects of statins on thrombin generation in patients with acute VTE have not&#xD;
      been studied. A study in patients with atrial fibrillation on warfarin showed a 40% reduction&#xD;
      in endogenous thrombin potential with only three months of intensive cholesterol-lowering&#xD;
      treatment including statins. Similar effects could be seen in patients with acute VTE. In&#xD;
      addition, previous studies evaluating the effects of statins on the reduction of D-dimer or&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines revealed promising results but were not focused on patients with acute&#xD;
      VTE. Therefore, this study will generate important information for acute VTE patients. This&#xD;
      is a pilot, randomized, open-labelled study. Eligible patients will be enrolled and&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 into &quot;anticoagulation&quot; arm or &quot;anticoagulation plus atorvastatin&quot; arm, with&#xD;
      atorvastatin given at 40 mg orally daily for 3 months. The targeted total accrual is 80&#xD;
      patients, with 40 in each arm. Patients will be recruited from the hospitals and clinics at&#xD;
      The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Follow up visits are planned at enrollment,&#xD;
      3 months, and 9 months after randomization. At each follow up, blood will be obtained and&#xD;
      assessments will include structured interviews of signs and symptoms of recurrent venous&#xD;
      thromboembolism (VTE), bleeding, post thrombotic syndrome, and adverse events from study&#xD;
      drugs. The primary objective of the study is to determine the reduction of thrombin peak&#xD;
      concentration and/or endogenous thrombin potential measured by Thrombin Generation Assay&#xD;
      (TGA) at 3 months in the &quot;anticoagulation +atorvastatin&quot; arm as compared to the&#xD;
      &quot;anticoagulation&quot; arm. The secondary objectives are to determine the chronological changes of&#xD;
      hemostatic, inflammatory, and lipidomic biomarker profiles in patients with acute VTE&#xD;
      receiving anticoagulation as standard of care, with and without statins. The biomarker&#xD;
      profile of interest, in addition to thrombin generation, include: D-dimer, Interleukin- 6&#xD;
      (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, high sensitivity C-reactive&#xD;
      protein, free fatty acids, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 , pro- inflammatory&#xD;
      eicosanoids. The ultimate goal is to study the mechanisms of VTE and use of statin in VTE&#xD;
      patients. Other secondary objectives include determination of relevant clinical outcomes such&#xD;
      as VTE recurrence, VTE related mortality, arterial thrombosis, hemorrhage, post thrombotic&#xD;
      syndrome, and residual vein obstruction in patients receiving standard of care versus&#xD;
      standard of care plus statins.&#xD;

        <description>The Villata score for Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS) stratifies the severity of post-thrombotic syndrome in lower extremity DVT. The score contains a combination of 5 subjective symptoms as reported by the patient (cramps, itching, pins and needles, heaviness, and pain) and 6 objective signs measured by a provider (edema, skin induration, hyperpigmentation, prominent veins on legs, redness, and tenderness on calf compression). Each sign is scaled from 0 (no or minimal) to 3 (severe) with a total score ranged from 0 to 33. Higher scores represent more severe disease.</description>

It has been shown to decrease the risk of first venous thromboembolism in an otherwise healthy population with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).&#xD;
Warfarin: Warfarin is a standard anticoagulation in the treatment for venous thromboembolism. The dose will be adjusted to goal INR of 2-3.</description>
