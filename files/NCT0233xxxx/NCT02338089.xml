  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide&#xD;
      and is caused most commonly by poor uterine muscle (myometrium) tone after delivery. The&#xD;
      first line agent used in the prevention and treatment of PPH is oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who require augmentation of labor with intravenous oxytocin because of inadequate labor&#xD;
      progression have been shown to be at increased risk of PPH. Typically, for augmentation of&#xD;
      labor, oxytocin is used as a continuous infusion, with no consensus on the initial dose, its&#xD;
      increments or maximal limit. High concentration continuous oxytocin infusions are not without&#xD;
      theirs risks, which include hyperstimulation, fetal distress, as well as uterine rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown the clinical benefits of pulsatile oxytocin delivery for labor induction&#xD;
      and augmentation with regards to requirement of less total oxytocin, similar uterine&#xD;
      contractility and similar rates of caesarean delivery when used for labor induction and&#xD;
      augmentation. However, the rate of PPH as a primary outcome measure has not been&#xD;
      investigated. Therefore we currently do not know the effect of pulsatile oxytocin delivery on&#xD;
      the rate of PPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the effect of myometrial desensitization following&#xD;
      pulsatile oxytocin exposure would be lower when compared to continuous oxytocin exposure.&#xD;
      These results will help in establishing whether myometrial contractility and sensitivity to&#xD;
      oxytocin can be better preserved by delivery of pulsatile oxytocin, rather than continuous&#xD;
      oxytocin for labor induction and augmentation, and thereby result in less PPH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Typically labor can be augmented by exposure to high levels of continuous oxytocin, for&#xD;
      prolonged periods. The increased incidence of uterine atony and PPH following exogenous&#xD;
      oxytocin administration during labor augmentation is related to myometrial oxytocin receptor&#xD;
      desensitization to oxytocin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human clinical trials have shown the benefits of pulsatile oxytocin administration for labor&#xD;
      induction and augmentation, which include requirement of less total oxytocin, similar uterine&#xD;
      contractility and similar rates of cesarean delivery. However, the outcome of the effect on&#xD;
      PPH is not currently known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterization of the effect of pulsatile oxytocin on the desensitization of myometrium&#xD;
      when compared to the effect of continuous oxytocin, may provide guidance for the delivery of&#xD;
      pulsatile oxytocin for labor induction and augmentation to protect against the otherwise&#xD;
      higher risk of PPH. Furthermore, the delivery of pulsatile oxytocin may be considered in&#xD;
      subgroups who are already at higher risk of PPH, and require labor augmentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' previously validated in-vitro model provides a solid foundation for the&#xD;
      study of myometrial contractility under controlled conditions, without any confounders that&#xD;
      could be encountered in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide insight into the level of desensitization of human&#xD;
      myometrium following exposure to pulsatile oxytocin. Based on oxytocin dose-response curves&#xD;
      after pretreatment to continuous oxytocin and pretreatment to pulsatile oxytocin, we will be&#xD;
      able to determine the extent of desensitized myometrium following each delivery method.&#xD;
