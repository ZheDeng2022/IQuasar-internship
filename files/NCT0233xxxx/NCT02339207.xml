             7 days of first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Abnormal heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature or blood pressure values outside of&#xD;
             the normal range (evaluated in a semi-recumbent or recumbent position after 5 minutes&#xD;

&#xD;
         21. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentration &gt;5 x ULN&#xD;
