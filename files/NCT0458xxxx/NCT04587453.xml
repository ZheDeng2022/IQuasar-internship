      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in combination with topical corticosteroids (TCS)&#xD;
      compared with placebo in combination with TCS in treating moderate-to-severe atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab in combination with TCS on severity and extent of&#xD;
      AD, itch, health-related quality of life, and health care resource utilisation compared with&#xD;
      placebo in combination with TCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of tralokinumab in combination with TCS when used to treat&#xD;

    <masking_description>Neither the trial participant nor any of the investigator or LEO staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the participants will be aware of the treatment received. The packaging and labelling of the investigational medicinal product (IMP) will contain no evidence of their identity. Since tralokinumab and placebo are visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP will be handled and administered by a qualified, unblinded healthcare professional at the site who will not be involved in the management of trial participants and who will not perform any of the assessments.</masking_description>

Each item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale (0=not at all ‚ÅÑ not relevant; 1=a little; 2=a lot; 3=very much). The total score is the sum of the 10 items (ranging from 0 to 30), with higher scores indicating poorer health-related quality of life.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Patient-Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) score form baseline to Week 16</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 0 to Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>POEM consists of 7 items, each addressing a specific symptom (itching, sleep, bleeding, weeping, cracking, flaking, and dryness). Participants score how often they have experienced each symptom over the previous week, using a 5-point categorical response scale (0=no days; 1=1 to 2 days; 2=3 to 4 days; 3=5 to 6 days; 4=every day). The total score is the sum of the 7 items (ranging from 0 to 28) and reflects disease-related morbidity; higher scores indicate more severe disease.</description>
