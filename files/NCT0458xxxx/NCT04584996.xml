      1. Define the circRNA expression profile in PDAC and identify dysregulated circRNA&#xD;
           candidates. These will be validated in further tissue samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate candidate circRNA Expression in blood (plasma samples) as a clinically relevant&#xD;
           diagnostic biomarker; expanding on the primary objective to include other diagnostic&#xD;
           features such as specificity, area under the receiver operator curve, positive&#xD;
           predictive value and negative predictive value.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the expression of candidate circRNAs and related molecules in patient&#xD;
           biomaterials (including tissue, blood, bile and biopsy samples) as biomarkers for&#xD;
           diagnosis; prognostication; association with clinico-pathologic features and survival&#xD;
           outcomes; and their ability to predict/monitor treatment response e.g. surgery and/or&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Utilise computer-based analyses to describe the theoretical interactions of candidate&#xD;
           circRNAs within the full complement of RNA and related molecules produced by the tumour&#xD;
           cells, called the 'transcriptome', in human PDAC.&#xD;

      This first step of this project is a 'discovery experiment' to describe the expression&#xD;
      profiles of 8 PDAC tissue samples compared to controls; with subsequent validation of&#xD;
      candidate circRNAs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 paired samples of PDAC tumour tissue and associated normal pancreatic tissue will be&#xD;
      collected at the time of surgery (after the pancreatic tumour is resected). The expression&#xD;
      levels of circRNAs will be profiled and the most significantly dysregulated candidate&#xD;
      circRNAs will be chosen (also considering other datasets and the current literature in this&#xD;
      decision).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step of this project is a prospective non-interventional observational cohort&#xD;
      study to investigate these candidate circRNAs further:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expression of these candidate circRNAs expression levels will be measured longitudinally&#xD;
      throughout the clinical timeline of patients with PDAC in blood samples; and in bile, tissue&#xD;
      and biopsy samples (when this is safely available after clinical sampling and without&#xD;
      additional investigations). This will be compared against control patients with benign&#xD;
      biliary disease and other biliary tract cancers. These controls would only be available for&#xD;
      blood tests and, if undergoing cholecystectomy, bile. Blood tests will be taken alongside&#xD;
      clinical bloods or after anaesthesia for surgical procedures, bile will be taken after&#xD;
      removal of the gallbladder for gallstone disease when this is in excess to clinical&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of each circRNAs as a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarkers will be&#xD;
      described and compared to CA 19-9 (the only biomarker that is currently widely accepted in&#xD;
      PDAC). This will first be considered in blood samples and then other patient biomaterials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final part of the project will be to undertake both computer and laboratory evaluation of&#xD;
      candidate circRNAs in order to propose a its molecular relationships and how this may explain&#xD;
      and associations described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Bioinformatical review will give the ability to computationally determine the miRNA-binding&#xD;
      capabilities of candidate circRNAs, and the downstream mRNAs regulated. Gene-ontology and&#xD;
      KEGG pathway enrichment-analyses of the differentially expressed genes will allow a&#xD;
      global-view of the transcriptome under circRNA regulation in PDAC.&#xD;
