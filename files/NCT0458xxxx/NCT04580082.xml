      The AMBR Study is a randomized controlled trial that examines the effectiveness of teaching&#xD;
      mindfulness-based techniques through online lessons to combat loneliness, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression among people living with HIV who are over the age of 50 and enrolled in ADHOC&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT04311554). The intervention consists of 14 mindfulness&#xD;
      audio lessons, each approximately 20-minutes long. The mindfulness lessons are designed to&#xD;
      develop three core skills: concentration (the ability to maintain focus on present-moment&#xD;
      experiences), clarity (the ability to pinpoint exactly what you are experiencing in each&#xD;
      moment), and equanimity (openness to experience).&#xD;

    <description>There are 14 lessons in total, each lasting approximately 20 minutes. Participants will be asked to listen to one lesson per day for 14 consecutive days, but to allow for possible missed days, they will have up to 25 days to complete as many of these 14 lessons as they can. The lessons will be delivered via the internet, and participants can use a variety of devices (e.g. smartphone, desktop computer, laptop computer, tablet) to access them. While the lessons cannot be downloaded, they are available for streaming anytime and anywhere there is an internet connection. Participants are welcome to revisit any lesson they have listened to previously, but are not allowed to &quot;skip ahead&quot; to other lessons until they have completed all preceding lessons. This is done because the lessons build on one another, which means that skipping lessons makes continued participation difficult. We will be able to track each participant's usage pattern and will analyze differences across users.</description>

    <description>The control group will not receive the intervention until the intervention group has completed lesson listening. During this waiting period, they will receive periodic emails letting them know that their turn to listen to lessons is coming soon.&#xD;
Once available, the control group will have 25 days to listen to the 14 lessons.</description>
