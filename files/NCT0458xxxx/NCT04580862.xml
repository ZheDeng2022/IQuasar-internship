      To compare the incidence of post-operative pain after single-visit versus two-visit&#xD;
      non-surgical endodontic retreatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post treatment failure could be treated by two options including orthograde retreatment and&#xD;
      apical surgery . In a previous study, orthograde retreatments presented a success rate of 81&#xD;
      % classified as healed and 93 % as no symptoms and fully functional. In a systematic review,&#xD;
      it has also been concluded that endodontic surgery offers more favorable initial success but&#xD;
      orthograde retreatment yields to a better long-term outcome . Although early results of&#xD;
      single-visit treatments are contradictory ; Completing the treatment in a single appointment&#xD;
      reduces the treatment time and cost, decreases micro leakage risk and avoids recontamination&#xD;
      of root canals between appointments in multiple-visit treatments . Again, reviewing the&#xD;
      literature concerning primary treatment showed that, no significant differences were observed&#xD;
      in healing of periapical radiolucency between teeth treated in single-visit and those treated&#xD;
      in two-visits. Even, after using calcium hydroxide for four weeks . The presence of a&#xD;
      positive bacterial culture at the time of filling did not influence the outcome of treatment&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thorough online search revealed that, few studies are found concerning post- operative pain&#xD;
      after single visit retreatment . The present study is designed to compare the effects of&#xD;
      single-visit and two-visit root canal treatments on postoperative pain in retreatment cases.&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure of this study is proposed to be whether single-visit root canal&#xD;
      retreatment influenced the occurrence of postoperative pain as compared to two-visit&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
