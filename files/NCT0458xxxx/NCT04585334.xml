      PAES, double blind, double dummy, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical study to&#xD;
      demonstrate superiority of Tricortin 1000 over placebo in improvement in pain relief as&#xD;
      change from baseline to 15 days in patients with chronic low back pain (LBP).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a PAES, double blind, double dummy, multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical&#xD;
      study, which will consist of a Screening phase (Visit 1) of up to 14 days and a Follow-up&#xD;
      phase of up to 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 300 patients of either sex, aged between 40 and 70 years with diagnosis of chronic&#xD;
      mechanical (mild, moderate degenerative process of disc and facet) LBP for at least 3 months&#xD;
      but no more than 6 months will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two stratification groups will be distinguished: the first group will be comprised of&#xD;
      patients with chronic mechanical LBP due to mild, moderate degenerative process of disc and&#xD;
      facet from 40 to &lt;55 years, the second group will be comprised of patients with chronic&#xD;
      mechanical LBP due to mild-moderate degenerative process of disc and facet ≥55 to 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be required to have diagnosis of chronic LBP with clinically and imaging&#xD;
      confirmation of mechanical (mild, moderate degenerative process of disc and facet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline assessments include: pain assessment and functional disability, clinical parameters,&#xD;
      patient global assessment (PGA), clinical global impression (CGI) and consumption of rescue&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will then be randomly assigned to one of the following three treatment&#xD;
      arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tricortin 1000 by intramuscular route (Arm A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diclofenac sodium medicated plaster by topical application (Arm B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Placebo (Arm C) In arm A and B, Tricortin 1000 and Diclofenac sodium medicated plaster&#xD;
           will be administered together with the alternate placebo, while patients in the placebo&#xD;
           arm (Arm C) will be treated with both intramuscular and locally applied placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be in the study for approximately 30 days of trial duration with a treatment&#xD;
      period of 15 days.&#xD;
