  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being conducted to find out how heart function and energy use differ&#xD;
      among healthy endurance athletes, individuals who do not exercise regularly, and patients&#xD;
      with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The research study involves taking part in a&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), two positron emission tomography (PET) scans, an&#xD;
      echocardiogram, and blood draws. The study will consist of a total of three visits scheduled&#xD;
      over a maximum of two weeks. By determining how heart function and energy use differ between&#xD;
      our three groups of healthy endurance athletes, individuals who do not exercise regularly,&#xD;
      and patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the investigators hope to have this work&#xD;
      translate into a novel clinical tool for differentiating pathologic changes of the heart from&#xD;
      physiological changes in heart. This is otherwise known as &quot;gray-zone&quot; left ventricular&#xD;
      hypertrophy, or enlargement of the left ventricle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators anticipate that by defining the myocardial metabolic profiles of&#xD;
      exercise-induced left ventricular hypertrophy (EI-LVH) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM),&#xD;
      we will determine if these differ sufficiently to distinguish these two forms of LVH. Because&#xD;
      HCM causes sudden death with physical activity, it is critically important to determine the&#xD;
      etiology of undifferentiated &quot;gray zone&quot; LVH in the athlete presenting for medical&#xD;
      evaluation, and existing mechanisms of assessing myocardial structure and function are not&#xD;
      universally adequate. The investigators anticipate that the work may translate into a novel&#xD;
      clinical tool for differentiating pathology from physiology in &quot;gray-zone&quot; LVH. The&#xD;
      complementary mechanistic goal of this study is to combine comprehensive evaluations of&#xD;
      myocardial functional parameters and metabolism to better understand the link between&#xD;
      function and metabolism and, ultimately, the biological mechanisms of EI-LVH and LVH due to&#xD;
      HCM. There are three specific aims to the research study. The first specific aim is to define&#xD;
      the relationships between changes in myocardial metabolic efficiency (MME) and changes in&#xD;
      myocardial mechanics that accompany EI-LVH. The second is to establish and compare myocardial&#xD;
      metabolic profiles of EI-LVH and HCM. The third is to analyze a subset of the endurance&#xD;
      athlete subjects to determine the impact of aerobic exercise training on MME over a 90-day&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will employ a mixed study design. The study is a cross-sectional design but will&#xD;
      analyze a subset of endurance athletes longitudinally with repeated measures after 90 days&#xD;
      from the first three study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the cross sectional design, the first study visit will be at Massachusetts General&#xD;
      Hospital and will involve a cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) on an upright bicycle, with&#xD;
      blood sampling before the CPET at rest, and after exercise. Study visits two and three will&#xD;
      follow the same protocol. Both study visits two and three will occur at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital and will involve an echocardiogram and a positron emission tomography (PET) scan.&#xD;
      Both visits will include blood sampling at rest, and then either the resting PET scan or a&#xD;
      PET scan after acute exercise provocation on a supine bicycle. Study visits two and three&#xD;
      will occur on two sequential mornings.&#xD;
