    <description>Number of participants with presence and size of induration in active versus control at the Candin injection site compared to the intra-individual saline control injection site approximately 48 hours after Candin challenge will be reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) in the Active Arm Versus the Control Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant participating in a clinical study that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the pharmaceutical/biological agent under study. TEAEs are defined as AEs with onset or worsening on or after date of first dose of study treatment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants with Treatment-Emergent Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the Active Arm Versus the Control Arm</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
