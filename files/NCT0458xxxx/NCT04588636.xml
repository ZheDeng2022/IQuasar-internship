  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of personalized&#xD;
      thermoformed occlusal splints together with behavioral and self-care therapy in the&#xD;
      management of myalgia of the masticatory muscles. A controlled clinical trial was carried out&#xD;
      with a total of 46 subjects diagnosed with myalgia according to the diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
      temporomandibular disorders (DC / TMD). All subjects were treated with behavioral and&#xD;
      self-care therapy (BST) at the beginning of the study, and were then randomized into 4&#xD;
      groups: behavioral and self-care control group; rigid occlusal splint group; soft occlusal&#xD;
      splint group and non-occlusive splint group. Follow-ups were carried out at 2, 6 and 10&#xD;
      weeks, where it was evaluated: pain in the masticatory muscles, mandibular range of motion,&#xD;
      mandibular functional limitation and occlusal discomfort.&#xD;

      Materials and method This randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted between October&#xD;
      2017 and January 2018 at the Dental Clinic of the Andrés Bello University (Viña del Mar,&#xD;
      Chile). The study subjects were recruited from the universe of patients seeking treatment for&#xD;
      jaw pain at the School of Dentistry. All subjects were informed about the study by their&#xD;
      operator and gave their written consent before starting the study. The protocol, design and&#xD;
      implementation were approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Dentistry&#xD;
      of the Andrés Bello University, Viña del Mar, Chile (Folio No. 033, October 2017). Which was&#xD;
      in accordance with the latest version of the Declaration of Helsinki of the World Medical&#xD;
      Association (World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki, 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation It was calculated according to a confidence level of 95% and a&#xD;
      statistical power of 80%. Based on a previous study by Niemelä et al. (Niemelä et al., 2012)&#xD;
      it was determined that the variance of the main variable (masticatory muscle pain) of the&#xD;
      reference group is 2.6. In turn, the pain variable was measured on the visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), where a minimum clinically relevant difference was considered if a 3.5 point decrease&#xD;
      was achieved on the VAS scale with respect to treatment, a reference that was also considered&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and interventions. After meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the&#xD;
      subjects were randomly assigned to four groups through a computationally generated sequence&#xD;
      &quot;list randomizer&quot; developed by random.org.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation methods The initial evaluation, to determine the degree of involvement of axis I,&#xD;
      was carried out following the symptom questionnaire and clinical examination guidelines&#xD;
      according to the DC / TMD protocol. Additionally, the questionnaire for the chronic pain&#xD;
      degree scale (GCPS v2.0) and the functional limitation scale (JFLS-20) of axis II of the DC /&#xD;
      TMD protocol were applied. In turn, an intraoral clinical examination was performed to&#xD;
      exclude pain of dental origin. No subject was excluded for odontogenic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic analysis The demographic characteristics of the sample were reported descriptively.&#xD;
      The data studied were tested to determine normality by using the Shapiro-Wilk and&#xD;
      Doornik-Hansen tests, data that were parametric, so they were analyzed with a mixed ANOVA&#xD;
      test, a factorial part and a repeated means part for the variables degree of chronic pain,&#xD;
      masticatory muscle pain, mandibular range of motion, functional limitation and occlusal&#xD;
      discomfort. The level of significance used was established at p 0.05. All statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17&#xD;
      software (IBM, Chicago, USA).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>To protect the blinding of the study, it was carried out by two operators: A (examiner) and B (therapist). The treatment of the subjects consisted of 5 sessions: (1) evaluation and diagnosis of recruited subjects, and taking an impression of the upper jaw by operator A; (2) teaching BST and delivery of OS by operator B; (3) first treatment control and BST booster at 2 weeks; (4) second treatment control and BST booster at 6 weeks; (5) third control of treatment and removal of OS if it corresponds to 10 weeks. All controls were performed by operator A in order to use a blind design without the knowledge of the outcome assessor. To protect this, it is explained to the subject that operator A cannot know the treatment that was delivered. Operator B delivered the treatments at random among the subjects selected by operator A after the initial examination, being himself in charge of contacting them and delivering the corresponding treatment.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>In the first session, operator A explained to the study subjects the alternatives, benefits and possible complications of the treatments, but it was indicated that at the time of delivery of the treatment it would not be explained to them in which group they were assigned in order to protect blinding of treatments. Operator B was in charge of delivering the treatments randomly among the subjects selected by operator A. Finally, the controls were carried out by operator A in order to protect the blinding by not knowing the treatments of the patients at the time controls.</masking_description>
