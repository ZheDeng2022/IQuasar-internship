  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, study in which 300 evaluable subjects will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 to receive active or delayed therapy with Moments PNS. Subjects in the&#xD;
      Delayed group will start with therapy at 3-month visit follow up. The primary endpoint is a&#xD;
      &gt;50% pain relief at 3-months as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) without increase in&#xD;
      baseline pain medications, with additional measurements assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and&#xD;
      36-months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study in which up to 300&#xD;
      evaluable subjects will receive Moventis PNS. Target subjects will have chronic knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized into either the active or delayed group. Devices will be&#xD;
      activated post-op in accordance to the randomization assignment. Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      Active group, programming parameters will be set, and therapy will be delivered for a minimum&#xD;
      of 2-hours per day for the duration of the study. Implanted subjects will be educated on the&#xD;
      use of the transmitter. Programming changes can be done as needed during this time period to&#xD;
      maximize clinical response according to pre-programmed settings. Subjects randomized to the&#xD;
      Delayed group will begin 2-hour stimulation/day at the 3-Month visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be at 3-Months, comparing Active vs. Delayed data from baseline&#xD;
      data, and subjects in the Delay group will begin stimulation. At the 3-month visit, VAS will&#xD;
      be completed and compared to baseline VAS, during this visit the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      device will be assessed, and subjects in the Delayed group will be instructed to begin daily&#xD;
      stimulation for a minimum of 2 hours a day. Subjects will be seen at 3-month intervals&#xD;
      through the 12-Month visit for data collection and adverse event review. Subjects will&#xD;
      continue therapy and followed for a total of 36-months with primary outcomes assessed at&#xD;
      3-months. Their participation in the study will end at 36-months.&#xD;
