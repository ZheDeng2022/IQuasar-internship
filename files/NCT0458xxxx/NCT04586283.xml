  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During pregnancy women may need or choose to undergo physical therapies such as&#xD;
      physiotherapy, massage or osteopathy. Recent findings from studies of mothers who had a&#xD;
      stillbirth in late pregnancy found that the position in which women went to sleep in was&#xD;
      linked to stillbirth, as was the frequency of day time naps. This link is thought to be due&#xD;
      to changes in mother's blood flow from her heart when lying flat leading to changes in the&#xD;
      amount of oxygen going to her baby. This raise concerns that spending extended periods laid&#xD;
      flat could be detrimental to baby's health. However, it is not known whether lying flat for&#xD;
      extended periods for physical therapies could also alter a baby's heart rate or levels of&#xD;
      oxygen. One small study of 33 women from Brazil found that there were no differences in a&#xD;
      mother's heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation or baby's heart rate. But there were&#xD;
      changes in mother's breathing rate and systolic blood pressure when a mother laid on her&#xD;
      front. All the women reported feeling comfortable lying flat (on a bent surface). However, in&#xD;
      this study women only spent 6 minutes in each position which is less than a woman would be&#xD;
      expected to spend lying in a position for a session of physical therapy. The investigators&#xD;
      plan a study to assess whether using a device to support a prone position (Anna cushion)&#xD;
      would be associated with changes in mother's heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and&#xD;
      blood oxygen levels and baby's heart rate. The investigators will also ask about mother's&#xD;
      levels of comfort while she is laid in the prone position. The findings of this study will&#xD;
      give an indication whether supporting a mother to lie in a prone position for physical&#xD;
      therapies is safe and comfortable.&#xD;

      Women frequently experience lower-back or pelvic pain during pregnancy. This may lead to a&#xD;
      need for physical therapies such as physiotherapy, osteopathy or massage in late pregnancy.&#xD;
      Several case-control studies, and a recent individual patient data meta-analysis has&#xD;
      demonstrated an association between going to sleep position and late stillbirth (a greater&#xD;
      than 2-fold increased risk with going to sleep supine) and increased frequency of daytime&#xD;
      naps. This is thought to be related to maternal haemodynamic changes when a mother lies&#xD;
      supine in late pregnancy which decreases cardiac output and uterine blood flow. These changes&#xD;
      are accompanied by alterations in fetal behaviour which are consistent with a reduction in&#xD;
      oxygenation. This observation raises concerns that spending extended periods laid flat could&#xD;
      be detrimental to baby's health. However, it is not known whether lying flat for extended&#xD;
      periods for physical therapies could also alter a baby's heart rate or levels of oxygen. One&#xD;
      small study of 33 women from Brazil which randomised the order of maternal positions found&#xD;
      that there were no differences in a mother's heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation or&#xD;
      baby's heart rate between a supine, lateral and prone position (bent over a concave couch).&#xD;
      However, there were observed changes in mother's breathing rate and systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      when a mother laid on her front. Nevertheless, all the women reported feeling comfortable&#xD;
      lying flat (on a bent surface). However, in this study women only spent 6 minutes in each&#xD;
      position which is less than a woman would be expected to spend lying in a position for a&#xD;
      session of physical therapy. Therefore, further work is required to determine whether&#xD;
      spending extended periods laid prone is safe for mother and baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-investigator (Karli BÃ¼chling) has developed a cushion to support mothers in a prone&#xD;
      position (Anna cushion). This study will investigate whether adopting this position supported&#xD;
      by the cushion is associated with changes in mother's heart rate, blood pressure, breathing&#xD;
      rate and blood oxygen levels and fetal heart rate as assessed by the cardiotocograph. The&#xD;
      investigators will also ask about mother's levels of comfort while she is laid flat. The&#xD;
      findings of this study will give an indication whether supporting a mother to lie in a prone&#xD;
      position for physical therapies is safe and comfortable.&#xD;
