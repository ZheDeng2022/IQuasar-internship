  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood pressure is a serious and common health problem. This disease affects 1 billion&#xD;
      people all over the world and responsible for 7,1 million deaths. Trials involving more than&#xD;
      1 million people state that stroke incidence rises as blood pressure rises. The effects of&#xD;
      high blood pressure on cerebral perfusion is not well realized. Intraoperative blood pressure&#xD;
      management of patients with high blood pressure is not well known. And it is still not clear&#xD;
      how autoregulation of cerebral perfusion is affected by high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic arterial pressure changes have little effect on cerebral perfusion. This is&#xD;
      regulated by changes of precapillary resistance. When systemic arterial blood pressure drops,&#xD;
      it is regulated by vasodilatation of arteriolar smooth muscles. And when systemic blood&#xD;
      pressure rises, it is regulated by vasoconstriction of arterioles. Cerebral perfusion is well&#xD;
      preserved between 50-125 mmHg changes of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). Patients with&#xD;
      high blood pressure have higher ranges. Patients with chronic high blood pressure can better&#xD;
      tolerate higher blood pressures. But even physiologic drops of systemic blood pressure can&#xD;
      cause ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic drugs have variable effects on cerebral blood flow and physiology. The drugs used&#xD;
      with anesthetic drugs, the noxious stimulus of surgery, intracranial compliance, blood&#xD;
      pressure, and carbon dioxide pressure can all alter and complicate these effects. Anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs must be selected carefully in patients with high blood pressure. It is still&#xD;
      investigated whether, management of blood pressure under anesthesia, should be&#xD;
      individualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with high blood pressure, some neuromonitorization technics have been evaluated&#xD;
      to prevent neurologic complications under anesthesia. But there is not a technic, which is&#xD;
      considered as a gold standard. Cerebral blood pressure has been studied by, nitrous oxide&#xD;
      method, krypton uptake method, and xenon injection methods previously. Near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (NIRS) is the best monitorization technic of intracranial pressure (ICP),&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral metabolism. But it can not be applied to all&#xD;
      patients. Recently, it is possible to measure blood flow of cerebrum with transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler ultrasound in anesthesia practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators aim to evaluate cerebral perfusion of hypertensive patients&#xD;
      with transcranial Doppler during lumbar disc surgery to optimize the blood pressure under&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To best of our knowledge, there is no trial evaluating cerebral perfusion of hypertensive&#xD;
      patients with transcranial Doppler ultrasound.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this trial, the investigators aim to evaluate the cerebral perfusion of patients with&#xD;
      transcranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) during lumbar&#xD;
      disc surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will divide participants into three groups according to their blood&#xD;
      pressure history after preoperative evaluation of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will enroll normotensive participants in group 1(control group).&#xD;
      Participants with diagnosis of high blood pressure will be enrolled to group 2. In the third&#xD;
      group, participants who don't have any diagnosis of high blood pressure, but actual blood&#xD;
      pressure is higher than the physiological levels at the preoperative evaluation will be&#xD;
      enrolled to group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First measurements of TCD and NIRS, will be performed at preoperative period. Second&#xD;
      measurements will be obtained after anesthesia induction. Third measurement will be performed&#xD;
      after prone position. Forth measurement will be taken after 1 hour of surgical incision. The&#xD;
      last measurement will be performed at the postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During all these measurements, blood gas samples, invasive arterial blood pressures, pulse&#xD;
      variation index (PVI), electrocardiography (ECG), peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), peak&#xD;
      pressure of airway and end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) levels will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be evaluated for their cognitive functions with mini-mental and&#xD;
      confusion assessment method (cam) tests at the preoperative and postoperative periods.&#xD;
