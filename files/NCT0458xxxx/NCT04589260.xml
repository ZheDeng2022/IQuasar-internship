      A Phase 1, 3-part, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, first in human study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a single ascending dose (SAD) study in up to 5 cohorts of 8 healthy subjects (6&#xD;
      active and 2 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B is a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in up to 4 cohorts of 8 healthy subjects (6&#xD;
      active and 2 placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C is a 28 day multiple-dose study in up to 2 cohorts of 12 IPF subjects (8 active and 4&#xD;
      placebo). The dose levels administered in Part C will not exceed those previously&#xD;
