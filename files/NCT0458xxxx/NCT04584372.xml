  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) increases with advancing age. Developing effective&#xD;
      lifestyle-based strategies to promote, preserve or restore cardiovascular health with aging&#xD;
      is a high priority. The overall aim of this clinical research is to investigate the&#xD;
      innovative concept that an increased intake of dietary nitrate (through beetroot juice) could&#xD;
      be a feasible adjuvant therapy to treat elevated blood pressure and improve blood vessel&#xD;
      function in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inorganic dietary nitrate, found in beetroot and green leafy vegetables, is a source of&#xD;
      nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule that is important for cardiovascular health. NO is&#xD;
      also produced in the human body, but the body's production and availability of NO decrease&#xD;
      during ageing and CVD. The declined NO availability is associated with impaired blood vessel&#xD;
      function, unresolved inflammatory responses, and an increased CVD risk. Dietary nitrate is an&#xD;
      additional NO source. Following the intake of nitrate, NO is produced in a pathway that&#xD;
      involves commensal bacteria in the mouth. So far, little is known about whether dietary&#xD;
      nitrate improves cardiovascular health in older populations with high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study is to investigate whether the&#xD;
      daily intake of nitrate-rich beetroot juice over four weeks translates into improved&#xD;
      cardiovascular health-related outcomes in older adults with treated mild high blood pressure.&#xD;
      Men and women, between the ages of 55 and 70 years, who have been diagnosed with grade 1 high&#xD;
      blood pressure and who are taking two or more blood-pressure lowering medications will be&#xD;
      recruited. The study will investigate whether the increased dietary nitrate intake further&#xD;
      lowers blood pressure and improves blood vessel function. A specific aim is to examine&#xD;
      whether the nitrate intake results in favorable changes in the oral bacteria community and&#xD;
      the systemic inflammatory status, and whether these changes correlate with&#xD;
      cardiovascular-related outcomes. This research will offer information on the value of dietary&#xD;
      nitrate to counteract chronic inflammation, the latter of which plays a role in developing or&#xD;
      worsening cardiovascular disorders, such as high blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results of this study will provide important new evidence of whether&#xD;
      nitrate-rich beetroot juice could be a key component of therapeutic interventions to improve&#xD;
      cardiovascular health in individuals with high blood pressure.&#xD;

      This clinical research is funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF, project number: KLI 858).&#xD;
      It is based on close collaborations between the University of Vienna and the Medical&#xD;
      University of Vienna, with the Department of Clinical Pharmacology at the Medical University&#xD;
      of Vienna as the clinical trial center and Prof. M.D. Michael Wolzt as the trial center's&#xD;
      coordinating physician. The sponsor is the University of Vienna, as represented by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator Dr. Oliver Neubauer (Research Platform Active Ageing). International&#xD;
      collaborations include Dr. Catherine Bondonno, Prof. Hodgson (both Edith Cowan University)&#xD;
      Dr. Jonathan Peake (Queensland University of Technology), and Prof. Richard Woodman (Flinders&#xD;
      University) (all Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wider research context / theoretical framework:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Developing effective&#xD;
      strategies to improve cardiovascular health with ageing is a high priority. Emerging data&#xD;
      indicate that inorganic dietary nitrate, found in green leafy vegetables and beetroot juice&#xD;
      (BRJ), is important for cardiovascular health (Blekkenhorst et al. 2018). These data suggest&#xD;
      that small increases in nitrate intake among those with elevated risk for CVD would have a&#xD;
      substantial impact, by improving the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) through the&#xD;
      enterosalivary nitrate- nitrite-NO pathway (involving the oral microbiome). Results from the&#xD;
      study group's research suggest beneficial short-term effects of nitrate-rich BRJ on blood&#xD;
      pressure and vascular inflammation markers in healthy older adults (Raubenheimer et al.&#xD;
      2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses / research questions / objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed clinical study is aimed to examine whether the daily consumption of 2Ã—70 mL BRJ&#xD;
      over 4 weeks translates into improved clinical outcomes in older adults with treated grade 1&#xD;
      hypertension. The primary hypothesis is that the increased dietary nitrate intake lowers&#xD;
      blood pressure and improves vascular function. The secondary hypotheses are that the&#xD;
      increased dietary nitrate intake results in changes in the oral microbiome, favorably&#xD;
      modulates the systemic inflammatory status, and that these changes correlate with&#xD;
      cardiovascular-related outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach / methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study will involve two 4-week treatment&#xD;
      periods, consisting of interventions with nitrate-rich BRJ and nitrate-depleted BRJ,&#xD;
      separated by a 4-week washout period. Thirty-five men and women, between the ages of 55 and&#xD;
      70 years, who have been diagnosed with grade 1 hypertension will be recruited. Twenty-nine&#xD;
      participants will be required to complete the study, based on power/sample size calculations&#xD;
      with the forearm blood flow (FBF) response to acetylcholine and 24 h-ambulatory systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure as the primary endpoints. Principal secondary endpoints are the number of&#xD;
      CD11b-expressing blood granulocytes and the FBF response to glyceryltrinitrate. Among various&#xD;
      additional secondary and exploratory endpoints, plasma nitrate and nitrite and a broad range&#xD;
      of inflammation biomarkers will be measured. Furthermore, the oral microbiome will be&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Level of originality / innovation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beneficial effects of nitrate have predominantly been observed in healthy populations, but&#xD;
      evidence of cardiovascular benefits and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical populations is&#xD;
      limited (Raubenheimer et al. 2019). This study addresses the need to determine the efficacy&#xD;
      of dietary nitrate to improve cardiovascular health and counteract chronic low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation in humans at risk of CVD.&#xD;

The study will involve a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design, with two 4-week treatment periods separated by a 4-week washout period. The two treatments will consist of a 4-week high-nitrate (HI-NI) and a 4-week low-nitrate (LO-NI, i.e., placebo) intervention in older adults with treated grade 1 hypertension, on the background of a low-nitrate diet and unaltered lifestyle.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>The two treatment arm will consist of a 4-week high-nitrate (HI-NI) intervention (using nitrate-rich beetroot juice) and a 4-week low-nitrate (LO-NI) intervention using nitrate-depleted beetroot juice as the placebo. All products will be obtained from the same supplier (James White Drinks Ltd., UK). The nitrate-depleted beetroot juice is generated for research purposes only. The two juices will be indistinguishable by taste, color, smell and packaging.
