  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The progression of brain lesions after severe head trauma or subarachnoid hemorrhage results&#xD;
      from extra cranial aggression which is well controlled in intensive care and intracranial&#xD;
      aggression which is less well known and therefore less well managed. The detection of events&#xD;
      that can generate new lesions from intracranial monitoring is limited and late once the&#xD;
      lesions are irreversible. Invasive cortical depolarizations (SD) can be observed using&#xD;
      cortical electrodes and an acquisition system having access to the usually filtered DC signal&#xD;
      (0 to 1 Hz). SD are observed at the onset of a new attack of the cortex and spread widely&#xD;
      away from the site of aggression. During their propagation, SD generate a significant&#xD;
      metabolic demand, and can cause ischemic injury, particularly after meningeal or&#xD;
      post-traumatic hemorrhage. SDs are therefore both a marker of new lesion and a mechanism of&#xD;
      progression of primary lesions. Yet this type of monitoring is only performed in some expert&#xD;
      centers around the world. The analysis of the feasibility and safety of the placement of&#xD;
      cortical electrodes in this indication is therefore an essential step to study the clinical&#xD;
      benefit of individualized management on the basis of this monitoring.&#xD;
