      A 48-Week Prospective, Double-Blinded, Randomized, Cross-over design in Multicenter Study of,&#xD;
      100 unit of Abobotulinum Toxin Type A (Dysport) and 33.33 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A&#xD;
      (Neuronox) injection for Hemifacial Spasm in patient diagnosed with Hemifacial Spasm&#xD;
      according to clinical diagnosis. It was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, quality of life and the comparesion the improvement after treatment by of&#xD;
      Abobotulinum Toxin Type A (Dysport) injection versus Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox)&#xD;
      Injection.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Abobotulinum&#xD;
      Toxin Type A (Dysport) injection and Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) Injection for&#xD;
      Hemifacial Spasm. The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate the quality of life of&#xD;
      Abobotulinum Toxin Type A (Dysport) and Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) Injection for&#xD;
      Hemifacial Spasm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 patients diagnosed with Hemifacial Spasm were planned to be enrolled into the study.&#xD;
      Total of 120 patients planed to be and randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary efficacy variable: Comparesion of pre- and post- treatment after 12 and 24 week scale&#xD;
      with 33.33 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) and 100 unit of Abobotulinum Toxin&#xD;
      Type A (Dysport); as following&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 24 hours HFS diary record for 12 week after treatment Time to peak improvement, response&#xD;
           duration period, Total intensity score per day, duration of facial muscle spasm (hour&#xD;
           per day) and duration of functional impairment (hour per day) record for 12 week after&#xD;
           each treatment will be assessed&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hemifacial Spasm- 30 Questionnaire (Thai version). Seven subscales (30 items). Mobility&#xD;
           (5 items), activity of daily living (5 items) and communication (3 items) are classified&#xD;
           as physical health domain. Emotional well-being (7 items), stigma (4 items), social&#xD;
           support (3 items) and cognition (3 items) are classified as mental health domain&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS) (Thai version) Rating sacle of the severity&#xD;
           of movements in 7 regions, each on a 5 points scale and a separate rating of the overall&#xD;
           severity of the abnormal movements, judged on the amplitude of movements, incapacitation&#xD;
           postures and positions, including sitting in chair, opening the mouth, tapping the thumb&#xD;
           against each finger, holding the hand out stretched and standing and walking, are&#xD;
           included. Dental status is also rated, as the presence or absence of problems with teeth&#xD;
           or dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary efficacy variables: : Comparesion of pre- and post- treatment after 12 and 24 week&#xD;
      scale with 50 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) and 250 unit of Abobotulinum Toxin&#xD;
      Type A (Dysport); as following&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 36-item questionnaire and comprises eight domains: Physical functioning (PF), Role&#xD;
           limitations due to physical health (RP), Role limitations due to emotional problems(RE),&#xD;
           Vitality (VT), Mental health (MH), Social functioning (SF), Bodily pain (BP), General&#xD;
           health (GH)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Center of Epidemiologic study -Depression scale (CES-D)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient health Questionnaire - 9 item (PHQ-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The investigator's /patient's global assessment of change (GAC) Safety criteria: The&#xD;
           assessment of safety and tolerability were based mainly on the frequency of adverse&#xD;
           events.&#xD;
