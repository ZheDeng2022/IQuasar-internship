      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of implementing the virtual assistant&#xD;
      devices into the daily routine of participants and their caregivers,to measure social&#xD;
      determinants of health,depression,cognitive impairment,nutritional and functional status in&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive meals delivered to them by the Meals oN wheels(MOW) program for 6 weeks.MOW will once a week deliver in-person enough frozen meals to cover lunch for 5 days and breakfast for 7 days. Study staff will call the participants twice a week to ask 5 questions about their health, mood, and meal consumption.At the end of the 6 weeks, a study team member will make an in-person visit to the participants' homes to measure Fried Frailty Phenotype(FFP), MHS, CES-D, MOCA, Activities of Daily Living (ADL)/Instrumental activities of daily living(IADL)s, NSI, and ZCBI. Caregivers will not receive meals during this first phase as the focus is on the nutritional status of the cognitively impaired older adult.</description>

    <description>For the second 6 weeks, participants will continue to have meal deliveries and will now have the AES 8 device which can be used by the cognitively impaired participant and their caregiver. AES 8 devices will be installed in participant's homes by the study team and participants will be given basic instructions on using the device as well as a one-page handout that will include instructions on how to use and maintain privacy with their device. The study staff will continue to call twice a week to ask the 5 questions. At the end of the 6 weeks, a study team member will make an in-person visit to the participants' homes to measure FFP, MHS, CES-D, MOCA, ADL/IADLs, NSI, ZCBI, and TAM.</description>

    <description>In the third 6 weeks, the participants will continue to have meal deliveries and the AES 8 will be upgraded to provide an active intervention by asking the twice a week 5 questions through the device. The questions should be answered by the cognitively impaired older adult using the device, though the caregiver can still use the device for other basic services. The participant will be able to answer the questions verbally or by touch screen options displayed on the device.At the end of the 6 weeks, a study team member will make an in-person visit to the participants' homes to measure FFP, MHS, CES-D, MOCA, ADL/IADLs, NSI, ZCBI, and TAM.</description>
