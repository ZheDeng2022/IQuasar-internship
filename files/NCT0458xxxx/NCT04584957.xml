    <textblock>
      A prospective controlled randomized study aimed to prospectively evaluate, the impact and&#xD;
      effectiveness of clean incision prophylactic vacuum negative pressure therapy on wound&#xD;
      healing (ciNPWT) in women at high risk of developing wound complications who undergo major&#xD;
      gynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gynecologic Oncology patients appear to be more at risk of developing wound complications&#xD;
      than the general surgery population, reaching infection rates of 36 vs. 24 % that become 40&#xD;
      and 60% for obese and morbidly obese patients, respectively. Data about the use of ciNPWT are&#xD;
      few, controversial and are of poor quality. No randomized, controlled trials have yet been&#xD;
      reported in support of the use of ciNPWT in the gynecologic population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound complications in patients undergoing surgery for malignancies have a negative impact on&#xD;
      quality of life and, in addition, are associated with an increase of the duration of hospital&#xD;
      stay, imparting a significant socio-economic burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several approaches have been proposed to reduce the wound complications rate without success.&#xD;
      Instead, a novel and promising method has been employed which utilizes prophylactic negative&#xD;
      pressure wound therapy placed over clean and closed surgical incisions immediately after&#xD;
      surgery (ciNPWT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent meta-analysis across studies including all types of wounds and surgeries, ciNPWT&#xD;
      was observed to reduce by 29.4 % the incidence of SSI and the odds of SSI. In the same&#xD;
      meta-analysis, while limiting attention to general abdominal surgery alone, the weighted&#xD;
      average of the selected studies reported a reduction in wound complications of 10.43% (13.54%&#xD;
      vs 23.97%) for the ciNPWT group compared with controls which was a significant benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective multi-centre controlled randomized trial, where after gynecologic&#xD;
      oncologic laparotomic surgery and standard abdominal wall closure (if inclusion criteria&#xD;
      result satisfied), patient is randomized to one of the two arms of the study: ARM A&#xD;
      (sperimental): ciNPWT ARM B ( control): standard dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women in arm A: prophylactic ciNPWT therapy entails placement of the device over a closed&#xD;
      incision immediately post-operatively. The device may be left in place with no additional&#xD;
      intervention for up to 7 days. The use of the device does not require specialty care services&#xD;
      or continued hospitalization. For women in arm B: standard dressing should be changed every 2&#xD;
      days after sterile medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People will be visited after 7 day of VAC-therapy (first visit) , discharge time (second&#xD;
      visit or coincidence with the first visit), after 15 days from surgery (third visit for&#xD;
      agraphis removal), after 30 days from surgery (fourth visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size determination. A review of previous literature suggests that the incidence of&#xD;
      wound-SSI is about 35% in G.O. patients. We assume that the use of ciNPWT could be linked to&#xD;
      an wound-SSI incidence of 15% Setting a two-sided α=0.05 and power = 80%, the sample size is&#xD;
      N=164 subjects. A dropout rate of 20% is added, reaching a final sample size of N=196&#xD;
      subjects (98 subjects per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be achieved calculating and comparing the proportions of wound-SSI&#xD;
      in the two arms. The comparison will be performed with a Chi-squared test. The same test will&#xD;
      be applied to the comparisons of final and intermediate wound healing rates. The comparison&#xD;
      of the proportion of wound complications and the proportion of patients in need of&#xD;
      antibiotics will be achieved with a Chi-squared test, as well. Comparison of the time of&#xD;
      operating room required to apply the dressings, hospital stay and time to adjuvant therapies&#xD;
      will be performed with a T-test (if data are normally distributed) or with the Wilcoxon test&#xD;
      (if data are not normal). A p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data will be collected and managed using an electronic database anonymously.&#xD;
