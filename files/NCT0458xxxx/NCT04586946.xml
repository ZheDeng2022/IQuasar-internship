  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Home sleep studies - which allow the measurement of breathing while the person sleeps - will&#xD;
      be performed on patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease attending two of the UK's&#xD;
      largest respiratory medicine services.The study will investigate at how symptoms, and&#xD;
      breathing and exercise tests differ between these two groups after 12 months of study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The interstitial lung diseases are a group of diseases in which patients develop uncontrolled&#xD;
      scarring (called fibrosis) within the lung. This causes failure of the lung and patients&#xD;
      become progressively more breathless over time. The commonest of these diseases is idiopathic&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis and this is a devastating condition with a survival of 3-5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many people with fibrotic interstitial lung diseases have disrupted sleep as well as low&#xD;
      oxygen levels at night or obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA - pauses in breathing at night time&#xD;
      due to obstruction of the upper airway).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with low oxygen levels at night have a worse quality of life, with fatigue during&#xD;
      the day and survive for less long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      102 patients from specialist clinics at Guy's and St Thomas' and the Royal Brompton and&#xD;
      Harefield NHS Foundation Trusts will be recruited. This research is funded by a grant from&#xD;
      the British Lung Foundation. The investigators aim to compare patients with and without low&#xD;
      oxygen levels at night by observing how their disease and quality of life changes over a&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to complete a two-night home sleep study which will involve wearing a&#xD;
      probe over the finger connected to a sensor on the wrist. Patients will also be provided with&#xD;
      a home spirometer to measure their breathing at home daily during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung function testing (which is part of normal clinical practice), a six-minute walk test and&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires will be performed at the beginning of the study. These&#xD;
      investigations will be repeated at six and twelve months and this will tell us how night time&#xD;
      oxygen levels affect the progression of the disease, quality of life, exercise tolerance,&#xD;
      hospitalisation frequency and survival of these patients.&#xD;

      pulmonary fibrosis, including but not limited to Muc5b, TOLLIP and TERT. Serum and plasma&#xD;
      will be analysed for solu-ble biomarkers including but not limited to KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, Fas,&#xD;
      MMP1, MMP7, clusterin, dynamin, VEGF, CCL18, osteopontin, thrombospondin and inflammatory&#xD;
