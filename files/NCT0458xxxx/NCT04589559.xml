  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study tests the feasibility of a home-based heart rate variability biofeedback (HRVB)&#xD;
      intervention in survivors of cardiac arrest (CA). Specifically, the primary purpose of this&#xD;
      pilot study is to assess feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, usability, and&#xD;
      compliance for an at-home, 3-week HRVB intervention in 10 participants. The study also tests&#xD;
      whether cardiac-related interoceptive fear, trait anxiety, and negative affect decrease among&#xD;
      CA survivors completing the HRVB intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HRV biofeedback is a technique that combines slow paced breathing with the use of accurate,&#xD;
      moment-to-moment physiological monitoring. The goal is to make internal cardiac information&#xD;
      available to people in order to help them learn how to increase the beat-to-beat variability&#xD;
      in their heart's activity and thereby increase parasympathetic activity of the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system. Apart from active interventions such as exercise training that reliably&#xD;
      increase HRV but that may be inappropriate for many cardiac patients, HRV biofeedback is an&#xD;
      easy-to-implement technique which allows people to monitor and then ultimately alter their&#xD;
      parasympathetic activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research is needed to determine whether HRV biofeedback training has beneficial consequences&#xD;
      for mental and cardiovascular health in patients who have experienced serious,&#xD;
      life-threatening cardiac events. The investigator believes that cardiac arrest survivors, in&#xD;
      particular, may stand to benefit from such an intervention because many of them experience&#xD;
      clinically significant psychological distress after their medical event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distressed cardiac patients may be especially motivated to learn to influence their own heart&#xD;
      activity in order to improve their own HRV, reduce their cardiovascular risk, and lessen&#xD;
      their symptoms of psychological distress. Therefore, it may be wise to harness this&#xD;
      motivation in the service of helping these patients deliberately learn to alter their own&#xD;
      autonomic activity rather than simply breathing at a rate that automatically improves HRV&#xD;
      without any learning process. By providing patients with an external (e.g., visual) form of&#xD;
      feedback about their otherwise largely inaccessible autonomic physiology (i.e., vagus nerve&#xD;
      activity), the investigator will conduct a feasibility study of HRV biofeedback training with&#xD;
      the goal of increasing HRV and reducing anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of enrolling 10 participants&#xD;
      and assessing the feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, and usability of the at-home,&#xD;
      multi-week HRV biofeedback training as well as participants' compliance with the&#xD;
      intervention. Additionally, the purpose of the study is to assess whether participants&#xD;
      generally show a decrease in cardiac-related interoceptive fear, a decrease in trait anxiety,&#xD;
      a decrease in negative affect, and an increase in HRV during the course of the study. The&#xD;
      data collected from participants as part of this feasibility pilot will influence the&#xD;
      decision to continue with a larger randomized clinical trial using the methods in this pilot&#xD;
      together with a control group. Progress will be monitored with Polar H10 heart rate monitor -&#xD;
      a supremely precise heart rate sensor that comes with the Polar Pro chest strap. It will be&#xD;
      used with a smartphone app Elite HRV - which is non-experimental.&#xD;
