    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>FACT-G ((Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General) is a validated multi-dimensional quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. It consists of 26 items and addresses four dimensions of QoL, including physical wellbeing (PWB), functional wellbeing (FWB), emotional wellbeing (EWB), and social wellbeing (SWB). The scoring system is a five-point Likert scale assessing the QoL of the past seven days. The FACT-G total score has a range of 0-108, whereas higher scores indicate a higher QoL.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in PHQ-9 at week 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire) aims at depressive disorders in medically ill populations. It is a 9-item diagnostic tool based upon the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV) criteria for major depressive disorder. The PHQ-9 score has a range of 0-27, whereas a score above 10 indicates major depression,&#xD;
This questionnaire will also be completed by a close caregiver (family or friend).</description>

    <measure>Change of symptom burden, assessed by ESAS-R</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and weekly until week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The ESAS-R (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale revised) was established specifically for palliative care patients and is a nine-item patient-rated symptom visual analog scale. Each item is rated by a numerical rating scale (0-10), whereas higher numbers indicate a more severe symptom experience. The total score of all symptoms represents the total symptom-burden, whereas a higher score indicates a higher total symptom-burden.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in use of Pro re nata medication (P.R.N.M.), assessed by Pro re nata medication diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily from baseline to week 8</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the use of pro re nata medication, the participants will document their usage in a diary. P.R.N.M. may be antiemetics, analgetics, tranquilizers or any other drug used for acute symptom relieve.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in FAMCARE-2 at week 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the satisfaction of advanced cancer care in family or friends caregivers, the family satisfaction with end-of-life care two questionnaire (FAMCARE-2) will be used. It is a 17-item assessment tool using a Likert scale (score: 0-68), including subscales for information giving, physical patient care, psychosocial care, and availability of care. A high score on the FAMCARE-2 is associated with a high satisfaction with the palliative care service.&#xD;
This questionnaire will only be completed by a close caregiver (family or friend).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in Performance Scales at week 4 and 8</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 4 and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Karnofsky Performance Scale describes a patient's ability to perform daily activities without restrictions due to disease through to death on a scale of 100 to 0, in steps of 10. Additionally, the ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) Performance Scale, which is a six-grade scale that assesses the level of functioning in terms of self-care, activity, and physical ability, will be assessed.</description>
