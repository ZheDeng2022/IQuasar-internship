  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) is an umbrella term that refers to any report on a&#xD;
      health status measure that is reported directly by the patient, without the influence of&#xD;
      clinicians or anyone else. PROMs have been shown to more closely reflect a patient's daily&#xD;
      health status when compared to physician-reported measures. However, research is needed to&#xD;
      evaluate if patient symptom reporting during definitive-intent radiotherapy allows earlier&#xD;
      and improved detection of treatment toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMPROVE pilot study will describe the proportion of patients with cancer with changes in&#xD;
      physician-perception of treatment-related toxicity that result from routine physician review&#xD;
      of PROMs reported during definitive radiotherapy.&#xD;

      Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) is an umbrella term that refers to any report on a&#xD;
      health status measure that is reported directly by the patient, without the influence of&#xD;
      clinicians or anyone else. PROMs have been shown to more closely reflect a patient's daily&#xD;
      health status when compared to physician-reported measures. However, research is needed to&#xD;
      evaluate if patient symptom reporting during definitive-intent radiotherapy allows earlier&#xD;
      and improved detection of treatment toxicity, and leads to individualized interventions which&#xD;
      may improve the toxicity outcomes for patients with locally-advanced and oligometastatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that routine physician review of PROMs during on-treatment&#xD;
      visits will (1) increase proportion of patients with an increased in their physician' s&#xD;
      assessment of their overall toxicity burden during definitive radiotherapy, and (2)&#xD;
      correspondingly increase the proportion of patients receiving physician-directed&#xD;
      interventions for treatment-related symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IMPROVE pilot study will describe the proportion of patients with cancer with changes in&#xD;
      physician-perception of treatment-related toxicity that result from routine physician review&#xD;
      of PROMs reported during definitive radiotherapy. The IMPROVE study will also describe (1)&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with changes in the management of treatment-related symptoms and&#xD;
      (2) the type of management changes that result from routine physician review of PROMs&#xD;
      reported during definitive radiotherapy.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with any change in their physicians-assessed burden scores for at least one radiotherapy on-treatment visit, along with their exact binomial 95% confidence interval. Lee et al. demonstrated the feasibility of using a global burden score to capture the provider's overall perception of the combined burden of all assessed symptoms, using a visual analogue scale demarcating an aggregate score from 0 to 10. This scale uses anchors at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 for no, mild, moderate, severe, life-threatening adverse events, and death, respectively.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>During weekly on-treatment visits and prior to reviewing their patient's PROMs, physicians will formulate an initial symptom management plan based on available clinical data. Then after reviewing the patient's PROMs, physicians will report any change in recommended interventions due to review of the PROMs.</description>

        Our study population will be treating radiation oncologists and their primary cancer&#xD;
        patients requiring definitive treatment with radiation with or without concurrent&#xD;
        chemotherapy as per the inclusion criteria below. Cancer patients receiving stereotactic&#xD;
        body radiation therapy or hypo-fractionated definitive radiation will not be recruited as&#xD;
        these patients represent a different treatment population with a much lower overall&#xD;
        treatment toxicity burden.&#xD;
