    <textblock>
      One of the frequently encountered problems in breastfeeding is insufficient lactation.&#xD;
      Numerous integrative treatments support to overcome this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled experimental study will conduct to determine the effect of&#xD;
      acupressure on lactation in non-breastfeeding mothers following preterm caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample of the study will comprise of 64 mothers (32 acupressure-experimental and 32&#xD;
      control group), who will randomly select from among the primipara mothers of premature&#xD;
      newborns delivered through cesarean section at Dursun Odabaş Medical Center of Van Yüzüncü&#xD;
      Yıl University. Before the implementation, the Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale and the&#xD;
      Richard Campbell Sleep Quality Scale will apply. In post-operative three days, 15-minute&#xD;
      acupressure will implement in the morning/evening, for acupressure-group mothers and pump&#xD;
      milking will apply; control group mothers will only milked in mornings and evenings.&#xD;
      Lactation symptoms will evaluate with Visual Analog Scale and acupressure satisfaction with&#xD;
      Analog Patient Satisfaction Scale, and milk quantities will record.&#xD;
