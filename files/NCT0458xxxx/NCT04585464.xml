  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EDG-5506 is an investigational product intended to protect and improve function of dystrophic&#xD;
      muscle fibers. This Phase 1 study of EDG-5506 will assess the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and of EDG-5506 in adult healthy volunteers and in adults with Becker&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy (BMD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants in this study will receive a single oral dose or multiple oral doses of&#xD;
      EDG-5506 or a placebo. Blood and urine samples will be collected to measure how EDG-5506 is&#xD;
      processed by the body and how the body responds when exposed to EDG-5506. Participants in the&#xD;
      single ascending dose part of the study will remain in the clinic for 7 days with a 42-day&#xD;
      follow-up period. Participants in the multiple ascending dose part of the study will remain&#xD;
      in the clinic for 16 days with a 13-day follow-up period. Safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of EDG-5506 will be assessed in healthy volunteers prior to enrolling&#xD;
      participants with Becker muscular dystrophy.&#xD;
