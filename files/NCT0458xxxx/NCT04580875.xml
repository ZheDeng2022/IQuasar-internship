  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exploratory laparotomy has been traditionally used for managing penetrating abdominal trauma&#xD;
      (PAT). Currently, minimally invasive surgery (for diagnosis and treatment purposes) is a&#xD;
      well-established and rapidly growing modality for dealing with penetrating abdominal trauma&#xD;
      in stable children. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and outcomes and emphasize&#xD;
      the importance of timely intervention by minimally invasive surgery for PAT possessing the&#xD;
      potential to violate the peritoneum in stable pediatric victims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study was carried out on 102 hemodynamically stable pediatric cases with&#xD;
      highly suspicious penetrating abdominal trauma (caused by gunshot, stab, &amp; accidental stab),&#xD;
      admitted and managed by minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy &amp; laparoscopic-assisted&#xD;
      procedures). Information recorded for analysis included demographic data, anatomical location&#xD;
      of injury, organs affected, operative findings, operative time, need for conversion to&#xD;
      laparoscopic-assisted approach, length of stay, complications, missed injury, and mortality&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 102 pediatric cases with highly suspicious penetrating abdominal trauma (PAT) were&#xD;
      managed by minimally invasive surgery (MIS). They were 62 males and 40 females with mean age&#xD;
      of 7.3±0.6 years (range, 1-14 years). They included 39 cases of gunshot, 30 cases of stab&#xD;
      abdomen, and 33 cases of accidental stab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, there was 100% accuracy in defining the injured organs with zero percent&#xD;
      missed injuries in addition to effective therapeutic potential as regard the role of&#xD;
      minimally invasive surgery in management of penetrating abdominal trauma in children.&#xD;

      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Herein, the investigators aim to present our experience, evaluate the effectiveness &amp;&#xD;
      outcomes, and emphasize the importance of timely intervention by minimally invasive surgery&#xD;
      in managing PAT highly suspicious to violate the peritoneum in hemodynamically stable&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review of literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Different management modalities of penetrating abdominal trauma in children&#xD;
           (conservative, routine exploratory laparotomy, Laparoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disadvantages of selective non-operative management (SNOM) and negative&#xD;
           (non-therapeutic) laparotomy for penetrating abdominal trauma in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Merits of diagnostic and therapeutic laparoscopy for penetrating abdominal trauma in&#xD;
           children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study, will be conducted out at 3 pediatric surgery tertiary centers&#xD;
      (Al-Azhar University hospitals in Cairo, Prince Mohammed bin Abdul-Aziz Hospital in Riyadh&#xD;
      and Maternity &amp; Children's Hospital in KSA) on pediatric patients presenting to the ER by&#xD;
      penetrating abdominal trauma in the period from January 2015 to February 2021. Responders to&#xD;
      initial resuscitation will be managed by minimally invasive surgery (laparoscopy and&#xD;
      laparoscopic-assisted procedures). The total anatomical region of interest is defined as the&#xD;
      cylindrical area bounded superiorly by the nipple line and the inferiorly by symphysis pubis.&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will give a written informed consent even for possible&#xD;
      conversion to laparotomy if necessary. The study will be approved by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board and ethics committee of the hospitals. All bullets and sharp objects will be removed&#xD;
      during the procedures after optimum secure hemostasis. The main objective is to&#xD;
      laparoscopically manage all PAT highly suspicious to violate the peritoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases will be admitted, resuscitated, and stabilized as per pediatric advanced life support&#xD;
      (PALS) and advanced trauma life support (ATLS) protocol guidelines, meanwhile, cases will be&#xD;
      investigated by appropriate laboratory &amp; radiologic studies. All patients will undergo E-FAST&#xD;
      ultrasound and contrast abdominopelvic CT. Documented patients' data will include patient&#xD;
      demographics, mechanism of injury, location of injury, pediatric trauma score (PTS) on&#xD;
      admission (included weight, systolic blood pressure, mental status, airway condition,&#xD;
      skeletal fracture, &amp; open wounds), need for preoperative blood transfusion, surgical&#xD;
      approach, operative findings, duration of hospital stay, complications, need for&#xD;
      re-intervention, and follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Institutes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter study at Pediatric Surgery Departments, Al-Azhar University hospitals in Cairo,&#xD;
      Prince Mohammed bin Abdul-Aziz hospital (PMAH) in Riyadh, and Maternity &amp; Children's hospital&#xD;
      in KSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of cases: One-hundred-Two cases. Time frame: period of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Consideration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will be discussed and approved for clinical study by the Ethical Research&#xD;
      Committee at PMAH and other participating hospitals. The procedures and the aim of the study&#xD;
      will be clearly explained to the patient and the family. A written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained before enrollment of the patients into the study. The family refusal to give consent&#xD;
      for laparoscopic management is respected but does not deprive the patient from getting&#xD;
      surgical care by exploration laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be subjected to full clinical examination, rapid history taking, and&#xD;
      necessary laboratory investigations (CBC, Coagulation profile, Liver and Renal Function&#xD;
      tests, rapid serology for HBV, HCV, &amp; HIV) and preoperative imaging (E-FAST, CT). They will&#xD;
      be rapidly assessed and resuscitated. They will receive a dose of triple broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics 30 min-1 hour before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were followed-up for median period of 52±17.12 months (range, 6-60 months) with no&#xD;
      patients lost to follow-up. Ninety-two patients were reviewed at the office clinic and 10&#xD;
      patients were contacted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data were analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 24.0 (IBM&#xD;
      Corp, IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY, USA). Continuous variables were expressed&#xD;
      as mean± standard deviation (SD), range, and average while categorical variables were&#xD;
      expressed as frequency count and percentage. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison of&#xD;
      frequency counts/percentage. The t test was used for comparison of mean values. A two-sided p&#xD;
      value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion will focus on laparoscopic management of penetrating abdominal trauma in children.&#xD;
      The results obtained from this study will be compared with each other and with that reported&#xD;
      in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discussion will focus on operative difficulties, operative time, conversion to directed&#xD;
      laparotomy (laparoscopic-assisted procedure), and complications. It will compare results of&#xD;
      this study with the results of others. Discussion will determine the most accurate management&#xD;
      modality for penetrating abdominal trauma in children which offers the best outcome and least&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
