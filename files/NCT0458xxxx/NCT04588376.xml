      Findings from an ongoing improvement project to improve antibiotic prescribing for children&#xD;
      and adolescents for three acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs: upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute otitis media) among pediatric and family&#xD;
      medicine clinics revealed performance gaps between the two primary care specialties. An&#xD;
      improvement project was then set up to address the lower performance by family medicine&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review revealed that, in general, quality improvement feedback was more effective&#xD;
      if provided to individual clinicians rather than to a group of clinicians, but very limited&#xD;
      data existed for antibiotic prescribing practices actually comparing individual clinician&#xD;
      feedback to group (clinic-level) feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that individual clinician data feedback is superior to group (clinic-level)&#xD;
      feedback in improving antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs in children and adolescents by family&#xD;
      medicine clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to determine if there are significant differences for antibiotic prescribing for&#xD;
      ARTIs and for broad spectrum antibiotic prescribing percentage between an intervention group&#xD;
      and a comparator group of family medicine clinics after the intervention starting November&#xD;
      2015 and ending December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster randomized trial was designed for 39 family medicine clinics. The intervention&#xD;

      Introduction/Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from an ongoing improvement project to improve antibiotic prescribing for children&#xD;
      and adolescents for three acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs: upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infection, acute bacterial sinusitis, and acute otitis media) among pediatric and family&#xD;
      medicine clinics revealed performance gaps between the two primary care specialties. An&#xD;
      improvement project was then set up to address the lower performance by family medicine&#xD;
      clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Literature review revealed that, in general, quality improvement feedback was more effective&#xD;
      if provided to individual clinicians rather than to a group of clinicians, but very limited&#xD;
      data existed for antibiotic prescribing practices actually comparing individual clinician&#xD;
      feedback to group (clinic-level) feedback.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that individual clinician data feedback is superior to group (clinic-level)&#xD;
      feedback in improving antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs in children and adolescents by family&#xD;
      medicine clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to determine if there are significant differences for antibiotic prescribing for&#xD;
      ARTIs and for broad spectrum antibiotic prescribing percentage between an intervention group&#xD;
      and a comparator group of family medicine clinics after the intervention starting November&#xD;
      2015 and ending December 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster randomized trial was designed for all 98 family medicine clinics within Novant&#xD;
      Health Medical Group. In August 2015, retrospective review of data from January 1, 2014 was&#xD;
      conducted by the antimicrobial stewardship team, and the trial was developed. Clusters were a&#xD;
      subset of clinics identified as under-performing, based on not avoiding antibiotics in at&#xD;
      least 83% of patients with upper respiratory infection or common cold (URI) (2013 Healthcare&#xD;
      Effectiveness Data Information Set mean in patients 3 months-18 years of age). Among these 47&#xD;
      clinics, 6 had recorded &lt; 20 encounters in the 6 months, January-June 2015, for an illness&#xD;
      diagnosis of URI and were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining 39 clinics sites in 26 practices (1 practice had 10 clinic sites and a second&#xD;
      had 5 sites; all others were single site practices) agreed to participate and were stratified&#xD;
      by size of clinic (number of clinics or clinicians as very small, small, large, very large).&#xD;
      Clinics were then block randomized with selection of half of each stratum for two groups - an&#xD;
      intervention group and a comparator group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institutional Review Board of Novant Health Presbyterian Medical Center granted a waiver&#xD;
      of written, informed consent. An email was sent to the lead physicians for the 41 remaining&#xD;
      clinics detailing the protocol, and all but two clinics agreed to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 39 clinics received the same multifaceted intervention with one exception. This&#xD;
      intervention included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A one-hour, in-person, educational session, in September-October 2015, with the lead&#xD;
           clinician, clinic administrator, and stewardship team physicians describing the project&#xD;
           and clinical guidelines for URI, ABS, and AOM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A tip sheet detailing how to improve scores (appropriate codes and documentation&#xD;
           strategies).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An after-visit summary for clinicians to give to patients and parents discussing&#xD;
           antibiotic use and side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A presentation of summary results for all pediatric and family medicine clinics for the&#xD;
           3 ARTI metrics to for the six-month period, January-June 2015. Clinic comparison&#xD;
           performance data were then provided monthly for all 39 clinics&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Discussion about a new clinical pathway for acute bacterial sinusitis with a request for&#xD;
           adoption and implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A request of each practice to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Discuss the guidelines for the three metrics, the tip sheet, the AVS, and baseline&#xD;
                performance at the outset.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Adopt and implement the ABS clinical pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Review monthly the performance scores for the three metrics. The exception was the&#xD;
                intervention group received monthly clinician-specific performance data for the&#xD;
                three measures, while the comparator group received only clinic-level data. All&#xD;
                family medicine clinics received composite clinic-level data for all family&#xD;
                medicine and pediatric clinics so each clinician could view, at the clinic level,&#xD;
                all other clinics' performances. Clinical decision support was not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline performance data were collected retrospectively from January 1, 2014-October 31,&#xD;
      2015. The intervention period was November 1, 2015-December 31, 2017. A post-intervention&#xD;
      period was from January 1-December 31, 2018, during which time only clinic-level data were&#xD;
      provided monthly to all 39 clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit-level data included ICD-9 codes and, starting in October 2015, ICD-10 codes associated&#xD;
      with an encounter (IE) and listed as a visit diagnosis. Antibiotic prescribing was determined&#xD;
      by medication orders' search in the record associated with the encounter or within 30 days&#xD;
      prior (if URI diagnosis) or within 60 days prior (if ABS or AOM diagnosis) and 3 days&#xD;
      subsequent to the encounter. IEs were defined as evaluation and management visits for new&#xD;
      patients (with codes 99201-99205) and for established patients (with codes 99212-99215).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infectious Diseases Society&#xD;
      of America, customized clinical quality measures for the 3 ARTIs were developed and validated&#xD;
      by selective, manual chart review of electronic health records. These measures represented&#xD;
      the primary outcomes at cluster level and included as numerator, appropriate care, and&#xD;
      denominator, IE, for each ARTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A target of ≥ 90% for URI was set using the HEDIS® 2013 90th percentile, and at 80% for ABS&#xD;
      and AOM, consistent with targets suggested by an outpatient antibiotic use target-setting&#xD;
      workgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary outcome was broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribing (BSAP) percentage, determined&#xD;
      monthly by enumerating all antibiotics given, stratifying by narrow and broad spectrum and&#xD;
      dividing by the total number of antibiotics prescribed for any condition, not limited to the&#xD;
      3 ARTIs. For this calculation, patients were excluded if their record showed an allergy to an&#xD;
      antibiotic listed as narrow or broad spectrum and/or one of the listed antibiotics had been&#xD;
      given 60 days prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if code shifting occurred or total antibiotic utilization changed after the&#xD;
      intervention began, the investigators recorded the mean number of encounters per clinic for&#xD;
      the 3 ARTIs and the total of all IEs and antibiotics prescribed for all patients seen for&#xD;
      illness in the baseline and intervention periods in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power will be estimated based on the primary outcomes, baseline-to-intervention period change&#xD;
      in the proportion of encounters with the appropriate treatment for URI, ABS, and AOM,&#xD;
      respectively. The numbers of clusters are fixed at 22 for the intervention group and 17 for&#xD;
      the comparator group. Based on retrospective data from the baseline period, the average&#xD;
      cluster sizes, i.e., the average numbers of encounters per clinic over 22 months, for URI,&#xD;
      ABS, and AOM, respectively, are 210.0, 72.6, and 129.2 for the intervention group and 211.0,&#xD;
      65.5, and 133.6 for the comparator group. This provided &gt; 85% power to detect a study group&#xD;
      difference in mean baseline-to-intervention period change of 0.4 standard deviations,&#xD;
      corresponding to a medium effect size, with two-sided alpha = 0.05, for intra-cluster&#xD;
      correlations (ICCs) ranging between 0.01 and 0.15. The power analysis was performed using&#xD;
      PASS 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic is the unit of analysis for describing changes in clinical decision making. The&#xD;
      primary outcomes, i.e., the proportion of relevant encounters with appropriate treatment (for&#xD;
      URI, ABS, and AOM, respectively) will be recorded for each clinic during the baseline and&#xD;
      intervention periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the influence of the intervention on clinical decision making, a generalized linear&#xD;
      mixed model (GLMM) will be analyzed for each outcome using PROC GLIMMIX® in SAS. The response&#xD;
      variable in the models is y/n, where y = the number of appropriate treatment occurrences and&#xD;
      n = the total number of relevant encounters, and the response distribution is specified as&#xD;
      binomial with a logit link. The independent variables are the study group (intervention,&#xD;
      comparator), time period (baseline, intervention), a study-group-by-time interaction term,&#xD;
      and clinic size (very small, small, large, and very large) (used as the stratification&#xD;
      variable in the randomization). The models include a random intercept term for clinic to&#xD;
      account for relatedness of clinical decisions made in the same clinic. The p-value for the&#xD;
      interaction term will be used to assess significance between the intervention and comparator&#xD;
      groups on the baseline-to-intervention period change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall alpha level is pre-specified at 0.05. To account for multiple testing, Holm's&#xD;
      Step-Down procedure will be used to adjust p-values, where the family of inferences includes&#xD;
      those for the three primary outcomes and the secondary outcome, BSAP%. In the case of a&#xD;
      significant interaction effect, the pre-intervention and post-intervention outcome will be&#xD;
      compared for the intervention and comparator groups, respectively, using pre-specified&#xD;
      contrasts generated from the GLMM. Odds ratios, corresponding to these contrasts, will be&#xD;
      calculated, along with 95% confidence intervals that are Bonferroni-corrected (at the α/2 =&#xD;
      0.025 level) to further adjust for multiple comparisons. For each outcome variable, the ICC&#xD;
      will be calculated using the level-2 (i.e. random intercept) variance from the GLMM and a&#xD;
      level-1 variance component assumed to be π‸2/3 = 3.29 for a logistic random intercept model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the secondary outcome, BSAP percentage, will be conducted using the steps&#xD;
      described for the primary outcomes. All analyses will be performed using SAS.&#xD;
