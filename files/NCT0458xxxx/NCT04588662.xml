      The overall objective of this proposal is to develop and utilize a multicenter UM registry&#xD;
      that will, in a longitudinal fashion, capture prospective data in order to characterize the&#xD;
      natural history of UM and provide data that will be used to support the development of novel&#xD;
      therapies for this disease. The care of patients with UM requires a multi-disciplinary team&#xD;
      of physicians that commonly requires the involvement of both radiation oncology and&#xD;
      interventional radiology, and is typically directed by an ophthalmologic oncologist at time&#xD;
      of initial diagnosis of primary disease. Overall management is transitioned to a medical&#xD;
      oncologist when distant recurrence is identified. In the case that a patient presents with&#xD;
      metastasis at the time of diagnosis, a medical oncologist typically directs overall&#xD;
      management. The management of surveillance for the development of metastasis following the&#xD;
      treatment of primary disease is variable and, if performed at all, is managed by either an&#xD;
      ophthalmologic oncologist or medical oncologist. Thus, the successful development of a&#xD;
      registry that aims to capture the data regarding the full natural history of UM requires a&#xD;
      collaborative effort including leaders from both the UM ophthalmologic oncology and medical&#xD;
      oncology fields. To this end, the investigators have built an initial consortium of key&#xD;
      ophthalmologic oncology and medical oncology leaders from multiple major UM centers in the&#xD;
      United States.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, accounting&#xD;
      for 85% to 95% of ocular melanoma cases. However, UM represents only about 3% to 5% of all&#xD;
      melanomas in the United States (US). UM most commonly arises from choroidal melanocytes&#xD;
      (85-90%), but can also arise from the iris (3-5%) and ciliary body (5-8%). The median age of&#xD;
      diagnosis is approximately 62; however, the peak range for diagnosis is between 70 and 79.&#xD;
      Males have a 30% greater incidence than females. A variety of putative risk factors have been&#xD;
      identified, including the presence of light eyes, fair skin, an inability to tan, ocular&#xD;
      melanocytosis, dysplastic nevus syndrome, and germline BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1)&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly, there are no recent or on-going multi-center natural history studies being&#xD;
      conducted in this disease, and this effort is the only one to be launched with the goal of&#xD;
      capturing the complete course of this disease, from diagnosis, initial management,&#xD;
      surveillance, and treatment of recurrent disease in a national and international setting.&#xD;
      This registry is especially important in providing such needed data.&#xD;
