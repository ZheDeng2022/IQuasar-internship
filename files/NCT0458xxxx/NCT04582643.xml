  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to validate and pilot test the short-term intervention effect of a newly&#xD;
      developed healthy metabolic behaviour tool, named as the 6P tool, on dietary attitude/&#xD;
      practice and body weight changes over one month among overweight and obese women. A total of&#xD;
      50 women, aged 21-40 years, BMI â‰¥25 kg/m2, who are attending the preconception clinic and&#xD;
      planning for a pregnancy over the next one year, will be invited to participate in this pilot&#xD;
      study. The recruitment period is estimated to take up to 10 weeks, with subsequent 1 month&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preconception is a stage that could critically influence subsequent antenatal and postnatal&#xD;
      health of mother and offspring. In Singapore, approximately one-third of women are overweight&#xD;
      and obese during the preconception period. In the present pilot study, the investigators aim&#xD;
      to introduce a simple, self-administered tool that can identify discrete components of an&#xD;
      individual's diet, which would lead to self-awareness, self-evaluation and self-education,&#xD;
      and over time, results in a positive change in eating habits and health. Specifically, the&#xD;
      study aims i) to validate a newly developed tool that comprises six main dietary components&#xD;
      (6P), namely Portion, Proportion, Pleasure, Phase, Physicality and Psychology in overweight&#xD;
      and obese women during the preconception period; (ii) and to assess the short-term&#xD;
      intervention effect of the 6P tool on dietary attitude/ practice and body weight changes over&#xD;
      one month. The investigators hypothesise that intervention using this 6P tool in overweight&#xD;
      and obese women will help them to promote healthy eating behaviours and reduce body weight.&#xD;
      This study targets to recruit 50 overweight/ obese preconception women, from KK Women's and&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool over one month. Throughout the&#xD;
      one month follow up period, nudges in the form of text messages/images related to the 6P&#xD;
      goals will be sent to participants through mobile phone. This validated 6P tool is planned to&#xD;
      be applied in a preconception targeted intervention cohort in order to build a positive&#xD;
      mental model in healthy eating among overweight and obese women, enhancing awareness and&#xD;
      belief towards weight management behaviour, and promoting a healthy life cycle.&#xD;
