  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a simultaneous treatment by high&#xD;
      power magnet and radiofrequency energy for toning of abdomen and reduction of subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat. The study is a prospective multi-center single-blinded sham-controlled study. The&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and assigned into two study groups; active and sham group. Subjects&#xD;
      of both groups will be required to complete three (3) treatment visits and two to three&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of a simultaneous treatment by high&#xD;
      power magnet and radiofrequency energy for toning of abdomen and reduction of subcutaneous&#xD;
      fat. The study is a prospective multi-center single-blinded sham-controlled study. The&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled and assigned into two study groups; active and sham group. Subjects&#xD;
      of both groups will be required to complete three (3) treatment visits and two to three&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, ultrasound imaging will be performed; the subject's weight and waist&#xD;
      circumference will be recorded. Photos of the treated area will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment administration phase in both study groups will consist of three (3) treatments,&#xD;
      delivered once a week. The applicator of BTL-703 will be applied over the umbilicus. The&#xD;
      active group will receive treatment with intensities of a magnetic field and radiofrequency&#xD;
      energy just below the patient's tolerance threshold. The device will induce visible muscle&#xD;
      contractions along with heating of the subcutaneous fat. The sham group will receive a&#xD;
      treatment with the intensities of the magnetic field and radiofrequency energy set to 5% of&#xD;
      the maximum device output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the last therapy visit, the subject's weight and waist circumference will be recorded, and&#xD;
      photos of the treated area will be taken. In addition, subjects will receive Subject&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire to fill in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety measures will include documentation of adverse events (AE) including the subject's&#xD;
      experience of pain or discomfort after each procedure. Following each treatment&#xD;
      administration and at all of the follow-up visits, subjects will be checked for immediate&#xD;
      post-procedure adverse event assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the post-procedure visits (at 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits), the subjects will&#xD;
      undergo ultrasound imaging. Also, the subject's satisfaction will be noted, and weight with&#xD;
      waist circumference will be recorded. Photographs of the treated area will be taken. There&#xD;
      will be an option of a 6-months follow-up visit, according to subject's availability.&#xD;

    <description>To gather clinical evidence on the effectiveness of the combined treatment for abdominal toning and subcutaneous fat reduction through changes in abdominal tissues, measured via ultrasound and comparison of active and sham groups. The changes will be considered statistically significant where p-value &lt;0.05.</description>

    <measure>Patient's satisfaction with study treatment measured via questionnaires</measure>
    <time_frame>7 months</time_frame>
    <description>To determine the patient's satisfaction with study treatment for non-invasive aesthetic improvement of the abdomen. The 5-point Likert scale Satisfaction questionnaire will be used to evaluate the participant's satisfaction with the therapy outcome. Subject satisfaction will be assessed after the last therapy visit and during the follow-up visits.</description>
