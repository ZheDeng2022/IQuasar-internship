  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adipose, or fat, tissue is a plastic organ that retains the ability to expand and store&#xD;
      excess calories during positive energy balance in humans. The capacity of subcutaneous (subQ)&#xD;
      adipose tissue to expand and remodel is an important determinant of obesity-related health&#xD;
      complications, and impaired expansion of subQ fat tissue is thought to contribute to the risk&#xD;
      of diseases such as the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D). The&#xD;
      objectives of the study are to evaluate the changes and mechanisms of (subQ) adipose tissue&#xD;
      expandability that occur as a result of short-term weight gain and to investigate the effects&#xD;
      on cardio-metabolic health outcomes. Findings from this study will provide new insight into&#xD;
      the dynamics of adipose expansion and remodeling during changes in energy balance and how&#xD;
      this may impact future fat tissue function and metabolic health.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Following the consumption of deuterium-labeled water (2H2O; heavy water), adipose tissue biopsies from the subcutaneous abdominal and femoral depots will be collected. The 2H from the heavy water is enriched into the DNA of newly synthesized cells. The primary outcome is to assess changes in new adipocyte formation in vivo and other mechanisms of adipose expansion and remodeling in response to 30% overfeeding (OF group) relative to the weight-stable CTL group.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Following the consumption of deuterium-labeled water (2H2O; heavy water), adipose tissue biopsies from the subcutaneous abdominal and femoral depots will be collected. The 2H from the heavy water is incorporated into the glycerol component of the adipose, providing a measure of new triglyceride synthesis. A secondary outcome is to assess changes in triglyceride synthesis in vivo and other mechanisms of adipose expansion and remodeling in response to 30% overfeeding (OF group) relative to the weight-stable CTL group.</description>

    <description>A secondary outcome is to investigate the correlation between mechanisms of adipose tissue expansion and remodeling with changes in metabolic health outcomes (i.e. abdominal adiposity; insulin sensitivity; ectopic lipid) in response to 30% OF relative to the CTL group.</description>
