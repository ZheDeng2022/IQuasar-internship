      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of sweet in compare to virtual reality&#xD;
      (VR) device in reducing injection pain and anxiety associated with local anesthesia in&#xD;
      pediatric dental patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial is a randomized split-mouth assignment. Included patients are 5 - 12 years&#xD;
      old requiring local anesthetic infiltration with conventional syringe (CS) for conservative&#xD;
      treatment of two primary maxillary molars bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients undergo two single-visit treatments after CFSS-DS measurement before each,&#xD;
      whereas sweet is allocated to first local anesthesia procedure and VR is allocated to second&#xD;
      local anesthesia procedure. Primary outcome measure will be pain felt during injection,&#xD;
      reported by patient on visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcome measures: self-reported&#xD;
      anxiety during injection on FIS; pain-related behavior according to FLACC scale; heart-rate&#xD;
      dynamics; patient preference to local anesthesia method - CS+sweet or CS+VR.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Achieving local anesthesia in children is one of the critical aspects of pain management and&#xD;
      they effect the quality of treatment as well as behavior of child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A contemporary engaging form of distraction is represented by virtual reality devices.&#xD;
      Virtual reality (VR) devices create a virtual environment of view and sound that allow&#xD;
      patients to be immersed in an interactive, simulated world to distract them from pain. The VR&#xD;
      devices have a wide viewing field and three-dimensional displays that project the images&#xD;
      right in front of the user. They not only show potentially attractive audio-visual stimuli,&#xD;
      but also exclude all other visual environmental stimuli that may affect the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While sweet-tasting reduce signs of pain during painful procedures. This effect is considered&#xD;
      to be mediated both by the release of endorphins and by a pre absorptive mechanism related to&#xD;
      the sweet taste.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of sweet-testing compare to a virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) device in reducing injection pain and anxiety associated with local anesthesia&#xD;
      in pediatric dental patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device used in this study is Harga Miniso Vr Glass 3d terbaru, compatible with a mobile&#xD;
      phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sweet used is xylitol tablet The clinical trial is a randomized split-mouth assignment.&#xD;
      Included patients are healthy positive children 5-12 years old requiring local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration for conservative treatment of two primary maxillary molars bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients undergo two single-visit treatments after measurement of dental fear prior&#xD;
      to each according to the Dental Subscale of the Children's Fear Survey Schedule (CFSS-DS).&#xD;
      Local anesthetic is delivered through buccal infiltration with conventional syringe, where is&#xD;
      the sweet-test applied with first local anesthesia procedure and the virtual reality&#xD;
      distraction is allocated to second local anesthesia procedure. Primary outcome measure will&#xD;
      be pain felt during injection, reported by patient on visual analogue scale. Secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures: self-reported anxiety during injection on Facial Image Scale; pain-related&#xD;
      behavior according to Faces, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) scale; heart-rate&#xD;
      dynamics; patient preference to local anesthesia method - sweet test infiltration or virtual&#xD;
      reality device-assisted injection.&#xD;
