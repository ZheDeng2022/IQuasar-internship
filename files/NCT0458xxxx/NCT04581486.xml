  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of an optimal-massive intervention (OMI)&#xD;
      based on increasing shear viscosity of fluids, nutritional support with oral nutritional&#xD;
      supplements (ONS) and triple adaptation of food (rheological and textural, caloric and&#xD;
      protein and organoleptic) and oral hygiene improvement on the incidence of respiratory&#xD;
      infections in older patients with OD. We have designed a randomized clinical trial, with two&#xD;
      parallel arms and 6 months follow-up. The study population will be constituted by older&#xD;
      patients of 70 years or more with OD hospitalized at Hospital de Mataró by an acute process&#xD;
      that will be identified by using the volume-viscosity swallow clinical test. We will&#xD;
      consecutively recruit 500 subjects during admission (Geriatrics, Internal medicine, etc.) at&#xD;
      the Hospital de Mataró. Patients included will be randomly assigned to one of both&#xD;
      interventional groups: a) study intervention: multifactorial intervention based on fluid&#xD;
      viscosity adaptation (with a xanthan gum thickener -&gt; Nutilis Clear®), nutritional support&#xD;
      with a triple adaptation of food (texture, caloric and protein content, organoleptic) +&#xD;
      pre-thickened ONS and evaluation and treatment of oral hygiene (tooth brushing + antiseptic&#xD;
      mouthwashes + professional dental cleaning), or b) control intervention: standard clinical&#xD;
      practice (fluid adaptation with Nutilis Powder and simple texture adaptation for solids).&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: respiratory infection incidence during the 6-month period follow-up.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: mortality at 6 months, general hospital readmissions and readmissions due&#xD;
      to respiratory infections, nutritional status, hydration status, quality of life, functional&#xD;
      status, oral hygiene and dysphagia severity and its relationship with other study variables.&#xD;

      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Study design: Randomized controlled clinical trial with two parallel arms and 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary aim: To evaluate the effect of a rheological, nutritional and oral hygiene&#xD;
           intervention (OMI) on the incidence of respiratory infections including lower&#xD;
           respiratory tract infections -LRTI-, pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#xD;
           (COPD) infectious exacerbations in older patients with OD at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary aims: to evaluate the effect at 1, 3 and 6 months of this intervention on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. General hospital readmission and hospital readmission due to respiratory&#xD;
                infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Nutritional status according to the MNA, anthropometrical measures and biochemical&#xD;
                markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Hydration status according to bioimpedance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Quality of life according to the EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Functional status according to Barthel index.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Oral hygiene status according to the simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the effect at 1, 3 and 6 months of this intervention on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Swallowing function according to the V-VST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rate of institutionalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compliance with the treatments (thickeners, ONS, diets and oral health).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Palatability and acceptability of diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the relationship between severity of dysphagia (V-VST / FOIS), nutritional&#xD;
           status, oral hygiene and the incidence of respiratory infections (LRTI, pneumonia and/or&#xD;
           COPD exacerbations).&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Study subjects: 500 older patients with OD admitted to Hospital de Mataró for acute&#xD;
           conditions (internal medicine, cardiology, pneumology, neurology, geriatric wards, etc).&#xD;
           Number of subjects necessary: 500 (G1: 250; G2: 250): Accepting an α risk of 0.05 and a&#xD;
           β risk of 0.2 in a bilateral contrast, 244 subjects in each group are required to detect&#xD;
           as statistically significant difference in the percentage of patients with LRTI at six&#xD;
           months that for the control group is expected to be 20 % and for the intervention group&#xD;
           of 10% (reduction by half).A tracking loss rate of 20% has been assumed and the required&#xD;
           number of subjects (244) in each group already includes the dropout rate. Investigators&#xD;
           will intend to recruit a total sample of 500* individuals, 250 in each intervention&#xD;
           branch.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SAFETY - Safety and tolerance parameters: Incidence, frequency, seriousness, severity&#xD;
           and relatedness of adverse events or serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
           STUDY GROUPS AND INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Study groups: there will be 2 groups of patients: G1 - study intervention, 250&#xD;
           patients; G2 - control intervention, 250 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Study interventions:there will be 2 interventions: G1) study intervention: multimodal&#xD;
           intervention based on optimal fluid viscosity adaptation (with Nutilis Clear®), optimal&#xD;
           nutritional support with a triple adaptation of food (texture, (Nutilis Clear®)) caloric&#xD;
           and protein content, organoleptic) + ONS depending on nutritional status and evaluation&#xD;
           and optimal treatment of oral hygiene (tooth brushing + antiseptic mouthwash +&#xD;
           professional dental cleaning); G2) control intervention: standard clinical practice&#xD;
           (fluid adaptation with Nutilis Powder® and simple texture adaptation (for solids&#xD;
           (Nutilis Powder®)).&#xD;
&#xD;
           STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Statistical analysis: the primary outcome will be the occurrence of the respiratory&#xD;
           infections during the follow-up period (number of events/100 patients-year) and will be&#xD;
           mainly analyzed with the Poisson regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Qualitative data will be presented as relative and absolute frequencies and analyzed by&#xD;
           the Fisher's exact test or the Chi-square test. Volume and viscosity levels (V-VST) will&#xD;
           be compared between them by applying the McNemar's test. Continuous data will be&#xD;
           presented as mean±standard deviation (SD) and compared with the T-test (intergroup&#xD;
           comparisons) or Paired T-test (intragroup comparisons). For those variables that will&#xD;
           not follow a normal distribution, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test (intergroup&#xD;
           comparisons), the Wilcoxon-paired test (intragroup comparisons) or the Kruskal-Wallis'&#xD;
           test for multiple comparisons with Dunn's multiple comparison test will be used.&#xD;
           Survival curves will be used to evaluate 6-month mortality after discharge. The primary&#xD;
           analysis will be performed on the ITT population. Note: primary analysis is on number of&#xD;
           events at 6 months follow-up, to simplify sample size considerations are based on&#xD;
           percentage of patients with LRTI at 6 months.&#xD;

    <description>Respiratory infections incidence (includes LRTI, pneumonia and exacerbations of COPD): all new episodes of respiratory infections recorded in the clinical history or in the reports presented by the patient will be recorded. LRTI: presence of at least 2 of the following symptoms without other cause to explain them: fever, cough, purulent expectoration, rhonchi or wheezing. Pneumonia: performing 1 or more radiographic tests with new condensation, fever or leukopenia or leukocytosis and at least: cough, purulent expectoration, dyspnea, tachypnea, suggestive auscultation or worsening of gas exchange. COPD exacerbation: acute exacerbation of COPD is a sudden worsening of COPD symptoms (shortness of breath, quantity and color of phlegm) that typically lasts for several days. It may be triggered by an infection with bacteria or viruses or by environmental pollutants.</description>
