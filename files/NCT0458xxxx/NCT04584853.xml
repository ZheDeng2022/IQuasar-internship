      POETIC-A is a phase 3 trial which targets post-menopausal primary breast cancer patients with&#xD;
      a high 5-year risk of relapse as determined by a high Ki67 after 2 weeks aromatase inhibitor&#xD;
      therapy pre-surgery. Eligible patients will be randomised to standard adjuvant endocrine&#xD;
      therapy alone or standard adjuvant endocrine therapy with a CDK4/6 inhibitor called&#xD;
      abemaciclib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer, taking a hormone therapy (also known as&#xD;
      endocrine therapy) for at least five years after surgery is very effective at reducing the&#xD;
      risk of the cancer returning. However, for some women their cancer may eventually become&#xD;
      resistant to these drugs. POETIC-A Registration part will identify those who have a higher&#xD;
      risk of developing resistance to standard endocrine therapy (ET). 5000 - 6000 women diagnosed&#xD;
      with early stage breast cancer and have not yet had surgery to remove the cancer will enter&#xD;
      the Registration stage from 80 centres. Study doctors will use aromatase inhibitors (AIs), a&#xD;
      type of ET, to treat the cancer for 2 weeks before surgery. A sample will be taken from the&#xD;
      cancer during surgery and the study laboratory will measure a biological marker called Ki67.&#xD;
      If the level of Ki67 does not drop after 2 weeks of AI treatment, the patient is likely to be&#xD;
      less sensitive to endocrine therapy, and the study doctor will explore additional treatments&#xD;
      after surgery in the POETIC-A Treatment part. Everyone who agrees to join the Treatment stage&#xD;
      (2500 patients) will be randomly put into one of the 2 treatment groups; Group1: ET only; or&#xD;
      Group2: ET plus a new drug called abemaciclib. The first aim of the Treatment stage is to&#xD;
      confirm whether abemaciclib given in combination with ET is more effective than giving ET&#xD;
      alone in preventing the cancer coming back. The study laboratory will perform a second test&#xD;
      on the cancer sample, called an AIR-CIS test. This test aims to find out if particular groups&#xD;
      of patients based on their tumour biology are more suitable for treatment with abemaciclib.&#xD;
      Patients in Group 2 will receive ET plus abemaciclib for 2 years. Patients in both groups&#xD;
      will have regular study visits during this period.&#xD;
