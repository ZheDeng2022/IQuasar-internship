    <textblock>
      The study will use previously established doses of panitumumab or cetuximab in the metastatic&#xD;
      setting for the treatment of unresectable colorectal cancer (CRC). It is designed to&#xD;
      investigate an alternative treatment strategy to maximize the benefit to inhibition of&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) for a highly selected patient population. It will&#xD;
      enroll 110 participants with left-sided, unresectable metastatic CRC. Participants will be on&#xD;
      study up to 5 years.&#xD;
