        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Newly diagnosed, histologically confirmed GBM WHO Grade IV (any wildtype or mutant or&#xD;
             gene type, except gliosarcoma), non-resectable or partially resected or resected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 20 - 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 60.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Expected life expectancy ≥16 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Stable or decreasing corticosteroids (5 mg/day dexamethasone or equivalent) within 5&#xD;
             days before the first dose of ADI-PEG 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. No prior systemic therapy, immunotherapy, investigational agent, or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Recovered from any prior surgery and no major surgery within 2 weeks of initiating&#xD;
             treatment (other than GBM surgery). Surgery for placement of vascular access devices&#xD;
             is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects and male subjects must be asked to use appropriate contraception for&#xD;
             both the male and female for the duration of the study. Male partners of female&#xD;
             subjects and female partners of male subjects must agree to use two forms of&#xD;
             contraception or agree to refrain from intercourse for the duration of the study if&#xD;
             they are of childbearing potential. Females of childbearing potential must not be&#xD;
             pregnant at the start of the study, and a serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)&#xD;
             pregnancy test must be negative before entry into the study. If positive HCG pregnancy&#xD;
             test, further evaluation to rule out pregnancy must be performed according to GCP&#xD;

             post-menopausal (defined as cessation of regular menstrual period for at least 12&#xD;
             months).&#xD;

             malignancy, with the exception of: a) curatively resected non-melanoma skin cancer; b)&#xD;
             curatively treated cervical carcinoma in situ; or c) other primary solid tumor with no&#xD;
             known active disease present or in the opinion of the investigator will not affect&#xD;
             patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who had been treated with ADI-PEG 20 previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
