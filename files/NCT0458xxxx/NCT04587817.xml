      This trial will explore effectiveness and safety using the combination therapy of&#xD;
      camrelizumab and hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients with massive tumor including&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer, soft tissue sarcoma or urothelial carcinoma. Hypofractionation&#xD;
      which represented by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a technique that delivers&#xD;
      higher daily doses of radiation over a shorter period of time. This trial will also observe&#xD;
      the index which can influencing the curative effect of hyperfractionated radiotherapy&#xD;
      combined with immunotherapy.&#xD;

      This trial is a prospective, observational, single-center, single-arm clinical research. This&#xD;
      trial will explore effectiveness and safety using the combination therapy of camrelizumab and&#xD;
      hyperfractionated radiotherapy in patients with massive tumor including non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, soft tissue sarcoma or urothelial carcinoma. All enrolled patients will receive the&#xD;
      following treatments: camrelizumab 200mg every 2 weeks until disease progression (as&#xD;
      determined by RECIST 1.1), intolerance, or patient/physician decision to stop treatment. One&#xD;
      week following completion of the first immunotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy(SABR)&#xD;
      with tumor center dose of 24-32Gy/8Gy/3-4f and surrounding important organs at risk ≤3.0Gy&#xD;
      will be performed. And the routine radiotherapy will be started with reaching a radical cure&#xD;
      dose for the tumor margin. Generally, the radiotherapy will end before the fourth&#xD;
      immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During treatment participants will be assessed for curative effects and the occurrence of&#xD;
      adverse events. Following treatment, participants will be assessed at a clinic visit every 3&#xD;
      months to collect survival information and follow-up treatment information. The planned&#xD;
      sample size is 60 study participants.&#xD;
