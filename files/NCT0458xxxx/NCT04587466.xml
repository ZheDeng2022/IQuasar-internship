  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nursing homes are a recent occurrence in Guadeloupe, and little is known about the&#xD;
      characteristics of their residents. In Guadeloupe, in the French West Indies, nearly 1200&#xD;
      dependent older people are cared for in nursing homes. The aim of the KArukera Study of Aging&#xD;
      in Nursing Homes (KASEHPAD) is to study the care pathways of dependent elderly people in&#xD;
      nursing homes in Guadeloupe over a year. The main objective will be to obtain the annual rate&#xD;
      of hospitalisation in this setting. The secondary objectives will be to assess&#xD;
      hospitalisations costs, the incidence of mortality, the prevalence of geriatric syndromes, as&#xD;
      well as the quality of life of residents and professional caregiver burnout. Ultimately,&#xD;
      these results will be compared to a similar study in nursing homes, the KASAF study (for&#xD;
      Karukera Study of Aging in Foster Families).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      hile not fully integrated in the Caribbean culture, nursing homes may well become a&#xD;
      necessity, and their number is growing. For example, there are now 6 nursing homes in&#xD;
      Jamaica, and since the first one in 1991, 20 more have opened in Guadeloupe. Being admitted&#xD;
      in a nursing home may be beneficial for the residents as well as for their families since it&#xD;
      offers around-the-clock medical care and a secure living environment. On the other hand,&#xD;
      living in a nursing home also tend to alter the medical and psychological state of the&#xD;
      resident. Little is known about the characteristics of nursing home residents in Guadeloupe.&#xD;
      Epidemiological and medico-economic data on older people in nursing homes are essential to&#xD;
      assess the relevance of this type of care, and several and yet unanswered questions come to&#xD;
      mind: what is the residents' annual hospitalization rate and the associated costs? What is&#xD;
      the prevalence of geriatric syndromes in this population, and the incidence of mortality?&#xD;
      What is the incidence of pneumonia, the leading cause of death and emergency hospitalization&#xD;
      in older people? What is the quality of life of the older residents and their professional&#xD;
      caregivers? KASEHPAD, an epidemiological cohort, aims to answer these questions. This&#xD;
      longitudinal study will assess the health status and medical and economic data of 500 nursing&#xD;
      home residents and their professional caregivers over a year. A similar study (KASAF, for&#xD;
      Karukera Study of Aging in Foster Families) will be conducted simultaneously among 250 older&#xD;
      people in foster families, as to compare these two types of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the number of hospitalizations over a year. Local PMSI (Medicalization&#xD;
      program of the information system) hospitals databases will provide information on hospital&#xD;
      admissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      500 people aged 60 and older and living in nursing homes in Guadeloupe will be included. Data&#xD;
      collection will be conducted using face-to-face interviews with the participants and their&#xD;
      professional caregivers at baseline and after 6 and 12 months, and phone interviews with the&#xD;
      professional caregivers, after 3 and 9 months. Anthropometric measures, information on&#xD;
      general health status and care pathways (hospitalization, medical and paramedical&#xD;
      consultations), as well as data on medical history, cognition, nutritional status, and&#xD;
      physical frailty will also be collected. Depressive and anxiety symptoms will also be&#xD;
      assessed along with functional abilities (mobility, instrumental activities of daily living&#xD;
      and activities of daily living). A systematic update of vital status (death) and care pathway&#xD;
      will be carried out at each follow-up. Additional information on the residents' living status&#xD;
      and potential hospitalizations will be collected after 3 and 9 months. Finally, professional&#xD;
      caregivers will be interviewed at inclusion, after 6 months and after a year to assess their&#xD;
      own quality of life and burnout symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was supported by a grant from the Agence Régionale de Santé de la Guadeloupe.&#xD;

Each movement is scored 0-4 points out of a total score from 0 to 12, with higher scores showing better physical performance. If total score is under 8, there is a risk of sarcopenia. For the analyses, the variable will be dichotomized accordingly (1 = sarcopenia; 0 = no sarcopenia). The participant will complete this test at inclusion.</description>

    <time_frame>inclusion</time_frame>
    <description>Health-related quality of life of the participant will be assessed with the EQ-5D questionnaire. This questionnaire assesses health conditions. It is the most widely used questionnaire in medico-economic analyses. It allows health outcomes to be assessed in terms of QALYs (Quality-Adjusted Life-Years). This indicator summarizes the length and quality of life in a single figure. The result of a cost-utility analysis is expressed in terms of the cost of gaining one QALY (i.e. one year lived in perfect health). To estimate QALY, health-related quality of life is designed on a continuum from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health). Each health status is thus assigned a weight of 0 to 1, the higher the corresponding quality of life.&#xD;
