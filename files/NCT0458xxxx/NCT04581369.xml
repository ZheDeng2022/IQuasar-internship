  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To address the health care system's lack of care coordination, the Institute of Medicine and&#xD;
      Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recommend the development of collaborative care&#xD;
      models (CCM) in a wide range of clinical settings. CCMs are intended to provide coordinated,&#xD;
      personalized care pragmatically using care coordinators. CCMs have successfully improved care&#xD;
      in multiple patient populations, ranging from frail older adults to depression. In contrast,&#xD;
      for patients with cirrhosis, there is a paucity of data to support the benefit of CCM in this&#xD;
      medically complex and vulnerable population. At Indiana University, researchers have over 20&#xD;
      years of experience in developing, testing, and implementing CCMs successfully for patients&#xD;
      living with dementia or depression. Building on these successes, we have customized the CCM&#xD;
      to best meet the unique and complex biopsychosocial needs of patients with cirrhosis: the&#xD;
      Cirrhosis Medical Home.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the Cirrhosis Medical Home, a care coordinator, supported by an interdisciplinary clinical&#xD;
      team, will deliver a personalized intervention guided by a set of innovative tools: (i)&#xD;
      patient-centered care protocols, (ii) a mobile office, (iii) care coordination support&#xD;
      software, and (iv) dynamic feedback measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal is to improve quality of life of patients discharged from the hospital with&#xD;
      cirrhosis and to reduce acute health care utilization for patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, up to 40 caregivers will be enrolled in the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Initial Evaluation: Prior to discharge, the care coordinator will review the hospital discharge plan, obtain the approval of the patient's physicians to co-manage the patient's care, and schedule a visit with the patient at their place of discharge.&#xD;
Participants in this arm will receive direct interaction with a care coordinator to develop an individualized care plan. Frequent assessments, at least once every two weeks, will occur to continue to follow or to modify the care plan based on the needs of the patient.&#xD;
At the end of 6 months, all patients will be transitioned to receive full care by their primary care and specialty physicians and their participation in this study will be ended.</description>

    <description>Prior to hospital discharge, the care coordinator will identify the primary care and/or hepatology provider of patients in the usual care group and will ensure follow up appointments at the time of hospital discharge. The coordinator will compose and send a letter to the primary care and/or hepatology provider summarizing the patient's diagnosis, hospital course, discharge medications, and the plan of follow-up care. If the patient does not already have a primary care or hepatology provider, the coordinator will work with the patient to identify a new provider. Subjects in this group will receive no further intervention.</description>

    <description>The First Visit: The care coordinator will conduct a visit within 72 hours of hospital discharge to assess the patient's physical, cognitive, and psychological status, and will complete a needs assessment for both the patient and family caregiver. These measures will be used to guide the use of care protocols and development of the individualized care plan. The care plan will be developed with an emphasis on coordinating services with the patient's providers.&#xD;
The Second Visit: During the second visit, the coordinator will review the individualized care plan with both the patient and the family caregiver and will make revisions to the plan based on assessment outcomes.&#xD;
The 6-month Interaction Period: Approximately every 2 weeks, the coordinator will meet with the participant to revisit the care plan and to facilitate care.&#xD;
At the end of 6 months, all patients will be transitioned to receive full care by their primary care and specialty physicians.</description>
