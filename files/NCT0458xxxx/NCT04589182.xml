  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy as well as safety and tolerability of auditory SWS enhancement on measured outcomes&#xD;
      in Parkinson disease (PD) patients with disturbed nighttime sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will assess the feasibility and efficacy of auditory&#xD;
      slow-wave sleep (SWS) enhancement in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Huntington Disease&#xD;
      (HD) patients in a pilot study.&#xD;

      The study is a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled cross-over trial to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy as well as safety and tolerability of auditory SWS enhancement on measured outcomes&#xD;
      in PD patients with disturbed nighttime sleep. Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: Group&#xD;
      1 will first be treated with auditory stimulation for 3 nights and then - after a wash-out&#xD;
      period of 4 nights - switched to 3 nights of sham stimulation. Group 2 will first receive&#xD;
      sham-stimulation for 3 nights and then switch to 3 nights of auditory stimulation treatment.&#xD;
      The wash-out period in between will be 4 nights. Patients and investigators assessing the&#xD;
      outcomes will be blinded to the conditions. All interventions will take place at the&#xD;
      patients' homes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study is aimed at assessment of safety, tolerability, feasibility and efficacy of&#xD;
      auditory SWS enhancement on measured outcomes in MCI and HD patients with disturbed nighttime&#xD;
      sleep. Patients will be treated with verum or sham auditory stimulation for 2 consecutive&#xD;
      nights. All interventions will take place at the patients' homes.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive all-night auditory stimulation during sleep over 3 nights using a portable, safe, in-home device (MSHL-SleepBand). This device records biosignals (EEG) and precisely plays tones (between 45-65 dB, maximum 80 dB) targetted to the up-phase of sleep slow waves.</description>

    <intervention_name>MHSL- SleepBand</intervention_name>
    <description>The MHSL-SleepBand (sleep headband) is easy to apply and only involves attachment of sticky electrodes on different locations on the face/behind ear to be able to measure EEG (electroencephalogram), EOG (electrooculogram) and EMG (electromyogram). Brief tones at a low volume (around 60 dB, comparable to conversation) will be applied, when slow waves are present in the course of the sleep period and other criteria are fulfilled. Auditory stimulation will start with a specific volume that has been adjusted to the individual hearing capacity (usually between 45-65 dB; maximum 80 dB). The stimulation is performed in a way that the general structure of sleep (e.g. duration, sleep cycling, etc.) is unchanged.</description>
