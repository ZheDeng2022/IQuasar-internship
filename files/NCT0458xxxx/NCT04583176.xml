  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Objective measurement of physical activity has several advantages compared to declarative&#xD;
      measures: exemption from memory bias and desirability bias, more precise evaluation, taken&#xD;
      into account activities of low intensity, measurement of physical activity and sedentariness&#xD;
      profiles (number and duration of periods of activity, number of breaks in sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the early postoperative mobility of patients who have&#xD;
      undergone pulmonary excision by thoracoscopy or robot surgery using ActiGraph GT3X&#xD;
      accelerometer. This assessment will serve as a reference element for further studies.&#xD;
