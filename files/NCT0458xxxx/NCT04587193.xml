  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of using of a portable&#xD;
      exoskeleton for walking training in persons with Parkinson's disease that have gait mobility&#xD;
      problems and/or postural instability.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to examine a novel application of state-of-the-art robotic-assist&#xD;
      gait training to improve mobility in people with Parkinson's disease (PD). The study will&#xD;
      investigate the utility of the Keeogo速 exoskeleton (a robotic-assist gait training device)&#xD;
      for people with PD. The Keeogo速 offers advantages of being lightweight and portable (for&#xD;
      eventual home use) and is relatively quick to attach and remove. The aims here are to&#xD;
      establish the safety of the Keeogo速 for gait training in persons with PD and to preliminarily&#xD;
      assess the potential efficacy of the Keeogo速 for better balance control, gait mobility and&#xD;
      fall reduction in persons with PD.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, post treatment (5 weeks), 4-5 week follow up (up to 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Walking capacity will be assessed using the 6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) that assesses distance walked to determine aerobic capacity and endurance. Participants will be asked to walk as far as possible in 6 minutes and the total distance will be recorded.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post treatment (5 weeks), 4-5 week follow up (up to 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>FOG will be assessed using the 6MWT. FOG will be assess using 2 gait related questions on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Scores are summed and range from 0 (normal) to 4 (very poor).</description>

    <measure>Change in balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, post treatment (5 weeks), 4-5 week follow up (up to 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Berg Balance Scale (BBS) assesses balance via asking the participant to perform 14 functional activities. Ability to perform the functions is rated on a 5 point scale from 0 (unable) to 4 (able safety or with minimal aid). Scores range from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating better balance.</description>

    <description>The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) Part IIIMDS-UPDRS, part III will be used to assess motor symptoms and fluctuations of Parkinson Disease (PD) This outcome measure will be used to report a change in PD motor symptoms from baseline. Scores range from 0 to 56 with higher scores indicating more symptoms.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, post treatment (5 weeks), 4-5 week follow up (up to 14 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ39) is a 39 item self-report questionnaire assessing how often patients experience difficulties across the 8 quality of life dimensions of functioning and well-being. Items are scored from 0 (never) to 4 (always) and can be summed in the PDQ39 Summary Index with lower scores indicating better QOL.</description>

    <description>Participant's caregivers QOL will be assessed using the Parkinson's Disease Carer Questionnaire (PD-Carer), a 29 item measure of health related quality of life for use with carers of people with Parkinson's disease. Scores range from 0 (no problem at all) to 100 (worst level of problem).</description>
