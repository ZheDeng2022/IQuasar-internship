  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) project is a clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      and cost-effectiveness random controlled trial (RCT) of DynamiCare Health's innovative&#xD;
      smartphone/smart debit card remote digital coaching program, which integrates Contingency&#xD;
      Management, Recovery Coaching, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), to address alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) in 300 adult Vermont Medicaid recipients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This application proposes to continue clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness testing&#xD;
      of the DynamiCare Health platform. This is an innovative smartphone-based digital coaching&#xD;
      program that offers remotely-delivered contingency management (CM), Recovery Coaching, and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) content to address alcohol use disorder (AUD). CM, which&#xD;
      uses financial incentives to reward abstinence and treatment attendance, is one of the most&#xD;
      effective, evidence-based, and overlooked intervention for substance use disorders (SUD).&#xD;
      DynamiCare, through its remote delivery system, has addressed the logistical barriers to&#xD;
      adoption, and now seeks, through this proposal, to drive payer adoption. Our Phase 1&#xD;
      preliminary data shows that the intervention is acceptable and can be highly effective when&#xD;
      delivered as a supplemental therapy to persons with AUD enrolled in treatment. Phase 2&#xD;
      proposes to partner with Vermont (VT) Medicaid to deploy and test the fully developed&#xD;
      intervention in an RCT among individuals with AUD (n=300). Our goals are to: 1) Deploy the&#xD;
      DynamiCare CM and digital coaching program at scale among VT Medicaid members with AUD; 2)&#xD;
      determine clinical effectiveness; and 3) evaluate the cost-effectiveness and&#xD;
      return-on-investment from the payer perspective. This study design addresses a lack in the CM&#xD;
      literature of empirical evidence on the cost-savings for payers from CM. If CM can be shown&#xD;
      to create cost-savings for payers, the final barrier to widespread adoption would fall.&#xD;
      Overall, this Phase 2 project, which follows a highly successful Phase 1, will provide&#xD;
      critical data to advance the utility of this innovative digital platform as it is deployed in&#xD;
      the real world to help the millions of people with AUD.&#xD;
