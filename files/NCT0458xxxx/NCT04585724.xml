    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects of stereotactic radiosurgery with abemaciclib,&#xD;
      ribociclib, or palbociclib in treating patients with hormone receptor positive breast cancer&#xD;
      that has spread to the brain (brain metasteses). Stereotactic radiosurgery is a specialized&#xD;
      radiation therapy that delivers a single, high dose of radiation directly to the tumor and&#xD;
      may cause less damage to normal tissue. Abemaciclib, ribociclib, and palbociclib may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      abemaciclib, ribociclib, or palbociclib concurrently with stereotactic radiosurgery may&#xD;
      reduce the side effects and/or increase the response to each of the therapies.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Prospectively evaluate safety and toxicity of the combination of radiosurgery (SRS) and&#xD;
      concurrent CDK 4/6 inhibitors (CDKi) for hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate late toxicity (after 3 months) following SRS and concurrent CDKi. II. Evaluate&#xD;
      local control efficacy with combination therapy of SRS and concurrent CDKi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess quality of life and neurologic functional outcomes following treatment using&#xD;
      standardized questionnaire (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain [FACT-Br]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Analyze overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive&#xD;
      abemaciclib orally (PO) twice daily (BID). Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive&#xD;
      ribociclib PO once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III: Beginning within 2 weeks prior to stereotactic radiosurgery, patients receive&#xD;
      palbociclib PO QD on days 1-21. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 4-6 weeks post&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.&#xD;

The rate of radiation necrosis will be compared with that of our institutional historical control.</description>
