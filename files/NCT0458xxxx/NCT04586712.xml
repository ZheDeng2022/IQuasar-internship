    <textblock>
      The study aims to determine the efficacy of a controlled short-term trial of CBD ingestion&#xD;
      for reducing symptomatic response and facilitating recovery following induced muscle injury.&#xD;
      A double-blind, randomized, three-arm study design will be used and participants will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to either a high dose (n=15), low dose (n=15), or vehicle control group&#xD;
      (n=15). The clinical outcomes include measures of muscular pain and disability along with&#xD;
      measures of pain-related fear and anxiety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current research has shown evidence that phytocannabinoids may have a promising therapeutic&#xD;
      potential in a variety of physical and psychological ailments, and cannabidiol (CBD) is of&#xD;
      particular interest due to its positive safety profile, non-intoxicating effects and&#xD;
      widespread capabilities in a number of musculoskeletal diseases. Three primary reasons people&#xD;
      consume CBD on a global basis, in addition to the fact that it is non-intoxicating, are for&#xD;
      symptomatic (pain) relief, anxiety reduction, and improved sleep quality. Very little is&#xD;
      known about CBD and how it functions in the body from both an efficacy and mechanistic&#xD;
      perspective, especially in humans. There is a large consumer base for this product that will&#xD;
      be expanding exponentially in the next few years. Most of the evidence available is anecdotal&#xD;
      from the personal testimony of consumers. We aim to determine the efficacy of a controlled&#xD;
      short-term trial of CBD ingestion for reducing symptomatic response and facilitating recovery&#xD;
      following induced muscle injury. In addition, we aim to identify if the effects are&#xD;
      dose-dependent by utilizing a low-dose (25 mg/day), high-dose (62.5 mg/day) and&#xD;
      vehicle-control (0 mg/day) ingestion regimen. We will assess, in serial fashion, symptomatic&#xD;
      response, functional limitations and recovery of the quadriceps muscle following induced&#xD;
      injury in which selected doses of CBD oil will be administered orally during a 15-day&#xD;
      pre-injury consumption and post-injury recovery phase. A double-blind, randomized, three-arm&#xD;
      study design will be used and participants will be randomly assigned to either a high dose&#xD;
      (n=15), low dose (n=15), or vehicle control group (n=15). Our clinical outcomes include&#xD;
      measures of muscular pain and disability along with measures of pain-related fear and&#xD;
      anxiety. Our laboratory-based study design is desirable and advantageous because it is a&#xD;
      controlled method of tracking individuals using an experimental model of injury that is&#xD;
      translatable to clinical populations. Another advantage of this study design is that it will&#xD;
      address, in parallel fashion, two of the primary reasons people are consuming CBD -&#xD;
      symptomatic relief and anxiety reduction. This exploratory study will provide preliminary&#xD;
      data needed to support the hypotheses of a planned larger scale application.&#xD;
