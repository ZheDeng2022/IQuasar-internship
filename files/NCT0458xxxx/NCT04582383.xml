  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne is common illness of adolescents and young adults which is associated with substantial&#xD;
      morbidity. While topical treatments are often sufficient for mild acne, moderate to severe&#xD;
      acne often requires treatment with systemic medications such as oral antibiotics, hormonal&#xD;
      therapies such spironolactone, and isotretinoin. Sebum overproduction is fundamental to the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of acne with associated disordered keratinization and subsequent microbial&#xD;
      colonization and inflammation resulting in the clinical manifestations of acne. Given the&#xD;
      influence of hormones on sebum production, therapies that address these underlying hormonal&#xD;
      factors such as spironolactone and oral contraceptive pills represent an underutilized&#xD;
      treatment option for women with acne and could help decrease the use of long-term oral&#xD;
      antibiotics in this patient population. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness of spironolactone versus doxycycline hyclate (tetracycline class&#xD;
      antibiotic) for women with acne.&#xD;
