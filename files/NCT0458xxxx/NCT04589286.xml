  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT) is the standard of care for fit multiple myeloma&#xD;
      (MM) patients; however, the first 100 days after SCT are marked by extensive life&#xD;
      disruptions. We have found a 56% relative increase in the use of high-risk benzodiazepine and&#xD;
      Z-class (B/Z) drugs for anxiety and insomnia among MM patients during this period. Digital&#xD;
      life coaching (DLC), whereby trained coaches work longitudinally with patients through phone&#xD;
      calls and text messages to accomplish personal goals, may be able to target anxiety and&#xD;
      insomnia in a more integrative manner. This study will investigate whether peri-SCT DLC can&#xD;
      lower B/Z usage and improve patient-reported well-being.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, Phase II randomized study of MM patients comparing 16 weeks of DLC&#xD;
      access versus quasi-usual care (quasi-usual because both arms will receive generic&#xD;
      wellness-related electronic handouts alongside requests for patient-reported outcome (PRO)&#xD;
      assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate DLC's impact on B/Z drug usage (excluding lorazepam prescribed for&#xD;
      chemotherapy-induced nausea/vomiting, or CINV)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate DLC's impact on patient-reported general quality of life every 1-2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate DLC's impact on patient-reported psychosocial distress every 1-2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate DLC's impact on patient-reported insomnia every 1-2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore DLC's impact on rates of communications between patients and their treatment&#xD;
           teams&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore DLC's impact on clinical outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may continue study treatment (DLC platform access) for 16 weeks from the time of&#xD;
      initiating treatment. Participants will not be contacted by the DLC platform vendor after&#xD;
      this point. Patients will be followed up at Day +101 after SCT, corresponding to&#xD;
      approximately 3 months after SCT.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Proportions of patients with &gt;=1 B/Z prescription versus &lt;1 B/Z prescriptions will be compared between arms using chi-square analyses. Participants will be stratified on B/Z usage over time into 3 groups arms based on B/Z-na√Øve status (i.e., no B/Z usage at time of study enrollment), baseline psychosocial distress, defined as an National Comprehensive Caner Network (NCCN) Distress Thermometer (DT) score of 4 or higher, and baseline insomnia, defined as a Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance short form (SF) 4 item (4a) standardized score of 57 or higher.</description>

    <description>Estimations or differences in changes over time by study group will be performed via a post-estimation test using one-sided t-tests at each assessment. To control the family wise error rate at alpha level of 0.05, the Bonferroni method will be used.</description>

    <description>This 10-item inventory is part of the PROMIS series to assess quality of life (QOL) with item scores ranging from 1 to 5. Raw PROMIS scores will be transformed to T-score metrics to reflect a population mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. Among cancer patients, a T-score change of 5 points on any PROMIS inventory is generally considered to be clinically meaningful</description>

    <description>This single-item inventory uses an analog graphic to allow patients to assess their overall distress with a score range of 0 (no distress) to 10 (extreme distress). A score of 4 or higher to differentiate clinically significant distress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in PROMIS 4-item Sleep Disturbance Short Form (SF-4a) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance SF-4a inventory will be used to assess quality of sleep, with item scores ranging from 1 to 5. Raw PROMIS scores will subsequently be transformed to T-score metrics to reflect a population mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10. As validated in a previous study of cancer patients, a PROMIS Sleep Disturbance score of 57 or higher will be defined as insomnia.</description>
