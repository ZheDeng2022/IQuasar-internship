    <textblock>
      This study was planned to investigate the relationship between the risk of injury and posture&#xD;
      in wrestlers. The study will be included male wrestlers. The spine posture and flexibility of&#xD;
      the athletes will be measured during standing position with the Idiag M360® brand Spinal&#xD;
      Mouse (SM), while the overall body posture will be measured from the anterior and lateral&#xD;
      sides using the New York Posture Analysis Method (NYPAM). Injury risks of the athletes will&#xD;
      be evaluated by Functional Movement Screen (FMS) which was consisting of seven basic movement&#xD;
      patterns.&#xD;
