             non-childbearing potential, a female must be post-menopausal for at least 1 year, or&#xD;
             surgically sterile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation at the time of the study enrollment (or in the 4 weeks preceding the&#xD;
             trial vaccination) or planned participation during the present trial period in another&#xD;
             clinical trial investigating a vaccine, drug, medical device or medical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of any vaccine in the 4 weeks preceding the trial vaccination or planned&#xD;
             receipt of any vaccine from enrollment through the last blood sampling Visit, except&#xD;
             for influenza vaccination, which may be received at least 2 weeks before study&#xD;
             vaccine. This exception includes monovalent pandemic influenza vaccines and&#xD;
             multivalent influenza vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous vaccination against S. pneumoniae with either a pneumococcal conjugated&#xD;
             vaccine (PCV) or a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV).&#xD;

          -  Receipt of immune globulins, blood or blood-derived products in the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, or receipt of&#xD;

             within the preceding 6 months; or long-term systemic corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
             (prednisone or equivalent for more than 2 consecutive weeks within the past 3 months).&#xD;

             threatening reaction to the vaccines used in the trial or to a vaccine containing any&#xD;
             of the same substances .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Verbal report of thrombocytopenia contraindicating IM vaccination in the&#xD;
             Investigator's opinion.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Current alcohol abuse or drug addiction.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it might&#xD;
             interfere with trial conduct or completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that in the opinion of the Investigator could interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation of the vaccine (eg, under investigation or monitoring for possible&#xD;
             coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19]).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Moderate or severe acute illness/infection (according to investigator judgment) on the&#xD;
             day of vaccination or febrile illness (temperature ≥ 100.4 F). A prospective&#xD;
             participant should not be included in the study until the condition has resolved or&#xD;
             until 3 days after the febrile event has subsided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receipt of oral or injectable antibiotic therapy within 72 hours prior to the first&#xD;
             blood draw.&#xD;
