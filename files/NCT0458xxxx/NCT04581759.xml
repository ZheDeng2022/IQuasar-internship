  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular treatment（ET）is an effective therapy for acute ischemic stroke(AIS) with great&#xD;
      vessel obstruction. However, acute complications such as high postoperative perfusion injury,&#xD;
      hemorrhagic transformation and restenosis resulted in functional independence in only about&#xD;
      50% of patients 90 days after interventional surgery. Therefore, it is very important to&#xD;
      protect the neurologic function after emergency endovascular treatment. The investigators'&#xD;
      previous studies have shown that combined with intravenous thrombolytic therapy and remote&#xD;
      postconditioning（RIPC）can significantly improve the neurological impairment and short-term&#xD;
      and long-term prognosis in patients with acute stroke. In this multicenter, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, the investigators assumed patients with acute ischemic stroke who had&#xD;
      successfully revascularization after ET might benefit from RIPC as well. Patients in the RIPC&#xD;
      group had five cycles of 5-min cuff inflation followed by 3-min deflation to the bilateral&#xD;
      upper arm after ET. The primary endpoint measure was the proportion of patients with a&#xD;
      favorable recovery of nerve function deficient assessed by Modified Rankin Scale （mRS≤2） 90&#xD;
      days after surgery. Secondary endpoints included the following: (1) Symptom endpoints:&#xD;
      Neurological intelligence and function scores, postoperative hemorrhagic transformation rate,&#xD;
      etc. (2) Blood index test: postoperative inflammatory factors, neuron-specific enolase (NSE)&#xD;
      and other indicators. (3) Imaging endpoints: MRI-FLAIR , TCD, etc.&#xD;
