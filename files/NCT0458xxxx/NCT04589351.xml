  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we seek to explore the importance of fat accumulation in the kidneys in&#xD;
      relation to diabetic kidney disease (DKD). To do this, we conduct an intervention trial in&#xD;
      individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and DKD where we investigate whether the inhibition of&#xD;
      intestinal cholesterol absorption with ezetimibe affects albuminuria (a strong risk factor&#xD;
      for diabetic complications) and kidney fat accumulation. At the same time and to confirm that&#xD;
      kidney fat accumulation is, in fact, abnormal in T2D and DKD, we conduct a cross-sectional&#xD;
      study in which we compare kidney fat accumulation in participants at baseline from the&#xD;
      intervention trial with a group of individuals with T2D and no DKD and a group of healthy&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare cross-sectionally the fractions of kidney lipid between controls, individuals&#xD;

           and non-severe diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess by intervention trial whether ezetimibe reduces albuminuria and kidney&#xD;
           parenchymal triglyceride fraction in individuals with type 2 diabetes and non-severe&#xD;
           diabetic kidney disease.&#xD;

Trial participants (n=60), by virtue of their baseline examinations (e.g. MR-examinations), also participate in the cross-sectional part of this study where they constitute one of three groups. The other two groups contain controls (n=30) and individuals with T2D and no diabetic kidney disease (n=30).</intervention_model_description>
