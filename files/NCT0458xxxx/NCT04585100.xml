          -  Males must be surgically sterile (&gt;30 days since vasectomy with no viable sperm),&#xD;
             abstinent, or if engaged in sexual relations with a WOCBP, the participant and his&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. OAG currently untreated; where previous treatment has been inefficacious and/or&#xD;
                  intolerable, and therefore discontinued at least 4 weeks prior to the baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Elevated IOP (≥24 and ≤30 mmHg at 08:00 hours, and ≥21 and ≤30 mmHg at 10:00 and 16:00&#xD;
             hours) on baseline visit in at least one eye off treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anterior chamber is open and non-occludable (both eyes) as confirmed by Investigator&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Clinically relevant abnormal medical history, abnormal findings on physical&#xD;
             examination, vital signs, ECG, or laboratory tests at screening that the Investigator&#xD;

             patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant, nursing, or planning a pregnancy. The absence of&#xD;
             pregnancy will be confirmed for all female patients by a serum pregnancy test&#xD;

             type of medical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of poor study drug compliance, protocol non-compliance, or&#xD;
             prohibited medication intake.&#xD;
&#xD;

             or other disease that the Investigator feels might increase the risk to the safety of&#xD;
             the patient or confound the results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery (e.g., stomach bypass) or medical condition that might significantly affect&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Central corneal thickness of less than 500 µm or greater than 620 µm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BCVA worse than 20/200 in either eye.&#xD;

             abnormality).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Advanced glaucoma (e.g., cup/disc ratio &gt;0.80), evidence of significant visual field&#xD;

             progressive visual field loss within the last year.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other forms of glaucoma (e.g angle closure glaucoma, normal tension glaucoma,&#xD;
             congenital glaucoma, etc), other than OAG or OHT.&#xD;

             the eye and/or eyelids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of retinal detachment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, or any retinal&#xD;
             disease that may be progressive during the time course of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any ocular disease or condition that in the opinion of the study Investigator may put&#xD;
             the patient at significant risk, may confound study results, or may interfere&#xD;
             significantly with the patient's participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Donation or loss of more than 450 mL blood during the 3 months before the start of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
