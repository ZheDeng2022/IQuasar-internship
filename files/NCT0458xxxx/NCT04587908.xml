      The main purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of TAS-205 in patients with Duchenne&#xD;
      muscular dystrophy (DMD) compared with placebo as measured by the mean change from baseline&#xD;
      to 52 weeks in the time to rise from the floor． Following completion of the treatment period,&#xD;
      patients may elect to continue in open-label extension study.&#xD;
