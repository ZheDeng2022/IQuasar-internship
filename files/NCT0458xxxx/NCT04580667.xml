  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is conducted to develop a new test to identify prostate cancer patients&#xD;
      at highest risk of radiotherapy-related complications, especially related to&#xD;
      gastrolintestinal (GI) toxicities. This clinical study would allow monitoring of total tissue&#xD;
      damage in blood samples as early as after the 2nd but before the 4th radiotherapy dose during&#xD;
      week 1 of radiotherapy, which could help clinicians make treatment decisions. Detection of&#xD;
      excessive tissue damage at this early time, well before symptoms occur, could allow doctors&#xD;
      to tailor interventions which could include patient therapies that would reduce or prevent&#xD;
      the problems that occur due to radiotherapy of their cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently, a patient's risk for toxicity is based almost exclusively on population&#xD;
      statistics. Radiation (and chemotherapy) doses are based on phase I data and not on the&#xD;
      individual's specific genetics or hidden predispositions. RadTox measures cell damage as&#xD;
      early as after the 2nd but before the 4th radiotherapy dose during week 1 of radiotherapy and&#xD;
      should help identify patients at high risk for radiation complications. This should allow&#xD;
      physicians to adjust radiation field size and dose to minimize long-term toxicity, especially&#xD;
      gastrointestinal toxicities.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will determine if measurement of circulating DNA from normal tissues shortly after the start of radiotherapy provides an early indication of patients at high risk of radiation-related toxicity. Blood specimens for RadTox test will be collected: (a) prior to radiotherapy (T0); (b) after the 2nd but before the 4th radiotherapy dose during week 1 (T1); (c) on Week 2 during radiotherapy (T2); and (d) 3 months after completion of radiotherapy (T3).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate who have not received previous&#xD;
             treatment (defined as prostatectomy, transurethral resection of the prostate [TURP],&#xD;
             radiation of the pelvis, and GreenLight Laser Therapy) except for short-term (≤6&#xD;
             months) Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) according to National Comprehensive Cancer&#xD;
             Network (NCCN) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidate for definitive prostate radiotherapy (either IMRT or proton).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients to be treated with IMRT should have all radiation treatment planned with&#xD;
             IMRT, whereas patients to be treated with protons should have all radiation treatment&#xD;
             planned with protons (including pelvic nodes if treated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Localized prostate cancer, as confirmed by staging with Prostate-Specific Antigen&#xD;
