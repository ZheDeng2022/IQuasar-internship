  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2012, the General Medical Council (GMC) funded PRACtICe (PRevalence And Causes of&#xD;
      prescrIbing errors in general practiCe) study, reported that 1 in 20 prescriptions in general&#xD;
      practice were found to have a prescribing or monitoring error. The PRACtICe study also&#xD;
      proposed some strategies to consider to improve prescribing safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further to the PRACtICe study, in line with recommendation from the Medical Research Council&#xD;
      (MRC) for developing complex interventions, we conducted a series of focus groups with health&#xD;
      care professionals and members of the public to identify possible ways to improve the&#xD;
      prescribing education provided for general practitioner (GP) trainees - a group that was&#xD;
      identified as likely to benefit from additional education and training in prescribing safety.&#xD;
      These focus group discussions identified a pharmacist-led review of the prescribing done by&#xD;
      GP trainees, together with feedback, as a promising potential intervention. This&#xD;
      intervention, named REVISiT, was piloted with ten trainees and their trainers in the East&#xD;
      Midlands. The error rate for the trainees was recorded as 9%. Interviews with the trainees&#xD;
      and trainers undertaken following the intervention highlighted that REVISiT was positively&#xD;
      received. Some GPs gave examples of how their prescribing practice had changed following the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this pilot study, we conducted another study involving interviews, focus groups and a&#xD;
      stakeholder event with key stakeholders (practice, policy, legal and members of the public)&#xD;
      to explore the next steps for REVISiT. Whilst some participants proposed that REVISiT be&#xD;
      immediately implemented with minor modifications, others pointed to the need to establish the&#xD;
      impact of the intervention more broadly (including its impact in areas other than education&#xD;
      and training). Additionally, they highlighted the importance of establishing its&#xD;
      effectiveness in order to support making a substantial case for future allocation of&#xD;
      resources. Conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT) would help establish the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the REVISIT intervention and its impact on areas of professional practice&#xD;
      that may impact prescribing safety. However, before we can do this, there are components of&#xD;
      the REVISiT intervention and RCT process that we need to further explore, test and refine in&#xD;
      order for it to be employed on a wider basis. This pilot study of the REVISiT intervention is&#xD;
      being undertaken to do this further exploration, testing and refining.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prescribing medication is integral to the role of a general practitioner (GP). Figures from&#xD;
      2017 show that an estimated 1,105.8 million prescription items were dispensed in England&#xD;
      alone. However, in practice, sometimes prescribing errors occur and these have the potential&#xD;
      to cause significant morbidity and mortality. The General Medical Council (GMC) funded&#xD;
      PRACtICe study which set out to determine the prevalence and nature of prescribing and&#xD;
      monitoring errors in general practices in England identified prescribing errors in around one&#xD;
      in twenty prescriptions. The study also put forward explanations as to why some of the errors&#xD;
      may have occurred and offered recommendations for strategies and areas of focus that could&#xD;
      potentially be explored to improve prescribing. One of these areas highlighted for&#xD;
      consideration was providing further support for prescribing, specifically for GPs in&#xD;
      training. The study found that, as a group, GPs in training did not necessarily receive&#xD;
      training in prescribing that was comprehensive and structured. GPs in training also reported&#xD;
      feeling unprepared for managing patients with complex and long term health needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further to the PRACtICe study, in line with recommendation from the Medical Research Council&#xD;
      (MRC) for developing complex interventions4, a series of focus groups5 were convened with&#xD;
      health care professionals and members of the public to explore in more details which ideas&#xD;
      proposed as part of the PRACtICe study should be considered for further development. The&#xD;
      results further highlighted the desire for GPs in training to receive further educational&#xD;
      input in the area of prescribing practice and safety. Furthermore, an educational&#xD;
      intervention considered that could potentially meet this training need, was an&#xD;
      individualised, pharmacist-led retrospective review of GPs in training prescribing practice&#xD;
      (REVISiT intervention).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following on from the focus group study, a small pilot study was conducted in the East&#xD;
      Midlands to explore the feasibility of using the REVISiT intervention in general practice.6&#xD;
      The REVISiT intervention itself started with a primary care pharmacist undertaking a&#xD;
      retrospective review of approximately 100 consecutive prescription items prescribed by ten&#xD;
      GPs in training (in total 1028 prescriptions were reviewed). This was then followed by each&#xD;
      GP in training, and their trainer receiving individualised feedback in a form of a report.&#xD;
      The report presented the GP with areas where errors were identified and examples of 'good&#xD;
      prescribing'. The impact of the intervention on prescribing and the experience of&#xD;
      participating in the pilot study was assessed qualitatively. For this, GPs in training and&#xD;
      their trainers participated in two interviews, one was conducted within a month of receiving&#xD;
      feedback and the second one within 3-months of receiving feedback. Results from this pilot&#xD;
      study reported an error rate of 9%, which was higher than the 5% error rate recorded in the&#xD;
      GMC PRACtICe study. Furthermore, the pharmacist review identified a high rate of 'suboptimal'&#xD;
      prescribing (35% of prescriptions) which identified further areas where GPs in training could&#xD;
      improve on their prescribing. The qualitative narratives revealed that the REVISiT&#xD;
      intervention was positively received by GPs and was deemed a unique training opportunity to&#xD;
      receive individualised feedback on prescribing skills and knowledge that had potential to&#xD;
      improve their prescribing and subsequently patient safety. GPs in training gave examples of&#xD;
      where their prescribing had changed as a result of the REVISiT intervention and some&#xD;
      communicated their intention to change, or implement a prescribing behaviour when the next&#xD;
      opportunity arose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the pilot study, we conducted a qualitative study involving interviews, focus groups&#xD;
      and a stakeholder event with key stakeholders (practice, policy, legal and members of the&#xD;
      public) to explore whether the REVISiT intervention, in its current or modified form, should&#xD;
      be considered for wide spread adoption into GP training and general practice or whether an&#xD;
      evaluation study to establish the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the intervention&#xD;
      was first warranted. Some participants expressed their disbelief that an intervention such as&#xD;
      REVISiT was not already in routine use in general practice. They mainly felt that with some&#xD;
      modifications the intervention would be fit to recommend for use. On the contrary, some&#xD;
      suggested that more robust evidence, generated from conducting a definitive randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial, would be needed before directing already limited resources towards an&#xD;
      intervention in its early stages of development and use such as REVISiT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, before we are able to conduct a definitive randomised controlled trial of the&#xD;
      REVISiT intervention to assess its effectiveness in improving prescribing of GPs in training&#xD;
      (increase in the proportion of prescriptions prescribed correctly / reduction of observed&#xD;
      prescribing errors) and the cost-effectiveness, there are components of the intervention&#xD;
      itself and the trial process that need to be further explored, tested and refined. This step&#xD;
      is important because there is evidence in the literature pointing to the 'failure' of some&#xD;
      interventions arising due to poor intervention and study design and description.4&#xD;
