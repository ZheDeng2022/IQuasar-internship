  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well androgen deprivation therapy and apalutamide with or&#xD;
      without radiation therapy works for the treatment of prostate cancer that has a rise in the&#xD;
      blood level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and has come back after treatment with surgery&#xD;
      or radiation (biochemically recurrent). Androgens can cause the growth of prostate tumor&#xD;
      cells. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgens by the&#xD;
      tumor cells. Androgen deprivation therapy drugs, leuprolide or degarelix, work to lower the&#xD;
      amount of androgen in the body, also preventing the tumor cells from growing. Radiation&#xD;
      therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Giving radiation&#xD;
      therapy with apalutamide and androgen deprivation therapy may help to control prostate cancer&#xD;
      that has come back in only a few (up to 5) spots in the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess PSA progression-free survival in both treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess time of recovery of serum testosterone in both treatment arms. II. To assess PSA&#xD;
      progression-free survival and overall survival following testosterone recovery in both&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess safety of androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) + apalutamide as well as ADT +&#xD;
      apalutamide in combination radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the time to first new metastasis or local / pelvic recurrence in both treatment&#xD;
      arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To assess the impact of both treatment arms on quality of life. VI. To assess the impact&#xD;
      of both treatment arms on metabolic syndrome parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To assess the impact of both treatment arms on bone density. VIII. To investigate the&#xD;
      association of changes in repeat advanced imaging with outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To compare fluciclovine and prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify potential markers of response or resistance to the administered therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I: Patients receive apalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and ADT&#xD;
      consisting of leuprolide intramuscularly (IM) every 12 weeks or degarelix subcutaneously (SC)&#xD;
      every 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II: Patients receive apalutamide PO QD on days 1-28 and ADT consisting of leuprolide IM&#xD;
      every 12 weeks or degarelix SC every 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 cycles&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo&#xD;
      radiation therapy (RT) between cycles 4-7 in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 and 4 months.&#xD;
