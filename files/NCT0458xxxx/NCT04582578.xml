    <textblock>
      This trial will compare two management strategies for HF patients with preserved LV function&#xD;
      in sinus rhythm and LBBB. The control group will be treated with practice guideline optimal&#xD;
      medical therapy for HF. The experimental group will be treated with CRT in addition to&#xD;
      optimal medical therapy for HF. In addition, the trial will further compare two methods of&#xD;
      delivering CRT. One experimental group will receive BiV-CRT, while the second experimental&#xD;
      group will receive CS-CRT.&#xD;
