  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase I SBIR will develop and demonstrate the usability/feasibility of the Opioid Rapid&#xD;
      Response System (OSSR) in order to reduce deaths and strain on emergency response systems&#xD;
      from opioid overdoses. Opioid overdoses exact a tremendous cost in lives and expenditures due&#xD;
      to incredible strain on emergency response systems. Naloxone has been developed to counteract&#xD;
      overdoses. However, the nature of these events requires a rapid response, a situation that&#xD;
      challenges emergency responders in both lightly populated rural areas as well as densely&#xD;
      populated urban communities. PulsePoint has developed an app with the potential to obviate&#xD;
      both concerns by linking responders to events through the 911 system. PulsePoint is already&#xD;
      in place in 4,000 communities throughout the U.S. However, the app cannot accomplish these&#xD;
      goals without being used by a large number of citizen responders who are both able to&#xD;
      administer life-saving Naloxone and confident in their ability to do so. This project is&#xD;
      designed to develop innovative and effective techniques for filling this gap. We build off of&#xD;
      the Clark County Pilot Project conducted by members of our team that developed preliminary&#xD;
      recruitment and training protocols for enabling citizen responders to utilize the PulsePoint&#xD;
      App. Using communication theory, a technology-based recruitment protocol will be built around&#xD;
      appeals to individuals (personal identity appeals) and others (communal appeals). Recruitment&#xD;
      messages will be disseminated through diverse media channels, including social media,&#xD;
      posters, radio announcement, and work-of-mouth. Social Cognitive Theory will be used to&#xD;
      develop both online and face-to-face training to enable users to use the PulsePoint App,&#xD;
      safely respond to calls, and administer Naloxone. An unblinded, two-arm, parallel group&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial with non-random cluster sampling will be conducted in two Indiana&#xD;
      counties to establish the usability and feasibility of ORRS and its recruitment and training&#xD;
      components. We anticipate recruiting and training 400 citizen responders. Pretest and&#xD;
      posttest surveys will evaluate the training and as well as recruitment exposure through the&#xD;
      various channels. County-level data on the number of events to which participant responded as&#xD;
      well as lives saved also will be used to evaluate the intervention. A quasi-experimental&#xD;
      design will compare the two recruitment strategies and the two training modalities. Project&#xD;
      findings will be used to design and more extensive, two statewide evaluation studies (Indiana&#xD;
      and Washington) that examine outcomes in numbers of lives saves as well as conducted a cost&#xD;
      effectiveness analyses. The project has great promise for rapid and wide dissemination&#xD;
      through the PulsePoint network of communities and has the potential to develop a model for&#xD;
      community responses to similar public health events (e.g., coronavirus, stroke, heart&#xD;
      failure).&#xD;

    <description>Scales will measure response efficacy (i.e., administering Naloxone is effective) and self efficacy (i.e., they can administer Naloxone) using agree-disagree scales. Each subscale will consist of at least 3 items and be modified from existing efficacy scales used in drug prevention research.</description>
