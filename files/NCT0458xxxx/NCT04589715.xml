  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of electroacupuncture among&#xD;
      women with pelvic organ prolapse(Level II - III), compared with sham electroacupuncture.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the study and potential risk, all patients giving written informed&#xD;
      consent form will be undergo a 1-week screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups 1)&#xD;
      electroacupuncture group: electroacupuncture will be provided to patients at BL33, BL35 and&#xD;
      SP6 for 3 time per week for the first 4 weeks, then twice a week for 4 weeks, and once a week&#xD;
      for the last 4 weeks. There will be 24 times of treatment in total in 3 month; 2) sham&#xD;
      electroacupuncture group: sham electroacupuncture will be provided to patients at sham&#xD;
      acupoints to BL33, BL35 and SP6 with the same schedule as electroacupuncture group.The&#xD;
      follow-up time for the two groups are 6 months after treatment. Primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      will be measured at 3, 6, and 9 months from the start of the treatment, respectively.&#xD;

    <measure>the change from baseline on the score of the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-short form 20 (PFDI-20)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline, and 3 months when the treatment is completed.</time_frame>
    <description>Data will be collected via the the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-short form 20 (PFDI-20) . The questionnaire consists of three sections, pelvic organ prolapse distress inventory 6 (POPDI-6), colorectal-anal distress inventory 8 (CRADI-8), and urinary distress inventory 6 (UDI-6). Each section has 6-8 questions with 5 answers rated from 0-4 in each, and mean score of each section is the total score of this section divided by number of questions in this session. Then the sum of the mean scores of the three section timing 25 will come to the total score of the questionnaire(0-300). The higher the total score is, the severer the symptoms are.</description>

    <time_frame>at baseline, and 3 months when the treatment is completed.</time_frame>
    <description>Pelvic organ prolapse quantitative examination(POP-Q) is a manual approach to measure the severity of female pelvic organ prolapse with five level from 0 to 4 . The POP-Q examination will be conducted by experienced gynecologists in each participating center. The higher the level is, the severer the symptoms are.</description>

    <description>Data will be collected via the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire Short Form-7（PFIQ-7) , which uses 7 questions to evaluate the impact of bladder, colorectal and virginal symptoms on daily life, respectively. For each type of symptoms, the answer to one question has four levels, no bother(0), mild bother(1), moderate bother(2), severe bother(3). The higher the total score is, the severer the quality of life is impacted.</description>

    <description>patients will receive electroacupuncture at 3 acupoints(Bladder meridian of foot-taiyang 33 and 35#BL33 and BL35), and Spleen meridian of foot-taiyin 33(SP6)) 3 times/week for 4 weeks, then 3 times/week for 4 weeks, and then once/week for 4 weeks(24 times in total in 3 months), and be followed up for 6 months after treatment. Disposable acupuncture needles with size of 0.30 × 75 mm will be used at BL 33 and BL 35, and needles with size of 0.30 ×40 mm at SP 6. Standardized electroacupuncture apparatuses will be used, and the stimulation will last for 30 minutes with a continuous wave of 20 Hz, and a current intensity of 2 to 6.5 mA at BL33 and BL 35, and 1 to 3.5 mA at SP6.</description>
