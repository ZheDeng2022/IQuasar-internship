  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      NERv's traditional feasibility clinical trial is a multi-center, pre-market, single-arm, and&#xD;
      non-randomized trial. This study will involve the retrospective analysis of prospectively&#xD;
      collected data. The trial is intended to establish the safety of NERv's Inline Device and&#xD;
      collect preliminary data to illustrate the change in pH and electrical conductivity during&#xD;
      normal postoperative recovery and in the event of a complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of NERv's feasibility study is to establish a clinical model that shows the&#xD;
      progressive change in pH and electrical conductivity during a normal post-operative recovery&#xD;
      and in the event of an anastomotic leak in colorectal, hepatobiliary (HPB), trauma, and&#xD;
      general surgery patients. Upon analyzing data collected from NERv's Inline Device, a clinical&#xD;
      model of change in pH and conductivity over time will be created. The clinical model can be&#xD;
      used in future stages to determine if a complication is developing. For instance, boundaries&#xD;
      (reading thresholds) can be established to detect a complication when readings exceed such&#xD;
      boundaries.&#xD;
