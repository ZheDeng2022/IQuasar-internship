  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the feasibility of an individualized video game training (VITAAL&#xD;
      Exergame) for older adults with mobility impairments and/or urinary incontinence. In&#xD;
      addition, the effect of the newly developed training program on motor and cognitive functions&#xD;
      is examined. This study is a national study. The development of the exergame was carried out&#xD;
      at the Fraunhofer AICOS research center in Portugal and further studies are being conducted&#xD;
      in international collaboration with the University of Montréal in Canada, KU Leuven in&#xD;
      Belgium and ETH Zurich. The Exergame consists of a video game based training, which is&#xD;
      performed with step movements. These movements are detected by two sensors on the feet. The&#xD;
      video game should make the training fun and motivate to train. The training will include&#xD;
      specific cognitive and physical functions. Special emphasis will be put on a continuous&#xD;
      interaction and integration of motor and cognitive functions. An intact cognitive-motor&#xD;
      interaction as well as balance and strength form the basis for all everyday performances,&#xD;
      especially for safe and accident-free movement in older adults. In the Exergame VITAAL,&#xD;
      balance is trained with step-based games. Strength, especially leg strength, is trained&#xD;
      through Tai-Chi-like movements/exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pelvic floor training takes place using a vaginal probe that measures the contractions of&#xD;
      the pelvic floor. The training games on the VITAAL Exergame have been adapted for this&#xD;
      purpose and are controlled via the probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants receive an individually tailored training session that is optimally adapted&#xD;
      to their needs based on the results of the pre-measurement. Participants with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence also receive an integrated pelvic floor training. The study includes 32-52&#xD;
      seniors with mobility impairments and 8-28 older adults with urinary incontinence. Balance&#xD;
      and strength, gait pattern, cognitive functions and pelvic floor specific functions will be&#xD;
      measured before and after the training in order to detect any changes. The training should be&#xD;
      carried out during 12 weeks, with a maximum of two weeks break/holidays. There are two&#xD;
      measurement dates with all examinations, whereby one measurement date lasts approx. 1.5&#xD;
      hours. All study participants can continue their everyday life as usual.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The VITAAL exergame is an individualized multicomponent exergame training based mostly on the&#xD;
      prevention and slowing of physical and cognitive decline and its consequences. It mainly&#xD;
      consists of three (four with UI) components; strength training, balance training, cognitive&#xD;
      training and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) when suffering from UI. For strength&#xD;
      training, Tai Chi-inspired movements are included which are a combination of classical&#xD;
      strength exercises and Tai Chi movements. Since Tai Chi is mainly performed in a semi-squat&#xD;
      posture it places a large load on the muscles of the lower extremities. For balance training,&#xD;
      step-based training is included in the VITAAL exergame, as the execution of rapid and well&#xD;
      directed steps has been shown to be effective in preventing falls. Both, Tai Chi-inspired&#xD;
      exercises and step-based exercises, combined with challenging game tasks, provide a&#xD;
      'holistic' physical activity requiring motor functions, cognition and mental involvement. The&#xD;
      PFMT is divided in two categories, isolated exercises of PFM (different contraction&#xD;
      sequences) and dual task exercises, where PFM contractions are performed with or in&#xD;
      combination with balance exercises. Moreover, Tai Chi-inspired training, step-based training&#xD;
      and PFMT could be more motivating and joyful than standard exercises. Some cognitive training&#xD;
      is already included in these training components as they represent simultaneous&#xD;
      cognitive-motor interaction and require motor and cognitive functions. But specific&#xD;
      attentional and executive functions are important for walking abilities and safe gait.&#xD;
      Therefore, the VITAAL exergame explicitly targets on these neuropsychological functions&#xD;
      (selective attention, divided attention, inhibition/interference control, mental flexibility,&#xD;
      working memory). To maximize benefits for participants, the VITAAL exergame implements some&#xD;
      basic general training principles; providing feedback, optimal load of task demands,&#xD;
      progression of difficulty and high variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group MI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VITAAL exergame intervention for MI includes 36 training sessions with three sessions per&#xD;
      week, each lasting around 45 minutes (30 minutes real training time) resulting in 12 weeks of&#xD;
      training (two weeks of break/holiday allowed). The time frame and training intensity is based&#xD;
      upon studies illustrating positive training effects in older adults performing exergame&#xD;
      training. A training session includes an individually calculated amount of strength,&#xD;
      cognitive-motor and balance training, which remains the same over the 12 week intervention&#xD;
      period. Between the training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be integrated to&#xD;
      alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants are allowed to continue their usual&#xD;
      daily business and activities during the study period. The training takes place at Physio&#xD;
      SPArtos in Interlaken, Bern. They get well instructed on how to set up and use the system at&#xD;
      the physio centre. The first two training sessions will be supervised one to one, after that&#xD;
      someone will observe the training every 4 weeks to make adjustments and support the&#xD;
      participants. The other training sessions will be done without supervision. However, there&#xD;
      will be a physiotherapist available in case questions come up or help is needed. The&#xD;
      compliance with the exergame training will be monitored using an attendance protocol filled&#xD;
      in by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group UI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the incontinent women in this study, the VITAAL exergame intervention will last over 12&#xD;
      weeks and consists of three parts 1) VITAAL exergame (2 sessions/week) lasting 45 minutes&#xD;
      each (30 minutes real training time) at the physio centre, 2) PFM exercises according to a&#xD;
      training booklet (3 sessions/week) lasting 10 minutes each at home and 3) education related&#xD;
      to UI at home.. Between the training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be&#xD;
      integrated to alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants will be allowed to&#xD;
      continue their usual daily business and activities during the study period. The training will&#xD;
      take place at the physio centre SPArtos, Interlaken, Switzerland and their home. Women will&#xD;
      get instructed on how to set up and use the system at the centre and how to do the PFM&#xD;
      exercises at home. The VITAAL exergame training sessions will be supervised. Furthermore,&#xD;
      every fourth week the additional weight for the strength training will be adjusted. However;&#xD;
      the participants will be encouraged to use the system as independently as possible. The&#xD;
      compliance with the exergame training will be monitored using an attendance protocol filled&#xD;
      in by participants. For both groups, training compliance will be followed online by the&#xD;
      investigators in the Web portal as each participant will have a personal login and training&#xD;
      data will be stored in the internet-based back-end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group MI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants of the MI control group are instructed to do a non-individualized conventional&#xD;
      training including 15 minutes walking exercise (in nature or on treadmill) and additional 15&#xD;
      minutes of strength, balance, and cognitive-motor exercises (at the therapy centre or at&#xD;
      home). The exercises are based on recommendations from the &quot;Beratungsstelle für&#xD;
      Unfallverhütung&quot; (bfu). The participants will receive a training booklet with the exercises.&#xD;
      In total there are three different training programs which are divided according to their&#xD;
      level of difficulty. Participants are instructed to start with the first level for four weeks&#xD;
      and then go on to the next level for another 4 weeks. The control group training in this&#xD;
      study includes 36 training session with three sessions per week, each lasting around 45&#xD;
      minutes resulting in 12 weeks of training (two weeks of break/holiday allowed). Between the&#xD;
      training sessions and exercises, rest intervals will be integrated to alleviate the&#xD;
      acquisition of new skills. Participants are allowed to continue their usual daily business&#xD;
      and activities during the study period. The first training sessions take place at Physio&#xD;
      SPArtos in Interlaken, whereas the walking can be made outside or on a treadmill. The&#xD;
      participants get well instructed on how to do the training at the centre or at home. There&#xD;
      will always be a supervisor at the training centre to further help and support the&#xD;
      participants with any questions and issues. Furthermore, participants will be called every 4&#xD;
      weeks, to ensure social contact similar to that in the intervention group. The training&#xD;
      components will not be individually adapted for this group. Participants in this groups will&#xD;
      report their trainings in an attendance protocol and their additional activity in an activity&#xD;
      protocol. In addition they need to rate the exercise intensity on each session with Borg&#xD;
      scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group UI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group training will last over 12 weeks. The training sessions will be divided in&#xD;
      three parts 1) 30 minutes of brisk walking (2 sessions/week, 2) PFM exercises according to a&#xD;
      training booklet (3 sessions/week) lasting 10 minutes each at home and 3) education related&#xD;
      to UI at home. The PFM training booklet will be based on two studies that showed a reduction&#xD;
      of incontinence in older adults while performing group pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)&#xD;
      and mobility exercises. The PFMT program will consist of 4 PFM exercises and will be divided&#xD;
      into three phases allowing for the gradual progression in treatment (from first to third&#xD;
      month), with gradual increase in difficult exercises in terms of duration, repetition and&#xD;
      position. Each phase will last four weeks. Between the training sessions and exercises, rest&#xD;
      intervals will be integrated to alleviate the acquisition of new skills. Participants will be&#xD;
      allowed to continue their usual daily business and activities during the study period. The&#xD;
      first training sessions take place at the physio centre SPArtos, Interlaken, whereas the&#xD;
      walking can be made outside or on a treadmill. The participants get well instructed on how to&#xD;
      do the training at home. Furthermore, participants will be called every 4 weeks, to ensure&#xD;
      social contact similar to that in the intervention group. The training components will not be&#xD;
      individually adapted for this group. Participants in this group will report their trainings&#xD;
      in an attendance protocol and their additional activity in an activity protocol. The&#xD;
      compliance with the active control intervention will be monitored using an attendance&#xD;
      protocol filled in by participants. Furthermore, training compliance will be followed online&#xD;
      by the investigators in the Web portal as each participant will have a personal login and&#xD;
      training data will be stored in the internet-based back-end.&#xD;

The exercises are based on recommendations from the &quot;Beratungsstelle für Unfallverhütung&quot; (bfu). The participants will receive a training booklet with the exercises. In total there are three different training programs which are divided according to their level of difficulty. Participants are instructed to start with the first level for four weeks and then go on to the next level for another 4 weeks. The control group training in this study includes 36 training session with three sessions per week, each lasting around 45 minutes resulting in 12 weeks of training (two weeks of break/holiday allowed).</description>

    <description>The control group training will last over 12 weeks. The training sessions will be divided in three parts 1) 30 minutes of brisk walking (2 sessions/week, 2) PFM exercises according to a training booklet (3 sessions/week) lasting 10 minutes each at home and 3) education related to UI at home. The PFM training booklet will be based on two studies that showed a reduction of incontinence in older adults while performing group pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and mobility exercises. The PFMT program will consist of 4 PFM exercises and will be divided into three phases allowing for the gradual progression in treatment (from first to third month), with gradual increase in difficult exercises in terms of duration, repetition and position. Each phase will last four weeks.</description>
