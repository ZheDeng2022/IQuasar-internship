  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ten percent of infants are prescribed short-acting bronchodilators (i.e. salbutamol) for&#xD;
      wheezing every year, yet evidence to support this treatment in children younger than two&#xD;
      years old is scarce. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      salbutamol for treatment of wheezing in young children who present to their primary care&#xD;
      physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will compare the effect of a 7-day treatment with salbutamol&#xD;
      to the effect of 7-day treatment with a placebo. The main effect will be measured by&#xD;
      evaluating a parent-reported symptom score. Additionally, the investigators will look at the&#xD;
      presence of wheeze after 5 days, time to recovery, adverse events, healthcare utilisation,&#xD;
      medication prescriptions, cost-effectiveness, and parent satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BACKGROUND: Worldwide, 30% of all infants and young children experience an episode of&#xD;
      wheezing (Matricaldi et al. 2008; Mallol at al. 2010; Martinez et al. 1995). Currently, there&#xD;
      is no evidence to underpin the management of these children. National Belgian and Dutch&#xD;
      primary care professional guidelines propose 'a trial of treatment' with short acting&#xD;
      bronchodilators (i.e. salbutamol) for wheezing children below the age of six years and to&#xD;
      evaluate treatment effect after 1 to 2 weeks, but convincing evidence is lacking (Chavasse et&#xD;
      al. 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of salbutamol has been studied well in children with proven asthma and is&#xD;
      considered the first-line treatment in all patients in international asthma guidelines.&#xD;
      However, trial findings of children with asthma are not applicable to primary care infants&#xD;
      and young children with acute wheeze for several reasons; the anatomy and physiology in&#xD;
      younger children differs significantly from those in older children and many infants and&#xD;
      young children with an acute episode of wheezing do not experience further wheezing episodes&#xD;
      later in life. As a result, it is at present unclear whether salbutamol inhalation therapy&#xD;
      confers any benefit in young children who wheeze.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of salbutamol inhalations (4x200μg for 7&#xD;
      days) versus placebo in children aged 6-24 months presenting to their primary care physician&#xD;
      with wheezing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: A primary care based, randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre, parallel group&#xD;
      trial in 40 general practices and community paediatric practices in Belgium and the&#xD;
      Netherlands.&#xD;
