    <textblock>
      This phase IIA trial studies the effect of a vaccine (PDS0101) when given together with&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy (chemoradiation) in treating patients with stage IB3-IVA&#xD;
      cervical cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells&#xD;
      and shrink tumors. PDS0101 is a type of vaccine that is intended to help the immune system&#xD;
      respond to human papillomavirus (HPV16)-infected cervical tumor cells. PDS0101 contains two&#xD;
      active components: the first is called R-DOTAP (Versamune) and is included in the vaccine to&#xD;
      boost the immune system's response against the HPV viral proteins and the second group of&#xD;
      active components are selected small pieces of proteins (called peptides) taken from the HPV&#xD;
      virus. Giving PDS0101 in combination with chemoradiation may work help to control cervical&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the safety and toxicity profile of delivering the immune nanoparticle liposomal&#xD;
      HPV-16 E6/E7 multipeptide vaccine PDS0101 (PDS0101) with standard-of-care chemoradiation&#xD;
      (chemoRT) in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Rate of complete metabolic response on day 170 (+/- 14 days) positron emission tomography&#xD;
      computed tomography (PET CT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rate of &gt;= 90% gross tumor volume reduction day 35 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (+/-&#xD;
      5 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Report rates of local control (LC), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS) at 12 and 18 months following chemoRT completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Long-term safety: rate of grade &gt;= 3 chronic toxicity (from day 81 to completion of&#xD;
      trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY HPV-SPECIFIC IMMUNE RESPONSE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assays on interferon-gamma and granzyme B&#xD;
      levels in E6/7-specific T cells isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare intratumoral T-cell receptor (TCR) clonality at baseline and end of treatment by&#xD;
      TCR sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Measure CD4+ and CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from cervical brush samples&#xD;
      by using markers of T-cell exhaustion (PD1, CTLA4) and T cell-activation (granzyme B, CD69+).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the intestinal and cervical microbiome by analyzing rectal and cervical swab&#xD;
      samples with 16s ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Additional assays such as circulating tumor cells, circulating cell-free tumor&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ccfDNA), and other assays will be performed at the discretion of&#xD;
      the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy over 1 hour 5 days per week (Monday-Friday) for 5-7 weeks&#xD;
      and receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 4 hours once per week (QW) during the 5 weeks&#xD;
      of radiation therapy in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients also receive PDS0101 subcutaneously (SC) on days -10, 7, 28, 49, and 170 in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 1, 4, 6, 12, and 18&#xD;
      weeks, and 18 months.&#xD;
