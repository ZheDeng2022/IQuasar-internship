  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gender medicine considers the way in which gender, male or female, affects the development&#xD;
      and impact of diseases and the response to therapies. It can be said that it is a new&#xD;
      transversal dimension of medicine, which evaluates the gender differences in the physiology,&#xD;
      pathophysiology and clinic of many diseases and thus sets itself the goal of reaching optimal&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions both in men and women based on proven scientific evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although knowledge of gender medicine has increased significantly in recent years, a gender&#xD;
      approach has not been much developed in pediatrics. In the field of bone marrow transplants,&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is known to be the most effective consolidation&#xD;
      therapy in some high-risk hematology malignancies such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia and&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia, and represents one of the potential treatment for patients suffering&#xD;
      from solid tumors and genetic hematological, metabolic diseases and primary&#xD;
      immunodeficiencies. Huge progress has been made in high resolution donor typing, choice of&#xD;
      conditioning regimens, manipulation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and prevention of&#xD;
      serious infections in recent years, which have significantly improved the survival rate of&#xD;
      patients undergoing to this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      International literature regarding the response and outcomes from hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation in a gender perspective is completely absent, for these reasons this pilot&#xD;
      study was born from the need to understand from a broader perspective and in order to better&#xD;
      understand how the gender may or not influence the outcome of transplantation in pediatric&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective analysis of the data will concern all patients who underwent allogeneic or&#xD;
      autologous bone marrow transplant. The data will be collected from clinical records and from&#xD;
      Regional electronic databases. All data will be collected anonymously and an identification&#xD;
      code will be assigned to each case.&#xD;
