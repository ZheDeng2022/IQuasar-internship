      The purpose of the study is to examine whether non-adjunctive (without having to double check&#xD;
      using another method) use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring improves A1c in adults or children&#xD;
      with diabetes managed by intensive insulin therapy.&#xD;

             course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated acute use of oral or injectable glucocorticoids that could affect glycemic&#xD;
