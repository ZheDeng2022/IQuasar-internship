    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the side effects of NT-I7 in treating patients with squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of head and neck that has come back (recurrent) who are undergoing surgery.&#xD;
      NT-I7 is an immunotherapy drug that works by helping the immune system fight tumor cells. The&#xD;
      body produces T-cells which play an important role in body's immune response and its ability&#xD;
      to recognize tumor cells. This immunotherapy drug may boost body's T-cells to help fight&#xD;
      cancer and enhance body's response to cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate safety and feasibility of a single intramuscular injection of efineptakin alfa&#xD;
      (NT-I7) in patients with locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of head and neck (SCCHN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe changes in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in peripheral blood after a single&#xD;
      dose of NT-I7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe changes in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in tumor microenvironment of&#xD;
      surgical specimen after a single dose of NT-I7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate changes in immune subsets in peripheral blood after a single dose of NT-I7&#xD;
      and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To make assessment of exploratory biomarkers for pharmacodynamic activity of NT-I7 in&#xD;
      peripheral blood, and/or tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive one dose of efineptakin alfa intramuscularly (IM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 35 days after dose or 21&#xD;
      days after surgery.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of NT-I7 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women&#xD;

          -  Had major surgical procedure, open biopsy, or significant traumatic injury within 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to study initiation&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has active and clinically relevant bacterial, fungal, viral, or Tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
             infection, including known Hepatitis A, B, or C or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
