      Previous studies suggested that most patients with Cardiac Electronic Implantable devices&#xD;
      have a perception of describing the lifestyle due to a limitation of daily activities and&#xD;
      physical exercise, besides the consequences in the psychological aspects such as anxiety and&#xD;
      depression. The MHOL-CEID is a randomized controlled trial that Verifies the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the Mobile Health of lifestyle that focuses on aspects of physical functional, psychosocial,&#xD;
      and quality of life of patients with Cardiac Electronic Implantable Device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases represent one of the main causes of death in the Brazilian&#xD;
      population, as well as dysfunctions of the heart conduction system. In an attempt to treat&#xD;
      and correct heart conduction system dysfunctions, Cardiac Electronic Implantable Device&#xD;
      (CEID) was developed. Most people with CEID have a perception of describing the lifestyle due&#xD;
      to a limitation of daily activities and physical exercise, besides the consequences in the&#xD;
      psychological aspects such as anxiety and depression. These changes in the psychosocial&#xD;
      conduct of patients with CEID are due to the lack of knowledge and the lack of effective&#xD;
      guidance, being of fundamental importance to elaborate the resources of education in health&#xD;
      for patients with CEID. Health promotion through educational intervention is a recognized&#xD;
      strategy and an Internet approach to the mobile health proposal is a recognized and promising&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study is been conducted to verify the effectiveness of the Mobile&#xD;
      Health of lifestyle that focuses on aspects of physical functional, psychosocial, and quality&#xD;
      of life of patients with CEID. The hypothesis is that the use of Mobile Health of lifestyle&#xD;
      provides greater physical functional, psychological aspects, and quality of life to patients&#xD;
      with CIED.&#xD;
