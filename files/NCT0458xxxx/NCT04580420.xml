  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate DCR-PHXC in participants with PH1 or PH2 and severe&#xD;
      renal impairment, with or without dialysis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, repeat-dose, Phase 2 study of DCR-PHXC in participants with PH1 or PH2&#xD;
      and severe renal impairment, with or without dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the up-to-35- day screening period, participants will return to the clinic for&#xD;
      monthly dosing visits through Day 180. Participants successfully completing the Day 180 visit&#xD;
      will continue on to an extended follow-up period and receive open-label DCR-PHXC for an&#xD;
      additional 3 years, or until DCR-PHXC is commercially available, whichever comes first. As&#xD;
      participants in this extended treatment period will return to the clinic only every 3 months,&#xD;
      participants and/or their caregivers will be trained in the at-home administration of&#xD;
      DCR-PHXC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is approximately 2 years from first participant, first visit,&#xD;
      to last participant, last Day 180 visit, with up to an additional 3 years of extended&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36®) in adults</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of DCR-PHXC on Quality of Life (QoL) assessments in patients with PH.&#xD;
The SF 36 is a set of generic, coherent, and easily administered quality-of-life measures that taps 8 health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. It also includes a single item that provides an indication of perceived change in health. The 36 items are identical to the MOS SF 36 described in Ware and Sherbourne (1992). Participants respond to each item on a categorical scale. Categorical answers are transformed to a 0 to 100 range so that the lowest and highest possible scores are 0 and 100, respectively. All items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the EQ-5D-5L™ in adults</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of DCR-PHXC on Quality of Life (QoL) assessments in patients with PH.&#xD;
The EQ-5D-5L consists of the EQ 5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS).&#xD;
The descriptive system has 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The digits for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the participant's health state.&#xD;
The EQ VAS records the participant's self-rated health on a 20-cm vertical VAS, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine.' Participants are asked to place an &quot;X&quot; on the line that represents their health on that day.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) in children</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate the effect of DCR-PHXC on Quality of Life (QoL) assessments in patients with PH.&#xD;
The 23-item PedsQL is comprised of 5 items in the Emotional, Social, and School Functioning dimensions (Psychosocial Health) and 8 items in the Physical Functioning (Physical Health) dimension. Items are reverse-scored on a 0 to 4 Likert scale and linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better functioning and HRQOL. Scale Scores are the sum of the items in each dimension, divided by the number of items answered.</description>
