    <textblock>
      This is a small-scale proof-of concept clinical trial of amobarbital as a treatment to&#xD;
      prevent post-traumatic osteoarthritis in fractured ankle joints. The study is a double blind,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, stepwise trial. Amobarbital will be delivered to&#xD;
      ankle joints in solution with hyaluronic acid (HA) as a vehicle. Amobarbital/HA injections&#xD;
      (active dose) will be compared to HA alone (placebo dose). Our primary goal is to confirm&#xD;
      safety, but we will also assess whether treatment improves chondrocyte viability and&#xD;
      decreases synovial inflammation. The intervention that has proven to be effective in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo models. The study team will assess safety and begin to evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
      amobarbital/Gel-One in patients having sustained tibial pilon fractures. The study team will&#xD;
      use advanced imaging-based methods we have developed to characterize how joints subjected to&#xD;
      varying levels of fracture severity and residual elevated contact stress respond in treated&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phase I:6 subjects will be treated with a single dose open label, and safety measures will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Once initial safety is confirmed, 20 amobarbital:10 control subjects will be&#xD;
      treated with the single dose at the initial operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming continued safety, an additional 20 amobarbital:10 control subjects will be treated&#xD;
      with two doses and evaluated. The second dose of 2.5 mM amobarbital will be administered&#xD;
      during the second operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will participate in the following procedures:&#xD;

      SOC surgical intervention Randomization to Amobarbital/Gel-One arm or control arm X-rays CT&#xD;
