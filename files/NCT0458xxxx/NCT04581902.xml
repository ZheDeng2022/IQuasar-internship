  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a stratified, parallel-group, single-center study utilizing multimodal imaging&#xD;
      techniques to identify biomarkers for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). The study goal is to&#xD;
      identify biomarkers for MDD and treatment response that can be implemented in clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis and care as valid and reliable measures, through monitoring neurophysiological and&#xD;
      electrophysiological changes across the course of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First, the study will examine the replicability and prognostic utility of two previously&#xD;
      identified potential biomarkers for MDD using resting state imaging. Second, investigators&#xD;
      will conduct an exploratory, whole brain analysis combining EEG and imaging techniques to&#xD;
      identify new potential biomarkers for MDD and treatment response as participants complete a&#xD;
      course of TMS treatment. It is the hope to shed new light on the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      depression and relapse, which may allow for a more effective, personalized selection of&#xD;
      treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete initial screening and baseline evaluation, along with&#xD;
      resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)&#xD;
      and electroencephalography (EEG) scans prior to the initial TMS treatment. Participants will&#xD;
      complete 30-36 TMS sessions and a post-treatment evaluation, along with mid- and&#xD;
      post-treatment fMRI, DTI and EEG scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that participants with MDD have a specific set of neural features that can&#xD;
      classify with high precision patients with MDD from those who do not, and that align with&#xD;
      clinical diagnoses. This set of neural features will change across the course of treatment.&#xD;
      Further, investigators expect that improvement as rated by a common MDD measure is modulated&#xD;
      by time of treatment.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible participants will be assigned to the afternoon treatment group. Prior to the onset of rTMS treatment, EEG scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sessions including diffusion weighted imaging will be recorded as baseline measures. These measures will also be repeated at treatment midpoint and within one month of rTMS discontinuation in order to track structural and functional changes that occur over the course of treatment. Participants will complete an initial screening followed by 30-40 daily sessions of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), completed with their TMS provider.</description>

    <description>rTMS treatment parameters will be determined by TMS care providers. Typical TMS settings for MDD involve rTMS applied at 10 Hz with an intensity of 120 % of resting motor threshold. Forty trains of 4 s duration with 11s of trains is typically applied (3000 pulses per day), resulting in approximately 90,000 pulses in a given treatment course.</description>
