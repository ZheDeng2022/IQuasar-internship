  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will assess the effect of the alginate (in a capsules) on the weight of&#xD;
      generally healthy volunteers over a 12 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, will recruit 150 (non-smoking) generally healthy volunteers to attend the&#xD;
      study centre on four separate occasions. Volunteers will be randomly allocated into active or&#xD;
      placebo arm of the trial, both will receive capsules with the same appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers will have their height, weight, waist circumference, body composition, and&#xD;
      fasting levels of circulating glucose, triacylglycerol and cholesterol measured at each for&#xD;
      the four visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will last approximately 12 weeks depending on your availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to come to the research facility in Newcastle University, before&#xD;
      they have had any breakfast, on four separate occasions. The volunteers must not eat or drink&#xD;
      anything (except water) after 8 pm the evening before they come in. This includes not&#xD;
      drinking any alcohol, tea or coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each time the volunteers come in, their height (first assessment only), weight, waist&#xD;
      circumference and body composition will be measured. Body composition is measured using&#xD;
      scales which can determine the percentage of their body is fat or bone or muscle. This is&#xD;
      done using a small harmless electrical current passing through their body, they will not&#xD;
      detect or feel this at all. Their height will also be measured at the first visit.&#xD;
      Cholesterol, triglyceride and glucose levels in the blood will also be measured at each&#xD;
      visit. This will be done through a single finger prick blood sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enough capsules will be given to the volunteers to last you four weeks at the first three&#xD;
      visits. The capsules will be filled with either alginate or another dietary fibre believed to&#xD;
      have no effect on weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be asked to take four of these capsules with their three main meals per day&#xD;
      over the 12 week study.&#xD;
