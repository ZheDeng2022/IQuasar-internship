  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is referred to a group of conditions that involve mostly the larger&#xD;
      weight-bearing joints such as the hip, knee, and ankle. It is the result of an intricate,&#xD;
      multifaceted, progressive softening and break-down of articular cartilage along with capsular&#xD;
      fibrosis and re-growth of new cartilages and bones called osteophytes at the margin of the&#xD;
      articular surfaces to increase the surface area of them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study aimed to find out the efficacy of specified manual therapies in combination&#xD;
      with a supervised exercise protocol on managing pain intensity and functional disability in&#xD;
      patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

      Out of 70-millions older adults in the America, the majority of females have been suffering&#xD;
      from osteoarthritis (OA) that progressively lead to chronic pain, joint stiffness, reduced&#xD;
      mobility, muscle atrophy, poor balance, and ultimately, physical disability. Other&#xD;
      physiological changes such as reduction in quadriceps' muscle strength and range of motion&#xD;
      (ROM) in sagittal plane, and shortening of soft tissues around the joints collectively yield&#xD;
      the distinctive clinical features such as articular pain; worsening on weight -bearing&#xD;
      activities, resting/morning joint stiffness, progressive decline in physical activities and&#xD;
      increasing to deformities/disabilities.Researchers observed the effectiveness of a structured&#xD;
      exercise programs including an aerobic exercise program, a resistance exercise program, and a&#xD;
      health education program in improving functional outcomes (self-reported disability) and&#xD;
      decreasing the knee pain among older adults with knee OA at short-term and long term.the&#xD;
      manual therapy along with supervised exercise protocol revealed a significant reduction in&#xD;
      joint stiffness and knee pain and improvement in functional status of the patients with knee&#xD;
      OA for short-term and long-term (1-year follow-up) than the placebo therapy (sub-therapeutic&#xD;
      dose of ultrasound).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study based on a randomized, pretest-posttest experimental group design, included a total&#xD;
      of 32-participants with knee osteoarthritis randomly divided into groups A and B. Group A&#xD;
      received a supervised exercise protocol, however group B received specified manual therapies&#xD;
      in a combination of a supervised exercise protocol. Pain and functional disability measured&#xD;
      with NPRS and WOMAC index respectively. Data collected on day-1st pre-intervention&#xD;
      (baseline), day-14th posttest, and day-28th follow-up and analyzed using t-test and one-way&#xD;
      ANOVA by keeping the level of significance at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Strengthening exercises:It included a sets/group of exercises such as a static quad set in knee extension, standing terminal knee extension, seated leg-press, partial squats weight-lessened with arm support as needed, and step-ups Stretching Exercises:A slow, sustained stretching was performed in different positions for different group of muscles with holding time 30-seconds, a gap of 1-minute between two repetitions, and repeated 3-times per session on alternate day for 2-weeks. The stretching performed for the calf muscle, hamstring muscle, and quadriceps femoris muscle in standing, supine, and prone positions respectively.</description>
