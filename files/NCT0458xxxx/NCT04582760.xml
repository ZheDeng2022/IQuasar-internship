      Early mobilization in Ventilated sEpsis &amp; acute Respiratory failure Study: EVER Study&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, assessor-blinded study aiming to investigate the clinical&#xD;
      effects of early mobilization in the ICU versus only conventional intensive care for&#xD;
      improving physical function after ICU discharge, and after hospital discharge, in patients&#xD;
      undergoing mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure or sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several studies on rehabilitation treatment for patients in intensive care have&#xD;
      reported that rehabilitation treatment is safe for patients with ventilators, elderly&#xD;
      patients, and patients receiving continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) or&#xD;
      extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In the United States and Europe, evidence of the&#xD;
      stability and clinical outcomes of physical and occupational rehabilitation in the ICU have&#xD;
      already been established. In contrast, there is a lack of cost analysis and health and&#xD;
      sociological grounds for intensive care rehabilitation in Korea. Therefore, there is an&#xD;
      urgent need to evaluate the clinical effects of early rehabilitation, starting on the very&#xD;
      first day in the ICU, in patients with acute respiratory failure and sepsis, requiring&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical study plan of the current study is as follows. In ICU patients undergoing&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure or sepsis, the clinical effects of early&#xD;
      mobilization on improving physical function will be assessed using FSS-ICU at discharge from&#xD;
      the ICU and discharge from the hospital, and compared to those who did not receive early&#xD;
      mobilization.&#xD;

        following criteria within 48 hours of ICU hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who voluntarily consent to participate in this clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Those who are over the age of 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who require mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure and sepsis&#xD;
             (non-malignant tumor patients; excluding non-invasive mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
             high-flow oxygen therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a Clinical Frailty Scale score of 1-4 points (physical condition prior&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients whose mechanical ventilation treatment is expected to last for more than 48&#xD;
             hours (evaluated at the time of study enrollment). However, if the patient has already&#xD;
             begun mechanical ventilation treatment at another hospital, the time of airway&#xD;
             intubation serves as the reference point. If it is difficult to confirm the exact&#xD;
             time, the time of hospitalization is used as the reference point.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain damage, psychiatric illness, or cognitive impairment making&#xD;
             evaluation difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are contraindicated for mobilization (active bleeding, deep vein&#xD;
             thrombosis, increased brain pressure, open abdomen, iliac fracture, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who do not meet the screening criteria for mobilization (however, if the ICU&#xD;
             rehabilitation multidisciplinary team determines that mobilization can be started even&#xD;
             if the patient does not meet the screening criteria below, the patient can be included&#xD;
             in the study) A. Patients with a Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score less&#xD;
             than -2 or greater than +2 B. Patients who have at least one of PEEP ≥ 10cmH2O, FiO2 ≥&#xD;

             systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or&gt; 200 mmHg, average arterial pressure&gt; 110 mmHg or&#xD;
             &lt;65 mmHg, pulse rate&gt; 130/min or &lt;60/min or newly developed arrhythmia, or currently&#xD;
             increasing the dose of inotropic agents.&#xD;

             the investigator expects a high probability of mortality (&gt;50%))&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have already undergone mechanical ventilation treatment for more than 72&#xD;
             hours (if the patient is re-intubated within 36 hours after airway intubation, the&#xD;
             treatment time is calculated as the continued mechanical ventilation time. If the&#xD;
             total mechanical ventilation time is within 72 hours, the patient can be registered&#xD;
             for the study)&#xD;

          -  Patients who take neuromuscular blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose physical function is impaired due to brain or spinal cord diseases&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients who maintain airway intubation and mechanical ventilation only to maintain&#xD;
             airway hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-cardiac pulmonary resuscitation patients&#xD;
&#xD;
