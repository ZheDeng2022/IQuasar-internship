  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the years, there has been some progress made in reducing stunting in Afghanistan, the&#xD;
      prevalence remains high with half of the provinces experiencing rates above the WHO alert&#xD;
      threshold. As part of the Country Strategic Plan (CSP), the World Food Programme (WFP) plans&#xD;
      to implement a stunting prevention programme in collaboration with Ministry of Public Health&#xD;
      (MoPH) through its Public Nutrition Department (PND) in selected locations with stunting&#xD;
      rates above 45%. The programme will emphasis on appropriate nutrition support in the '1000&#xD;
      days' window of opportunity with special focus on proven effective nutrition interventions&#xD;
      such appropriate breast feeding, complementary feeding, micronutrient supplementation,&#xD;
      malnutrition treatment and prevention, WASH.&#xD;

      Over the years, there has been some progress made in reducing stunting in Afghanistan, the&#xD;
      prevalence remains high with half of the provinces experiencing rates above the WHO alert&#xD;
      threshold. As part of the Country Strategic Plan (CSP), the World Food Programme (WFP) plans&#xD;
      to implement a stunting prevention programme in collaboration with Ministry of Public Health&#xD;
      (MoPH) through its Public Nutrition Department (PND) in selected locations with stunting&#xD;
      rates above 45%. The programme will emphasis on appropriate nutrition support in the '1000&#xD;
      days' window of opportunity with special focus on proven effective nutrition interventions&#xD;
      such appropriate breast feeding, complementary feeding, micronutrient supplementation,&#xD;
      malnutrition treatment and prevention, WASH. This will therefore take the form of an&#xD;
      integrated approach ensuring the targeted beneficiaries are supported to access nutrition&#xD;
      assistance as well as other complimentary interventions provided in-kind by study partners or&#xD;
      promoted through social and behaviour change communication (SBCC). WFP will target pregnant&#xD;
      and lactating women (PLW) and children aged 6-23 months but will also engage men and players&#xD;
      that influence maternal infant and young child nutrition practices. Through this programme,&#xD;
      children aged 6-23 months will receive lipid-based nutrient supplement - medium quantity&#xD;
      (LNS-MQ) to complement their diets while PLW will receive Super Cereal - wheat soya blend&#xD;
      with sugar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An operational research study was embedded in the stunting prevention programme by credible&#xD;
      third-party to determine the extent to which the new actions will influence nutrition&#xD;
      outcomes and practices. Introducing the provision of SNF, SBCC as well as formulation and&#xD;
      adoption of local culturally acceptable recipes for complementary feeding from locally&#xD;
      available nutritious food would be new additions to the current Community Based Nutrition&#xD;
      Program (CBNP) package in the implementation phase. During the project implementation,&#xD;
      emphasis will be placed will be placed on the adoption of the locally formulated&#xD;
      complementary foods as well as application of knowledge and practices promoted through the&#xD;
      SBCC activities as part of the exit strategy and ensuring a lasting impact of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the Centre of Excellence in Women and Child Health, Aga Khan University, Pakistan&#xD;
      proposes an operational research study with mix-methods including formative research,&#xD;
      quasi-experimental design to evaluate the stunting prevention programme and process&#xD;
      evaluations for stronger evidence base on the effectiveness of proposed interventions on&#xD;
      prevention of stunting and developing viable programmes on nutrition under &quot;real&quot; operational&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
