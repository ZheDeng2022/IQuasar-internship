  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The elimination of pathogenic microorganisms from the root canal system is one of the main&#xD;
      factors in order to have success in endodontic treatment. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      perform a randomized controlled clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of endodontic&#xD;
      treatment in primary teeth when using Guedes-Pinto paste, with and without instrumentation of&#xD;
      the root canals, and associated or not with antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. Forty-five&#xD;
      necrotic primary teeth of children aged between 3 and 6 years will be selected. The teeth&#xD;
      will be divided into three groups. In Group I, the conventional endodontic treatment&#xD;
      (instrumentation) and filling with Guedes-Pinto paste will be performed. In Group II, the&#xD;
      root canals will not be instrumented, only irrigated and filled with Guedes-Pinto paste. In&#xD;
      Group III, the root canals will not be instrumented, only irrigated, photodynamic therapy&#xD;
      will be performed and the filling will also be made with Guedes-Pinto paste. In all groups,&#xD;
      microbiological evaluations will be made before and immediately after endodontic treatment,&#xD;
      and clinical and radiographic evaluations will be conducted in the day, 1 month, 3 months and&#xD;
      6 months after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>All samples will be collected with three paper cones, which will be inserted into the root canal before and immediately after treatment and placed into brain heart infusion broth for culturing to allow the determination of the total number of viable bacteria. The samples will be homogenized for 3 minutes in a vortex agitator, followed by dilution in 4.5 ml of peptone water of the order of 10-6. Three 25-μl aliquots of the decimal solution will be sewn into Petri dishes with blood agar. The cultures will be incubated for 5 days at 37 °C in an 85 % nitrogen (N2), 10 % carbon dioxide (CO2) and 5 % hydrogen (H2) atmosphere obtained though the use of an anerobiosis generation system to allow the visualization of the total number of viable bacteria in CFU.</description>

    <description>The Therapy XT-EC (DMC ABC Medical and Dental Equipment, São Carlos, SP, Brazil) will be used for PDT, with laser emission in the red band (660 nm) and the narrow tip for the specific use of PDT in areas of difficult access. One session of PDT with the Chimiolux® methylene blue photosensitizer (Hypofarma, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil) at a concentration of 0.005 % will be performed in the interior of the root canal. The photosensitizer will be applied with a sterile paper cone for 3 minutes and the excess will be removed with an endodontic aspirator. The canal will be irradiated for 40 seconds, with the device previously calibrated to emit a wavelength at 660 nm, with radiant energy of 4 J and mean maximum power of 100 mW. The direct contact method will be employed.</description>
