  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections are common in infants. Obtaining urine from pre-continent children&#xD;
      can be difficult and time consuming. The method of collection must balance reliability,&#xD;
      speed, low rate of contamination, and invasiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, midstream clean-catch urine is an acceptable&#xD;
      method to diagnose urinary tract infections. However, it is impractical in pre-continent&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two quick, safe and effective methods have been reported in the literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Quick-wee method: it consists in stimulating the suprapubic area with a cold and wet&#xD;
           compress to obtain urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bladder stimulation method : the child is held under the armpits with legs dangling&#xD;
           and a physician taps the suprapubic area and massages lumbar area alternatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, advanced age, high weight, and level of discomfort during bladder stimulation were&#xD;
      significantly associated with failure to obtain urines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in infants. The diagnosis of a UTI has important&#xD;
      implications for follow-up, and delayed treatment can result in morbidity, including renal&#xD;
      scarring and serious bacterial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtaining urine from pre-continent children can be difficult and time consuming, the method&#xD;
      of collection must balance reliability, speed, low rate of contamination, and invasiveness&#xD;
      The actual guidelines recommend suprapubic aspiration or bladder catheterization for&#xD;
      collection of urine sample in pre-continent children, but these methods are invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common way to collect urines in infants is the use of a sterile collection bag. This&#xD;
      is an easy technique, but time consuming and responsible for high rate of contamination,&#xD;
      leading to false positives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, midstream clean-catch urine is an acceptable&#xD;
      method to diagnose urinary tract infection. However, it is impractical in pre-continent&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, two quick, safe and effective methods have been reported in the literature:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Quick-wee method: it consists in stimulating the suprapubic area with a cold and wet&#xD;
           compress to obtain urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The bladder stimulation method: the child is held under the armpits with legs dangling&#xD;
           and a physician taps the suprapubic area and massages lumbar area alternatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, advanced age, high weight, and level of discomfort during bladder stimulation were&#xD;
      significantly associated with failure to obtain urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Futhermore, even if urine collection in pre-continent children most often concerns urinary&#xD;
      tract infections, these techniques could also be used to look for a metabolic abnormality, an&#xD;
      uropathy or a nephropathy (urine electrolyte concentrations, proteinuria, hematuria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare the effectiveness of two non-invasive midstream urine&#xD;
      collection methods in pre-continent children : &quot;the Quick-Wee method&quot; and &quot;the Bladder&#xD;
      stimulation method&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also compare in the two groups the time required to obtain urine&#xD;
      sample, the comfort of the infant during urine collection and the quality of urines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, for each technique will be analyzed the risk factors associated with failure in&#xD;
      obtaining urine sample&#xD;

    <description>The bladder stimulation technique requires the presence of 2 people:&#xD;
The child must be held by an adult (caregiver or parent) under the armpits, legs dangling.&#xD;
the first person (the investigator), performs the stimulation technique consisting of: rapid tapping (frequency of about 100 / min), over the pubic area, at the level of the bladder, alternated with external rotational movements of the pits lumbar, in the kidneys. Alternate these 2 maneuvers every 30 seconds.&#xD;
The second person starts the stopwatch at the start of the stimulation, and is about to collect the urine, 2nd jet in a sterile pot&#xD;
The maneuver ends as soon as urine is obtained, and will be stopped after 5 minutes in case of failure.</description>
