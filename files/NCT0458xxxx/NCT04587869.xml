  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a randomized controlled trial of a multi-session cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) group intervention that addresses coping with discrimination and medical&#xD;
      mistrust among Black sexual minority men (SMM). Primary intervention objectives include&#xD;
      increasing health care engagement and receipt of evidence-based preventive care, as well as&#xD;
      better coping and reduced anticipated and internalized stigma, and medical mistrust among&#xD;
      intervention participants.&#xD;

      This study is a randomized controlled trial of Still Climbin', an 8-session cognitive&#xD;
      behavior therapy (CBT) group intervention that addresses coping with discrimination and&#xD;
      medical mistrust among Black sexual minority men (SMM). Designed to be flexible for use in&#xD;
      community settings, this intervention was developed in partnership with community&#xD;
      stakeholders who emphasized the need for a community-based program outside of the health care&#xD;
      system, and without a specific disease focus. It intends to give Black SMM a safe space to&#xD;
      receive support for the whole of their identity and to openly discuss barriers to health&#xD;
      care. Participants will be followed for 12 months. The effectiveness of the Still Climbin'&#xD;
      intervention will be assessed on health care engagement and receipt of evidence-based&#xD;
      preventive care, through surveys administered at multiple points throughout the intervention&#xD;
      period. These outcomes will be confirmed with information from medical records. A total of&#xD;
      300 Black participants will be recruited and randomly assign 150 to receive the coping&#xD;
      intervention and 150 to a no-treatment control. There will be about 10 groups of about 15&#xD;
      participants each for both intervention and control. Participants will be randomized to an&#xD;
      intervention or control group after they complete the baseline survey. Participants will&#xD;
      complete four surveys, starting with the baseline survey, and followed by 4-, 8-, and&#xD;
      12-month post-baseline follow-up surveys to assess health care engagement and receipt of&#xD;
      evidence-based preventive care (e.g., cancer and diabetes screening, cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      prevention, influenza vaccination, HIV prevention), and other topics such as coping&#xD;
      strategies, stigma, and discrimination. The intervention is hypothesized to show increased&#xD;
      health care engagement and receipt of evidence-based preventive care, in addition to better&#xD;
      coping and reduced medical mistrust than the control group.&#xD;
