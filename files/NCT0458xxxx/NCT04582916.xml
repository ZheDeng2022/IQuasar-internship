      Purpose: To determine whether COX-1 and COX-2 are detectable in the brains of individuals&#xD;
      with MDD experiencing a major depressive episode (MDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A - Calculation of COX-2 density from [11C]MC1 PET scans, using baseline scans and&#xD;
      scans after blockade with celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B - Calculation of the density of COX-1 using [11C]PS13 in healthy volunteers and&#xD;
      depressed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the relationship between peripheral markers of inflammation and COX binding&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the relationship between clinical rating scales and COX binding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Group A Sixteen (16) medication-free participants with MDD; Group B Three&#xD;
      groups of 16 subjects each will be studied: 1) Medicated MDD, 2) Unmedicated MDD and 3)&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. Participants may be male or female. They must be between 18 and 70 years&#xD;
      old. Individuals may be recruited from anywhere but, for those participating in the&#xD;
      outpatient study, most are expected to come from the Washington DC metropolitan area. MDD&#xD;
      participants must be in good medical health and provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data acquisition of [11C]MC1 and [11C]PS13:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dynamic 3D PET brain scan on PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One venous line for radioligand injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arterial line for blood sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Transmission (CT) scan will be performed to measure and correct for attenuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Injection of 20 mCi of [11C]MC1 or [11C]PS13.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Emission scans on PET/CT or PET scanner. Emission scan for about 90 min (possibly up to&#xD;
           2h). Frame information: 6 frames 30 sec each, 3 frames 1 min each, 2 frames 2 min each,&#xD;
           and remaining frames of 5 min each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate) and ECG (either 3 or 12 lead)&#xD;
           will be recorded within three hours of tracer injection, in the middle, and after the&#xD;
           PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. We will take the two [11C]MC1 scans preferably in same day. They should be separated by&#xD;
           at least 2.5 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood analysis in [11C]MC1 and [11C]PS13:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement of whole blood, plasma activity, and metabolite levels in all phases:&#xD;
           MIB/NIMH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of whole blood activity by PET Department is not required in any phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of celecoxib: In these scans, specific binding of [11C]MC1 to COX-2 in the&#xD;
      brain will be verified by a pre-blocking study using celecoxib (600 mg PO). Participants will&#xD;
      be encouraged to have a light meal prior to PET studies with blockade by celecoxib. After&#xD;
      oral administration, the plasma concentration peaks at about two hours (Paulson et al. 2001).&#xD;
      Thus, we will administer celecoxib about two hours before the second PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring by MIB/NIMH:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-scan labs within 24 hours prior to injection: Urine pregnancy test (woman of child&#xD;
           bearing potential), CBC, acute care panel (Na, K, Cl, CO2, creatinine, glucose, urea&#xD;
           nitrogen), hepatic panel (alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, bilirubin total, and bilirubin&#xD;
           direct), glucose, mineral panel (albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. C-reactive protein (CRP) will be measured in the pre-PET blood sample to assess overall&#xD;
           inflammatory status in periphery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Data for safety monitoring will be recorded at three timepoints: no more than three&#xD;
           hours before injection, about the middle of the PET scan, and after the PET scan.&#xD;
           Recorded data included: blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and EKG (either 3- or&#xD;
           12-lead).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-scan labs: CBC, acute care panel (Na, K, Cl, CO2, creatinine, glucose, urea&#xD;
           nitrogen), hepatic panel (alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, bilirubin total, and bilirubin&#xD;
           direct), glucose, mineral panel (albumin, calcium, magnesium, phosphorus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pregnancy Tests: For women of childbearing potential, urine pregnancy testing will be&#xD;
           done within the 24 hours prior to any MRI or PET scan. If the pregnancy test is&#xD;
           positive, PET and MRI will not be done, and the subject will be taken off the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Follow-up Procedures: Subjects will be contacted one to three business days after each&#xD;
           PET scan to determine whether they have had any untoward sequelae.&#xD;

             B may continue their therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants should not have taken NSAIDs for two weeks prior to the PET scan.&#xD;
             Aspirin, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate) must not have been&#xD;

             nicotine dependence) within the preceding three months. In addition, participants must&#xD;
             not have substance use disorder or alcohol use disorder. However, alcohol or cannabis&#xD;
             use by themselves are not exclusion criteria, unless that use impairs function.&#xD;

             electrical devices, brain stimulators, dental implants, aneurysm clips (metal clips on&#xD;
             the wall of a large artery), metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart&#xD;
             valves, and cochlear implants), permanent eyeliner, implanted delivery pumps, shrapnel&#xD;

             hours, including claustrophobia, overweight greater than the maximum for the scanner,&#xD;
             and uncontrollable behavioral symptoms, which will be screened by an interview with&#xD;
             the participant during the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;

             investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because this protocol has more than minimal risk from radiation exposure without&#xD;
        possibility of direct benefit, inclusion of children is not appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION OF PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant women will be excluded because this protocol involves exposure to ionizing&#xD;
        radiation. Lactating women will be excluded because radioisotopes may be excreted in milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION OF PARTICIPANTS WHO ARE HIV POSITIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons with HIV infection are excluded because HIV infection itself may cause&#xD;
        neuroinflammation, and we wish to specifically study the effect of depression on&#xD;
        neuroinflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION OF NON ENGLISH SPEAKING PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
