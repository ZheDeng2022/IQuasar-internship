      Ballistocardiographic (BCG) biosensors reflecting the patients' current state is established.&#xD;
      There are few studies documenting BCG biosensors efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. In&#xD;
      addition, technologies using invasive blood pressure curves and Near Infrared Regional&#xD;
      Spectrometry (NIRS) to measure hemodynamics have been used. Using these technologies to guide&#xD;
      clinical decisions may be an major advance for patients with acute and chronic diseases. The&#xD;
      investigators will explore how these technologies compares to well established technologies&#xD;
      measuring vital signs of healthy subjects. The investigators will use live continuous and&#xD;
      non-continuous biosensor data to monitor the development of vital parameters during different&#xD;
      scenarios. The study will document how CPD measured by biosensors, cerebral oximetry measured&#xD;
      by NIRS, and invasive blood pressure curves measured by FloTracâ„¢ are compared to established&#xD;
      technologies of vital organ functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be measured continuously and documented simultanuously with technologies such as&#xD;
      Doppler Echocardiography, transthoracic impedance (TTI), Electrocardiogram (ECG), invasive&#xD;
      blood pressure [cardiac output/index (CO/CI), stroke volume/stroke volume index (SV/SVI),&#xD;
      stroke volume variation/pulse pressure variation (SVV/PPV), systemic vascular resistance/&#xD;
      systemic vascular resistance index (SVR/SVRI), mean arterial pressure (MAP)], pulse oximetry&#xD;
      (SpO2) and cerebral oximetry (rSO2). Of special interest is to document how relative heart&#xD;
      stroke volume reflects blood flow documented by the parallel technology measures. All these&#xD;
      measures are the key part in the study to document user friendliness, accuracy, sensitivity,&#xD;
      specificity and correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main research question is whether adding BCG biosensor measures, cerebral oximetry and&#xD;
      invasive blood pressure to monitor vital signs will add meaningful information to the care of&#xD;
      patients in a situation where we are able to control all the factors that may impact these&#xD;
      measures. The aim of the study is to document (correlation, sensitivity and specificity) how&#xD;
      BCG biosensors perform compared to each other and to well established technologies used for&#xD;
      monitoring blood flow, blood pressure, heart rate and respiration rate in steady state and&#xD;
      during ambulance transport. In addition, the investigators will in a controlled manner&#xD;
      measure how established maneuvers like Trendelenburg, hypo-/hyperventilation, and bolus of&#xD;
      fluid influences our measures.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ballistocardiographic (BCG) biosensors collecting continuous physiological data (CPD) in real&#xD;
      time to generate information reflecting the patients' current state is established and have&#xD;
      become more useful in monitoring vital signs of subjects and patients. There are few studies&#xD;
      documenting BCG biosensors efficacy, effectiveness, and efficiency. Using CPD to guide&#xD;
      clinical decisions may be a major advance for patients with acute and chronic diseases. In&#xD;
      addition, technologies using invasive blood pressure curves and Near Infrared Regional&#xD;
      Spectrometry (NIRS) to measure hemodynamics have been used. This may drive the evolution from&#xD;
      episodic to continuous patient care for these patients experiencing a severe medical event&#xD;
      compromising blood flow. The investigators will explore how these technologies compares to&#xD;
      well established technologies measuring vital signs of healthy subjects. In the present study&#xD;
      the investigators will use live continuous and non-continuous biosensor data to monitor the&#xD;
      development of vital parameters during different scenarios. The study will document how CPD&#xD;
      measured by biosensors, cerebral oximetry measured by NIRS, and invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      curves measured by FloTracTM are compared to established technologies of vital organ&#xD;
      functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study data will be measured continuously and in phases of the study&#xD;
      simultaneously with other well established technologies such as Doppler Echocardiography,&#xD;
      transthoracic impedance (TTI), Electrocardiogram (ECG), invasive blood pressure [cardiac&#xD;
      output/index (CO/CI), stroke volume/stroke volume index (SV/SVI), stroke volume&#xD;
      variation/pulse pressure variation (SVV/PPV), systemic vascular resistance/ systemic vascular&#xD;
      resistance index (SVR/SVRI), mean arterial pressure (MAP)], pulse oximetry (SpO2) and&#xD;
      cerebral oximetry (rSO2). Based on this the investigators believe they will be able to pick&#xD;
      up how dynamic differences develop. Of special interest is to document how relative heart&#xD;
      stroke volume reflects blood flow documented by the parallel technology measures. HRV will&#xD;
      also be evaluated in the light of other measures such as pulse, respiration, and relative&#xD;
      stroke volume. All these measures are the key part in the study to document user&#xD;
      friendliness, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and correlations.&#xD;
