      50 healthy volunteers (HV) will participate in 2 identical ketamine-induced pharmacoBOLD&#xD;
      (phBOLD) sessions at least 7 days apart. On both days, clinical assessments will be performed&#xD;
      following removal of the subject from the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HV will be discharged home after clearance by the study physician. This study will assign&#xD;
      ketamine doses in successive 10 subject cohorts. The ketamine dose for the 1st cohort will&#xD;
      start at 0.08 mg/kg. For subsequent cohorts, the bolus will be successively reduced or&#xD;
      increased by 0.02 mg/kg (n=10/dose) to determine the lowest dose of ketamine that still&#xD;
      produces a robust phBOLD response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be subject and rater blind, i.e. subjects and raters, will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment (ketamine dose) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study physician will be aware of the ketamine dose, and ketamine dose will be the same&#xD;
      for both sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be told what the exact ketamine dose they will receive, but it will be&#xD;
      based on their weight and will be no higher than 0.08 mg/kg.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia (Sz) is associated with psychotic symptoms, such as hearing voices and paranoid&#xD;
      beliefs that remain partially or fully refractory to standard antipsychotic medications for&#xD;
      ~2/3 of patients. Alternative, glutamatergic approaches for treatment development have been&#xD;
      proposed but have not yet led to FDA-approved medications. Moreover, several&#xD;
      glutamate-targeted medications, such as pomaglumetad (POMA), have failed in pivotal clinical&#xD;
      trials despite robust effectiveness in preclinical models. A major barrier to effective&#xD;
      glutamatergic treatment development is the absence of validated measures for target&#xD;
      engagement that can identify effective compounds and guide dose selection. Target&quot; refers to&#xD;
      a factor that an intervention is intended to modify, leading to improvement in symptoms, and&#xD;
      target engagement biomarkers are a measure of the ability of the intervention to &quot;engage&quot; the&#xD;
      target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the recently completed NIMH multicenter FAST-PS initiative (IRB protocol 6925 and&#xD;
      7285), we evaluated ketamine-induced pharmacoBOLD (phBOLD) in healthy volunteers (HV) as a&#xD;
      potential target engagement biomarker for development of metabotropic glutamate (mGluR2/3)&#xD;
      agonists, as a prelude to planned studies in Sz. BOLD imaging indirectly measures brain&#xD;
      energy, as a proxy for glutamate target engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study will (1) build on these initial positive results to develop phBOLD for use&#xD;
      in Sz, (2) optimize ketamine dosing to further increase sensitivity of the phBOLD approach,&#xD;
      and (3) explore mechanisms of psychosis. The present study will enable a personalized&#xD;
      medicine approach to target engagement and dose evaluation in Sz, while, in parallel,&#xD;
      evaluating mechanisms in Sz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The structure of this grant requires successful completion of Specific Aim (SA) 1 over the&#xD;
      first 18 months prior to initiation of SA2 and SA3. We will amend the PSF and consent to&#xD;
      include a full description of SA's 2 and 3 prior to its initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In FAST-PS, we selected a high dose of ketamine (0.23 mg/kg) in order to produce robust&#xD;
      pharmacological effects. Under SA1, we will titrate this dose downward in HV in order to&#xD;
      identify doses that produce reduced psychotomimetic effects, but nevertheless sufficiently&#xD;
      robust phBOLD effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 HV will participate in 2 identical phBOLD sessions at least 7 days apart. In total, MRI&#xD;
      scans will last approximately 45 minutes, including pre and post ketamine scan. The design is&#xD;
      based on our published study(Javitt, Carter et al. 2018). On both days, clinical assessments&#xD;
      will be performed following removal of the subject from the scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HV will be discharged home after clearance by the study physician. Although we expect all HV&#xD;
      to tolerate ketamine challenge, in the case that a subject does not tolerate it well, we have&#xD;
      the capability of admitting a HV subject to an inpatient unit for monitoring and treatment if&#xD;
      necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SA1 will assign ketamine doses in successive 10 subject cohorts. The ketamine dose for the&#xD;
      1st cohort will start at 0.08 mg/kg. For subsequent cohorts, the bolus will be successively&#xD;
      reduced or increased by 0.02 mg/kg (n=10/dose) to determine the lowest dose of ketamine that&#xD;
      still produces a robust phBOLD response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be subject and rater blind, i.e. subjects and raters, will be blinded to the&#xD;
      treatment (ketamine dose) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study physician will be aware of the ketamine dose, and ketamine dose will be the same&#xD;
      for both sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will not be told what the exact ketamine dose they will receive, but it will be&#xD;
      based on their weight and will be no higher than 0.08 mg/kg.&#xD;
