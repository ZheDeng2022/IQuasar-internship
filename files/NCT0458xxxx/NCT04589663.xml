    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-period, single-sequence crossover study including 2 single dose&#xD;
      treatments of mometasone furoate 100 μg administered via Twisthaler® and of 75/40 µg&#xD;
      indacaterol acetate/mometasone furoate fixed dose combination 75/40 µg (QMF149) administered&#xD;
      via Concept 1 device with a washout period between the two treatments. The study will include&#xD;
      a screening period of up to 14 days, two single-dose treatments separated by a 4-7 day&#xD;
      washout period (4 days is the minimum washout) and a 30-day investigational drug-free&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, two-period, single-sequence, crossover study to assess the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of single inhaled doses of mometasone furoate (MF)&#xD;
      when administered alone via MF Twisthaler® (TH) or as an indacaterol acetate/MF fixed dose&#xD;
      combination (QMF149) via the Concept 1 (C1) device in ≥ 6 to &lt;12 year old asthma patients.&#xD;
      The study includes two open-label single-dose treatment visits. On the first treatment visit&#xD;
      (Day 1) patients receive a single inhaled dose of 100 μg MF administered via the Twisthaler®&#xD;
      device. On the second treatment visit (Day 6) patients receive a single inhaled dose of 75/40&#xD;
      μg indacaterol acetate/MF fixed dose combination (QMF149) via C1 device. Both treatments are&#xD;
      in addition to their rescue medication and potentially standard of care asthma therapy&#xD;
      (excluding MF and indacaterol acetate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the systemic exposure to MF resulting from single doses&#xD;
      of MF when administered as MF TH 100 μg versus QMF149 75/40 μg C1.&#xD;
