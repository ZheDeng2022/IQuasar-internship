  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that begins&#xD;
      in childhood and can persist throughout adolescence and adulthood. ADHD affects persistently&#xD;
      about 5% of children and adolescents and about 2.5% of adults worldwide. The cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) has proven to be effective in significantly reducing ADHD-symptoms,&#xD;
      maintaining the effects during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to develop and validate a psychological treatment program for adult&#xD;
      ADHD-patients consisting of six sessions based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and to&#xD;
      study the effectiveness of the developed program in short and long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients will be randomized to two treatment groups (1:1). One group will&#xD;
      receive 12 sessions of CBT and the other group six sessions of brief CBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the short-term effectiveness of a CBT psychological treatment program of&#xD;
      six group sessions will be the same as the response to the CBT psychological treatment&#xD;
      program of twelve group sessions in adult ADHD-patients with stable drug treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the ADHD-Rating Scale (ADHD-RS)</measure>
    <time_frame>In the 6 sessions group: at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.In 12 session group: at 12 weeks, at 24 weeks and at 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The ADHD-RS is a 18-items scale self-report version for assessing symptoms for ADHD DSM-IV. It consists of a subscale of inattention (IN, 9-items), another of hyperactivity/impulsivity (H / I, 9-items) and the total (TOT, 18-items). The interviewees are asked about the frequency of the symptoms over the past 6 months. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 points, and the highest scores indicates more severe symptomatology of ADHD.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the ADHD symptons at childhood</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by Wender UTAH Rating Scale (WURS). This is a scale used in the diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder based on behaviour and feelings experienced during childhood.&#xD;
The self-report questionnaire consists of 61-items, 25 of which are highly relevant items for ADHD (thus used in the scale for ADHD) and can help link childhood symptoms with patterns of behaviour in adulthood.&#xD;
The scale is however limited by the capacity of the patient to recall memories from childhood.&#xD;
Each of the questions in the retrospective scale has 4 answer choices, awarded points from 0 to 4:&#xD;
Not at all or slightly (0 points);&#xD;
Mildly (1 point);&#xD;
Moderately (2 points);&#xD;
Quite a bit (3 points);&#xD;
Very much (4 points).&#xD;
The results range between 0 and 100 when the 25-item scale is used and a cut-off at 46 points was provided. This means that patients who score 46 or above are likely to be diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the Health status</measure>
    <time_frame>at Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by SF-36. The Short Form (36) Health Survey is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. The SF-36 consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability</description>

    <measure>Change in the WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>In the 6 sessions group: at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.In 12 session group: at 12 weeks, at 24 weeks and at 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>WHO Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHODAS 2.0) consist of 36 items. The scores assigned to each of the items - &quot;none&quot; (0), &quot;mild&quot; (1) &quot;moderate&quot; (2), &quot;severe&quot; (3) and &quot;extreme&quot; (4) - are summed. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST)</measure>
    <time_frame>In the 6 sessions group: at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.In 12 session group: at 12 weeks, at 24 weeks and at 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It comprises 24 items that assess impairment or disability in six specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time. It is a likert scale. Each item is scored from 0 to 4. The total scored range is from 0 to 96 with a higher score indicating more disability problems.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)</measure>
    <time_frame>In the 6 sessions group: at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks and at 24 weeks.In 12 session group: at 12 weeks, at 24 weeks and at 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>the BDI-II also contains 21 questions, each answer being scored on a scale value of 0 to 3. Higher total scores indicate more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs used differ from the original:&#xD;
0-13: minimal depression 14-19: mild depression 20-28: moderate depression 29-63: severe depression</description>

    <description>This inventory is made up of 40 questions and they are rated on a 4-point scale. Low scores indicate a mild form of anxiety whereas median scores indicate a moderate form of anxiety and high scores indicate a severe form of anxiety.</description>
