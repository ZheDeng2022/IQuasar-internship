  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop an effective telephone mediated follow-up system to&#xD;
      reduce the number of unplanned readmissions and emergency department visits after total joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty. This will help reduce costs related to unnecessary visits to the hospital as&#xD;
      well as catch complications earlier on. The investigators plan to accomplish this by&#xD;
      performing a pilot study that will compare the outcomes of using an Interactive Voice&#xD;
      Response system through phone call in addition to the standard follow-up protocol. The&#xD;
      outcomes of this group will be compared to those receiving the standard of care follow-up&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon patient education and consent to participate in this study, patients will be randomized&#xD;
      via online randomizer during their baseline visit into either Treatment As Usual (TAU) or&#xD;
      Integrated Voice Response (IVR) cohorts. During this baseline visit, the patients in the IVR&#xD;
      group will be given specific information on the nature of the calls and what to expect. Both&#xD;
      groups will fill out a form for assessing their baseline pain and functionality. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive standard total joint arthroplasty. After this, the TAU group will receive the&#xD;
      standard of care which involves appropriate pain management and scheduled clinic follow-ups&#xD;
      lasting approximately 60 minutes at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks along with additional&#xD;
      visits if required. Clinic visits will assess pain via VAS scale, joint functionality via&#xD;
      HOOS and KOOS scale, and quality of life via SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the standard of care follow-up visits as in the TAU group, the IVR group will&#xD;
      also receive automated phone calls lasting up to 3 minutes, which will be the focus of this&#xD;
      research study. These phone calls will be daily for the first week, every other day the&#xD;
      second week, twice a week for weeks 3-6, and weekly for weeks 7-12. The content of these&#xD;
      calls will assess pain management, wound healing and screen for potential complications&#xD;
      through a series of questions (questionnaire script attached). At the completion of each&#xD;
      call, the patient will be instructed to either continue standard treatment or visit the&#xD;
      emergency department based on the content of their response. If there is reason for concern,&#xD;
      the PI will automatically be informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey questions pertaining to the patients outcomes and satisfaction will be completed in&#xD;
      clinic and collected by the PI. The responses and data relating to IVR calls will made&#xD;
      available through computer software designed by our team on the secure REDcap network.&#xD;
