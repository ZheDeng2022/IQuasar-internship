  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly development of capsule endoscopy provides a comfortable and minimal invasive modality&#xD;
      which is an alternative to conventional esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD). The use of capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy beyond the small bowel is increasing and several capsule endoscopy systems have&#xD;
      been introduced for the examination of the esophagus and colon. The current capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      systems are less effective for the upper gastrointestinal tract examination. Short transit&#xD;
      time in the esophagus and the passive movement of the capsule makes it more difficult to&#xD;
      identify or visualize the lesion comparing with traditional EGD. The sensitivity rate of&#xD;
      esophageal varices detection from capsule endoscopy was ranging from 65% to 80%. In order to&#xD;
      control the capsule in the gastrointestinal tract for better visualization, many methods are&#xD;
      invented. Magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy systems and string-mounted capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy are applied in many studies. Magnetically assisted capsule endoscopy system and&#xD;
      string-mounted capsule endoscopy are used to control the capsule endoscopy for elongating&#xD;
      esophagus transit time to have a better visualization of the esophagus. The InsightEyes EGD&#xD;
      System combines the string and magnetic assisted capsule endoscopy system to provide a&#xD;
      real-time high-quality image during the examination. On the other hand, 3D image processing&#xD;
      can be used for distinguishing the esophageal varices and normal folds well, theoretically.&#xD;
      Thus, in this study, the investigators combine string, magnetically assisted capsule&#xD;
      endoscopy systems, and 3D image processing together to form a new system for improving the&#xD;
      detection of esophageal varices and other gastric lesions.&#xD;

      This is a prospective and observational study. Sample size calculation and patient selection&#xD;
      The investigators plan to include a total of 140 participants in this study. Sixty-five&#xD;
      cirrhotics with portal hypertensive symptoms (such as platelets count less than 100,000) will&#xD;
      be enrolled to evaluate for the presence and stage of esophageal varices by using a&#xD;
      magnetic-assisted capsule endoscope system. Thirty-five cirrhotics patients with history of&#xD;
      endoscopy-confirmed esophageal varices will be included for the follow-up examination by&#xD;
      using the magnetic-assisted capsule endoscope system. Another 40 healthy volunteers without&#xD;
      known gastrointestinal disease will be enrolled as the control group. Those participants with&#xD;
      less than 20-year-old, having implanted electronic or magnetic devices, pregnant, or unable&#xD;
      to swallow the capsule, will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention The patient will undergo both diagnostic tests in two days, with a&#xD;
      magnetic-assisted capsule endoscope system first and then conventional EGD will be carried on&#xD;
      at least 4 hours afterward.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic-assisted capsule endoscope system (MACE, InsightEyes EGD System) with or without 3D&#xD;
      images(&quot;MedicalTek&quot; Endoscopic Imaging system and accessories) will be used for detecting&#xD;
      esophageal varices and other possible lesions. As standard per-endoscopy preparation,&#xD;
      patients undergo a 6-8 hour fast. The participants take 400 mg of N-acetylcysteine solution&#xD;
      in 200 mL of water 1 h before the MACE examination and an additional 300 mL of clear water&#xD;
      after 30 min to remove gastric mucus. With the upright(sitting) position, the patient is&#xD;
      instructed to swallow the capsule with 20mL of clear water. The hand-held magnet is held&#xD;
      above the sternum in order to catch the capsule and examine the esophagus. Capsule endoscopy&#xD;
      is manipulated by changes in the patient's position and hand-held magnet. The magnetic field&#xD;
      navigator is placed in front of the patient's abdomen and helped the capsule moving and&#xD;
      rotating by moving the magnetic field navigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capsule endoscopy will end up in the second portion of the duodenum as the conventional&#xD;
      EGD does.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lesion is detected using 2D and 3D imaging at the same time during the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) EGDs (Olympus GIF-H290) are conducted by experienced&#xD;
      endoscopists. These practitioners are able to check the indication of the procedure and&#xD;
      previous findings of EGD. The EGDs are conducted by standard techniques. The patient&#xD;
      undergoes pharyngeal anesthesia and then EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation evaluation The quality of gastric preparation includes the degree of mucosal&#xD;
      visibility and stomach distention. The degree of mucosal visibility is classified into four&#xD;
      grades: excellent = no adherent mucus on the gastric mucosa; good = small amount of mucus on&#xD;
      the gastric mucosa but without obscured vision; fair = small amount of mucus on the gastric&#xD;
      mucosa with partially obscured vision; and poor = profuse mucus on the gastric mucosa with&#xD;
      obscured vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stomach distention is classified into three grades: good = satisfactory stomach distention&#xD;
      with the remaining small amount of collapsed gastric folds; fair = considerable amount of&#xD;
      collapsed gastric folds that obscure some parts of the stomach; and poor = insufficient&#xD;
      stomach inflation, and examination of the area of interest is impossible. The investigators&#xD;
      evaluate the proximal (cardia, fundus, and upper body) and distal (lower body and antrum)&#xD;
      portions of the stomach separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion detection Esophageal varices detection Esophageal varices will be evaluated and&#xD;
      described according to the Japanese Research Society for Portal Hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other lesion detection Another lesion is evaluated including portal hypertensive gastropathy,&#xD;
      peptic ulcers, and polyps.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire on comfort and acceptance After the examinations, the patient will receive a&#xD;
      questionnaire, including the pain during the examination by using a visual analog scale&#xD;
      (VAS), scoring from 1(no pain) to 10(badly painful, barely tolerable), other discomforts such&#xD;
      as nausea and abdominal fullness. The questionnaire also includes the preferred choice of two&#xD;
      modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will compare the detection rate of esophageal varices in the cirrhotic&#xD;
           patients in the MACE system and 3D image processing with conventional EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will compare the grading consistency in the patients who have the&#xD;
           esophageal varices between the two modalities, using the conventional EGD as the gold&#xD;
           standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The investigators will evaluate the image quality in the MACE system and 3D image&#xD;
           processing in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The investigators will compare the detection rate of other gastric lesions such as&#xD;
           portal hypertensive gastropathy, gastric polyp, and ulcer in the MACE system plus 3D&#xD;
           image processing with conventional EGD in all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The investigators will evaluate the discomfort using the questionnaire in all&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
