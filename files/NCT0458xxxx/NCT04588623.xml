      This is a single center, double blind (patients and investigators), Placebo controlled&#xD;
      randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients with Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) in moderate disease activity (Psoriatic&#xD;
      Arthritis Disease Activity Score: PASDAS &gt;3.2 - &lt;5.4) on a stable treatment (no&#xD;
      immunomodulatory treatment change in the last 3 months) with biological (bDMARDs) and/or&#xD;
      synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (sDMARDs) and/or glucocorticoids will be&#xD;
      included in the study. Clinical assessment will be scheduled at baseline, 12 weeks and 24&#xD;
