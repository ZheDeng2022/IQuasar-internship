    <textblock>
      Phase 1b/Phase 2 open-label, multi-center, parallel group umbrella study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sasanlimab (a PD-1 antagonist monoclonal antibody) will be combined with a different targeted&#xD;
      therapy in each sub-study. The Phase1b part of each sub-study will evaluate the safety of the&#xD;
      combination and select the dose for the Phase 2 part. The Phase 2 part of each sub-study will&#xD;
      evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination.&#xD;
