  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Integrating ICT in health promotion has been suggested to offer many advantages compared to&#xD;
      traditional approaches to promote well-being. Research has shown the positive effects of a&#xD;
      body-mind-spirit (BMS) approach in enhancing health and well-being. We will develop and&#xD;
      assess a pilot trial involving a holistic BMS approach to promote positive emotion change,&#xD;
      emotion regulation and self-awareness through an ICT-supported program in a community&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The body-mind-spirit (BMS) approach views the three components as a connected, balanced&#xD;
      system that interacts with one another harmoniously. With the well-established&#xD;
      academic-community partnership between HKU and Caritas-Hong Kong, our pilot trial aims to&#xD;
      build upon the previous experiences by Caritas-Hong Kong and investigate the feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness of a BMS approach in enhancing positive emotions and well-being among community&#xD;
      participants. This trial is an innovative attempt at conducting an ICT-supported online&#xD;
      intervention with community participants. It would also help meet the urgent need for brief,&#xD;
      community-based preventive mental health promotion, especially in the context of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
