  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rhizarthrosis is the wear of the thumb saddle joint. It is a very common disease affecting up&#xD;
      to 25% of postmenopausal women. There are currently various conservative and surgical methods&#xD;
      available for treatment. If conservative treatment does not lead to freedom from pain, one of&#xD;
      the surgical methods can be used, such as metacarpal extension osteotomy, trapeziectomy with&#xD;
      or without ligamentoplasty, trapeziometacarpal arthrodesis, prosthesis implantation and&#xD;
      various forms of interposition arthroplasty . Despite the high satisfaction rate of up to 95%&#xD;
      after surgical treatment, the anatomy of the carpus is irreversibly destroyed . Apart from&#xD;
      that, these operations are also associated with corresponding complications and&#xD;
      post-operative immobilization of several weeks. Thus, a minimally invasive treatment method&#xD;
      with a corresponding success rate would be of great advantage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      By infiltrating and filling the joint with Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP), fat or a combination&#xD;
      of both, the pain of rhizarthrosis can be reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the announced doctoral thesis is to investigate the effect of PRP, lipofilling and&#xD;
      its combination on arthroses of the thumb saddle joint after a single joint injection and to&#xD;
      compare it with a control group.It is to be proven that PRP, fat and their combination lead&#xD;
      to a different degree of pain relief compared to the control group due to the expansion of&#xD;
      the joint space and the associated filling effect.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in mobility of the thumb</measure>
    <time_frame>is measured 5 times, from screening visit to 3 months after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>assessed by Kapandji-score, measured degrees of motion Dig I MCP, Dig I IP. A score of 0 indicates no opposition, a score of 10 indicates maximal opposition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in quality of life score, assessed by Questionnaire SF36</measure>
    <time_frame>is measured 5 times, from screening visit to 3 months after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The SF36 consists of 8 domains, the range of every scale goes from 0-100. A higher score indicates no restriction in health. 0 =greatest possible restriction of health; 100 = absence of health restrictions</description>

    <time_frame>is measured 5 times, from screening visit to 3 months after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Upper-extremity disability and symptoms are assessed by the DASH-Score. The range goes from 0 (no disability) to 100.</description>

    <measure>Change in Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire (MHQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>is measured 5 times, from screening visit to 3 months after intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>The MHQ has six domains. Overall hand function, activities of daily living (ADLs), work performance, aesthetics, and patient satisfaction) are scored from 0 - 100 in which 100 is the best possible ability.&#xD;
The pain domain is scored from 0 - 100, where 0 indicates no pain.</description>
