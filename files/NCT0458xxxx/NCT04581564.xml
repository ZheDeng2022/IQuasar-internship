  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Every year, approximately 100,000 people are diagnosed with aphasia-a language disorder&#xD;
      leading to substantial difficulties in their daily communication. Based on the observation&#xD;
      that many people with aphasia can sing words that they otherwise cannot speak, melodic&#xD;
      intonation therapy (MIT) was developed in the 1970s. Although recognized as a standard&#xD;
      aphasia treatment, the neural mechanisms of MIT have been largely unexplored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our first goal is to identify the active ingredient of the music intervention. Although&#xD;
      rhythm has long been considered secondary to melody, recent evidence has challenged this&#xD;
      notion by demonstrating that rhythm alone is sufficient enough to facilitate improvements in&#xD;
      speech fluency for people with aphasia. To corroborate the positive role of rhythm, we will&#xD;
      train aphasic patients to leverage &quot;rhythmic groove&quot; for sets of sentences/phrases delivered&#xD;
      through a fun and engaging video gaming platform. This intervention emerges from the&#xD;
      theoretical framework, built from neuroimaging data, that language processes heavily rely on&#xD;
      neural resources within the sensorimotor and fronto-striatal circuits that subserve&#xD;
      rhythm/timing processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our second goal is to characterize the neural plasticity associated with language recovery&#xD;
      promoted by the novel rhythm-based therapy. We hypothesize that neuroplasticity will manifest&#xD;
      itself as increased white matter tracts, presumably due to changes in myelination in either&#xD;
      ipsilateral or contralateral (homologues) language areas. To effectively measure myelin white&#xD;
      matter fraction (MWF) in candidate tracts, we will mainly use a patented Laplace-transformed&#xD;
      relaxation MRI technique. Additionally, we will measure resting-state functional connectivity&#xD;
      using BOLD (Blood Oxygen-Level Dependent) fMRI. Lastly, we will attempt to record cortical&#xD;
      activity using fNIRS (functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy) during the pre-post behavioral&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, the proposed interdisciplinary research has theoretical, methodological, and&#xD;
      clinical innovations and significance. This exploratory work will serve as a critical&#xD;
      stepping stone toward unraveling the therapeutic component of music in neurological disorders&#xD;
      and will provide evidence-based guidance to the clinicians and therapists.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year, approximately 800,000 people have a stroke in the United States alone. Among&#xD;
      these individuals, roughly 100,000 are diagnosed with aphasia-a disorder characterized by&#xD;
      profound challenges in daily communication with their families and peers. Notably, many&#xD;
      individuals with aphasia can sing despite their speech difficulties, an observation which led&#xD;
      to the development of melodic-intonation therapy (MIT) in the 1970s. Although MIT has since&#xD;
      been accepted as a viable aphasia therapy by the American Academy of Neurology, the&#xD;
      underlying neurological mechanisms that enable speech recovery remain poorly understood.&#xD;
      Here, we propose a highly interdisciplinary approach to study the neural mechanisms of&#xD;
      language recovery in aphasia through a novel rhythm-based language intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our ultimate goal is to help clinicians and therapists optimize aphasia treatment by&#xD;
      elucidating the neural basis underlying music-induced language recovery through multimodal&#xD;
      neuroimaging and novel statistical analysis. In particular, we will test a hypothesis that&#xD;
      rhythm alone is sufficient to facilitate language recovery, without melody To explore this&#xD;
      hypothesis, we recently devised a novel framework for music-based language therapy that&#xD;
      solely leverages rhythm to facilitate language production at the phrase or sentence level.&#xD;
      Our therapy was used in a case study with a patient with chronic aphasia who had severely&#xD;
      impaired speech fluency due to a large unilateral stroke in the left hemisphere. Following&#xD;
      eight weeks of rhythm therapy, she exhibited remarkable improvement in speech production&#xD;
      (i.e., from 1-2 spontaneous words to 16 sentences made from 42 words), and increased&#xD;
      functional and structural connectivity within key regions of interest associated with the&#xD;
      right sensorimotor network. While compelling, these preliminary data warrant further&#xD;
      validation using proper active controls and a larger sample size, a goal to be achieved&#xD;
      through the proposed research. We have since translated the rhythm therapy into a fun and&#xD;
      engaging game termed &quot;TheraBeat&quot; that can be installed on a tablet PC or smartphone. In the&#xD;
      proposed research, we will use TheraBeat as a home-based aphasia therapeutic intervention to&#xD;
      minimize the burden of patient travel and increase accessibility to therapy. The proposed&#xD;
      study will be accomplished by pursuing the following specific aims:. This prediction is based&#xD;
      upon the theoretical and neuroscientific framework that demonstrates how language heavily&#xD;
      relies on rhythm processes mediated by the bilateral sensorimotor network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic role of rhythm in speech recovery for people with aphasia.&#xD;
      Based on recent evidence garnered by our group as well as others, we expect that rhythm-based&#xD;
      rehabilitation will enhance speech fluency in people with chronic aphasia, i.e., our target&#xD;
      patients who are beyond six months after the onset of stroke. This hypothesis will be tested&#xD;
      by directly comparing post-therapy outcomes of the treatment group, who will practice speech&#xD;
      production daily through rhythmic activity, to an active control group who will receive&#xD;
      conventional speech production therapy without the use of rhythmic activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Characterize the neural plasticity promoted by rhythm-based intervention. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that daily participation in our new therapy program will promote neuroplasticity&#xD;
      along the sensorimotor network, especially within the intact perilesional left or right&#xD;
      fronto-striatal circuits that are known to play a key role in speech production and fluency.&#xD;
      To determine structural neuroplasticity following the intervention, we will utilize patented&#xD;
      myelin-based MRI in combination with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). To explore functional&#xD;
      neuroplasticity, we will use both resting-state fMRI and functional near-infrared&#xD;
      spectroscopy (fNIRS). These structural and functional data will be analyzed via a novel&#xD;
      statistical shape analysis that captures morphological changes, which cannot be detected by&#xD;
      simple statistical approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using an innovative rhythm-based therapeutic intervention and cutting-edge neuroimaging&#xD;
      techniques, we will address hitherto unknown questions regarding how and why music works as a&#xD;
      therapeutic regimen for aphasia rehabilitation. With expertise in aphasia rehabilitation,&#xD;
      neuroimaging, computer science, and data analytics, our interdisciplinary research team is&#xD;
      well poised to undertake this investigation. The proposed research will serve as a critical&#xD;
      stepping stone toward understanding the therapeutic role of music in neurological disorders.&#xD;
      Our results will lay the foundations for future studies on music-induced language recovery.&#xD;
