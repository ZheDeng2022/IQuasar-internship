      This study seeks to compare the accuracy and acceptability of HPV testing self-sampling kit&#xD;
      and standard clinician-sampling for HPV testing. The primary outcome of this study is the&#xD;
      concordance between screening results on self-sampling kits compared to clinician-collected&#xD;
      HPV test, Pap smear results, and colposcopy. Secondary endpoints will include acceptability&#xD;
      of self-sampling and barriers to cervical cancer screening. These endpoints will be analyzed&#xD;
      to try to circumvent barriers to the cervical cancer screening and ascertain whether&#xD;
      self-sampling is a viable alternative.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The American Cancer Society estimates that 4,170 women in the United States (US) will die&#xD;
      from cervical cancer in 2018 (Siegel et al., 2018). Screening can reduce cancer mortality by&#xD;
      (1) detecting malignancies when they are more treatable and (2) for some tests, identifying&#xD;
      precancerous lesions for removal (Shieh et al., 2016). Guidelines recommend cytology and/or&#xD;
      HPV testing for cervical cancer screening among women ages 30-65 years, but screening rates&#xD;
      are suboptimal (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 2018; Saslow et al., 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To help bridge these gaps in screening, HPV self-sampling would be an alternative to&#xD;
      clinical-sampling for HPV testing. However, there are concerns about the comparability and&#xD;
      acceptability of self-sampling kits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to compare the test characteristics of the human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) self-sampling kit versus clinician-sampled HPV testing for cervical&#xD;
      cancer screening. Potential participants will be identified from the Penn State Family and&#xD;
      Community Medicine and OBGYN clinics after it is determined that they have abnormal findings&#xD;
      on their (clinician-sampled) Pap/HPV test and require a follow-up colposcopy. The patient&#xD;
      will be pre-screened by a study team member. If they are found to be eligible, a study team&#xD;
      member will invite them to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a participant enrolls in the study, a self-sampling kit is mailed to their home along&#xD;
      with a Summary Explanation of Research consent form and instructional sheet. Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the kit two weeks before or after their colposcopy, giving them a&#xD;
      28 day collection window. Study team members will perform a follow-up survey after the sample&#xD;
      is collected and provide reminder phone calls if needed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants who enroll in the study will be asked to complete an HPV self-sampling kit in addition to completing their colposcopy exam. Participants will collect the sample at home before or after their exam and mail it back to the Penn State Health laboratory for analysis. The results will be compared to those of the clinician-collected (standard of care) colposcopy exam, Pap, and HPV test. Participants will also complete a follow up survey over the phone after their sample is collected.</intervention_model_description>
