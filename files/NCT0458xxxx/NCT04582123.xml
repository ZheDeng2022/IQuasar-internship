  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this prospective randomized controlled trial is to evaluate and compare the&#xD;
      outcome of the 2wire vs 3 wire crossed pin configurations in the management of supracondylar&#xD;
      humeral fractures in children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fortyfive children with supracondylar humeral fractures were randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups. One group was treated with 2 crossed pins and the other group with 3 crossed pins.&#xD;
      The mean age was 6.04Â±2.49 (1-12).. The follow-up period was 5 years, with no patients lost&#xD;
      to follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Twentytwo patients were managed by 2 crossed and 23 by 3 crossed pin method.&#xD;
      All surgeries were performed by the same surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measurements: Postoperative stability, ulnar nerve injury, range of motions, and&#xD;
      pin tract infections were evaluated.&#xD;
