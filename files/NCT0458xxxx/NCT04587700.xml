  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Marijuana use has increased since its legalization in Canada and many believe that it may&#xD;
      help patients that are experiencing chronic pain. The investigators want to assess if&#xD;
      patients who have used marijuana chronically will need more medication to control their pain&#xD;
      after they have undergone orthopedic trauma surgery (ex. Hip, femur, humerus fractures etc.).&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will identify chronic marijuana users (ie. those using for 3&#xD;
      months or more) who are undergoing orthopedic trauma surgery to assess how much pain&#xD;
      medication they need post-operatively and compare this with non-users. The investigators will&#xD;
      also evaluate their pain scores, pain medication use and other complications that they may&#xD;
      have during or after their surgeries, including any nausea/vomiting, heart or breathing&#xD;
      problems.&#xD;

      Since its legalization in Canada, marijuana consumption has become more common while also&#xD;
      being the most widely used illicit drug within the USA. In addition to being consumed&#xD;
      recreationally, cannabis is being increasingly prescribed by medical practitioners as nearly&#xD;
      15% of Canadian and Australian patients experiencing chronic pain use it as one component of&#xD;
      treatment. Recent evidence has demonstrated that specific patient cohorts may benefit from&#xD;
      cannabis, including those with fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, complex regional pain&#xD;
      syndrome, multiple sclerosis, traumatic neuropathic pain, and difficulty sleeping due to&#xD;
      chronic pain, amongst others. Cannabis contains two main components:&#xD;
      delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is active, and cannabidiol, which is inactive. THC&#xD;
      has its effects by binding to Type 1 cannabinoid receptors and inhibiting pain pathways while&#xD;
      activation of Type 2 cannabinoid receptors have anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As literature continues to investigate its analgesic characteristics, many proponents of&#xD;
      cannabis use believe that it can modify pain response in various settings. One such setting&#xD;
      that is of special interest for pain control is during the post-operative period. Currently,&#xD;
      there is minimal data available to reflect the analgesic requirement, and thus degree of&#xD;
      pain, for a patient who is a chronic marijuana user immediately following a surgical&#xD;
      procedure. A class of surgical procedures that is of particular interest to us due to its&#xD;
      pain-evoking characteristics is orthopedic trauma surgery. In fact, orthopedic surgeons are&#xD;
      one of the higher opioid prescribing specialists, potentially highlighting the difficulty in&#xD;
      achieving adequate pain control in their patient population. More information is required to&#xD;
      better tailor analgesia for these patients as it may contribute towards their overall&#xD;
      recovery, restoring mobility, and patient satisfaction (6,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, the investigators would like to investigate the relationship between&#xD;
      orthopedic trauma surgery and post-operative pain control in the chronic marijuana user.&#xD;
      Minimal data is available in the literature reflecting this potentially common situation.&#xD;
      Specifically, the investigators are interested in the clinical implications of marijuana use&#xD;
      on opioid consumption and verbal pain rating in this patient scenario. The investigators also&#xD;
      hope that the data can reflect possible side effects or other concerning outcomes in the&#xD;
      peri-operative period so that clinicians may be able to provide more personalized care to&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;

        Patient recruits will be identified by accessing the electronic health record at the&#xD;
        University of Alberta hospital (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) and the written slate available&#xD;
        at the Royal Alexandra hospital (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada). These sources will list the&#xD;
        elective orthopedic slate, accessible about 1 week prior to surgery, and the trauma slate&#xD;
        which is available at least 24 hours prior to surgery. Patients can also be identified in&#xD;
        the pre-assessment clinic. Research supervisors and designated assistants will be&#xD;
        responsible for identifying potential participants. Once their location is identified, the&#xD;
        research assistant will consent the patient at least 12 hours prior to surgery or in the&#xD;
        pre-assessment clinic where patients will attend at least 24 hours prior to surgery.&#xD;
