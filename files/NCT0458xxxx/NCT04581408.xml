      Novel therapy for the Long QT Syndrome based on the mechanism of action of the&#xD;
      disease-causing mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long QT syndrome type 2 (LQT2) accounts for ~ 35% of all LQTS cases and is difficult to&#xD;
      manage, as beta-blockers frequently fail to provide full protection. Most LQT2 patients (pts)&#xD;
      have a Class 2 mutation, which implies defective &quot;trafficking&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumacaftor (LUM) is a drug developed and currently indicated for the treatment of cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (CF) in patients homozygous for the F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. LUM corrects&#xD;
      protein folding and trafficking defects of mutant and misfolded CFTR channels, restoring&#xD;
      their cell surface expression. The investigators recently demonstrated that LUM can rescue in&#xD;
      vitro the LQTS phenotype observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell- derived&#xD;
      cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from pts with LQT2 Class 2 mutations (PMID: 29020304) and in these&#xD;
      same two patients Orkambi administrated for 7 days at the same dosage approved for cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis showed to reduce their QTc (PMID: 30753398).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the present phase II clinical trial (MAST2) the investigators will enroll 20 LQT2&#xD;
      patients (see inclusion and exclusion criteria) and they will test in vivo the efficacy of&#xD;
      Orkambi in shortening their QTc. Patients will be admitted to hospital for a maximum of 7&#xD;
      days (minimum in-hospital stay based on evidence of QTc shortening). Orkambi will be&#xD;
      administered at the dose approved for cystic fibrosis and during the entire period continuous&#xD;
      ECG monitoring through both telemetry and 12-lead 24-hr Holter monitoring will be performed&#xD;
      and QTc length and morphology will be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The congenital Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by a&#xD;
      prolonged QT interval on the electrocardiogram, and an increased risk of life-threating&#xD;
      arrhythmias in otherwise healthy individuals. Typically, the heart is structurally normal and&#xD;
      the electric abnormality present in these patients is due to mutations in genes encoding ion&#xD;
      channel subunits or proteins modulating ion-channel function. The investigators will&#xD;
      specifically study the LQT2 variant which is the second most common form of LQTS (30-35% of&#xD;
      all LQTS cases), a rare condition present in approximately 1 in 7.500-8.000 live births&#xD;
      characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the KCNH2 gene (hERG) which result in a&#xD;
      reduction of the potassium current IKr, pivotal for ventricular repolarization. Four&#xD;
      different mutation classes define the molecular mechanisms impairing hERG. Among these,&#xD;
      almost 50% are class 2 mutations that determine hERG trafficking defects, with the consequent&#xD;
      lack of expression of these essential ion channels on the cardiomyocyte membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to clinical severity current therapies for LQT2 include β-blockers, left cardiac&#xD;
      sympathetic denervation and an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). However, ICD&#xD;
      implantation, is not devoid of complications and often, the pain and fear associated with ICD&#xD;
      shocks lead to electrical storms with multiple recurrent shocks. Furthermore, there are&#xD;
      concerns about the long-term impact of implanting an ICD in young LQTS patients, likely to&#xD;
      live another 7 to 8 decades after initial device implantation and who would be subjected to&#xD;
      multiple procedures for generator replacement and lead revisions/extractions with frequent&#xD;
      complications. There is a clear and unmet need for additional therapeutic strategies and&#xD;
      implementation of gene-specific therapy could represent a quite important step for improving&#xD;
      the clinical management of these pts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumacaftor (LUM) is a drug developed and currently indicated for the treatment of cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 12 years and older who are homozygous for the F508del mutation&#xD;
      in the CFTR gene. By acting as a chaperone, LUM corrects protein folding and trafficking&#xD;
      defects of mutant and misfolded CFTR channels, restoring their cell surface expression. In&#xD;
      its commercial formulation - brand name Orkambi - it is combined with ivacaftor (IVA), an&#xD;
      enhancer of the CFTR protein function. The recommended dose is two tablets (each tablet&#xD;
      containing LUM 200 mg/ IVA 125 mg) taken orally every 12 hours for a total daily dose of LUM&#xD;
      800 mg/ IVA 500 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators recently demonstrated that LUM can rescue in vitro the LQTS phenotype&#xD;
      observed in human induced pluripotent stem cell- derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) from&#xD;
      patients with LQT2 Class 2 mutations (PMID: 29020304) and in these same two patients Orkambi&#xD;
      administrated for 7 days at the same dosage approved for cystic fibrosis showed to reduce&#xD;
      their QTc (PMID: 30753398).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the present phase II clinical trial (MAST2) 20 LQT2 patients will be enrolled (see&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria). Patients will be admitted to hospital for a maximum of 7&#xD;
      days (minimum in-hospital stay based on evidence of QTc shortening) while beta-blocker&#xD;
      therapy will continue at the current dose. Orkambi will be administered at the dose approved&#xD;
      for cystic fibrosis [Orkambi (Lumacaftor 200 mg/Ivacaftor 125 mg) 2 tablets twice a day for a&#xD;
      total daily dose of 800 mg of Lumacaftor and 500 mg of Ivacaftor] and blood exams will be&#xD;
      performed at day 1, 3, 5 and 7. During the entire period continuous ECG monitoring through&#xD;
      both telemetry and 12-lead 24-hr Holter monitoring will be performed and QTc length and&#xD;
      morphology will be analysed. Independently of the result the patient will be discharged&#xD;
      without Orkambi as a chronic therapy. Therefore, the drug will be administered orally for a&#xD;
      maximum of 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of side effects a reduction of the dose will be considered and according to the&#xD;
      specific problem the possibility of an interruption will be evaluated. Furthermore, as an&#xD;
      additional &quot;stopping rule&quot; the patient can freely decide to withdraw from the study in any&#xD;
      moment even during the Hospitalization phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance will be strictly monitored as the drug will be assumed in Hospital in front of the&#xD;
      nurse twice a day for the maximum of 7 days. Placebo will not be used.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed consent: it is requested that the partipants understand the nature of the&#xD;
             study and can give their voluntary conset after being fully informed, after having&#xD;
             received satisfying replies to their questions regarding the study, and all the&#xD;
             authorizations according to local requirements. The informed consent form was&#xD;
             previously approved by the local Ethics Committee and will have to be dated and signed&#xD;
             before enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age and gender: participants of both the male and female sex aged between 18 and 65&#xD;
             years will be included&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mutations: the study will enrol patients with LQT2, i.e., with pathogenic mutations on&#xD;
             the KCNH2 gene, that present such functional characterization that classifies them as&#xD;
             class II mutations, namely mutations that cause a trafficking defect. This&#xD;
             characterization includes, but is not limited to, patch clamp data in single cells,&#xD;
             immunofluorescence data, positive reactions to drugs that correct the trafficking&#xD;
             defect in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent of the patient to not participate in any other clinical study during the&#xD;
             entire period of participation in the present study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women with child-bearing potential (pre-menopausal women, less than two years after&#xD;
             start of menopause and women who are not surgically sterile) must use a highly&#xD;
             effective contraceptive method from 30 days before enrollment in the study until 28&#xD;
             days after the last administration of study drug. It is specified that the sole use of&#xD;
             hormonal contraception, both oral, injectable, transdermic and implantable cannot be&#xD;
             considered an effective contraceptive method. Orkambi (Lumacaftor/ivacaftor) may&#xD;
             reduce the exposure to the hormonal contraceptives and possibly cause their&#xD;
             ineffectiveness. Male patients with a female partner with child-bearing potential must&#xD;
             use 2 forms of contraception (one of which should be a double-barrier method) from&#xD;
             enrolment in the study until 28 days after the last administration of study drug.&#xD;
             Highly effective contraceptive methods are: i) abstinence, ii) surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (=6 months postsurgery), iii) intrauterine device or intrauterine system, iv) oral&#xD;
             contraceptives combined with a barrier method, v) double-barrier method (e.g., male&#xD;
             condom or diaphragm with vaginal spermicides).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of one or more of the preceeding inclusion criteria&#xD;

          -  Pregnancy (established before enrollment by positive urine pregnancy test in&#xD;
             potentially fertile women) or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in a clinical study in which an experimental drugs has been administered&#xD;
             less than 30 days or less than 5 half-lives before the present study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinical condition that in the opinion of the investigator causes the patients not&#xD;
             to be suitable for the study and/or that may involve an unreasonable/significant risk&#xD;
             for the participants, thereby changing the interpretation of that data and affecting&#xD;
             the continuation of the study&#xD;
