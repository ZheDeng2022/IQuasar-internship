  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study&#xD;
      designed to assess the impact of preloaded betaine supplementation on thermoregulation and&#xD;
      exercise metabolism in the heat. The study, outlined in Figure 7 and described in detail&#xD;
      below, will consist of seven total visits to the Institute of Sports Science and Medicine&#xD;
      (ISSM) or Sandels laboratories at Florida State University, two of which will be experimental&#xD;
      visits. On the first visit, participants will be informed as to the details of the study&#xD;
      before giving their oral and written informed consent (Appendix A). Thereafter,&#xD;
      anthropometrics will be measured and participants will complete an incremental exercise test&#xD;
      on an electronically-braked cycle ergometer to volitional exhaustion to determine peak oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2 peak). Days 1-6 participants will consume a full dosage of supplementation,&#xD;
      whereas day 0 and 7 participants will consume half a dose of the supplement, with the last&#xD;
      dosage being consumed 60 minutes prior to experimental visits, days 7 and 21. On days 2 and&#xD;
      4, familiarization trials will be completed to standardize training loads and to reduce any&#xD;
      potential learning effect. These visits will be implemented in the heat. On day 7,&#xD;
      participants will complete the first experimental trial described in detail below.&#xD;
      Afterwards, participants will enter a seven day washout period 167 before crossing over to&#xD;
      the second supplemental condition on day 14. On days 16 and 18, participants will undergo the&#xD;
      same familiarization trials as they did on days 2 and 4. On day 21, participants will&#xD;
      complete their second experimental trial. Each experimental trial will be separated by 14&#xD;
      days. This study will be approved by the Florida State University Insitutional Review Board&#xD;
      (Appendix B).&#xD;

      Initial Visit Participants will be asked to come into the ISSM in the morning, following an&#xD;
      overnight fast (7-9 hr) having abstained from caffeine for the previous 12 hours, and having&#xD;
      abstained from alcohol and exercise for the previous 24 hr. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      consume 6 ml·kg-1 water 60 minutes prior to arrival. Following the signing of the informed&#xD;
      consent document, participants will be asked to change into athletic clothing. Thereafter,&#xD;
      with shoes removed, participants' height will be assessed to the nearest cm via a&#xD;
      wall-mounted scale (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Participants will be weighed to the nearest 0.1&#xD;
      kg via an automated scale (Detecto® 750, Webb City, MO). Body composition will then be&#xD;
      assessed via Bod Pod (Cosmed, Chicago, IL). Participants will be asked to rest quietly in a&#xD;
      supine position for 5 minutes, before blood pressure will be measured via auscultation and&#xD;
      sphygmomanometry (Grainger, Lake Forest, Illinois). While still in a supine position, fluid&#xD;
      compartments will be measured via bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) (ImpediMed SFB7,&#xD;
      ImpediMed Limited, Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these baseline measurements, participants will be asked to wear a heart rate&#xD;
      monitor then complete a self-determined 5-min warm-up on an electronically-braked cycle&#xD;
      ergometer (Velotron, SRAM, Spearfish, SD). Immediately after the warm-up, participants will&#xD;
      be fitted with a metabolic mask (TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Cart, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah) then&#xD;
      commence an incremental exercise test to exhaustion. The incremental test will consist of&#xD;
      3-min stages in which the resistance will begin at a relative intensity of 2 W·kg-1 and&#xD;
      increase in 25 W increments until RER is greater than 1.0. At this point, the test will&#xD;
      switch to 1-min stages with resistance increasing in 10 W increments until volitional&#xD;
      exhaustion. A similar protocol is described elsewhere 223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Afterwards, participants will be provided with their blinded supplement and instructed to&#xD;
      consume 50 mg·kg-1 twice daily (~12 hr apart) with 6 ml·kg-1 water each time, for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarization Trials The familiarization trials will occur the first week of&#xD;
      supplementation on days 2 and 4, and the second week of supplementation on days 16 and 18. On&#xD;
      familiarization days, participants will be asked to arrive at the Sandels building in the&#xD;
      morning in a euhydrated state, having consumed 6 ml·kg-1 water 60 minutes prior to arrival.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be asked to arrive following an overnight fast (7-9 hr)&#xD;
      having abstained from caffeine for the previous 12 hours, and having abstained from alcohol&#xD;
      and exercise for the previous 24 hr. Upon arrival, the participant will be fitted with a&#xD;
      heart rate monitor (Polar® FT4M, Sempele, Finland). Participants will enter the chamber (33°&#xD;
      C, 35% RH), be fitted with a metabolic mask (TrueOne 2400 Metabolic Cart, ParvoMedics, Sandy,&#xD;
      Utah) and cycle for 30 min at 70% VO2 peak. After a 5 min active recovery period, self-paced&#xD;
      pedaling against 50 W, participants will perform four 12 s maximal effort sprints against&#xD;
      5.5% of their body mass, followed by one 30 s maximal effort sprint against 5.5% of their&#xD;
      body mass. Participants will perform 2.5 min active recovery (self-paced pedaling against 50&#xD;
      W) between sprints. Participants will then exit the chamber and be allowed to drink ad&#xD;
      libitum in a resting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Trials This section provides an overview of the experimental trials, with&#xD;
      greater detail provided in the appropriate sections below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental trials will occur after the first week of supplementation on day 7, and the&#xD;
      second week of supplementation on day 21. The participants will be asked to ingest a CorTemp&#xD;
      Sensor (HQInc, Palmetto, FL) 10-12 hr before arrival. Participants will be asked to arrive at&#xD;
      the Sandels building in the morning in a euhydrated state, having consumed 6 ml·kg-1 water 60&#xD;
      minutes prior to arrival. Additionally, participants will be asked to arrive following an&#xD;
      overnight fast (7-9 hr) having abstained from caffeine for the previous 12 hours, and having&#xD;
      abstained from alcohol and exercise for the previous 24 hr. Participants will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a urine sample to confirm hydration status. A urine specific gravity (USG)&#xD;
      measurement of &gt;1.020 will be considered dehydrated, whereas a USG measurement of &lt;1.020 will&#xD;
      be considered euhydrated 124-126. If the participant is considered dehydrated upon arrival,&#xD;
      they will be provided with 6 mL·kg-1 water and the experimental trial will be pushed back&#xD;
      another 30 minutes. Additionally, hydration status will be measured via changes in pre- to&#xD;
      post-exercise body mass. Participants, in a private room, will be asked to towel dry and&#xD;
      provide a nude body weight while resting pre-exercise, and again after the 60 min bout of&#xD;
      exercise. Prior to exercise, participants will be asked to rest quietly in a supine position&#xD;
      for 5 minutes, before blood pressure will be measured via auscultation and sphygmomanometry&#xD;
      (Grainger, Lake Forest, Illinois). While still in a supine position, fluid compartments will&#xD;
      be measured via bioelectric impedance spectroscopy (BIS) (ImpediMed SFB7, ImpediMed Limited,&#xD;
      Australia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be fitted with iButtons (iButton DS1921G-F5, Maxim Integrated, San&#xD;
      Jose, CA, USA) to estimate whole body skin temperature from 7 standardized locations on the&#xD;
      body. Specifically, the investigators will use the abdomen (site A), inferior angle of the&#xD;
      left scapula (site B), left posterior forearm (site C), dorsal side of the left hand (site&#xD;
      D), left anterior thigh (site E), posterior side of the lower leg (site F), and left mid-foot&#xD;
      (site G) 224. Then, participants will be seated in an upright position and fitted with a&#xD;
      heart rate monitor (Polar® FT4M, Sempele, Finland) and metabolic mask (TrueOne 2400 Metabolic&#xD;
      Cart, ParvoMedics, Sandy, Utah). Baseline measures of core temperature, skin temperature,&#xD;
      heart rate, gas exchange, and blood will be sampled at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following baseline measurements, participants will enter the chamber (33° C, 35% RH) and&#xD;
      complete a workload corresponding to 70% VO2 peak for 60 min. Immediately following the&#xD;
      steady state exercise bout, participants will have a 5 min rest period to collect a blood&#xD;
      sample and nude body weight. Afterwards, participants will perform four 12 s maximal effort&#xD;
      sprints against 5.5% of their body mass, followed by one 30 s maximal effort sprint against&#xD;
      5.5% of their body mass. Participants will perform 2.5 min active recovery (self-paced&#xD;
      pedaling against 50 W) between sprints. Participants will then exit the chamber and be&#xD;
      allowed to drink ad libitum in a resting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental Chamber Ambient Temperature Ambient temperature and humidity will be controlled&#xD;
      via the environmental chamber and will be secondarily confirmed (Vantage Vue Weather Station,&#xD;
      Davis Instruments, Hayward, California) in 10 min increments throughout experimental visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of Diet and Training Prior to each familiarization and experimental visit,&#xD;
      participants will be asked to maintain consistent dietary and exercise habits for 2 days.&#xD;
      Additionally, for both days leading up to experimental trials, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      exactly replicate their dietary intake from week to week. To ensure compliance, participants&#xD;
      will be asked to complete a 48-hr dietary intake form (Appendix C) and a 48-hr exercise log&#xD;
      (Appendix D) for the days preceding the experimental trial. Finally, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to abstain from caffeine for the previous 12 hours, and abstain from alcohol and&#xD;
      exercise for the previous 24 hr.&#xD;
