  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial investigates how well radiation therapy, plasma exchange, and&#xD;
      pembrolizumab or nivolumab work in treating patients with melanoma. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Plasma exchange (also known as&#xD;
      &quot;plasmapheresis&quot;) is a way to &quot;clean&quot; or &quot;flush out&quot; the blood. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Plasma exchange&#xD;
      may help to improve the effect of standard radiation therapy and immunotherapy treatment on&#xD;
      tumor cells of patients with melanoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the kinetics of soluble (s)PD-L1 removal and regeneration by plasma exchange&#xD;
      in patients with melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe response at 3 months after plasma exchange plus immunotherapy. II. To observe&#xD;
      ongoing response at approximate 3 month intervals after plasma exchange plus immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effects of plasma exchange on immune cell function. II. To observe the&#xD;
      kinetics of extracellular vesicles (EVs) after plasma exchange in patients with melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiation therapy daily on days 1-5 (weekdays). Patients then undergo&#xD;
      therapeutic plasma exchange over 1-2 hours on days 4-6 or 5-7. Beginning on day 7, patients&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) or nivolumab IV. Treatment with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      continues every 3 weeks or treatment with nivolumab continues every 2 weeks in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 weeks and then for up to 2&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
