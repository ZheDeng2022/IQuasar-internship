  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective Phase II multi-center study with an upfront 16-week, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled period, and extension periods, to assess the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and pharmacokinetics of alpelisib in pediatric and adult participants with&#xD;
      PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of a screening period of up to 42 days, core period of 24 weeks,&#xD;
      extension period of 23 weeks and long-term extension period of up to approximately 4 years.&#xD;
      The study will enroll adult participants (Group 1), 6-17 years old pediatric participants&#xD;
      (Group 2), and an exploratory set of 2-5 years old pediatric participants (Group 3). At study&#xD;
      start, only the participants of Group 1 and Group 2 will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants aged ≥6 years old will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to alpelisib or&#xD;
      matching placebo. Both age groups will be enrolled in the study in parallel. In the core&#xD;
      period, participants will receive treatment in blinded fashion, with an upfront 16-week&#xD;
      placebo-controlled period. After Week 16 those participants who were randomized to receive&#xD;
      placebo will be switched to active treatment with alpelisib. Those participants who were&#xD;
      randomized to receive alpelisib will continue their active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 will be enrolled later, after 24-week efficacy, safety and PK data are available from&#xD;
      the first two age groups, in order to select the recommended dose for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned duration of alpelisib treatment in the study will be up to 5 years after&#xD;
      randomization for all age groups. Participant may be discontinued from treatment with&#xD;
      alpelisib earlier due to unacceptable toxicity, confirmed disease progression, death, and/or&#xD;
      any other reason at the discretion of the investigator or the participant.&#xD;
