  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill children treated with invasive mechanical ventilation (iMV) in a paediatric&#xD;
      intensive care unit (PICU) may suffer from complications leading to prolonged duration of&#xD;
      ventilation and PICU stay. Prolonged ventilation is associated with haemodynamic dysfunction,&#xD;
      neuromuscular insufficiency, malnutrition, metabolic disorders and diaphragmatic muscle&#xD;
      weakness. Evidence from adult critical care supports the existence of ventilator induced&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction, defined as a iMV-induced loss of diaphragmatic force - generating&#xD;
      capacity - characterised by muscle fibre atrophy, myofibril necrosis and disorganization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragm function or contractility can be assessed by measuring the diaphragm thickening&#xD;
      during inspiration and expiration with ultrasound and is expressed as a thickening fraction&#xD;
      (TF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A low diaphragm contractile activity in adults has been associated with rapid decreases in&#xD;
      diaphragm thickness, whereas high contractile activity has been associated with increases in&#xD;
      diaphragm thickness. Contractile activity decreased with increasing ventilator driving&#xD;
      pressure and controlled ventilator mode. Maximal thickening fraction (a measure of diaphragm&#xD;
      function) was lower in patients with decreased as well as increased diaphragm thickness than&#xD;
      in patients with unchanged thickness (p=0.05). Titrating ventilatory support to maintain&#xD;
      normal levels of inspiratory effort may prevent changes in diaphragm configuration associated&#xD;
      with iMV, but more research is needed to confirm this supposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one study has shown the presence of diaphragm atrophy in critically ill children on iMV&#xD;
      for acute respiratory failure. The diaphragm contractility, measured as thickening fraction,&#xD;
      was strongly correlated with a spontaneous breathing fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norm data for diaphragmatic thickness and TF in children are only available for healthy&#xD;
      neonates (n=15) and children (n=48) from 8 till 20 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine values of normal diaphragm thickness and TF in&#xD;
      children aged 0-8 years by ultrasound. This age range reflects the largest patient group&#xD;
      treated in the PICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once these values are known, the clinical relevance of the measuring of the diaphragm&#xD;
      thickness of ventilated children by ultrasound can be further studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine diaphragm thickness and thickening fraction in healthy&#xD;
      children below or equal to 8 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To determine the interrater reliability of operators performing the&#xD;
      ultra-sound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      prospective, cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy children in four age groups: 0-6 months; 6 months-1 year; 2-4 years; and 5-8 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited in two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1. Parents of children scheduled to undergo a daycare procedure will asked permission&#xD;
      for their child to join the study. These children undergo a minor procedure and are assumed&#xD;
      to have a normal diaphragm; therefore are considered 'healthy''.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2. Health professionals working on the PICU or other departments of Erasmus MC-Sophia&#xD;
      as well as family, friends and neighbours of members of the research group will be asked to&#xD;
      recruit 'healthy' children. The investigators will recruit participants by means of brochures&#xD;
      in which children and/or caregivers are invited to contact the researchers when interested to&#xD;
      participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary study parameters/outcome of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine diaphragm thickness and thickening fraction in healthy children below or equal&#xD;
      to 8 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study parameters/outcome of the study (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the interrater reliability of operators performing the ultra-sound&#xD;
