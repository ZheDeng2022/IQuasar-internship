    <textblock>
      This research will constitute a 3-year follow-up that includes a re-evaluation and&#xD;
      re-intervention of overweight or obese adults suffering from hypertension, who already&#xD;
      participated in a similar programme with the same objectives 3 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the Hypertension Unit of a public hospital and assigned to a&#xD;
      experimental group. The evaluation will include: eating behaviour, body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      physical activity levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension incidence and overweight or obesity related, constitute a worrying public health&#xD;
      problem nowadays. Evidence indicates that, despite the existence of several factors involved&#xD;
      in their etiology, diet and physical activity play a particularly important role in the&#xD;
      treatment and prevention of obesity and associated disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, interventions for the treatment of obesity encounter some environmental and personal&#xD;
      barriers, specifically problems or deficits in motivation. These barriers sometimes make it&#xD;
      difficult to implement intervention strategies. In this sense, there is an important&#xD;
      agreement about the need to generate alternatives and strategies which promote intrinsic&#xD;
      motivation, self-regulation and self-efficacy as fundamental variables which have a direct&#xD;
      relationship with the adherence and success of obesity treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are a very promising&#xD;
      alternative, as they can provide personalised feedback and can be flexibly adapted to each&#xD;
      user. In addition, ICTs also present other important advantages, especially their excellent&#xD;
      cost-benefit ratio, and the possibility of increasing the efficiency of the interventions,&#xD;
      since they allow to reach a greater number of users at a lower cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will constitute a 3-year follow-up that includes a re-evaluation and&#xD;
      re-intervention of overweight or obese adults suffering from hypertension, who already&#xD;
      participated in a similar programme with the same objectives 3 years ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited in the Hypertension Unit of a public hospital and assigned to a&#xD;
      experimental group. The evaluation will include: eating behaviour, body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      physical activity levels.&#xD;

    <description>Eating Behaviour will be measured with the DEBQ (Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire). DEBQ evaluates eating behaviour that may contribute to or mitigate the development of overweight. It consists of 33 items, with a 5-point Likert scale, which 89 evaluate three eating styles. The Emotional Eating Scale has 13 items (e.g. &quot;Do you have a desire to eat when you are angry?&quot;), the External Eating Scale has 10 items (e.g. &quot;Do you eat more than usual when you see others eating?&quot;), and the Restrictive Eating Scale has 10 items (e.g. &quot;Do you eat less deliberately so that you don't gain weight?&quot;).</description>
