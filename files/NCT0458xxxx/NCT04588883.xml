  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to use a group-based microfinance/internal lending model to develop social&#xD;
      capital among people with HIV in Kenya. This will create a context to deliver validated&#xD;
      curriculum targeting intimate partner violence, positive parenting, agriculture, small&#xD;
      business entrepreneurship, group-interpersonal therapy, and other determinants of well-being&#xD;
      and ART adherence among people with HIV. The primary outcomes are viral suppression, ART&#xD;
      adherence, and common mental disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that involvement in an internal savings and lending program will create&#xD;
      social capital among people with HIV and their guardians (in case of adolescents w HIV). This&#xD;
      social capital accrual will be leveraged to support and disseminate social skills (i.e.&#xD;
      positive parenting, conflict resolution), economic skills (i.e. entrepreneurship, farming),&#xD;
      and health skills (i.e. ART adherence, retention in care to produce viral suppression). The&#xD;
      overall outcome is improved social, health, and economic well-being.&#xD;

    <description>Patients, adults and adolescents, will be recruited from patient registries at 7 government operated HIV clinics in Meru County, Kenya. Patients will complete validated questionnaires at baseline, 1.5 year and 3 years into a novel adaptation of a community empowerment program. The program utilizes savings- and internal-lending/group-based microfinance process to facilitate exchange of savings amongst patients and adolescent guardians. A byproduct of this process is the development of social capital, which will be used to facilitate education, peer learning, and collective problem solving to improve determinants of well-being and clinical adherence among participants. Expected outcomes include improved viral suppression, ART adherence, clinical attendance, and mental health.</description>
