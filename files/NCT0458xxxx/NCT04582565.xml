  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Axillary lymph nodes are the main site of metastasis in breast cancer. If positive axillary&#xD;
      lymph nodes are present, an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is usually performed. This&#xD;
      procedure improves disease-free survival but comes with the risk of lymphoedema as a result&#xD;
      of disrupted lymphatic channels. Breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) is associated with&#xD;
      considerable morbidity, which is why proven measures to reduce its incidence would improve&#xD;
      patient outcomes. We aimed to investigate whether a regime of manual lymphatic drainage and&#xD;
      exercise, supervised by a manual lymphatic drainage therapist compared to standard care would&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphoedema in patients undergoing ALND.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients were those in whom a primary operable breast cancer is diagnosed and in&#xD;
      whom surgery is planned to include ALND. Patients with recurrent carcinoma, previous axillary&#xD;
      surgery/radiotherapy or any previous arm/axillary pathology leading to arm volume changes&#xD;
      will be excluded. Eligible participants will be identified at the breast multidisciplinary&#xD;
      meeting and will be informed of the study and given a written information sheet. Patients who&#xD;
      choose to participate will be asked to fill in a written consent form. Patients allocated to&#xD;
      the decongestive lymphatic therapy group will undergo intervention for a total period of 3&#xD;
      months. This will consist of 2 visits to a qualified practitioner in Dr Vodder manual&#xD;
      lymphatic drainage therapist, one at the start of the 3-month period and again 6 weeks later.&#xD;
      Patients in both groups will also be instructed to perform self-MLD on a daily basis and will&#xD;
      be taught a series of exercises to be performed on a daily basis. Compression hosiery will be&#xD;
      fitted to be worn during the exercises.&#xD;
