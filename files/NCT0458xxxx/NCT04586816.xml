  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research has reported that the maple leaf extract exhibits anti-aging effects by&#xD;
      inhibiting elastase activity, thereby preventing the breakdown of elastin and interfering&#xD;
      with the formation of wrinkles. Red maple leaf extract contains phenolic compounds known as&#xD;
      glucitol-core-containing gallotannins (GCGs) which help reduce the appearance of wrinkles and&#xD;
      may decrease skin inflammation, dark spots and pigmentation. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to examine the effects of topical Maplifa on the cosmetic appearance of facial lines, redness&#xD;
      and skin tone.&#xD;
