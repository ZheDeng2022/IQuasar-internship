    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the compliance of patients who suffer from a diabetic foot wound to&#xD;
      follow a physical activity program, adapted to their medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will aslo evaluate the security of this program, and how it could improve or not&#xD;
      the quality of life, the diabet's metabolical balance, and the wounds's cicatrization speed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective monocentric study, leaded in the Lille CHRU. this study is a&#xD;
      physical activity program feasibility assessment for patients with diabetic foot wounds. The&#xD;
      muscular mass stabilization and the physical activity is almost never used to heal diabetic&#xD;
      feet wounds. With this study, we evaluate the compliance of patients to follow a physical&#xD;
      activity program, which could lead to a further study, with more patients and multicentric,&#xD;
      and it could measure the impact of this program on metabolical balance, wound size and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last 6 months, the inclusion will last 3 months, and each patient will have a&#xD;
      3 months follow-up time. The patient have several medical appointments in the diabetic foot&#xD;
      unit, where the compliance will be evaluated, wound size and security will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The activity program is a suite of exercises, 4 times in a week, it lasts 30 minutes?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first day, follow-up book is given to the patient. During the follow-up, the patient will&#xD;
      still have his usual medical appointments, which will occur at the 30th, 60th and 90th days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone-call appointments will also be possible at the 15th and 45th days.&#xD;
