  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the effect of ultrasound-guided erector spinae plane block and&#xD;
      interthoracic intercostal nerve block in thoracic surgery. Interthoracic intercostal nerve&#xD;
      block is a routine procedure during the surgery by the surgeon in our hospital, and&#xD;
      ultrasound-guide erector spinae plane block is a relative new developed regional analgesia&#xD;
      technique introduced since 2016 and mainly done by anesthesiologists. Both technique provide&#xD;
      analgesic effect to some extent and reduce opiate consumption and side effects. However, no&#xD;
      previous literature or research compare the effect of these two technique in thoracic&#xD;
      surgery. The primary endpoint of our study is compare morphine consumption and pain score&#xD;
      between patients undergo ESP block and patients undergo ICNB after thoracic surgery; the&#xD;
      second endpoint is to compare the recovery condition evaluated by QoR-15 questionaire 24&#xD;
      hours after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sample size estimation is based on our APS team data, in which the average cumulative&#xD;
      morphine consumption in patients underwent VATS surgery with ICNB was calculated. The mean&#xD;
      cumulative morphine consumption was 15±8 mg of patients underwent VATS with ICNB. We assume&#xD;
      the difference between ICNB and ESPB group reach 5 mg and aim for a power of 95 % and a risk&#xD;
      of 0.05 for a type-1 error, at least 42 for each group needing to be recruited. 50 patients&#xD;
      for each group, total 100 patients will be collected to avoid dropouts. Patient will be&#xD;
      allocated to one of the trial groups using a computer-generated random number table once the&#xD;
      consent was approved. First group is ICNB group and the second group is ESPB group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The general anesthesia agents, induction process and routine care are the same for both&#xD;
      groups. Once aforementioned routine cares are done, the patient will be turn into lateral&#xD;
      decubitus position. Echo-guided ESP block will be performed after patients are turned into&#xD;
      lateral decubitus position in ESP group; on the other side, local anesthetics will be&#xD;
      injected at incision site and intrathoracic intercostal nerve block will be performed in ICNB&#xD;
      group right after the surgeon makes the incision site and get into chest cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain score (VAS) and cumulative morphine consumption will be recorded in PACU, postoperative&#xD;
      24H, 48H, and before discharge. Recovery condition will be evaluated via QoR-15 questionnaire&#xD;
      in postoperative 24H, furthermore, we will follow up the patient's pain and recovery status 3&#xD;
      months after the operation. After collecting above data, the effect of ESP group and ICNB&#xD;
      group on acute pain relieve, chronic pain control and recovery enhancement will be evaluated.&#xD;
