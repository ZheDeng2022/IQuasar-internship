  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 12-month prospective, open-label, non-masked, two arm randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing intermittently-viewed continuous glucose monitoring (iCGM) in addition to lifestyle&#xD;
      modification programme (LMP) as compared with a LMP alone in individulas with impaired&#xD;
      glucose tolerance (IGT). Following informed consent, participants will undergo screening&#xD;
      where a fasting glucose, 75g OGTT, HbA1c, fasting lipid profile along with comprehensive&#xD;
      medical and drug history to confirm eligibility. At week 0, participants will be randomised&#xD;
      to CGM plus LMP versus LMP alone. Both groups will receive individualized structured LMP&#xD;
      programme delivered by a dietitian and a fitness instructor. Outcomes will be evaluated by&#xD;
      laboratory tests, physical measurement, physical activity and dietary compliance and&#xD;
      questionnaires at Month 0, 4, 8, 12.&#xD;

             results may interfere with study compliance, diagnostic results, or data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
