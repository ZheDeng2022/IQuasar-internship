      Objective: To compare the temporal muscle activation between females with PF OA and normal&#xD;
      controls during stair ascent. Methods: An observational comparative study was conducted with&#xD;
      thirty-one females with PF OA and 11 healthy ones. The onset times of multifidus, transversus&#xD;
      abdominus (TrA), gluteus medius (GM), and vasti muscles were measured by quantitative&#xD;
      Electromyography during stair ascent task. hypothesis: Investigators hypothesized that there&#xD;
      won't be a significant difference between females with PF OA and their matched healthy group&#xD;
      regarding the onset times of vastus medialis obliqus (VMO), vastus lateralis (VL), gluteus&#xD;
      medius (GM), multifidus, and transversus abdominus (TrA), during stair ascent task.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators collected the EMG activity of VMO, VL, GM, multifidus, and TrA using bipolar&#xD;
      Ag-AgCl disposable surface electrodes (Better signal solution medical supply Co., limited,&#xD;
      Zhongshan, China) and eight channels high-resolution wireless bio amplifier (WBA) system&#xD;
      (Biomation, Almonte, Canada). Electromyographic data were sampled at 1000 Hz and bandpass&#xD;
      filtered at 50-200 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each muscle, three electrodes were used; two electrodes were placed ~ 30 mm apart in the&#xD;
      direction of the muscle fibers and a ground electrode was placed over the closest bony&#xD;
      prominence. Before placement of the electrodes, the subject's skin was cleaned with alcohol&#xD;
      to reduce impedance and excess hair was removed to eliminate shifting of the electrodes if&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stair-stepping task consisted of ascending 2 steps (each step was 40 cm in width, 20 cm&#xD;
      in height, without handrails. The depth of the first and second steps was 30 cm and 40 cm,&#xD;
      respectively) . Participants were asked to stand on the floor confronting the stairs and 20&#xD;
      cm away from the edge of the initial step. The stair ascent task was performed barefooted&#xD;
      while arms hanged at the side of the body. Patients started ascending the steps immediately&#xD;
      in response to a command, at their normal speed with their affected limb. Investigators&#xD;
      didn't control the speed of stair ascent, because controlling the timing of stair-stepping&#xD;
      can alter the electromyographic signal as shown earlier for gait in asymptomatic subjects.&#xD;
      Healthy subjects started ascending stairs with their dominant limb .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before data acquisition, participants performed one practice trial of stair ascent to get&#xD;
      familiarized with the task. Then the participants performed three test trials with thirty&#xD;
      seconds of rest after each trial to prevent fatigue. The raw data were stored on a personal&#xD;
      computer for analysis with a custom program in Matlab (Math Works, Natick, Massachusetts,&#xD;
      USA). Investigators used a mean of data in three trials for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management and analysis were conducted using the statistical package for social studies&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 22 for windows (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Normal distribution of the data&#xD;
      was tested using the Shapiro-Wilk test. The homogeneity of variances between groups was&#xD;
      examined using Levene's test. Descriptive data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation. An&#xD;
      independent t-test was conducted for comparison of subject characteristics; age, body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), weight and height, between both groups. A univariate test of one way MANOVA was&#xD;
      performed to compare EMG onset of each muscle between both groups. Post-hoc analysis using&#xD;
      the Bonferroni method was carried out for subsequent multiple comparison. The level of&#xD;
      significance for all statistical tests was set at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
