    <textblock>
      Clinical investigation of a medical device (CAVA) for recording eye movements. Forty&#xD;
      volunteers will sleep in a specially designed sleep lab for one or two nights, depending on&#xD;
      whether they are enrolled onto phase 1 (two nights) or phase 2 (one night) of the study. Each&#xD;
      volunteer will wear the CAVA device along with a Polysomnography (PSG) device, which is the&#xD;
      gold standard for monitoring sleep. The twenty participants in phase 2 will simultaneously&#xD;
      wear a commercially available consumer device for monitoring sleep. The eye movement data&#xD;
      captured using CAVA will be processed by novel computer algorithms to classify the sleep&#xD;
      stages in the data into Rapid Eye Movement (REM), non-REM and awake. The results will be&#xD;
      compared with the ground-truth from the gold standard, and also compared to the results from&#xD;
      the commercially available device. The aim of the study is to determine whether CAVA could be&#xD;
      a viable and competitive home-monitoring device for analysing sleep.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US has declared insufficient&#xD;
      sleep a 'public health problem' [1]. Over 35% of adults in the United Kingdom (UK) sleep less&#xD;
      than 7 hours and 16% sleep less than 6 hours per night and the proportion of people getting&#xD;
      less than the recommended hours of sleep is rising (Liu et al., 2014). This is alarming as&#xD;
      insufficient sleep can lead to increased mortality, accidents, and mistakes at work and is&#xD;
      also linked with many chronic conditions-such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease,&#xD;
      depression and neurodegeneration -that threaten the wellbeing of an increasing number of&#xD;
      people across the globe. On an annual basis, the UK loses an estimated 207,000 working days&#xD;
      due to insufficient sleep (mainly related to absenteeism) and the estimated economic cost of&#xD;
      insufficient sleep in the UK is over 50 billion dollars, that is 1.86 % of the national Gross&#xD;
      Domestic Product (GDP) [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection of sleep problems is imperative for prevention of this process, however it is&#xD;
      hindered by current technology, where the gold standard is represented by a laborious and&#xD;
      expensive method called polysomnography (PSG). Therefore, the need for innovative&#xD;
      technologies allowing the reliable monitoring of sleep behaviour in the home-environment&#xD;
      using non-invasive, user friendly and broadly accessible methods is immense. This study aims&#xD;
      to assess the suitability of the CAVA device (Continuous Ambulatory Vestibular Assessment)&#xD;
      that was originally developed by Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) clinicians&#xD;
      and University of East Anglia (UEA scientists to monitor dizziness, for the purpose of&#xD;
      diagnosing sleep conditions. The CAVA device is designed to record head and eye-movements&#xD;
      continuously over several weeks. Such signals are known to be useful for sleep state&#xD;
      diagnosis, and the preliminary analyses show that the data collected by the CAVA device&#xD;
      clearly delineate sleep and wake episodes so it is therefore plausible that the CAVA device&#xD;
      can be used for home-based sleep monitoring. The investigators term this new application&#xD;
      sCAVA. The objective of the proposed study is to re-purpose the CAVA device as a reliable and&#xD;
      broadly accessible sleep monitoring tool by developing, testing and validating algorithms to&#xD;
      interpret sCAVA data for sleep monitoring purposes.&#xD;
