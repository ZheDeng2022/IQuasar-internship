      Study design A Phase I, single-center, open-label, fixed-sequence study is designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of multiple-dose Itraconazole or Rifampicin Capsules on the single-dose&#xD;
      PK profiles of IMP4297 Capsules in healthy Chinese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      32 subjects are planned to be enrolled (at least 12 subjects complete the study on one side).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two parallel groups will be planned in this study with 16 subjects enrolled in each group.&#xD;
      Two cycles are set for each group. The first group will be given IMP4297 and Itraconazole in&#xD;
      a fixed sequence (two dosing regimens); The second group will receive IMP4297 and Rifampicin&#xD;
      in a fixed sequence (two dosing regimens).&#xD;

             biochemistry, urinalysis) indicate abnormal results with clinical significance&#xD;
             according to the investigator. The reference normal range of vital signs (including&#xD;
             the cut-off value) is as follows: Sitting systolic blood pressure is 90 to 139 mmHg,&#xD;
             diastolic blood pressure is 60 to 89 mmHg, pulse is 50 to 100 bmp, body temperature&#xD;
             (frontal temperature) is 36.0 to 37.0°C. The specific situation is comprehensively&#xD;
             determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. At screening after a quiet rest for at least 10 min, the corrected QT interval&#xD;
             (corrected by Fridericia's formula, QTcF = QT/RR1/3) &gt; 450 msec or QRS complex &gt; 120&#xD;
             msec was obtained by 12-lead ECG in supine position. If QTcF is more than 450 msec or&#xD;
             QRS is more than 120 msec, 12-lead ECG measurement should be repeated twice, and the&#xD;
             average value of QTcF or QRS measured three times is judged by the investigator as&#xD;
             abnormality with clinical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subjects who are allergic to IMP4297, Itraconazole, Rifampicin, or to any ingredients&#xD;
             of these preparations.&#xD;

             investigational drug and during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Subjects who consumed any food or beverages containing alcohol, caffeine, chocolate,&#xD;
             or rich in xanthine within 48 hours before the first dose of the investigational drug;&#xD;
             or those who cannot abstain from these products during the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Subjects who cannot abstain from grapefruit or grapefruit-related citrus (eg, pomelo)&#xD;
             or juice within 7 days before the first dose of investigational drug and during the&#xD;
             trial;&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Subjects or its partners who have birth plan, or are unwilling to adopt effective&#xD;
             contraception methods (Annex 2), or have sperm donation plan throughout the trial and&#xD;
             within 180 days after the last dose of the investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Subjects who are unwilling or unable to follow the lifestyle guidelines described in&#xD;
             the study protocol (such as dietary restrictions and activity requirements).&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Subjects who have other acute or chronic medical or psychiatric diseases, which may&#xD;
             increase the risks of participating in this trial, or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of the trial results, will be judged unsuitable to participate in this&#xD;
             trial by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Subjects judged by the investigator to be unsuitable for participation in the trial.&#xD;
