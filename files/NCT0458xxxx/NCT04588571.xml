    <textblock>
      Endovascular revascularization and open bypass grafting above the knee show comparable&#xD;
      results in primary 2-year patency (about 65%) in medium-length lesions - TASC II, C (Pereira&#xD;
      et al, 2006). At the same time, a recent study, where the authors studied the effectiveness&#xD;
      of stenting of long lesions (200 mm or more) of the chronic occlusions of the femoropopliteal&#xD;
      segments (TASC II, D), showed unsatisfactory results (primary patency 45%) of the stented&#xD;
      segment within 2 years (Lin et al, 2015). One of the possible solutions to the problem of&#xD;
      breakage of stents in the femoral-popliteal position is a modified method of their&#xD;
      manufacture by braiding from nitinol wire. Some studies with intervowen nitinol stents did&#xD;
      show their resistance to breakage in this position. Moreover, the primary patency was &gt; 70%.&#xD;
      (Werner et al, 2014). These data suggest a better primary patency rate within 2 years with a&#xD;
      longer lesion length (&gt;200 mm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label study. The main objective of the study is to&#xD;
      compare the clinical efficacy and safety of two therapies for the treatment of prolonged&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment above the knee, TASC&#xD;
      II type D - femoropopliteal proximal shunting and recanalization with angioplasty and&#xD;
      stenting using biomimetic interwoven nitinol stent in patients with symptomatic peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease at 24 months. Secondary objectives are to identify predictors of restenosis&#xD;
      and occlusions of the operating segment and compare the quality of life of patients after the&#xD;
      procedure. It is planned to recruit 110 patients (55 patients in each group). Observation&#xD;
      period 2 years. Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The effectiveness of the method of surgical treatment after 24 months (primary patency,&#xD;
      primary-assisted patency, secondary patency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical efficacy of the method of surgical treatment after 24 months (MALE);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety of the method of surgical treatment in the early postoperative period (hematoma&#xD;
           of the surgical access area, peripheral neuropathy, purulent-infectious complications of&#xD;
           the surgical access area) and after 24 months (MACE);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the quality of life in patients after surgical treatment at 6, 12, and 24&#xD;

      Endovascular revascularization and open bypass grafting above the knee show comparable&#xD;
      results in primary 2-year patency (about 65%) in medium-length lesions - TASC II, C (Pereira&#xD;
      et al, 2006). At the same time, a recent study, where the authors studied the effectiveness&#xD;
      of stenting of long lesions (200 mm or more) of the chronic occlusions of the femoropopliteal&#xD;
      segments (TASC II, D), showed unsatisfactory results (primary patency 45%) of the stented&#xD;

      breakage of stents in the femoral-popliteal position is a modified method of their&#xD;
      manufacture by braiding from nitinol wire. Some studies with interwoven nitinol stents did&#xD;
      show their resistance to breakage in this position. Moreover, the primary patency was &gt; 70%.&#xD;
      (Werner et al, 2014). These data suggest a better primary patency rate within 2 years with a&#xD;

&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label study. The main objective of the study is to&#xD;
      compare the clinical efficacy and safety of two therapies for the treatment of prolonged&#xD;
      atherosclerotic lesions of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment above the knee, TASC&#xD;
      II type D - femoropopliteal proximal shunting and recanalization with angioplasty and&#xD;
      stenting using biomimetic interwoven nitinol stent in patients with symptomatic peripheral&#xD;
      arterial disease at 24 months. Secondary objectives are to identify predictors of restenosis&#xD;
      and occlusions of the operating segment and compare the quality of life of patients after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of literature data showed, that two-year primary patency after endovascular&#xD;
      revascularization using a nitinol stent in long lesions was 60%. At the same time, the&#xD;
      two-year primary patency after the femoropopliteal proximal bypass was 56% (Enzmann et al.&#xD;
      Nitinol stent versus bypass in long femoropopliteal lesions: 2-year results of a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions. 2019 Dec 23; 12 (24): 2541-9.).&#xD;
      Considering these data, it should be assumed that the use of biomimetic interwoven nitinol&#xD;
      stents will slightly improve the primary patency parameters within 2 years in the stenting&#xD;
      group. The 2-year primary patency after stenting of the femoropopliteal segment with an&#xD;
      interwoven nitinol stent was 76% (Scheinert et al., 2011). A power analysis was performed to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size of the &quot;non-inferiority&quot; design for a study power of 80%, a type 1&#xD;
      error probability of 5%, and a non-inferiority margin of 10%. It is planned to recruit 110&#xD;
      patients (55 patients in each group). The observation period of 2 years. Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The effectiveness of the method of surgical treatment after 24 months (primary patency,&#xD;

    <description>Under general anesthesia, 2 standard open surgical approaches are performed: first - to the common femoral artery, superficial femoral artery, and deep femoral artery; the second - to the first portion of the popliteal artery. After systemic heparinization, clamps are applied to the arteries. A longitudinal arteriotomy of the popliteal artery is performed, and a distal end-to-side anastomosis is formed between the artery and the shunt. Next, the shunt is passed into the groin wound. Longitudinal arteriotomy of the common femoral artery. A proximal end-to-side anastomosis is formed between the shunt and the common femoral artery. Surgical hemostasis wound drainage and layer-by-layer wound closure are performed.&#xD;
Drug therapy includes pre-procedure aspirin (160-300 mg/day), starting at least one day before, and intra-procedure heparin (100 U / kg body weight intravenously). After the procedure, all patients have prescribed aspirin (75-100 mg per day) for a long time.</description>
