  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a correlation between the effect of lifestyle and prevalence and severity of primary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea. We will collect data through an online questionnaire. This study is an attempt&#xD;
      to elaborate on and clarify the prevalence and severity of primary dysmenorrhea in Jordan.&#xD;
      This study has already been applied to other target populations therefore the purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to establish solid numbers of dysmenorrhea prevalence in Jordan among the age group&#xD;
      18-25 and to exhibit a clear correlation between the lifestyle habits adopted by individuals&#xD;
      and the intensity of dysmenorrhea present. The lifestyle factors chosen include body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI), smoking, early menarche, prolonged menstrual flow and psychological&#xD;
      disturbances. The significance of forming this relationship is to help raise awareness among&#xD;
      the young generation of Jordanian women to improve on their adopted lifestyle habits in order&#xD;
      to eventually lead to lower numbers of morbidity associated with dysmenorrhea&#xD;
