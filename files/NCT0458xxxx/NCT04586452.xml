  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a degenerative vascular disease, which is typically&#xD;
      asymptomatic until rupture, resulting in high mortality. AAAs are more prevalent in men over&#xD;
      age 65, though rupture is disproportionately higher in women. Due to nonlinear and&#xD;
      unpredictable aortic dilatation, it is challenging to predict the AAA rupture using clinical&#xD;
      diagnostics based on morphology. No medical therapy is used clinically to treat AAA, and&#xD;
      there is an unmet need for clinically translatable, molecular biomarkers of AAA disease&#xD;
      activity for surveillance and patient-specific management. The goal of this proposal is to&#xD;
      develop a new approach for the diagnosis and targeted therapy of AAA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This project addresses the absence of a reliable diagnostic modality and medical therapy to&#xD;
      prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) growth and rupture in patients, leading to high&#xD;
      mortality in those over the age of 65 years old. Due to the pathogenic role of the monocyte&#xD;
      chemoattractant protein-1 / C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (MCP-1/CCR2) axis in AAA, we&#xD;
      propose to study the ability of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET/CT to predict the murine AAA rupture and&#xD;
      serve as a companion diagnostic to assess CCR2 molecular therapy of murine AAA. We will&#xD;
      perform the first-in-patient evaluation of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET/CT to image and detect AAA&#xD;
      inflammation in a preoperative setting and acquire key biological information from AAA&#xD;
      specimens collected at the time of open AAA repair, in order to assess the potential of&#xD;
      64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET in the management of AAA patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical and clinical research demonstrated that monocyte chemotactic protein-1/ chemokine&#xD;
      (C-C motif) receptor 2 (MCP-1/CCR2) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AAAs. This&#xD;
      axis specifically promotes AAA formation and development by mediating the recruitment of&#xD;
      circulating LY6Chigh monocytes and infiltration of macrophages, which leads to the&#xD;
      degradation of elastic and collagen. In AAA mouse models, the genetic depletion or specific&#xD;
      inhibition of CCR2 significantly decreased the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)&#xD;
      and formation of aneurysms, suggesting the potential of CCR2 as a biomarker for AAA imaging&#xD;
      and pre-screening for targeted intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have developed a specific CCR2 binding radiotracer, 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i, for targeted imaging&#xD;
      of CCR2 positive pro-inflammatory monocytes/macrophages, in multiple animal inflammatory&#xD;
      models using positron emission tomography (PET). This investigational PET tracer is being&#xD;
      used under Exploratory IND 137620 for research imaging studies in human subjects. In patients&#xD;
      with inflammatory diseases, 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET revealed specific detection of CCR2+ cells in&#xD;
      inflammatory tissues. In a rat AAA model, 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i PET revealed specific localization&#xD;
      within the aneurysm, as well as sensitive detection of CCR2+ inflammatory cells. Human AAA&#xD;
      specimens demonstrated specific binding of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i to CCR2 by autoradiography. Thus,&#xD;
      we hypothesize that 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i detect CCR2+ cells mediated aneurysmal activity and can&#xD;
      be utilized for AAA molecular imaging. We propose to assess the potential of 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i&#xD;
      as a biomarker for AAA patients imaging.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Perform histopathological evaluation of human AAA specimens and categorize them based on clinical status (e.g, diameter) and degree of inflammation. The investigators will consider healthy, nonatherosclerotic aorta as negative controls, and non-aneurysmal aortas from patients that have undergone surgery for aortoiliac occlusive disease as positive controls. Disease severity will be graded as mild, moderate, and severe based on the degree of VSMC loss and elastic layer disruption (&lt;25%, 25-75%, and &gt;75% compared to normal aorta). The presence of atherosclerotic changes, intraluminal thrombus and degree and location of associated inflammation will be documented.&#xD;
The degree of inflammation will be scored in three tiers: absent/minimal (rare scattered inflammatory cecells), moderate (small clusters of inflammatory cells), and severe (easily identified with scanning magnification).</description>

    <measure>Determine the relationship between 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i binding, regional CCR2 gene expression, cytokine profiles and local matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 years</time_frame>
    <description>Tissue will be collected from patients who undergo surgery and tissue will be collected from a repository at our institution. Investigators will correlate level of MMP expression, activity and cytokine profiles of each specimen, with associated histopathological features. To address the concern of tissue heterogeneity, investigators will perform spatial transcriptomics assays for quantitative measurement of regional CCR2 gene expression on human AAA sections. Since clinical status and aneurysmal anatomic features on preop imaging of each patient is known, investigators will explore correlation of standard of care imaging findings with those from Aim 2A and this sub-aim to determine the role of CCR2 in AAA pathogenesis and its potential as a biomarker for human AAA disease.</description>

We will image AAA patients pre-operatively and collect tissue at the time of open repair in an attempt to demonstrate ex-vivo tissue corroboration of our imaging findings (n=20, 10 women and 10 men).&#xD;
Participants with AAA will undergo routine clinical evaluation including ultrasound, CT scan and scheduling of open surgical repair. We will record age and tobacco use. If a renal function blood test has not been performed within the past 90 days, we will draw ~2 teaspoons of blood for a creatinine test. A contrast dye will be used for the CT portion of the PET-CT scan. Those having open surgery, their PET/CT imaging will be within 7-14 of the surgery and if available, collection of discarded aortic tissue at the time of surgery.</description>

    <description>The objective of this sub-aim is to better understand the relationship between the levels of CCR2+ inflammatory cells and the inflammatory and clinical status of AAA, to gain insight into the importance of proinflammatory monocytes/macrophages in the development of AAA disease at the time of elective AAA repair. We will correlate the level of MMP expression and activity, as well as cytokine profiles, of each specimen, with the associated histopathological features. The relationship between 64Cu-DOTA-ECL1i binding and CCR2 expression in tissues with different degrees of disease severity will be evaluated using Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients. This will allow us to speculate as to how tracer uptake will perform in vivo and what that uptake represents in regard to disease severity.</description>
