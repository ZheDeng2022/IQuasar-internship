  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite high risks of readmission and complex medical needs, there are no transitional care&#xD;
      standards in the U.S. for patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI)&#xD;
      discharged home from acute hospital care without inpatient rehabilitation. To enhance the&#xD;
      standard of TBI care, we will develop and refine a patient- and family-centered TBI&#xD;
      transitional care intervention that addresses specific needs and preferences for patients&#xD;
      with TBI (age &lt; 65 years) and families and will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite high risks of readmission and complex medical needs, there are no transitional care&#xD;
      standards in the U.S. for patients with moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI).&#xD;
      Patients with moderate-to-severe TBI (age &lt; 65 years) discharged home from acute hospital&#xD;
      care without inpatient rehabilitation have cognitive, physical, behavioral, and emotional&#xD;
      impairments that affect their abilities to independently self-manage their health, wellness,&#xD;
      and activities of daily living. Activity limitations often result in increased family&#xD;
      involvement for managing the person's care. The complexity of needs combined with the&#xD;
      fragmentation of healthcare services creates the perfect storm for mismanaged symptoms,&#xD;
      adverse health events, readmissions, and a lower likelihood of return to work and school.&#xD;
      Transitional care is defined as actions in the clinical encounter designed to ensure the&#xD;
      coordination and continuity of healthcare for patients transferring between different&#xD;
      locations or levels of care in close geographic proximity. In other patient groups who&#xD;
      experience acute events (e.g., stroke, myocardial infarction), transitional care management&#xD;
      has led to improved patient and family outcomes. Although preliminary research shows that&#xD;
      patients with TBI and families desire and could benefit from interventions to support the&#xD;
      transition from acute hospital care to home, the strength of evidence on this topic is low.&#xD;
      TBI transitional care interventions developed to date are ineffective in improving functional&#xD;
      outcomes and do not incorporate family needs. Thus, the purpose of our study is to first&#xD;
      develop and refine a patient- and family-centered TBI transitional care intervention to&#xD;
      support patients with moderate-to-severe TBI and their family caregivers during the&#xD;
      transition home from acute hospital care. The intervention will aim to improve quality of&#xD;
      life for patients with TBI, reduce strain for their family caregivers, and direct patients&#xD;
      and families to appropriate resources and care that is concordant with their health-related&#xD;
      goals. Second, we will examine the feasibility and acceptability and assess the preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of the TBI transitional care intervention. The primary outcome will be patient&#xD;
      quality of life at 16 weeks post-discharge. This study will also examine secondary outcomes&#xD;
      at 16 weeks post-discharge, including family caregiver strain and preparedness for the&#xD;
      caregiving role, and patient and family caregiver self-efficacy and healthcare utilization.&#xD;
      The new knowledge generated from the proposed research will guide the research team in&#xD;
      designing and conducting an NIH R01 implementation-effectiveness clinical trial of the TBI&#xD;
      transitional care intervention and will ultimately enhance the standard of care for patients&#xD;
      with TBI discharged home from acute hospital care and families&#xD;
