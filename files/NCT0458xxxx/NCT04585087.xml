  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine if the body's needs for threonine (an amino acid which is an&#xD;
      essential building block for protein) is different when assessed after 1, 3 or 6 days of&#xD;
      adaptation to the level of threonine intake being studied.&#xD;

      Our method, the Indicator Amino Acid Oxidation (IAAO) method has been used before to look at&#xD;
      amino acid requirements. Over the years, we have changed our method to make our studies on&#xD;
      amino acid requirements safer to use in specific vulnerable populations like babies or older&#xD;
      adults. For example, we have shown that we only need to collect breath and urine samples&#xD;
      instead of collecting blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another feature of our method is that we require subjects to consume personalized diets for 3&#xD;
      days at a time, repeated for up to 7 times. These personalized diets are important as they&#xD;
      allow us to study the amount of amino acids needed by the body. The body's metabolism changes&#xD;
      with different intakes of amino acids. We measure this change in metabolism by collecting&#xD;
      breath and urine samples on the 3rd day of each diet period. However, we do not know if this&#xD;
      specific length of time for the personalized diets (i.e. 3 days) is sufficient or whether&#xD;
      more time is needed for the body to adjust to the amount of amino acids provided. There is a&#xD;
      possibility that 3 days is not enough time and our results (i.e. our estimates of amino acid&#xD;
      needs) may be different if we allow more time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out if the threonine requirement determined using IAAO&#xD;
      in adult men changes if the length of time on the personalized diets increases from 3 days to&#xD;
      5 and 9 days.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will initially be seen for a pre-study assessment (2 hours). They will then be studied for up to 6 times (6 different levels of threonine intake). Each set of experiments will be 9-days in length. During the first 2 days, a pre-adaptation (milkshake) diet will be consumed. For the remaining 7 days, a protein liquid drink and protein-free cookies will be consumed. All of the diets will be provided by the investigators.&#xD;
During each 9-day experiment, participants are expected to come to the Clinical Research Centre at the Hospital for Sick Children for breath and urine collection (5 hours total for each visit)</description>
