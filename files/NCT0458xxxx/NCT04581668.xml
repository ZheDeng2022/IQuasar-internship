  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positive intra-thoracic pressures induced by mechanical ventilation can negatively impact&#xD;
      right heart hemodynamics by restricting systemic venous return and increasing right&#xD;
      ventricular afterload. These consequences may be detrimental in patients with a restrictive&#xD;
      right ventricular physiology and in patients with single ventricle physiology. NAVA (Neurally&#xD;
      Adjusted Ventilatory Assist) ventilation decreases intra thoracic pressures compared to&#xD;
      conventional ventilation modes. Brain perfusion is both a hemodynamic indicator and a&#xD;
      prognostic factor in cardiac postoperative care. Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS)&#xD;
      coupled with Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) is a new technology that allows monitoring, in&#xD;
      addition to brain tissue oxygenation, changes in brain blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This physiological study aims to evaluate the impact of NAVA mode ventilation on cerebral and&#xD;
      systemic hemodynamics in post-operative cardiac surgery patients with preload dependant right&#xD;
      ventricle or with passive venous return to the lungs . This prospective cross-over study will&#xD;
      include 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once stabilized in intensive care, patients will undergo 2 periods of ventilation in NAVA&#xD;
      mode and conventional mode separated by a 30-minute washout period, in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each period the following information will be collected: changes in cerebral blood flow&#xD;
      and cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamic parameters including cardiac output and oxygen&#xD;
      transport and ventilatory parameters.&#xD;

      1. Scientific context&#xD;
&#xD;
           In post-operative cardiac surgery, invasive ventilation is often necessary, but the&#xD;
           induced positive intra thoracic pressures can be detrimental to hemodynamics via several&#xD;
           mechanisms: decrease in venous return, increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and&#xD;
           increase in the afterload of the right ventricle. This effect is particularly&#xD;
           problematic in patients with a restrictive right ventricle, who are preload dependent,&#xD;
           and in patients with cavo pulmonary connections for single ventricle palliation. In&#xD;
           these patients, decreasing ventilator positive pressure improves cardiac output and&#xD;
           cerebral oxygenation. However, very early extubation is not always possible or safe, and&#xD;
           it is therefore essential to optimize mechanical ventilation in order to minimize its&#xD;
           hemodynamic consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In adults, ventilation in NAVA (Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist) mode, regardless&#xD;
           of the level of assistance, allows the preservation of intra thoracic pressure&#xD;
           variations characteristic of spontaneous ventilation and limits the impact of&#xD;
           ventilation on right ventricular ejection. In children, inspiratory and mean pressures&#xD;
           are also lower in NAVA compared to conventional ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of brain oxygenation and perfusion in cardiovascular resuscitation is&#xD;
           important both as a hemodynamic parameter and as a neurological prognostic factor. An&#xD;
           innovative non-invasive tool, Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy coupled with Near&#xD;
           Infrared Spectroscopy (DCS-NIRS), allows the non-invasive evaluation of both cerebral&#xD;
           oxygenation and variations in cerebral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hypothesis and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           The hypothesis is that the NAVA ventilation mode, which generates lower intra thoracic&#xD;
           pressures than conventional ventilation modes, will improve cerebral hemodynamics,&#xD;
           cardiac output, and oxygen transport of at-risk patients in the post-operative cardiac&#xD;
           surgery setting compared with conventional ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Main objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In pediatric patients following cardiac surgery with risk of right ventricular diastolic&#xD;
           dysfunction or passive pulmonary venous return (including Glenn, hemi-Fontan, Fontan,&#xD;
           and Tetralogy of Fallot surgery), investigators will evaluate the impact of NAVA&#xD;
           ventilation on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cerebral perfusion: cerebral blood flow (mm2/s) measured by DCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  cerebral oxygenation: cerebral tissue saturation (%) and regional cerebral O2&#xD;
                extraction (OEF, measured by NIRS-DCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In pediatric post-operative cardiac surgery patients with risk of restrictive right&#xD;
           ventricle or passive pulmonary venous return (including Glenn, hemi-Fontan, Fontan, and&#xD;
           Tetralogy of Fallot type surgery), investigators will compare the impact of conventional&#xD;
           ventilation to NAVA mode on:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brain regional O2 consumption extracted from NIRS-DCS measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systemic hemodynamics, including cardiac index, lactate level, central venous&#xD;
                oxygen saturation (ScvO2), and oxygen transport&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ventilation parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comfort as measured by the COMFORT scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective cross-over, single-center, physiological study to be conducted in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of CHU Sainte Justine (Montreal, Canada).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two periods of 60 minutes in each of 2 ventilation modes will be compared: conventional&#xD;
      ventilation mode (as prescribed by the treating team) and NAVA mode, in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On admission to the PICU postoperatively, study patients will be fitted with a naso-gastric&#xD;
      NAVA probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before performing any study measurements, investigators will wait for patient stabilization,&#xD;
      which is defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absence of hemodynamically significant bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stabilization of the ventilation parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stable inotrope dose The order of the 2 ventilation periods will be randomized according&#xD;
           to a previously generated random list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study period ventilation will be set as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  conventional ventilation: ventilation as prescribed by the treating team will be&#xD;
           continued. Usually, ventilation is in PRVC (pressure regulated volume control) mode with&#xD;
           a tidal volume between 5 and 8 mL/kg, a peep between 4 and 5, a respiratory rate to aim&#xD;
           for normocapnia, and FiO2 to aim for PaO2 between 100 and 150 mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NAVA Mode: NAVA level setting to target an Edi level between 3 and 20 V, tidal volume&#xD;
           between 5 and 7 mL/kg, and no respiratory distress on physical examination. The trigger&#xD;
           will be set at 0.5 V. The maximum pressure will be limited to 30 cmH2O. The PEEP level&#xD;
           will not be changed from that prescribed by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate comparability of brain flow and oxygenation measurements, FiO2, NO&#xD;
      concentration, inotrope dose, and sedation will be kept as stable as possible during these&#xD;
      periods, at the discretion of the treating physician. Similarly, if possible, blood&#xD;
      transfusions will not be administered during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the two periods of ventilation, the following parameters will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ventilatory parameters: ventilator parameters according to the set mode: peak&#xD;
           inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, PEEP, tidal volume, total and spontaneous&#xD;
           minute ventilation, Edi level, FiO2, exhaled CO2 via volumetric capnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemodynamic parameters: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure, systolic, diastolic,&#xD;
           central venous pressure (CVP), left atrial pressure (LAP), type and dose of vasoactive&#xD;
           medications received with calculation of the vasoactive-inotropic score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second half of each period, investigators will perform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a central arterial and venous blood gas and an arterial lactate measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a measurement of cerebral blood flow by diffuse correlation spectroscopy and a&#xD;
           measurement of cerebral regional tissue saturation and oxygen extraction. These&#xD;
           measurements are done non-invasively and painlessly by applying a probe to the child's&#xD;
           forehead for approximately 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a limited cardiac ultrasound for the calculation of cardiac output (CO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculation of urine output during the ventilation period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, for each patient, the following information will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age at the time of surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiac diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  existence and quantification of aorto-pulmonary collaterals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  preoperative medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  operative details: surgical procedure, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, aortic&#xD;
           cross-clamp duration, inotropes administered (and maximum dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  result of the postoperative trans-esophageal cardiac echo (cardiac function, evaluation&#xD;
           of repair, presence of residual anatomic lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  arterial and venous blood gases, lactate and haemoglobin levels prior to study&#xD;
           ventilation periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  time interval between the end of cardiopulmonary bypass and the start of study&#xD;
           measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables will be expressed in terms of mean standard deviation or median&#xD;
      (interquartile), depending on the nature of their distribution. Because of the sample size,&#xD;
      analysis of the differences between t variables during the 2 modes of ventilation will be&#xD;
      done using the non-parametric Wilcoxon test (all the variables studied are of the continuous&#xD;
      type). A value of p &lt;0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the calculation of sample size, investigators estimated, using the study by Huang et al&#xD;
      (4), that the standard deviation of brain saturation would be 6%, and that the expected&#xD;
      difference between the 2 ventilation modes would be at least 6%. To reach a power of 90% with&#xD;
      an alpha risk set at 0.05, a minimum of 24 patients is required. Given the risk of loss of&#xD;
      sight (e.g. technical difficulty in obtaining the main variable) and due to the heterogeneity&#xD;
      of the patient population, we decided to aim to include 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Note that no power calculation based on the variations in cerebral blood flow measured in&#xD;
      spectroscopy was performed, because there was no preliminary data on the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval from the Research Ethics Committee of Sainte Justine University Hospital and the&#xD;
      University Medical Affairs Department was obtained. Written consent will be required from the&#xD;
      parents.&#xD;
