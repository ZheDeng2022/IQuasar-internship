  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to systematically characterize the clinical course of the&#xD;
      progressive neuropathy and optic atrophy observe in pediatric and adult patients with&#xD;
      biallelic mutations in the ferredoxin reductase gene.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The mitochondrial membrane-associated ferredoxin reductase (FDXR) is a flavoprotein that&#xD;
      initiates the mitochondrial electron transport chain by transferring electrons from NADPH to&#xD;
      the mitochondrial cytochrome P450 system via the ferredoxins FDX1 or FDX2. In addition to&#xD;
      essential roles in Fe-S cluster biogenesis, this pathway is also central to the biosynthesis&#xD;
      of steroid hormones. Previously, Dr. Taosheng Huang's research group has identified mutations&#xD;
      in the FDXR gene in many individuals who share clinical presentations consistent with a&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorder-including ataxia, hypotonia and optic atrophy-and obtained a&#xD;
      naturally-occurring Fdxr mutant mouse model from Jackson Lab that corroborated these results&#xD;
      (PMID: 29040572 and PMID: 30250212). In particular, FDXR enzyme activity, mitochondrial&#xD;
      complex activities and ATP production were all significantly reduced in their patient&#xD;
      samples. Their studies further indicated that Fdxr mutation leads to neurodegeneration that&#xD;
      is associated with both inflammation as well as the abnormal accumulation of iron in the&#xD;
      mitochondria, likely as a result of disrupted Fe-S cluster synthesis. More recently, his&#xD;
      group has used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to generate a mouse line with a p.R389W amino acid&#xD;
      change, which more precisely matches the most common human variant observed in their patients&#xD;
      and shows a much more severe phenotype than their previous, naturally occurring Fdxr mouse&#xD;
      model. They have also show that AAV-based gene therapy can significantly improve the&#xD;
      condition of Fdxr mutant mice (DOI:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omtm.2020.05.021), providing&#xD;
      valuable preclinical data that may open the door for adapting such gene therapy treatments&#xD;
      for use in human clinical trials. Given the recent regulatory approval granted to gene&#xD;
      therapy treatments for LCA2, SMA1, and Î²-thalassemia, there is strong possibility that such&#xD;
      an approach will ultimately produce a viable clinical treatment for FDXR patients as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDXR is required for Iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters synthesis which is essential for multiple&#xD;
      important biological processes, including electron transfer, cofactor synthesis, and gene&#xD;
      regulation. Fe-S cluster biosynthesis is a tightly regulated process that requires&#xD;
      coordinated delivery of both iron and sulfur and is a cofactor of many proteins. A variety of&#xD;
      human disorders have been associated with impaired Fe-S cluster synthesis, including&#xD;
      neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. Friedreich's ataxia) and myopathy with lactic acidosis.&#xD;
      Iron homeostasis, which requires precise synthesis and localization of Fe-S clusters in&#xD;
      mitochondria, is critical to ensure that there is sufficient iron for cellular functions,&#xD;
      without reaching toxic levels of iron. Excessive levels of iron favor the formation of excess&#xD;
      oxygen free radicals and consequent mitochondrial dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rare Disease Act and Rare Disease Orphan Product Development Act highlight the importance&#xD;
      of rare disease research and the obstacles to developing effective treatments for these&#xD;
      diseases. However, the study of rare diseases may open a window to studying other human&#xD;
      conditions. For example, Iron-sulfur biosynthesis abnormalities have been observed in more&#xD;
      common human diseases such as Friedreich's ataxia. This relationship highlights the&#xD;
      importance of human disease research by multiple approaches to understand biological&#xD;
      mechanisms and for general application to human health. For these reasons, a better&#xD;
      understanding of the pathogenesis of FDXR deficiency may help facilitate our knowledge of&#xD;
      disease biology, neurodevelopment, brain function, and other organ abnormalities. Thus, in&#xD;
      order to better understand the function of FDXR and to help lay the groundwork for eventual&#xD;
      clinical trials of gene therapy or drug-based treatments for FDXR-related disease, the&#xD;
      investigators propose this natural history study of both pediatric as well as adult patients&#xD;
      with biallelic mutations in the ferredoxin reductase gene.&#xD;

    <measure>Inventory of Non-Ataxia Signs (INAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>INAS is an instrument developed by the Ataxia Study Group to provide structured information on non-ataxia signs in ataxia patients. INAS consists of 30 items, each of which is related to one of the following 16 signs or syndromes: areflexia, hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response, spasticity, paresis, amyotrophy, fasciculations, myoclonus, rigidity, chorea, dystonia, resting tremor, sensory symptoms, brainstem oculomotor signs (horizontal and vertical ophthalmoparesis, slowing of saccades), urinary dysfunction and cognitive impairment. For a semiquantitative assessement of non-ataxia signs, the number of non-ataxia signs is counted, yielding the INAS count, a dimensionless value with a range from 0 to 16. A sign is recorded as present if at least one item related to this sign is positive.</description>
