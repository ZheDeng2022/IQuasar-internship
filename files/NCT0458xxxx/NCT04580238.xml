  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post stroke headache occurs in approximately 10-23% of all stroke patients. Its onset is&#xD;
      shortly after experiencing a stroke, or stroke like event, and persists for at least three&#xD;
      months. These headaches have features which resemble migraine or occur in people who have a&#xD;
      previous history of migraine that was once infrequent. Botox is a treatment that is currently&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of chronic migraine, that is migraine headaches occurring for at&#xD;
      least 15 days a month for at least 3 months. Given the clinical similarity in character and&#xD;
      frequency of post stroke headache and migraine, and the fact that stroke affects structures&#xD;
      like the blood vessels in the brain that are also affected in migraine, this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the possible role that Botox would have in the treatment of Post-Stroke Headache.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will be a randomized, open-label, comparator controlled study&#xD;
      investigating the safety and efficacy of Botox in Persistent Post &quot;Stroke&quot; (encompassing&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, CVST, Cervical Vessel Dissection and RCVS) headache&#xD;
      patients relative to Placebo with or without concomitant standard pharmacologic and&#xD;
      Non-pharmacologic treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be a stratified random sample of stroke patients fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and consenting to study. The study groups will consist of 40 patients&#xD;
      randomly allocated to receiving Botox according to the treatment regime specified below and&#xD;
      40 patients randomly allocated to Non-Botox standard treatments, to a total study population&#xD;
      of 80 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Screening Questionnaire will be developed allowing for the identification of&#xD;
      persistent/chronic post stroke headache and the classification into novel vs previous stable&#xD;
      migraine sub-groups. Such dichotomization will not affect randomization process up and until&#xD;
      one sub-group total had been met. If one arm is met prematurely, the Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee will inform study investigators and only patients of the remaining&#xD;
      sub-population will be randomized post- screening (stratified random sampling).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate Data collection and monitoring. Patients will be seen in face to face&#xD;
      encounters every 12 weeks with interim phone interviews every 4 weeks. A cross platform&#xD;
      mobile based application (Migraine Buddy, Healint Analytics)15 will be utilized with patient&#xD;
      subjects to allow for documentation of migraine attacks including severity and the facility&#xD;
      of real-time documentation of temporal profile, migraine triggers, and medications as well as&#xD;
      facility for remote monitoring by study investigators. Subjects will be taught how to use&#xD;
      application to export data to study investigators in order to allow timely a communication of&#xD;
      potential adverse and serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will be undergoing a retrospective analysis of headache&#xD;
      patients treated at the Grey Nuns Community Hospital Stroke Clinic in order to add to the&#xD;
      literature regarding the clinical characteristics and putative treatment effects in this&#xD;
      unique patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botox 200 IU vials for 40 patients for the duration of study (4 treatment cycles); Treatment&#xD;
      will be based on the PREEMPT study full treatment and follow the pain protocol to a total of&#xD;
      195 IU in standard injection sites.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adult patients (&gt;18 y) fulfilling ICHD-3 criteria* of persistent post&#xD;
             stroke/hemorrhagic stroke headache; persistent headache post dissection* and post RCVS&#xD;
             persistent headache will be enrolled at 3 months or greater of persistence of&#xD;
             symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
             For the purposes of this study, as suggested elsewhere in the literature, the initial&#xD;
             onset of headache will be considered for study if occurring within 72 hours prior to&#xD;
             and 7 days post sentinel vascular event (&quot;Stroke&quot;). The 72 hours prior criteria&#xD;
             allowing for inclusion of patients of intracerebral hemorrhage who are known to have&#xD;
             anticipatory headache as well as alternate ischemic syndromes in which new onset&#xD;
             headache may anticipate stroke symptoms such as dissection and reversible&#xD;
             cerebro-vasoconstriction syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The syndrome of post CVST headache patients will only be enrolled after symptoms have&#xD;
             persisted for a minimum of 6 months and after relevant imaging demonstrates a&#xD;
             resolution of potentially structural contribution from the sentinel event (i.e.&#xD;
             recanalization or chronic thrombo- sis with a normal opening pressure on lumbar&#xD;
             puncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note the patients of post dissection persistent headaches may be enrolled despite&#xD;
                  the absence of an identified ischemic lesion, i.e. in the setting of TIA or new&#xD;
                  onset headache without embolic symptoms but with a history of the (stabilized)&#xD;
                  vascular injury associated with the syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note the co-existence of medication overuse headache will not be a&#xD;
                  contraindication to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Tension type Post Stroke Persisting Headache, Post stroke pain syndrome such as the&#xD;
             Thalamic syndrome of Dejerine-Roussy, or any headache semiology that does not fulfill&#xD;
             diagnostic criteria for chronic migraine, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Contraindications to Botox, neuromuscular illness or documented hyper- sensitivity&#xD;
             will preclude randomization of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concurrent active systemic illness, such as sepsis, chronic infective processes,&#xD;
             neoplastic syndromes, or autoimmune syndromes. (Headache secondary to medical illness,&#xD;
             even if occurring post-stroke).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be screened for coexistent (including psychiatric) conditions to exclude&#xD;
             illnesses that may influence the conduct or results of the trial. Subjects with&#xD;
             coexisting conditions, such as depression, may be included if they are defined a&#xD;
             priori, stable on current treatment regimens (with no anticipated changes in&#xD;
             management that may interfere with study results), and recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
             One of the secondary outcome measures in the study investigates the potential impact&#xD;
             on concurrent symptoms of depression. However, the stability of symptoms treatment and&#xD;
             concomitant medications should be assessed prior to inclusion in the study. If factors&#xD;
             are identified which might interfere with patient compliance, follow up or confound&#xD;
             results, such patients should be excluded. Other common reasons for exclusion include&#xD;
             severe depression and overuse of alcohol or illicit drugs, as defined by the&#xD;
             Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. CGRP inhibitors will be contraindicated during the period of study.&#xD;
