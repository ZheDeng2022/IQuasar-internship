      Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies are emerging as the steroid-sparing therapy of choice for&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome.This Randomized Clinical Trial seeks to evaluate whether Rituximab&#xD;
      biosimilar maintains drug-free disease remission in patients with steroid-dependent nephrotic&#xD;
      syndrome for 12-24 months and verify its superiority vs. mycophenolate mofetil (1,200 mg/m2&#xD;
      orally in 2 daily doses). The investigators will compare the risk of relapse to test this&#xD;
      hypothesis (primary outcome). Secondary objectives will include assessing short- and&#xD;
      long-term side-effects and developing specific biomarkers of sensitivity to therapy. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited, treated and followed at IRCCS G Gaslini and IRCCS Bambino Gesù where&#xD;
      laboratory studies will be performed at in-site facilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) is a podocyte renal disease characterized by loss of the&#xD;
      impermeability functions versus circulating proteins, causing severe proteinuria and&#xD;
      hypo-albuminaemia with edema. According to 2019 KDIGO guidelines administration of low-dose&#xD;
      prednisone is suggested to maintain remission in SDNS (steroid dependant nephrotic syndrome),&#xD;
      and mycophenolate mofetile (MMF) or calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) or Rituximab as&#xD;
      corticosteroid-sparing agents for children who develop serious corticosteroid-related adverse&#xD;
      effects. Given the toxicity of cyclophosphamide and CNI in long-term administration, there is&#xD;
      the need to clarify which is, between MMF and rituximab, the most effective approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RTX vs MMF trial is an open-label, two-parallel-arm, controlled and randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial testing the superiority of RTX over MMF (1,200 mg/m2 orally in two daily doses) in&#xD;
      maintaining steroid free disease remission in patients with SDNS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants are children and young adults (age between 3 and 24 years) with&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome who are dependent on prednisone 0.3-1mg/Kg/day and have received&#xD;
      prednisone for at least six months before enrolment. Previous treatment with MMF will be&#xD;
      allowed. All participants will enter a 45 days run-in period, during which children treated&#xD;
      with steroids alone will start MMF and will taper steroids after 15 days by 0.3 mg/kg per&#xD;
      week until complete withdrawal. Patients already receiving MMF alone will continue the&#xD;
      treatment. During the same period, instruction on urine collection and dipstick readings will&#xD;
      be carefully reviewed and compliance assessed. After run-in period, children will be&#xD;
      randomized to either the intervention arm (Rituximab, 375 mg/m2) or the comparator arm&#xD;
      (continuing or starting MMF). In the intervention arm, 1 month after infusion MMF will be&#xD;
      decreased by 50% and withdrawn within 2 additional weeks, whereas MMF will be maintained in&#xD;
      the comparator. All patients will be followed for up to 24 months. In case of relapses during&#xD;
      this period (see outcome section for definition) patients will be treated with oral&#xD;
      prednisone (60 mg/sqm day). Following remission, steroids will be maintained at the initial&#xD;
      dose for 7 days and then tapered off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal in&#xD;
      patients of the MMF arm. Patients of the intervention arm will instead be treated with&#xD;
      another infusion of RTX (same dose) immediately following steroid-induced remission. After&#xD;
      infusion of RTX, steroids will be maintained at the initial dose for 7 days and then tapered&#xD;
      off by 0.3 mg/kg per week until complete withdrawal. In this way relapsed patients in both&#xD;
      arms will receive the same cumulative dose of prednisone. In case following relapse of&#xD;
      proteinuria patients fail to respond to prednisone (they will terminate the study and be&#xD;
      considered as treatment failure). The study allows drop-in from one arm to the other after 2&#xD;
      relapses (i.e., investigators will be allowed to use RTX in the comparator arm and vice versa&#xD;
      MMF in intervention arm). The economic balance will be calculated on the basis of RTX doses&#xD;
      needed to maintain remittance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed for 24 months. In person visits will occur at enrollment, at T0&#xD;
      (infusion), after 1 month and every 3/6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are going to enroll 160 patients.&#xD;
