  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intimate protections are designed to absorb menstrual flow during menstruation. A woman will&#xD;
      use an average of 6,000 intimate protections during her lifetime. Intimate protections are&#xD;
      classified into two categories: internal intimate protections including tampon, menstrual&#xD;
      cup, menstrual sponge, and external intimate protections including disposable or washable&#xD;
      sanitary pads, panty liner, menstrual panty. The choice and use of a type of intimate&#xD;
      protection will depend on multiple factors specific to each woman. Due to a growing media&#xD;
      interest in this area, women have become extremely critical and suspicious of these devices,&#xD;
      particularly about the Toxic Shock Syndrome, attributed to the use of tampon in women&#xD;
      previously colonized vaginally by strain of toxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus (Toxic&#xD;
      shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1)). Similarly, chemical residues have been found in sanitary&#xD;
      napkins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, women's expectations have changed and there is a greater demand for transparency&#xD;
      with regard to intimate protection of their composition and their potential health risks.&#xD;
      Women want more and more alternative to conventional intimate protections in today's climate&#xD;
      of increasing environmental awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a cross-sectional, observational, prospective, unicentric inclusion study (CHU de&#xD;
      Reims). The primary objective is to describe women's intimate protection practices. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to study the determinants of women's choice for intimate protection,&#xD;
      to describe women's knowledge of the potential risks of these intimate protections. and&#xD;
      women's information sources on intimate protections. Finally describe the expectations of&#xD;
      women in terms of intimate protections. The results are intended to give a photograph of the&#xD;
      practices and knowledge of women consulting in the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department of&#xD;
      the University Hospital of Reims concerning intimate protections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients aged 18 to 50, presenting menstrual cycles, consulting in the obstetrics and&#xD;
      gynecology department of the University Hospital of Reims whatever the reason for&#xD;
      consultation can participate in the study after signing the consent of no opposition.&#xD;
      Participation in the study will not change the patient's medical management. Participation in&#xD;
      the study will result in the completion of a questionnaire concerning intimate protections.&#xD;
      The filling time of the questionnaire is estimated at 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This subject is evolving with a growing awareness of women on the management of their rules,&#xD;
      the products used, their potential risks and the environment. This study will allow us to see&#xD;
      if women are really informed and feel concerned by these changes. And in the end, find out if&#xD;
      they are ready to turn to intimate protections called &quot;alternatives&quot; The results will give us&#xD;
      a vision of the expectations of our patients in this area as well as the information&#xD;
      received, and thus allow us to publish an information guide and good practices of the&#xD;
      intimate protections available in the waiting rooms of our consultations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will allow health professionals to discuss this subject more easily&#xD;
      and easily with their patients.&#xD;
