  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IRD) are prone to malnutrition for&#xD;
      several reasons. The diseases and treatment can cause reduced intake and absorption of&#xD;
      nutrients and the inflammatory processes may cause an increased demand for nutrients,&#xD;
      especially proteins. Studies report that nutritional status can affect disease activity.&#xD;
      Dietary supplement of 3-4 gram omega-3 has shown beneficial effect upon disease activity in&#xD;
      patients with IRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To investigate whether improved dietary intake with and without supplements of omega-3&#xD;
      will affect disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and spondyloarthritis&#xD;
      (SpA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: A systematic change of diet in line with the Norwegian dietary guidelines,&#xD;
      which will result in increased intake of, among other nutrients, omega-3 fatty acids and&#xD;
      complete protein, as well as reduced intake of saturated fat and sugar, will improve&#xD;
      nutritional status and reduce disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: A systematic change of diet (as above), included a high dose of omega-3 will&#xD;
      further improve nutritional status and reduce disease activity compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A DB-RCT-study will be conducted. All patients will receive individualized dietary&#xD;
      guidance by a clinical dietician for 12 weeks, before randomization to supplements of omega-3&#xD;
      or placebo, for 24 weeks. The supplement will be blinded for the participants, researchers&#xD;
      and physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical implications: The study will investigate the effect of improved diet and nutrition&#xD;
      on treatment offered to patients with IRD to provide more evidence-based knowledge, and thus&#xD;
      specific dietary guidelines for patients with IRD. In addition, the study might increase the&#xD;
      understanding of the role of omega-3 in the pathogenesis of inflammation.&#xD;

      The study is approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics.&#xD;
      Participation is voluntary, and informed consent will be requested. Outpatients will be&#xD;
      recruited by doctors at the Rheumatology Department at Haukeland University Hospital (HUH).&#xD;
      Patients recruited will be included consecutively. The recruitment period will last up to 12&#xD;
      months. Anthropometrical measurements, analysis of body composition, blood tests, clinical&#xD;
      parameters, and dietary data will be collected at baseline, and after 12, 24, 36 and 52&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be twofold and consist of Intervention 1 and Intervention 2.&#xD;
Intervention 1: Dietary guidance (12 weeks). All participants will receive individual dietary guidance, as well as an intensive dietary course with 4 sessions. Participants will receive contact information to the clinical dietitian, and the opportunity to ask questions throughout the intervention period. Patients will be asked to not use other omega-3 supplement during the intervention period 1.&#xD;
Intervention 2: Omega-3 vs. placebo (24 weeks). After intervention 1, patients will be randomized to take either 3 grams of omega-3 or placebo daily, divided into 4 capsules. Patients will be asked not to use other omega-3 supplements in the period from 2 months until after intervention period 2.</intervention_model_description>
