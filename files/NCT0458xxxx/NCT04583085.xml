    <textblock>
      The role of micro-RNAs in chronic periodontitis associated with CAD is still in an incipient&#xD;
      stage needs to be explored further. The investigators attempt to quantify and compare the&#xD;
      levels of micro-RNA 146a and micro-RNA 126 in subgingival as well as coronary plaque samples&#xD;
      obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis with and without coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      The role of micro-RNAs in chronic periodontitis associated with CAD is still in an incipient&#xD;
      stage needs to be explored further. The investigators attempt to quantify and compare the&#xD;
      levels of micro-RNA 146a and micro-RNA 126 in subgingival as well as coronary plaque samples&#xD;
      obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic periodontitis with and without coronary artery&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-five participants were selected and grouped into 3 categories; 25 patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with chronic periodontitis and coronary artery disease: CP + CAD group; 25 patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with chronic periodontitis alone: CP group; and 25 systemically and periodontally healthy&#xD;
      controls (HP). Demographic variables, periodontal parameters, cardiac parameters, blood&#xD;
      pressure were obtained. miRNA-146a and miRNA126 levels were assessed in subgingival plaque&#xD;
      (SP) samples from all the three groups. Within CP+CAD group, SP samples of CP+CADa were&#xD;
      compared with coronary plaques samples (CP) of CP+CADb while the patient underwent CABG.&#xD;
