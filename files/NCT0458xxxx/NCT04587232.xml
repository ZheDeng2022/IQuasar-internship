  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Knee and hip osteoarthritis are common diseases that play an important role in health-related&#xD;
      quality of life (HR-QoL). Assessing HR-QoL with a disease- and site-specific HR-QoL is more&#xD;
      advantageous than generic scales. In that concept, to our knowledge, there is not any&#xD;
      osteoarthritis- and lower limb-specific HR-QoL instrument to use in Turkey. Mini-OAKHQoL was&#xD;
      derived from the OAKHQoL questionnaire, which was developed to assess the quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) in subjects with lower limb osteoarthritis. Its good psychometric properties have&#xD;
      recently been shown and validation studies have been done in several populations.&#xD;
      Mini-OAKHQoL's validation study has not been done before in Turkey. The aim is to investigate&#xD;
      the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Mini-OAKHQoL. Patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with knee or hip osteoarthritis were recruited. For cross-cultural adaptation, items of&#xD;
      Mini-OAKHQoL were selected from the interrelated Turkish version of the OAKHQoL study in&#xD;
      which the adaptation process had already done. Missing data, floor effect, and ceiling effect&#xD;
      were calculated. Reliability analysis with internal consistency and test-retest reliability&#xD;
      were discovered. Face, content, convergent, and divergent validities were applied.&#xD;

    <description>Turkish version of Mini Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life Questionnaire (Mini-OAKHQoL) was derived from the Turkish version of OAKHQoL questionnaire, which was developed to assess the quality of life (QoL) in subjects with lower limb osteoarthritis. It includes five subscales: physical activities, mental health, pain, social support, social functioning; with three additional independent items addressing sexual life, professional life, and fear of being dependent. It asks for the impact of the knee or hip OA on their QoL over the last month while filling the items. The numerical rating scales in the items range from 0 (worst) to 10 (best). Scores were obtained by computing the means of the item scores in each subscale. The social support and social functioning subscales are questioned inverse but scored similarly to the &quot;0 (worst)-10 (best) concept. The last three items' score (independent items) becomes the corresponding score.</description>

    <description>Convergent and divergent validities were analyzed to determine the construct validity. Convergent validity was assessed by correlating the Turkish version of Mini Osteoarthritis Knee and Hip Quality of Life (Mini-OAKHQoL) questionnaire score with the subsets of Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), Short form 36 (SF-36), and Western Ontario and McMaster questionnaire (WOMAC). The correlations of the Mini-OAKHQoL with parameters that are not directly related to the health-related quality of life, such as age, body mass index, and disease duration were assessed for divergent validity.</description>

The sum of the items within each section ranges from 0 to 100, and the total score ranges from 0 to 600. The higher score shows a worse quality of life.</description>
