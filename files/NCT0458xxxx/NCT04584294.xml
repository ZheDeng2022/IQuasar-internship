  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed a web-based decision support tool to help women Veterans get&#xD;
      the information and care they need to achieve their reproductive goals, whether that includes&#xD;
      optimizing their health before desired pregnancies or birth control to avoid unwanted&#xD;
      pregnancies. The study will test the effect of sending a weblink to the decision tool to&#xD;
      women Veterans prior to primary care visits at the VA. Half of participants will be sent a&#xD;
      weblink before their appointment, and half will not be sent the link. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that participants who are sent the link will be more likely to report&#xD;
      patient-centered discussions of their reproductive needs at visits, feel confident in&#xD;
      communicating with their health care providers, have accurate knowledge about reproductive&#xD;
      health, and choose birth control methods that best fit their preferences and needs.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Counseling and care that supports individuals' ability to achieve their reproductive goals is&#xD;
      an essential component of primary care. National organizations, including the Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), recommend that clinicians routinely engage in&#xD;
      patient-centered conversations about reproductive goals and offer care to help optimize&#xD;
      health and well-being prior to desired pregnancies and to prevent unwanted pregnancy and&#xD;
      births. This counseling is particularly critical for women Veterans, who face elevated risks&#xD;
      of adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes due to a high prevalence of chronic medical and&#xD;
      mental health conditions as well as psychosocial stressors including sexual trauma histories,&#xD;
      intimate partner violence, and homelessness. Moreover, stark racial/ethnic disparities in&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes are well-documented, and nearly half of reproductive-aged women Veterans&#xD;
      are minority race/ethnicity. Despite these national recommendations, however, conversations&#xD;
      about reproductive needs are often absent in primary care both outside and within the VA, and&#xD;
      the conversations that do happen frequently fail to incorporate women's values and&#xD;
      preferences. Interventions are needed to improve both the frequency and quality of counseling&#xD;
      about reproductive needs in primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effect of a novel, web-based, patient-facing decision support&#xD;
      tool designed to be used prior to VA primary care visits to help women Veterans with&#xD;
      reproductive capacity consider their reproductive goals; improve their knowledge about&#xD;
      fertility, contraception, and prepregnancy health risks; align contraceptive decisions with&#xD;
      their preferences and goals; and engage in shared decision making (SDM) with providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) clustered at&#xD;
      the provider level among VA primary care providers and their reproductive-aged women Veteran&#xD;
      patients. Study outcomes will be assessed among participants shortly after their scheduled&#xD;
      appointment and at 3- and 6-months follow up. The study will test the primary hypothesis that&#xD;
      participants who receive the tool weblink prior to visits will be more likely to report&#xD;
      patient-centered conversations about their reproductive needs at their visit. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that intervention participants will report higher perceived&#xD;
      self-efficacy in communicating with providers, reproductive health knowledge, contraception&#xD;
      decision quality, and contraception utilization. Exploratory outcomes include behaviors to&#xD;
      modify preconception health risks among participants considering pregnancy in the future and&#xD;
      intervention effects by race/ethnicity. The study will also collect quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data to assess the feasibility of implementing the tool more widely in VA primary&#xD;
      care settings.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Veteran participant data will be deposited into the &quot;Reproductive, Sexual, and Socio-Behavioral Health Data Repository and Registry&quot; VA data repository and registry housed and managed at the VA Puget Sound Health Care System. The data will be stored indefinitely in accordance with VHA regulations under VA IRB and R&amp;D Committee oversight. Procedures are as follows.</ipd_description>
    <ipd_time_frame>Data will be deposited into the data repository and registry described above at study closure. It is the intention of the repository team to store the data in the repository indefinitely.&#xD;
In accordance with VHA regulations, the repository will be terminated only under the direction of the VA IRB or R&amp;D Committee responsible for the oversight of the repository. If the repository is terminated, the data will only be re-used or transferred to another data repository if the IRB and/or R&amp;D approves of the transfer. The repository data may need to be destroyed if appropriate control of the data and compliance with VA and VHA requirements cannot be maintained.&#xD;
If the repository is terminated, the data will be destroyed in accordance with all VA and VHA records disposition requirements. We will retain these data for the minimum period required for records retention in accordance with the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) VHA Record Control Schedule (RCS).</ipd_time_frame>
    <ipd_access_criteria>Study data may be requested by VA investigators (all investigators must receive regulatory approval and sign a Data Use Agreement before gaining access to the data). The data repository will only be used to answer questions for approved studies and/or for activities preparatory to research. For activities preparatory to research, staff may only use aggregate data, and only for background information, to justify the research, or to verify proposed sample size requirements.&#xD;
Data from this study will be made available outside VA in response to a properly prepared Freedom of Information Act request submitted to the VA Puget Sound FOIA Officer, or submitted and passed down to the facility FOIA Officer from higher VA authority (e.g. VISN 20 or Central Office). Research publications will be made available to the public via the National Library of Medicine PubMed Central website within one year after publication date(s).</ipd_access_criteria>
