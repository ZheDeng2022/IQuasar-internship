    <textblock>
      Glomerulonephritis (GN) comprises a group of renal diseases characterized by glomerular and&#xD;
      tubulointerstitial fibrosis secondary to glomerular inflammation and proliferation of the&#xD;
      basement membrane, mesangial cells, or capillary endothelium triggered by immunologic&#xD;
      mechanisms.(1) The glomerular filtration rate decreases with progression of chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD), ultimately resulting in end-stage renal failure. Glomerulonephritis is the&#xD;
      third most common cause of end-stage renal failure. Initial clinical signs of&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis are nonspecific and subtle. Occasionally, affected patients present with&#xD;
      hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, raised serum creatinine level, weight gain, edema, or&#xD;
      nephrotic syndrome.(2) The underlying pathologic changes are partly irreversible, and a&#xD;
      prompt diagnosis with early initiation of treatment is of vital importance. The diagnosis is&#xD;
      based on clinical, laboratory, and conventional US findings, whereas renal biopsy is&#xD;
      considered the reference standard for a definitive diagnosis and fibrosis grading.(3,4)&#xD;
      Unfortunately, this invasive procedure is associated with the risk of serious bleeding&#xD;
      complications and therefore is not the method of choice for longitudinal monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elastography, a Novel imaging modality that estimates tissue stiffness, especially for&#xD;
      superficial organs such as the breast and Thyroid. In recent years, ultrasound elastography&#xD;
      (UE) has been demonstrated in the liver and has been applied widely in the diagnosis and&#xD;
      evaluation of liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver diseases, and non&#xD;
      alcoholic fatty liver diseases.(5,6) To date, renal allograft stiffness (elasticity) has been&#xD;
      evaluated by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and ultrasound elastography (UE). However,&#xD;
      UE application for native renal diseases has not been well up till now.(7) Conventional renal&#xD;
      ultrasonography may be appropriate to evaluate kidney size, as well as to assess the&#xD;
      echogenicity of the renal cortex, exclude obstruction, and determine the extent of fibrosis.&#xD;
      However, It has no significant role in diagnosis of GN. US time-harmonic elastography depicts&#xD;
      abnormal renal stiffness in glomerulonephritis, particularly among patients with early&#xD;
      disease and preserved renal function.(8,9,10)&#xD;
