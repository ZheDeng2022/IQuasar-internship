  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this evaluation, four versions of emails will be sent to eligible health plan members who&#xD;
      are not currently enrolled in the health system's mail-order pharmacy. A control group will&#xD;
      not receive any communication. The researchers hypothesize that the use of content informed&#xD;
      by behavioral nudge theory in the emails should lead to increased enrollment in the health&#xD;
      system's mail-order pharmacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The utilization of a mail-order pharmacy can increase adherence to medications. The health&#xD;
      system's mail-order pharmacy (from here, simply referred to as mail-order pharmacy) can also&#xD;
      provide reduced costs for medications. Ongoing outreach efforts involve sending emails and&#xD;
      other communications encouraging enrollment in Geisinger's mail-order pharmacy to eligible&#xD;
      members of the system's health plan (i.e., those who take maintenance medications). The study&#xD;
      will compare a standard promotional email from these outreach efforts, as well as three new&#xD;
      emails with content informed by behavioral science research, against a no-contact control arm&#xD;
      and each other.&#xD;

    <description>The email emphasizes future reductions in healthcare costs due to increased adherence with mail-order pharmacy, in addition to mentioning reduced prices for medications. It also uses fear appeals by stating the risk of hospital stays and how mail-order pharmacy could be an easily-achievable way to avoid this negative consequence.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Email with Endorsement</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The email is a letter from a doctor at the health system's health plan--who may been seen as a trusted source of information--encouraging the benefits of using a mail-order pharmacy.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Email with Comparison Table</arm_group_label>
