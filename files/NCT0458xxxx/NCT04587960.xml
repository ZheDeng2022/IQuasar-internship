    <textblock>
      Pregnant mothers requiring emergency cs with history of ruptured membranes would be allocated&#xD;
      randomly into two groups in an aim to study the comparative outcome of different methods of&#xD;
      skin closure namely primary and delayed primary closure on the incidence of wound infections&#xD;
      requiring secondary closures and to detect the associated risk factors increasing chance of&#xD;
      surgical site infections.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the effect of two different methods of skin wound closure namely Primary Closure&#xD;
      and Delayed Primary Closure on the incidence of wound infection and requirement for secondary&#xD;
      skin wound repair after emergency caesarean section in patients with ruptured membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS Caesarean Sections (CS) in emergency situation where amniotic membrane is&#xD;
      ruptured are clean contaminated procedures which are associated with 10-20% wound&#xD;
      disruptions. Delayed Primary Closure for managing contaminated wounds is a concept well&#xD;
      recognized by military surgeons, which reduces wound infections. Investigators wish to&#xD;
      conduct this prospective study to determine the efficacy of using this technique of wound&#xD;
      closure in Caesarean Sections in patients with history of ruptured amniotic membranes.&#xD;
      Investigators wish to study and compare the effect of this technique versus conventional&#xD;
      primary skin closure on wound infection and incidence of secondary wound suturing in CS with&#xD;
      ruptured membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY SETTING: Tertiary teaching hospital-based trial involving obstetric patients&#xD;
           undergoing Caesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PLACE OF STUDY: Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Calcutta National Medical&#xD;
           College and Hospital, Kolkata.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. PERIOD OF STUDY: From 1st March 2020 to 15th June 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. SAMPLE SIZE: As no similar study was found in literature related to obstetric&#xD;
           population, we have chosen an arbitrary sample size of 30 in case group and 30 in&#xD;
           control group in this Pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION CRITERIA :&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Parturients admitted with rupture of membranes undergoing emergency CS&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of intact membranes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incision other than Pfannenstiel&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of pre-existing infection at the site of skin incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of obvious chorioamnionitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of any immunosuppressive condition including HIV, intake of immunosuppressive&#xD;
           medication, h/o chemotherapy, haematological malignancies, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of other conditions interfering with wound healing like Tuberculosis, Diabetes,&#xD;
           collagen disorders, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers undergoing emergency CS for various indications after rupture of membranes will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to two groups Study group to undergo Delayed Primary Closure of skin&#xD;
      incision and Control group to undergo Primary closure of skin incision, after appropriate&#xD;
      consenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During CS Pfannenstiel incision will be made in the skin. All patients will receive&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotic within thirty minutes of making abdominal incision. Depending upon&#xD;
      the duration of membrane rupture wound will be defined either contaminated (duration of&#xD;
      membrane rupture ≥ 12 hours) or clean contaminated (duration of membrane rupture ≤12 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the procedure after closure of rectus sheath in the Study group, interrupted&#xD;
      stitches will be taken through skin and subcutaneous tissue with 1-0 monofilament suture but&#xD;
      knots will not be tightened and skin will be left open. Following operation, from next day&#xD;
      onwards dressing of the wound will be done for 3 days. On 4th day, the monofilament stitches&#xD;
      will be tightened under local anaesthesia to appose the skin. Thereafter, sutures will be&#xD;
      removed on 7th day after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Control group wound margins will be apposed by primary closure by interrupted stitches&#xD;
      using 1-0 monofilament and stitches will be removed on 6th day after operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is abnormal discharge from wound, wound swabs will be taken for bacterial culture&#xD;
      sensitivity test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is wound dehiscence, timing of secondary closure will be decided based on wound&#xD;
      health and presence of adequate granulation tissue after a period of regular wound dressing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STASTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN Statistical methods- Linear data will be represented a mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation for normally distributed data and as mean (interquartile range (IQR)) for&#xD;
      not-normally distributed data. Categorical data will represented as percentage (frequency).&#xD;
      Comparison of means will be done with Mann Whitney U test and comparison of proportions with&#xD;
      Chi - squared test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Multivariate modeling with logistic&#xD;
      regression will be used to compare different variables between the primary closure and&#xD;
      delayed primary closure groups.&#xD;
