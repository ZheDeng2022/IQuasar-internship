  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this trial is to confirm the efficacy of Memory and Attention&#xD;
      Adaptation Training (MAAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for treatment of&#xD;
      chemotherapy-related cognitive dysfunction among (female or male) breast cancer survivors.&#xD;
      This is a multi-center, multi-clinician randomized control trial (MAAT vs. supportive therapy&#xD;
      attention control condition). This trial will also evaluate a sub-sample of survivors pre-and&#xD;
      post treatment with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a working memory task to&#xD;
      evaluate pre-to-post treatment brain activation patterns to elucidate underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of clinical therapeutic change.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this multi-site, multi-clinician randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      determine if Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), a cognitive-behavioral therapy&#xD;
      (CBT) intervention, can improve self-reported and objectively measured cognitive functioning&#xD;
      in breast cancer survivors who previously received chemotherapy. Breast cancer survivors&#xD;
      (Stage I-III) who were treated with chemotherapy 1-5 years prior to enrollment and who have&#xD;
      subjective cognitive complaints may be eligible for this study. After eligibility is&#xD;
      confirmed, participants will complete baseline assessments of subjective and objective memory&#xD;
      and attention functioning as well as behavioral rating scales, and will be randomized to MAAT&#xD;
      or Supportive Therapy (ST; to control for therapist time and attention) for 8 weeks. Both&#xD;
      treatments (MAAT and ST) will be delivered through videoconferencing using mobile&#xD;
      (smartphone, laptop or other electronic device) in order to reduce survivor travel or time&#xD;
      away from work or family. Data collection methods will include telephone- and&#xD;
      web-administered measures of subjective and objective cognitive function, as well as various&#xD;
      behavioral ratings. Outcome assessments will be conducted post-treatment and at 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. It is hypothesized that MAAT participants will have significantly improved scores&#xD;
      of self-reported cognitive impairments and objective neurocognitive test scores (on verbal&#xD;
      memory and processing speed) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to participants&#xD;
      randomized to ST. In addition, willing and eligible participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      functional MRI working memory task at baseline and post-treatment, to examine whether those&#xD;
      who receive MAAT show greater increase in brain network activation than those who receive ST.&#xD;
      This may advance understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying improvement of objective&#xD;
      and self-reported cognitive function after chemotherapy. The sample size (n=100/group) will&#xD;
      allow for a 10-15% drop out-rate and still provide 80% power to detect group differences&#xD;
      using two (Group: MAAT vs. ST) by 3 (time: baseline, posttreatment, 6-month follow-up) ANCOVA&#xD;
      at alpha=0.05. Potential baseline differences between MAAT and ST groups on primary outcome&#xD;
      variables or other factors that may affect cognition (e.g., anxiety, fatigue or depression)&#xD;
      will be evaluated as potential covariates, although such differences due to randomization are&#xD;
      not anticipated.&#xD;

    <measure>FACT-Cog PCI</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Post-Treatment (8 weeks) and 6-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-Cog is a 37-item self-report measure that uses 5- point (0-4) Likert-type ratings that produce four scales: 1) Impact on quality of life; 2) Perceived cognitive impairments; 3) Comments from others; and 3) Perceived cognitive abilities. Higher scores indicate better function and quality of life on each scale. While each scale is scored and interpreted separately, they comprise the total Fact-cog assessment. The FACT-Cog has good evidence of reliability and construct validity. We are assessing change in PCI -- from baseline to post-treatment, to 6-month follow-up-- as our primary measure of outcome.</description>

    <measure>California Verbal Learning Test-3 (CVLT-3)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Post-Treatment (8 weeks) and 6-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The California Verbal Learning Test is a neuropsychological assessment of episodic verbal and working memory and processing speed. Participants listen to series of words and is then asked to recall the terms and the category to which they belong. This assessment attempts to measure how much a subject learned and also reveal strategies employed and the types of errors made. Higher CVLT-3 scores are associated with better memory and processing function.</description>

    <measure>Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Post-Treatment (8 weeks) and 6-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), is a neuropsychological measure of verbal fluency. The COWAT consists of three word conditions. Participants are asked to produce as many words as they can that begin with the F, A, or S within a 1 minute time period. The total number of words that the individual is able to produce provides a score. Typically, if someone scores less than 17 words, the test administrator will use additional tests to further evaluate cognition.</description>

    <measure>Digit Span test</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Post-Treatment (8 weeks) and 6-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Digit Span test is a neurocognitive subset of both the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) and the Wechsler Memory Scales (WMS) that assesses working memory. Participants read a sequence of numbers and are asked to repeat the same sequence back to the examiner in order (forward span) or in reverse order (backward span). This assessment generates three &quot;raw&quot; scores and one overall age-appropriate normed (standard) score. Higher scores indicate better working memory and neurocognitive function.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline, Post-Treatment (8 weeks) and 6-Month Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a neurocognitive screening instrument used to assess neurological dysfunction. Participants are required to use a coded key to match nine abstract symbols paired with numerical digits. Ten (10) practice items before commencing the test. The final score is the correct number of substitutions in 90 seconds, and scores range between 0 and 110. Higher scores indicate better neurocognitive functioning.</description>

    <measure>functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Baseline and Post-Treatment (8 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>fMRI assessment of a working memory task (N-Back) will assess brain activation patterns through detection in bloodflow changes. The fMRI N-Back working memory task has been demonstrated to reflect increased activation in response to MAAT treatment among individuals with traumatic brain injury.</description>

Clinicians will set expectations with ST participants that they will be provided validation of experience, support, and encouragement of building their own coping resources if asked directly about what to do about cognitive problems. ST emphasizes reflective listening to help deepen knowledge of the emotional experience of the participant.</description>
