  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this investigation is to obtain more information on the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      respiratory training methods with WellO2 in patients with asthma and COPD. Such a training&#xD;
      may offer an additional, non-pharmacological way for treatment and therapy of asthma and&#xD;
      COPD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Numerous respiratory muscle training (RMT) experiments with healthy subjects, as well as with&#xD;
      patients of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis and asthma, have&#xD;
      been reported since 80's. Respiratory training with WellO2 device was used in a clinical&#xD;
      pilot study by Huttunen and Rantala to investigate effects of steam inhalation and RMT on&#xD;
      voice quality in patients with voice symptoms. No adverse effects were found in that study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to investigate further the RMT and steam inhalation on lung&#xD;
      function and respiratory symptoms with subjects suffering from obstructive diseases such as&#xD;
      asthma and COPD. The results may be used later in statistical power calculations and to&#xD;
      determine the endpoints of larger clinical trial with the investigational device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is still an increasing problem in many countries, even though, incidence of the most&#xD;
      severe asthma cases is in decline due to earlier diagnosis, better control and earlier&#xD;
      intervention practices. The prevalence of asthma and COPD in western countries is around 10 %&#xD;
      and 5 %, respectively. The prevalence of COPD is higher in the countries where smoking and&#xD;
      poor quality of inhaled air are common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment of asthma is based on treatment of eosinophilic inflammation of the airways by&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroids and on treatment of bronchoconstriction by sympathomimetic&#xD;
      bronchodilators, short-acting and long-acting. The drugs may, however, induce side effects&#xD;
      like voice disorders and cardiac symptoms (palpitation, tachycardia and extrasystoles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, in many cases the doses of the drugs cannot continuously be kept at the highest&#xD;
      effective level. Therefore, non-pharmacological methods can complement the treatment&#xD;
      portfolio. The breathing physiotherapy by respiratory muscle training and warm steam&#xD;
      inhalation can offer an additive treatment method for patients with airway obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that training with the combination of positive counter pressure and steam&#xD;
      inhalation methods can induce significant improvement in ventilatory function variables and&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms in asthmatics who have kept their ordinary pharmacological therapy at a&#xD;
      constant level. Based on the previous scientific evidence found on the public domains, it can&#xD;
      be expected that the respiratory muscle strength will be increased offering a possibility for&#xD;
      more effective pulmonary mechanics, ventilation and lung volumes. In addition, exhaling&#xD;
      against resistance will induce a positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) effect which can&#xD;
      open narrowed airways and make the distribution of alveolar ventilation less heterogeneous.&#xD;
      This can improve gas exchange in the lungs and increase the level of low oxygen saturation in&#xD;
      arterial blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COPD, drugs can improve the airway changes, irreversible thickening of the airway walls,&#xD;
      and chronic inflammation only partially. Therefore, breathing physiotherapy may offer an&#xD;
      additive method to improve lung function and gas exchange, and to diminish dyspnoea and other&#xD;
      symptoms like cough. The mechanisms of RMT are principally the same in asthma and COPD.&#xD;
      Patients with obstructive airway disease frequently have both COPD and asthma, partly&#xD;
      reversible or irreversible.&#xD;
