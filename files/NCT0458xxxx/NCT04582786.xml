  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the analgesic effect and the safety of 4 doses of STR-324&#xD;
      administered as an infusion, with or without initial bolus, to patients suffering from&#xD;
      post-operative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensitivity of the pain model used in the trial will be evaluated with a standard group&#xD;
      treated with morphine under the usual care conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first step (single-blind standard group) aims to verify the sensitivity of the study pain&#xD;
      model in the proposed surgery to confirm the validity of the surgery according to their pain&#xD;
      and enrolment rate. 12 patients are planned to be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second step (dose-finding study) is a randomized, double-blind, parallel groups,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial involving a total of 106 patients divided into two groups in which&#xD;
      patients will be randomized between STR-324 and morphine HCl:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: Titration initiated with a bolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Titration without initial bolus.&#xD;
