  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological malignancy. PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors(PARPi) are an important progress in EOC treatment. The available evidence suggests&#xD;
      that BRCAmt or HRD-positive is an effective biological marker for PARPi. However, in our&#xD;
      previous clinical observation, it was found that the tumor burden may be the potential&#xD;
      clinical markers PARPi. We intend to develop a real-world study to confirm the potential&#xD;
      clinical markers and explore new clinical markers for PARPi.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study intends to conduct a systematic real-world study to observe the relationship&#xD;
      between the clinical characteristics of EOC patients and the efficacy of PARPi based on our&#xD;
      existing research foundation and stratified analyse these correlations by BRCA and HRD&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
