      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-four healthy subjects participated in this study (37 male and 37 female). Healthy&#xD;
      subjects were selected because ankle injuries frequently occur during normal locomotion; and&#xD;
      most people, not only athletes, experience an ankle injury at least once during their entire&#xD;
      life.25,27&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting this study power test was performed to determine the number of participants.&#xD;
      Participant's age range was 18 - 30 years old and participants were recruited from university&#xD;
      population, Participants were divided randomly into two groups (Taping group n=37) and&#xD;
      (Bandaging group n=37. Participant were excluded if he/she reports (a) previous hip/pelvis,&#xD;
      knee, ankle, or foot surgery within the past year; (b) lower extremity amputation; (c) injury&#xD;
      to the lower extremities six months; (d) known balance impairment due to neurological&#xD;
      disorder, vestibular disorder, medication use, or other; (f) pregnancy; or (g) concussion&#xD;
      within the previous three months. Standard clinical stability testing of the ankle&#xD;
      ligamentous structures was performed to rule out anterior and lateral talocrural joint&#xD;
      instability and lower extremity injuries during the previous 6 months. Each volunteer signed&#xD;
      an informed consent form before participation. This study was approved by Dokuz E|ylul&#xD;
      university ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Leg length was measured (right and left leg) while participant lying supine, from&#xD;
      the anterior superior iliac spine to the inferior border of the ipsilateral medial malleoli&#xD;
      by using standard measure tape. The dominant leg was determined according to Vauhnik. &amp; ark.&#xD;
      modified version. The limb that was used in at least 2 of the 3 following activities: (1).&#xD;
      Kicking a ball, (2). Drawing a diamond figure on the ground and (3).using his leg and step&#xD;
      over a spider toy, was considered as the dominant leg.30&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle taping Procedures Zinc oxide tape has been was used, its hard - preventive tap. The&#xD;
      taping procedure consists of three separate steps: The first step involved the application of&#xD;
      the anchor tape, which achieved by applying the tape circumferentially just above the&#xD;
      malleolar level at the lower end of the shank. The second step involved the application of&#xD;
      the stirrup. During this step, the foot was held in neutral, and the tape applied to pass&#xD;
      from the medial side of the ankle, under the foot just over the heel area (posterior&#xD;
      one-third of the foot) and up along the lateral side of the ankle. The second step was&#xD;
      repeated to apply the second stirrup. Both ends of the stirrups were firmly attached to the&#xD;
      anchor tape applied during the first step and this attachment was reinforced with a locking&#xD;
      tape during the third and final step by once again applying the tape circumferentially just&#xD;
      above the malleolar level at the lower end of the shank. The taping was applied by a physical&#xD;
      therapist according to the health association requirements.23&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle bandaging Procedures Standard 10 cm width elastic bandage was used. The elastic bandage&#xD;
      was wrapped around the ankle joint to form an 8-figure shape starting from the forefoot. Then&#xD;
      the bandage is taken diagonally upwards, steeply enough to go well above the heel, then&#xD;
      around the lower calf area to form an anchor, then diagonally down across the midfoot, again&#xD;
      wrapped around the forefoot and going diagonally up to finish off around the lower calf,&#xD;
      leaving the heel open.9 Then the participant was allowed to wear his/her sport shoes over the&#xD;
      bandage during the measurement procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance measurement Procedures Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) is a field test and widely&#xD;
      used to assess dynamic postural control, and has an excellent interrater reliability (ICC =&#xD;
      0.86 - 0.92)12. In thıs study the SEBT was used to evaluate balance. 8 strips of athletic&#xD;
      tape with a length of 6 feet were used. Then a '+' sign was formed. Then 'x' sign was formed&#xD;
      with the other two strips. The lines were separated from each other by an angle of 45°. The&#xD;
      participant was asked to wear sports clothes and take off the shoes, then to step on the&#xD;
      center of the grid formed by eight lines using the dominant leg, the plantar aspect of the&#xD;
      first metatarsophalangeal joint (ball of the foot) was positioned on the intersecting lines&#xD;
      at the center of the grid to maintain consistency in foot placement. The participant starts&#xD;
      to reach as possible as far in the eight lines, make a light touch on the line, and return&#xD;
      the reaching leg back to the center, while maintaining a single-leg stance with the other leg&#xD;
      in the center of the grid, starting from anterior direction and progressing clockwise. The&#xD;
      order of the directional reaches was as follows: A, AM, M, PM, P, PL, L, AL. When reaching in&#xD;
      the lateral and posterolateral directions, participants must reach behind the stance leg to&#xD;
      complete the task.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant practiced 6 training attempts to reduce the learning effect, and then after&#xD;
      5-min of rest period participant performed 3 trials in each of the 8 directions, 5-min of&#xD;
      rest period was taken between each one of the three trials. The researcher recorded the&#xD;
      reaching distance using standard tape measure by marking the tape as the distance from the&#xD;
      center of the gird to the maximal reaching point, the average of these three attempts was&#xD;
      calculated and then normalized to the leg length, the obtained result used in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis. If the participant used the stance leg for a high amount of support, was unable to&#xD;
      maintain balance on the stance leg, or removing his feet from the center any time while doing&#xD;
      the trial, the attempt was canceled and repeated again. In the case of a rejected trial,&#xD;
      verbal feedback was given to the participants so they attempt to correct the performance&#xD;
      error(s) on the next trial.13&#xD;
&#xD;
      The balance measurements were done 4 times, (before ankle taping, after 20 minutes while&#xD;
      using ankle taping, after 24 hours while using ankle taping and immediately after removing&#xD;
      the tap (after 24 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioception measurement Procedures Invistigators used the measurement procedure which&#xD;
      described in the study which was doneIris et al23. by The first step: volunteers were seated&#xD;
      in a high chair, and while their eyes are closed, the researcher consecutively on different&#xD;
      graduated surfaces (10° dorsiflexion, neutral position, 10° plantarflexion, and 20°&#xD;
      plantarflexion) respectively, each position will be done for just one time and will be held&#xD;
      for 5 seconds. The researcher told the volunteers that they have to memorize the positions&#xD;
      because they have to do it again by themselves. Simultaneously, each joint position was&#xD;
      recorded to obtain the target angle using the universal goniometer. This was the angle that&#xD;
      the volunteer was instructed to reproduce during the testing part of the study. The second&#xD;
      step: The volunteer was then encouraged to walk freely next to the researcher for 10 minutes,&#xD;
      still blindfolded. The third step: Then the volunteer sat on a high chair that did not allow&#xD;
      his or her feet to touch the floor (to avoid any information from the sole). Finally, the&#xD;
      researcher encouraged the subject to reproduce the four memorized positions, starting from&#xD;
      and finishing in the neutral position each time. The volunteer maintained each ankle&#xD;
      position, announced by the researcher at random, for five seconds. The volunteer's ankle&#xD;
      movement was recorded using the universal goniometer, and this reproduced ankle angle was&#xD;
      called the estimated angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference between the learned positions and the positions that were done by the&#xD;
      volunteer was calculated and documented. Deviation from the learned angle (degrees) described&#xD;
      the direction of Error when subjects tried to reproduce the requested position. Deviation was&#xD;
      obtained by coding net Error, which was based on the correct position occurring when the&#xD;
      learned and estimated angle were equal (±5 degrees)23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position (ROM) measurements were done on four occasions, (before ankle external support,&#xD;
      after 20 minutes while using external support, after 24 hours while using external support&#xD;
      and immediately after removing the external support (after 24 hours).&#xD;
