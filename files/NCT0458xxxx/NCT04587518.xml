  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to explore acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a novel cognitive-behavioral treatment for borderline personality disorder (BPD).&#xD;
      Extant treatments for this condition are intensive, long-term (usually at least one year),&#xD;
      and have, understandably, focused on targeting the life-threatening and therapy-interrupting&#xD;
      behaviors that often characterize this disorder. BPD, however, is a heterogeneous disorder&#xD;
      with diagnostic criteria that can be combined to create over 300 unique symptom presentations&#xD;
      (Ellis, Abrams, &amp; Abrams, 2008); to date, no treatments have been explicitly designed with&#xD;
      lower risk presentations of BPD in mind. This is unfortunate, as there is evidence to suggest&#xD;
      that the majority of individuals with BPD do not demonstrate the recurrent life-threatening&#xD;
      behaviors that warrant intensive, long-term care (Trull, Useda, Conforti, &amp; Doan, 1997;&#xD;
      Zimmerman &amp; Coryell, 1989). Additionally, various studies have shown that the difficulties&#xD;
      experienced by individuals with BPD can be understood as manifestations of maladaptive&#xD;
      variants of personality traits (e.g., Mullins-Sweatt et al., 2012). Specifically, individuals&#xD;
      with BPD demonstrate high levels of neuroticism, and low levels of agreeableness (antagonism)&#xD;
      and conscientiousness (disinhibition); these traits may not be universally present across all&#xD;
      individuals with BPD, perhaps underscoring the heterogeneity in presentations of this&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;

    <description>The study treatment will take place across 18-sessions. The first session will involve psychoeducation regarding BPD.The next two sessions with include exercises drawn from Behavioral Activation (i.e., identification of value-based goals) and Motivational Interviewing (i.e., pros and cons [long and short-term consequences] of tolerating emotions, engaging in prosocial behavior, and delaying gratification). Next, patients will receive 5 sessions of cognitive interventions (i.e., cognitive reappraisal related to situations/emotions, schema related to relationships, 5 sessions of behavior change skills (i.e., acting opposite to emotion-driven urges, exposure, assertiveness training), and 5 sessions of mindfulness skills (i.e., nonjudgmental emotion awareness, compassion training, urge surfing). Finally, treatment will conclude with 2 sessions of Relapse Prevention strategies. All sessions will last for 60 minutes in duration.</description>
