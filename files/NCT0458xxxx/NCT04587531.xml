  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effect of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) treatment on&#xD;
      adults with depression. Scalp based electroencephalogram (EEG) will be utilized to record the&#xD;
      brain activity of participants whilst they perform computer based tasks. The aim is to&#xD;
      understand if there would be changes in the neural signals following CES.&#xD;

      Patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria and volunteer to participate will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to &quot;Active CES Therapy&quot; and &quot;Sham CES Therapy&quot; groups. Before start of the&#xD;
      treatment (active or sham), their medication details or any other form of treatment they are&#xD;
      on will be noted down. These patients will be assessed on self-rated Beck Depression&#xD;
      Inventory and clinician rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. They will be also assessed on&#xD;
      neuropsychological functions of attention, executive functions, memory, information&#xD;
      processing and emotional processing evaluation using Emotional Test Battery. In addition, 25&#xD;
      patients from each group will undergo EEG recording whilst they perform computer based tasks.&#xD;
      These assessments will take place at 4 time points (Pre-treatment, 1 month after treatment,&#xD;
      at 3 months, and at 6 months after treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use scalp based electroencephalogram (EEG) to record the brain activity of&#xD;
      participants whilst they perform computer based tasks. The aim is to understand if there&#xD;
      would be changes in the neural signals following cranial electrotherapy stimulation.&#xD;
      Investigators propose to use EEG to investigate if CES therapy will modulate brain responses&#xD;
      in a way that leads to better information processing as a mechanism to improve depression.&#xD;
      Furthermore, researchers will also investigate changes in EEG based brain connectivity&#xD;
      patterns following CES therapy. Therefore, as a mechanism of action for CES therapy could be&#xD;
      changes in the functional brain connectivity for efficient information processing. EEG&#xD;
      investigation will be helpful to understand this connectivity based mechanism following CES.&#xD;
