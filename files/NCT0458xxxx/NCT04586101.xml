  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemophilia is often associated with chronic pain, functional restrictions and negative&#xD;
      consequences regarding the individual physical performance, especially on basic motoric&#xD;
      skills, activities of daily life and quality of life. Caused by high benefits, physical&#xD;
      activity is a fixed component and recommendation in the guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      haemophilia. Several studies showed that goal-directed physical activity is feasible for&#xD;
      patients with haemophilia (PwH) without any complications or bleeding episodes. Nevertheless,&#xD;
      there are difficulties in the implementation of supervised sports therapy for PwH regarding&#xD;
      local distributions and uncertainties concerning correct exercise execution on patients´ side&#xD;
      and in the monitoring and adequate training regulation from long distances on the therapeutic&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this project is a patient-related and participative development and pre-evaluation of&#xD;
      a mobile application to generate an online-guided, individualized home training for PwH,&#xD;
      followed by pre-evaluation in terms of a twelve weeks interventional phase. The intention of&#xD;
      this project is to show, that a mobile device is an appropriate way to increase physical&#xD;
      activity of PwH. Due to the development of an innovative trainings application, adapted to&#xD;
      the needs of PwH, a larger number of patients should be reached and supported later on in&#xD;
      participating on supervised physical exercise to improve the individual physical performance&#xD;
      and therefore the quality of life. Additionally, with an individualized exercise program also&#xD;
      adapted to the specific interests, needs and physical conditions, PwH at any age can be&#xD;
      addressed. Furthermore, in cooperation with the patient, the medical staff will get&#xD;
      systematic information of patients´ exercise activities to generate optimal factor and&#xD;
      overall treatment patterns. In addition, on the basis of the mobile device PwH will be able&#xD;
      to comprehend their individual exercise performance and to get an overview of the individual&#xD;
      trainings progress and improvements of physical performance with the purpose to enhance the&#xD;
      processes of self-motivation. Detailed instructions and information of exercise execution,&#xD;
      need of exercise and physical adaptions to be achieved, will minimize complications and&#xD;
      support patients´ self-confident for participating on exercise.&#xD;
