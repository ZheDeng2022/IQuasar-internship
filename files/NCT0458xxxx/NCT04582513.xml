  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to collect information on feasibility and effect size of a&#xD;
      confirmatory, prospective study with the question: Does a standardized checklist during&#xD;
      intraoperative handover of anaesthesia care reduce the rate of postoperative complications?&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During clinical routine, intraoperative handover of anaesthesia care occurs frequently. This&#xD;
      handover between two anaesthesiologists requires the transmission of all relevant information&#xD;
      concerning the patient and the ongoing procedure. Studies regarding the influence of such&#xD;
      handovers on patient outcome are inconclusive and mostly of retrospective nature. Some&#xD;
      studies report a negative effect of handovers on patients mortality and outcome, however&#xD;
      studies exist reporting no effect. A positive effect of intraoperative handovers as a result&#xD;
      of a &quot;second man&quot; effect ist also possible. To increase handover quality, the German Society&#xD;
      of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine (DGAI) recommends the application of the&#xD;
      situation, background, assessment and recommendation (SBAR) concept. Information are arranged&#xD;
      in those four groups with the goal of structuring the handover and incorporating all relevant&#xD;
      information. Studies show increased accuracy of transferred information and improved&#xD;
      comprehensibility when using the SBAR concept. Whether an intraoperative handover according&#xD;
      to the SBAR concept reduces the rate of postoperative complications is not yet investigated.&#xD;
      Due to lack of information regarding feasibility and effect size, the investigators plan a&#xD;
      prospective pilot study to answer these questions. Initially, patients undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery are recruited where handover is performed without a standardized handover. After the&#xD;
      implementation of a checklist using the SBAR concept, this checklist will be used during&#xD;
      intraoperative handover in recruited patients where a handover occurs. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is a combined endpoint consisting of all-cause mortality, readmission to any hospital, or&#xD;
      major postoperative complications. Additionally, implementation rate and efficacy of the&#xD;
      checklist will be evaluated.&#xD;
