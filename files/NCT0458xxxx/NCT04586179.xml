      Primary Aim: Compare physiological (e.g., heart rate) and clinical responses (e.g., symptom&#xD;
      provocation) of adolescent and adult athletes (14-35 years of age) completing either a&#xD;
      structured treadmill running or a dynamic aerobic exertion protocol during the subacute phase&#xD;
      of sport-related concussion recovery (3-30 days after injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim: Examine potential effects of clinically-relevant factors that influence&#xD;
      symptom responses to controlled aerobic exertion, such as age, physical activity patterns,&#xD;
      motion sensitivities, psychological responses to injury, and sleep quality, among subjects&#xD;
      completing controlled aerobic and dynamic exertion following sport-related concussion&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise testing is an emerging component of the clinical evaluation for sport-related&#xD;
      concussion. Despite the growing empirical evidence to suggest that early activity following&#xD;
      an initial rest period after injury is beneficial to recovery, the effects of modifiable&#xD;
      exercise prescription factors (e.g., exercise mode, duration, and intensity) is unknown.&#xD;
      Given that dynamic exertion, which incorporates synchronized head-body movements, may&#xD;
      contribute greater information processing demands for the functional pathways responsible for&#xD;
      balance and equilibrium than treadmill running, may be more likely to provoke symptoms during&#xD;
      exertion. Thus, physically active (&gt;150 min/week of moderate-intensity physical activity)&#xD;
      participants prior to a diagnosed sport-related concussion will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      complete either an aerobic or dynamic exercise task at 1 study visit following injury.&#xD;

    <time_frame>At 1 study visit within 30 days following concussion, and within 15 minutes of initiating exercise until approximately 15 minutes after exercise cessation</time_frame>
    <description>Concussion symptoms will be measured with the Post-concussion Symptom Scale (PCSS), a patient-report survey of 22 concussion-associated symptoms on a 0-6 Likert scale (0 'none' to 6 'severe'). Number of reported symptoms (range: 0- 22) and total symptom severity (range: 0-132) whereby greater scores indicate worse symptom burden will be examined. The survey takes approximately 5 minutes to complete</description>

    <measure>Heart Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 study visit within 30 days following concussion, and within 15 minutes of initiating exercise until approximately 15 minutes after exercise cessation</time_frame>
    <description>Actual and percent of age-estimated heart rate, measured in beats per minute , will be recorded prior to (approximately 5 min), during, and following (approximately 5 min) exercise via a noninvasive heart rate monitor. Heart rate at rest, exercise cessation, and their difference (maximum heart rate - resting heart rate) will be recorded.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 study visit within 30 days following concussion, and within 15 minutes of initiating exercise until approximately 15 minutes after exercise cessation</time_frame>
    <description>Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, measured in mmHg with a non-invasive blood pressure cuff, will be recorded prior to and following exercise intervention.</description>

    <measure>Exercise duration</measure>
    <time_frame>Completed during the 1 study visit within 30 days following concussion</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise duration, the time interval between exercise initiation and cessation, will be recorded in seconds (range: 0-900)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical recovery</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, approximately between 3 and 30 days following concussion</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of clinical recovery, measured in days, is the interval between injury onset until medical clearance to resume unrestricted sport participation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in vestibular ocular motor screening (VOMS) symptoms from pre-exercise to post-exercise</measure>
    <time_frame>At 1 study visit within 30 days following concussion, and within 15 minutes of initiating exercise until approximately 15 minutes after exercise cessation</time_frame>
    <description>The vestibular/ocular motor screening (VOMS) tool is a brief (approximately 5 minutes) patient-reported assessment to screen for vestibular and ocular motor impairments after concussion. Participants report on a 0-10 Likert scale (0 'none' to 10 'severe') prior to and following each of the 7 VOMS sub-tests: smooth pursuits, horizontal saccades, vertical saccades, near-point of convergence, horizontal vestibular-ocular reflex, vertical vestibular-ocular reflex, visual motion sensitivity; and near point of convergence (NPC) distance. Symptoms will be totaled across all symptoms and sub-tests (maximum=240) whereby greater scores indicate worse symptom burden.</description>
