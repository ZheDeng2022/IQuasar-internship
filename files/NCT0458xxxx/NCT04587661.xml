  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      African Americans living with chronic health conditions are more likely to experience&#xD;
      depression and other mental health disorders than their healthy counterparts, and are more&#xD;
      likely to experience severe depression than whites, but less likely to be diagnosed or&#xD;
      receive treatment. One especially vulnerable group is patients with sickle cell disease&#xD;
      (SCD), a genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent, many of&#xD;
      whom live in disadvantaged circumstances and are cared for in under-resourced settings. SCD&#xD;
      causes severe acute and chronic pain, end-organ damage, and early mortality. Patients&#xD;
      transitioning from adolescence to adulthood (ages16-30) are at high risk for mental health&#xD;
      disorders and suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using mobile technology, the investigators can provide high-quality, evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral mental health treatment that reaches patients in different settings. Digital&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is effective for treating depression and anxiety and can&#xD;
      be brought to scale at low cost. Despite the promise of digital CBT, there are barriers to&#xD;
      its widespread use, particularly in low-resource settings serving minorities. Qualitative&#xD;
      data show that cultural factors-lack of relatability, representation, and perceived stigma&#xD;
      regarding mental health treatment-limit engagement with digital CBT programs. Population-and&#xD;
      setting-specific adaptations to interventions can lead to their successful implementation and&#xD;
      wider use. The investigators will work with a digital CBT program to decrease stigma and make&#xD;
      it more relatable and relevant to young adults with SCD, by devising changes to advertising&#xD;
      and promotion, and tailoring communication with an integrated health coach, Aim 1: Use&#xD;
      implementation science (ImS) and human-centered design methods to define the barriers to&#xD;
      delivering routine mental health screening and digital CBT to adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      with SCD. Aim 2: Rapidly iterate, test, and evaluate adaptations to the implementation&#xD;
      strategy for a coach-enhanced digital mental health service. Aim 3: Demonstrate that a&#xD;
      population-specific implementation strategy improves engagement with a digital CBT-based&#xD;
      mental health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will capitalize on our mobile technology tools, interdisciplinary&#xD;
      expertise, and community-based partnerships to investigate the implementation of digital CBT&#xD;
      into low-resource clinics and community-based organizations serving adolescents and adults&#xD;
      with sickle cell disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      African Americans living with chronic medical conditions are at high risk for depression and&#xD;
      other mental health disorders yet are less likely to be diagnosed or receive treatment than&#xD;
      their white counterparts. Left untreated, depression can increase disease severity and risk&#xD;
      for mortality. One especially vulnerable group is patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), a&#xD;
      genetic blood disorder that primarily affects people of African descent and&#xD;
      disproportionately impacts those living in disadvantaged circumstances. Sickle cell causes&#xD;
      severe acute and chronic pain, end-organ damage, and early mortality. In SCD, the transition&#xD;
      from adolescence to adulthood is a tumultuous period, characterized by social vulnerability,&#xD;
      increased medical complications, and high health care utilization. Young adults in this age&#xD;
      group, 16-30, are at high risk for mental health disorders and suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using mobile technology, the investigators can provide high-quality, evidence-based&#xD;
      behavioral mental health treatment that reaches patients in under-resourced settings. Digital&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), also known as computerized CBT, is effective for treating&#xD;
      depression and anxiety, and can be easily brought to scale at low cost. Several meta-analyses&#xD;
      have found digital CBT effective for treating depression and anxiety in white adults. The&#xD;
      investigators' group has shown in a large-scale trial that it is effective for treating these&#xD;
      symptoms among African American patients at 22 primary care clinics. In two adult sickle cell&#xD;
      clinics, the investigators have shown that routine mental health screening and digital CBT&#xD;
      delivered as part of usual care can improve depressive symptoms and daily pain among adults&#xD;
      with SCD. The investigators' group has also used this method to treat pain in pediatric SCD&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gap in evidence: Despite the promise of digital CBT, there are barriers to widespread use of&#xD;
      this technology, particularly in low-resource settings serving minorities. Studies using&#xD;
      digital CBT often suffer from high attrition and poor adherence. In real-world settings,&#xD;
      uptake is poor even when the service is offered free of charge. These limitations affect&#xD;
      patients living with SCD. The investigators will modify how a digital CBT program for mental&#xD;
      health is delivered to these patient sat the patient, provider, and organizational levels, by&#xD;
      adding references and content representing SCD, chronic pain, and stressors unique to African&#xD;
      Americans. The investigators believe this approach will radically improve the implementation&#xD;
      of mental health screening and treatment in low-resource settings such as clinics and&#xD;
      community organizations serving adolescents and adults with SCD, and similar communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategy and goals: Population-and setting-specific adaptations to interventions can lead to&#xD;
      their successful implementation and wider use, yet no studies show how much adaptation is&#xD;
      needed to effectively implement digital CBT in different settings. Qualitative data from The&#xD;
      investigators' group and others show that cultural factors-lack of relatability,&#xD;
      representation, and perceived stigma regarding mental health treatment-limit engagement with&#xD;
      digital CBT programs. The investigators' proposal will devise changes to advertising,&#xD;
      promotion, and health coach communications, that will decrease stigma and make digital CBT&#xD;
      more relatable and relevant to young adults with SCD. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      low-cost adaptations to a digital CBT program will have better engagement than digital CBT&#xD;
      with standard implementation strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Use implementation science (ImS) and human-centered design methods to define the&#xD;
      barriers to delivering routine mental health screening and digital CBT to adolescents and&#xD;
      young adults with SCD. By leveraging ImS theory, models, and frameworks, The investigators&#xD;
      will systematically collect and analyze qualitative data to define and understand the&#xD;
      problem, stakeholder needs, and cultural barriers to routine mental health screening and&#xD;
      treatment in SCD clinics and the community. Specifically, the investigators will use the&#xD;
      Behavior Change Wheel as a validated method for identifying the appropriate behavior change&#xD;
      and implementation strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Rapidly iterate, test, and evaluate adaptations to the implementation strategy for a&#xD;
      coach-enhanced digital mental health service. Based on findings from Aim 1, the investigators&#xD;
      will systematically develop, test, and evaluate changes to how the CBT program is&#xD;
      advertised/promoted, and introduced to patients and providers. The investigators will tailor&#xD;
      the messages and multimedia content that health coaches send to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Demonstrate that a population-specific implementation strategy improves engagement&#xD;
      with a digital CBT-based mental health service. The investigators will recruit 40 adolescents&#xD;
      and young adults with SCD (ages 16-30) and comorbid depression and randomize them to either&#xD;
      the off-the-shelf digital CBT program and standard implementation strategy that has no&#xD;
      content or references to SCD, chronic pain, or the unique challenges facing minority groups,&#xD;
      to adapted digital CBT with a SCD-specific implementation approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addressing mental health in SCD is a major step to delivering quality care and improving&#xD;
      outcomes for this, and other hard-to-reach, minority populations. This study will generate&#xD;
      the necessary data and infrastructure to conduct a large scale, R01-funded, multi-site&#xD;
      pragmatic trial to determine how digital CBT can be used as an effective, low-cost, and&#xD;
      scalable mental health treatment for adolescents and young adults with SCD.&#xD;
