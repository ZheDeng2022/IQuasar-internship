  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Burn injury as well as diabetes mellitus (DM) induce physical functional and psychological&#xD;
      impairments. Lower limb burn involving Foot are still a challenging heath condition because&#xD;
      of its important sensory role. Balance is disturbed either in patients with lower limb burn&#xD;
      injury or diabetic patients. This study aime to compare between the effects whole body&#xD;
      vibrational training and Yoga exercises on postural balance, and Activities-specific Balance&#xD;
      Confidence in in type II diabetic Patients with foot burn&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thirty eight diabetic patients (17 male, 21female) with foot burn injury, with their age&#xD;
      ranged from 40 to 55 years. They will randomly assigned into two equal groups. Group (A) will&#xD;
      receive low vibrational training in the form of whole body vibration for 8 weeks (n=19),&#xD;
      while group (B) the control group for 8 weeks (n=19) in addition both groups will receive&#xD;
      their routine medical care and physical therapy rehabilitation including balancing exercises.&#xD;
      Dynamic balance will be evaluated through Biodex balance system (BBS);and balance confidence&#xD;
      will be measured by the Activities-specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) before the&#xD;
      starting and after the end of treatment for all patients in both groups&#xD;

    <description>Biodex Balance System was used to measure the dynamic balance of each patient in both groups (A and B) before and after 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
The system has a movable balance platform that permits about 20◦ tilt in 360◦ range, and is interfaced with computer software for objective balance assessment. It measures the ability of the patient to control the platform's tilting angle, which is quantified as a variation from the center, as well as the deflection degree over time at different stability levels</description>

    <description>A short,six-question version of the Activities-specific Balance scale, the Activities-specific Balance scale. Individuals report their balance confidence in six tasks: standing on tiptoes and reaching for something overhead, standing on a chair to reach for something, being bumped into by people while walking through a mall, stepping off an escalator holding onto the railing, stepping off an escalator without holding onto the railing, and walking on an icy sidewalk ABC scores range between 0% and 100%, with higher scores indicating better balance confidence</description>
