  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fecal contamination from animal sources, specifically chickens, is increasingly recognized as&#xD;
      a risk factor for enteric infections in low-income countries where domestic animals are often&#xD;
      kept in close proximity to living quarters. Community members typically allow chickens to&#xD;
      move freely around their compound and in their homes. Unlike other animals, such as cows or&#xD;
      goats, poultry are typically not confined and their feces, which are relatively small, are&#xD;
      considered relatively innocuous and therefore largely ignored by adults and children. In this&#xD;
      study, we implement an intervention to help rural poultry owners with children to&#xD;
      hygienically separate chickens from children by focusing on a small set of key factors,&#xD;
      including increased risk perception, increased perception of potential livelihood benefits,&#xD;
      increased skills, and increased supportive social norms. We hypothesize that the poultry&#xD;
      hygiene intervention will lead to improved poultry management practices, which will in turn&#xD;
      lead to reduced fecal contamination in the domestic environment and subsequently reduced&#xD;
      diarrheal illness in young children. To measure these parameters along the causal chain, we&#xD;
      will use a combination of household surveys, spot check observations and testing of&#xD;
      environmental samples for fecal contamination.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will consist of a series of participatory training exercises designed to accomplish three main goals: (1) increase awareness of health risks and lost livelihood benefits of current poultry management practices, (2) build practical skills for poultry management, and (3) build supportive community norms by facilitating savings group discussions on poultry management. The intervention will be delivered through three activities: (1) triggering exercise designed to raise awareness of both the health risks of the current practices and the economic potential of a more active poultry management approach, and ultimately to motivate participants for behavior change, (2) poultry management training activity based on local needs and norms, and (3) periodic follow-on coaching to reinforce messages from the initial training and emphasize action planning, monitoring of plan execution, and troubleshooting.</description>
