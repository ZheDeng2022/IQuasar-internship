  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The safe, highly-effective human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine remains underused in the US;&#xD;
      only 51% of 13- to 17-year-old girls and boys were up-to-date by 2018. The Announcement&#xD;
      Approach Training is effective in increasing HPV vaccine uptake during the clinic visit by&#xD;
      training providers to make strong vaccine recommendations and answer parents' common&#xD;
      questions. Systems communication like recall notifications also improve vaccination by&#xD;
      reducing missed clinical opportunities. Although never tested to support HPV vaccination, the&#xD;
      ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) Model is a proven implementation strategy&#xD;
      to promote capacity exchange between health care experts at academic centers and primary care&#xD;
      providers at the front line of rural community health care. The trial will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of two ECHO-delivered HPV vaccination communication interventions versus&#xD;
      control: HPV ECHO will provide Announcement Approach training, and HPV ECHO+ will provide&#xD;
      training plus recall notices to communicate with parents who initially decline vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will recruit 36 primary care clinics (family medicine and pediatric) in&#xD;
      Pennsylvania. Eligible clinics will have at least 100 active patients, ages 11-14, in their&#xD;
      electronic health record systems. Recruitment will target clinics in Central Pennsylvania,&#xD;
      where most counties are designated as rural. Clinics will be randomized to one of three arms:&#xD;
      ECHO-delivered HPV vaccine communication training using the Announcement Approach (HPV ECHO);&#xD;
      HPV ECHO plus systems follow-up communication for parents who initially decline vaccination&#xD;
      (HPV ECHO+); or control. Covariate-constrained randomization will be used to ensure balance&#xD;
      among the three arms with respect to clinic size (adolescent patient population), clinic type&#xD;
      (academic vs. non-academic), rurality, and historic adolescent HPV vaccination rates.&#xD;

    <description>Using proven adult learning techniques and interactive video technology, the ECHO Model promotes knowledge exchange between experts or specialists at centers of excellence (&quot;the hub&quot;) and primary care providers (the &quot;spokes), typically located in rural settings. Through regular real-time collaborative sessions, the spokes connect with the hub and with other spokes to discuss 1) best practices in care and 2) complex cases managed within their practice.</description>
