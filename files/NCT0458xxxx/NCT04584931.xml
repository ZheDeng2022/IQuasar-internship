    <textblock>
      Treatment of gingival recession requires favourable anatomical conditions and the use of&#xD;
      invasive surgical approaches. Hence, these procedures are not always indicated in all cases&#xD;
      and can cause great pain and morbidity. Coloured composite restorations that mimic the lost&#xD;
      gingival tissues can provide a non-invasive and simple solution regardless of the recession&#xD;
      soft and hard-tissue conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingival recession (also known as marginal tissue recession) is defined as the downward&#xD;
      displacement of the soft tissues around teeth that would have been otherwise covering the&#xD;
      cemento-enamel junction (CEJ), thus exposing the root surface clinically. Recession is one of&#xD;
      the most prevalent mucogingival conditions worldwide, affecting between 30% to 100% of the&#xD;
      overall population, and its incidence increases with age. Main concerns regarding recession&#xD;
      ranging from unacceptable esthetics to the patient, dentinal hypersensitivity, development of&#xD;
      carious and non-carious cervical lesions, or impairment of adequate plaque control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate aim for treating gingival recession is to provide complete coverage of the root&#xD;
      with optimal esthetics and function. A wide range of surgical interventions have been&#xD;
      investigated to provide for successful root coverage including rotational and advanced&#xD;
      pedicle flaps, free gingival grafts, or regenerative modalities such as guided tissue&#xD;
      regeneration. The predictability of surgical techniques depends on patient related factors&#xD;
      such as smoking, oral hygiene care and compliance, defect related conditions like depth,&#xD;
      width, gingival thickness and interdental attachment level, and finally, operator related&#xD;
      skills and experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronally advanced flap (CAF) with or without the use of connective tissue graft is&#xD;
      considered the gold standard for root coverage due to its ability to achieve complete root&#xD;
      coverage in favorable defects, superior esthetic outcomes and blending with surrounding&#xD;
      gingiva, and the possible realignment and increase in keratinized tissue height. On the other&#xD;
      hand, CAF is faced with multiple drawbacks. Complete root coverage in CAF procedures is not&#xD;
      predictable in cases with interdental attachment loss. The surgery poses added morbidity,&#xD;
      discomfort and pain, and donor site (if present) may augment these complications. Scar&#xD;
      formation as a result of incisions or sutures may reduce the overall esthetic appeal. It&#xD;
      requires frequent follow-up visits and arduous post-operative instructions. Post-operative&#xD;
      results are not stable over long period of time with frequent relapse. The procedure cannot&#xD;
      be performed in cases with systemic contraindications for surgical interventions. And&#xD;
      finally, it is time-consuming and requires surgical skill and training of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome all of the abovementioned drawbacks of CAF, composite resin restorative material&#xD;
      with pink shades known as &quot;gingival composite&quot; has been proposed to manage gingival&#xD;
      recessions. Root coverage with composite is known to effectively reduce dentinal&#xD;
      hypersensitivity effectively. Hence, managing gingival recession with this restorative&#xD;
      procedure, the patients concerns regarding esthetics or hypersensitivity can be directly&#xD;
      addressed using a simple and fast technique. Compared to CAF, restorative procedure shows&#xD;
      less pain, morbidity and bleeding, and it does not involve surgical incisions/sutures and&#xD;
      hence avoids no scar formation. Pink composite can be presented as a solution in cases that&#xD;
      are not expected to benefit from CAF such as RT3, and it can treat carious and non-carious&#xD;
      cervical lesions in one step. In addition, it requires less operative time and can be&#xD;
      performed by general practitioners and with conventional armamentarium.&#xD;
