      The role of the left ventricular diastolic function (LVDD) in the weaning failure from&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation in unclear. Specifically, is unclear whether the outcome of the&#xD;
      weaning process could be affected by a pre-existing LVDD (before ICU admission), or by the&#xD;
      worsening of a chronic pattern, or by a de-novo LVDD presentation.&#xD;

      Bedside echocardiography plays a critical diagnostic role in patients with heart failure,&#xD;
      being other examinations (i.e., physical examination, electrocardiogram, and chest&#xD;
      radiograph) unable to provide key information to discriminate between diastolic and systolic&#xD;
      heart failure. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) can assess diastolic function by means of&#xD;
      the doppler filling pattern, and can non-invasively measure intracardiac pressure at the&#xD;
      bedside.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During sinus rhythm, diastolic flow shows the E and A waves, which reflects early diastolic&#xD;
      filling and atrial contraction in the late diastole, respectively. Velocity of blood flow&#xD;
      across the mitral valve depends on the trans-mitral pressure gradient; then, E-wave velocity&#xD;
      is influenced both by the rate of early diastolic relaxation and by the left atrial pressure.&#xD;
      Changes of the velocity pattern can suggest left ventricular diastolic function (LVDD) and&#xD;
      prognosis, although mitral inflow patterns are highly susceptible to loading conditions&#xD;
      (mainly left atrial pressure). LVDD is quite is a condition quite common in the population. A&#xD;
      cross-sectional survey of over 2000 randomly selected Minnesota residents aged 45 years or&#xD;
      older found an incidence of LVDD almost five times higher than LV systolic dysfunction (28%&#xD;
      vs. 6%, respectively), which was a strong predictor of mortality (hazard ratio ranging from&#xD;
      8.3 for mild LVDD to 10.2 for at-least-moderate LVDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomly recruited population sample (n = 539; 50.5% women; mean age, 52.5 years), the&#xD;
      prevalence of the LVDD in those patients older than 50 y.o. was of about 50%5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doppler echocardiography could be a noninvasive tool for the detection of weaning-induced&#xD;
      left ventricular filling pressure elevation. Transmitral flow can help measure peak Doppler&#xD;
      velocities of E and A waves. E/A ratio has been proposed to estimate the left ventricular&#xD;
      filling pressure. Tissue Doppler imaging can measure early diastolic mitral annular velocity&#xD;
      (E'), which is a load-independent indicator of myocardial relaxation. The combination of&#xD;
      tissue Doppler imaging and pulsed Doppler transmitral flow can allow the computation of the&#xD;
      E/E' ratio, which is one of the best echocardiographic estimate of left ventricular filling&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of LVDD in critically ill patients is probably greatly underestimated by&#xD;
      intensivists, probably because in the past diastolic function was difficult to evaluate at&#xD;
      the bedside6. The LVDD in intensive care unit (ICU) patients can affect the outcome of&#xD;
      weaning from mechanical ventilation, especially in septic patients. In fact, cardiogenic&#xD;
      pulmonary edema has been recognized as a highly incident cause of weaning failure.&#xD;
      Unsuccessful weaning from mechanical ventilation occurs in approximately 20% of patients and&#xD;
      is related to prolonged mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit,&#xD;
      and increased morbidity and mortality. It has been proved that a spontaneous breathing trial&#xD;
      (SBT) increases the left ventricular filling pressure, leading to cardiogenic pulmonary edema&#xD;
      and impaired gas exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, studies focused on the impact of that medical condition on weaning showed&#xD;
      conflicting results. Moreover, heterogeneous definitions and measurements of LVDD have been&#xD;
      provided, associated to different form of SBTs. Furthermore, the majority carried out a&#xD;
      cross-sectional assessment of the LVDD before and after the SBT, not including changes in the&#xD;
      diastolic function during the ICU stay. All these variables limit the comparability and the&#xD;
      clinical applications of these studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, LV diastolic function depends on myocardial relaxation, LV stiffness, and filling&#xD;
      pressures, which are frequently impaired during the ICU stay (e.g., progression of the&#xD;
      disease, volume resuscitation, positive end-expiratory pressure, administration of inotropes,&#xD;
      vasopressors, etc). It is still uncertain whether the SBT failure could be affected by&#xD;
      pre-existing conditions (i.e. a LVDD present at the ICU admission) or by a worsening of the&#xD;
      cardiac function after the ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a matter of fact, the assessment of LVDD at the bedside is not routinely performed before&#xD;
      the SBT and the role of the degree of the LVDD in still not defined. Moreover, it unclear&#xD;
      whether the outcome of the weaning process could be affected by a pre-existing LVDD (before&#xD;
      ICU admission), or by the worsening of a chronic pattern, or by a de-novo LVDD presentation.&#xD;
