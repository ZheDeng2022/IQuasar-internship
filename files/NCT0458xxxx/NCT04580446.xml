  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm Phase I study of de-intensified hypofractionated radiation therapy for&#xD;
      favorable human papilloma virus-associated oropharynx cancer. It will evaluate the&#xD;
      tolerability of a de-intensified hypofractionated radiation therapy regimen completed in 3&#xD;
      weeks (with equivalent biologically effective dose to 60 Gy in 30 fractions) with concurrent&#xD;
      weekly cisplatin.&#xD;

      Standard of care radiation therapy (RT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)&#xD;
      involves conventional fractionation delivered over a course of 7 weeks. Although&#xD;
      hypofractionated RT (HFRT) delivering higher dose of RT each day over a shorter overall&#xD;
      treatment time has been studied and adopted as standard of care in many disease sites&#xD;
      including breast and prostate cancers, data on HFRT in HNSCC is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a strong radiobiological rationale for HFRT for HNSCC to decrease the overall&#xD;
      treatment time and thus the effects of accelerated repopulation in this disease entity. In&#xD;
      addition, if similar outcomes can be achieved with a reduced number of fractions, cost&#xD;
      effectiveness of care can be improved while minimizing the disruption to the patient's&#xD;
      personal and professional lives. A substantial decrease in treatment time may improve&#xD;
      compliance and financial toxicity associated with the patient's oncologic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The global COVID-19 pandemic is highlighting the health risk to society at large of having no&#xD;
      viable alternative to a 7 week daily RT course for HNSCC, especially in the setting of&#xD;
      compromised immune systems associated with concurrent chemotherapy frequently used in this&#xD;
      patient population. Thus, the study of HFRT for HNSCC is both timely and potentially paradigm&#xD;
      changing for practices across the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of human papilloma virus (HPV)-associated oropharynx cancer is increasing in&#xD;
      the United States, now accounting for 70-80% of all oropharynx cancers. It has a favorable&#xD;
      prognosis vs. non-HPV-associated cancers and studies are ongoing to determine the best&#xD;
      strategy to de-intensified therapy while maintaining good oncologic outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this single-arm Phase I study is to assess the tolerability and signal for&#xD;
      efficacy of de-intensified HFRT for favorable HPV-associated oropharynx cancer.&#xD;
      De-intensification will be achieved in two ways. First, the equivalent biologically effective&#xD;
      dose (BED) of HFRT used on trial will be 60 Gy of conventionally fractionationated RT (vs.&#xD;
      the current standard of care of 70 Gy). Second, the elective nodal volume irradiated will be&#xD;
      limited to involved nodal levels and one immediately adjacent level (vs. the current standard&#xD;
      of care of entire bilateral neck nodal regions). Patients will complete RT in 15 fractions (3&#xD;
      weeks) with concurrent weekly cisplatin on dose level 0, and if well tolerated, escalate to&#xD;
      level 1 delivering RT in 12 fractions (3 weeks). If a 3-week regimen is not well-tolerated, a&#xD;
      20 fraction regimen will be used on dose level -1.&#xD;
