  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The researchers are trying to determine whether a smartwatch and a mobile application, which&#xD;
      together deliver activity and goal setting notifications, can increase activity levels for&#xD;
      patients enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The VALENTINE Cardiac Rehabilitation Study will evaluate a digital intervention to supplement&#xD;
      cardiac rehabilitation for low- and moderate risk patients, integrating a mobile application&#xD;
      with physiologic and contextual information from wearables to provide incremental support to&#xD;
      patients. The study will be performed in conjunction with planned home-, hybrid-, or&#xD;
      center-based cardiac rehabilitation at Michigan Medicine. Participants will be randomized to&#xD;
      the control or telehealth group. Both groups will receive a smartwatch and usual care.&#xD;
      Participants in the telehealth arm will additionally (1) have access to activity tracking and&#xD;
      goal setting through the VALENTINE app; (2) receive micro-randomized, contextually tailored&#xD;
      notifications, and (3) receive weekly activity summaries via email, which will also be&#xD;
      provided to their exercise physiologist while enrolled in cardiac rehabilitation.&#xD;
      Contextually tailored notifications will be one of two types: walking and exercise&#xD;
      notifications. Walking notifications are designed to encourage participants to be active&#xD;
      though at lower than their target heart rate zone. Participants will receive 1 notification&#xD;
      per day, on average, at one of four times. Notifications will be randomized on four&#xD;
      dimensions of context. Exercise notifications are designed to encourage participants to&#xD;
      exercise within their target heart rate zone. Notifications will be delivered each evening at&#xD;
      a time of the participant's choosing. Participants will have a 50% probability of receiving a&#xD;
      notification each evening. Notifications will be randomized on two dimensions of context.&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for 6-months. Participants in both arms will be asked to&#xD;
      complete a 6-minute walk test at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months using their mobile phone&#xD;
      and smartwatch. They will additionally complete general and disease-specific quality-of-life&#xD;
      questionnaires at baseline and at 6-months.&#xD;
