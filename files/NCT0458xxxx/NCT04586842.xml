  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this research project is to analyze the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      Community-based Occupational Therapy Intervention on mental health for people with acquired&#xD;
      brain injury. To this end, variables such as quality of life, occupational performance and&#xD;
      balance, participation in significant roles and community integration will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be carried out as a non-randomized controlled trial study in which the&#xD;
      participants in the experimental arm will receive a community-based occupational therapy&#xD;
      intervention (domiciliary and telehealth intervention sessions) based on the stages of the&#xD;
      Human Occupation Model's Remotivation Process. The participants at the control arm will&#xD;
      receive the regular (public or private) services provision for this population profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected to be able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the intervention based on a&#xD;
      positive result in the change in the variables, so as to increase the chance and performance&#xD;
      of occupational participation after the acquired brain injury. Also, it is intended that&#xD;
      families and the community are key elements of agency and support in occupational&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;

    <description>The scale represents a uniform measurement system for functional independence based on the International Classification of Impairment, Disabilities and Handicaps. It assesses six functional areas (self-care, sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication and social cognition) within two domains (motor and cognitive). Each item is scored on a 7-point Likert-type scale. The items are performance-based rather than ability-based and are recorded in a hetero-administered manner.</description>

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adults with a diagnosis of medium or severe ABI and a diagnosis of neurocognitive disorder&#xD;
        following ABI (as recognised in the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of&#xD;
        Mental Disorders (DSM-5); by definition: evidence of significant cognitive decline from&#xD;
        pre-ABI level in one or more cognitive domains (attention, executive function, learning and&#xD;
        memory, perceptual-motor ability or social cognition).&#xD;
&#xD;
        It may occur with or without behavioural impairment (apathy, mood disturbance,&#xD;
        irritability, disinhibition, psychotic symptoms, etc.)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        This population (A) show difficulties in occupational participation with respect to the&#xD;
        pre-ABI situation and present needs for support, counselling and/or specific therapeutic&#xD;
        intervention; (B) are in a situation of hospital discharge from ABI specialisation units;&#xD;
        (C) are domiciled in the same province to which the providing hospital belongs. In&#xD;
        addition, they may or may not have been diagnosed with a mental health disorder other than&#xD;
        neurocognitive disorder, either prior or subsequent to the ABI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Persons will be excluded if (A) they are in a situation of symptomatological&#xD;
        destabilisation of severe functional impairment that, as a priority, requires continued&#xD;
        support from specialised mental health units, psychiatric or social-health care admission;&#xD;
        and/or (B) they are unable to determine for themselves (for cognitive reasons or by&#xD;
        conscious choice) any problem in at least one occupational area.&#xD;
