    <textblock>
      The Accuryn Registry Study is an open-ended, global, multi-center, retrospective and&#xD;
      prospective, single-arm data collection study with an FDA cleared device. The target&#xD;
      population are cardiovascular surgery patients. Physiologic data measurements will be&#xD;
      collected from enrolled subjects using electronic medical records and data streams via the&#xD;
      Accuryn Monitoring System.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the Accuryn Registry Study is to is to track and analyze changes in&#xD;
      physiologic data streams using the Accuryn Monitoring System and correlate these changes to&#xD;
      the occurrence of acute kidney injury (AKI) following cardiovascular surgery intervention(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the incidence of IAH and ACS in the cardiovascular&#xD;
      surgery population and the correlation of these diagnoses to the diagnosis of AKI.&#xD;
