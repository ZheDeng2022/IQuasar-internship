  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled Phase 1 study of&#xD;
      intraperitoneal docetaxel in combination with systemic mFOLFOX6 for patients who have gastric&#xD;
      cancer with gross peritoneal carcinomatosis (GC-PC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the United&#xD;
      States and has a five-year survival of 40% after surgical resection. Metastatic gastric&#xD;
      cancer has an even poorer prognosis and most patients die within the first year of diagnosis.&#xD;
      Most patients are diagnosed in advanced stages of the disease due to non-specific or lack of&#xD;
      symptomatology and treatment options are then limited to systemic chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      peritoneum is the most frequent site of metastasis as well as cancer recurrence. Peritoneal&#xD;
      Carcinomatosis (PC) results in adverse clinical sequelae and is ultimately responsible for&#xD;
      60% of all gastric cancer-related deaths. While visceral metastases originating from primary&#xD;
      gastric cancer are relatively chemosensitive, peritoneal carcinomatosis is particularly&#xD;
      challenging to treat because of inadequate drug delivery from systemic circulation. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this trial is to determine the safety of administering intraperitoneal&#xD;
      docetaxel in conjunction with the standard of care treatment regimen of intravenous mFOLFOX6&#xD;
      (5-Fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) in patients with primary gastric cancer with&#xD;
      gross peritoneal carcinomatosis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have histologically-confirmed GC-PC by diagnostic laparoscopy who have not undergone&#xD;

          -  Not have distant metastases as ruled out by an initial imaging (e.g. CT&#xD;
             Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis with contrast), positron emission tomography (PET scan). Any&#xD;
             metastasis in distant organs other than the peritoneum will exclude the patient from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;

             Performance Scale at study entry.&#xD;

             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks prior to study Day 1 or who has not&#xD;
             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed&#xD;
             by the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a patient's ability to sign&#xD;
