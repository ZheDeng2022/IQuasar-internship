  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total hip replacement is one of the most common surgical procedure in France. In 2010, an&#xD;
      estimated 147 513 total hip procedures were performed. This number is constantly increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is common, it can lead to many complications. The intra-prosthetic luxation is&#xD;
      the second one after aseptic loosening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The luxation risk is multifactorial and depends on the relative orientation of femoral et&#xD;
      acetabular components. This orientation is influenced by statics and dynamics parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So far, the literature shows that only static parameters are considered by surgeons. Thus, in&#xD;
      reference to Lewinneck publication, which states that the luxation risk is lower if the cup&#xD;
      is oriented with 15° +/- 10° of anteversion and 40°+/- 10° of inclination with respect to the&#xD;
      anterior pelvic plan (APP). Defined by the two anterosuperior iliacs spines and pubic&#xD;
      symphysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this approach is only static and do not take into account the variations of pelvic&#xD;
      plan orientation during everyday life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To consider these variations of pelvic inclination, it is possible to measure the angle&#xD;
      between APP and the horizontal (in lying position) or the vertical (in standing position)&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several devices allow the measure of pelvic inclination but they all have important limits&#xD;
      (EOS radiography, scanner or navigation). A new device has been developed in Brest to measure&#xD;
      this inclination in several positions of the daily life.This software has already been tested&#xD;
      in healthy volunteers and results demonstrate an excellent accuracy and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to described the dynamic of the pelvic bone thanks to this&#xD;
      ultrasound based device, and to assess the amount of variation induced by hip replacement&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
