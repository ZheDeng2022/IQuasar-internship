  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) accounts for half of heart failure&#xD;
      cases with heterogenous cause and variable presentations. The diagnosis of HFpEF required&#xD;
      clinical signs and symptoms of HF, normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and&#xD;
      evidence of diastolic dysfunction. No treatment has been shown in recent major clinical&#xD;
      trials having benefits in these patients. One major reason of the poor response to medical&#xD;
      treatment is the heterogeneity of HFpEF, which contains many different underline causes. To&#xD;
      identify the underlying causes of HFpEF may improve the diagnosis and treatment in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-related amyloid deposition has first been reported in 1876 and the following autopsy&#xD;
      studies showed the prevalence of senile cardiac amyloid is up to 25%. Recently, it has been&#xD;
      recognized that the deposits in senile cardiac amyloid are derived from wild-type&#xD;
      transthyretin (TTR). Transthyretin amyloidosis cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR CA) is caused by&#xD;
      myocardial deposition of misfolded transthyretin protein. There are 2 types of ATTR&#xD;
      classified by genetic mutation including wild-type ATTR (ATTRwt) and familial cardiac amyloid&#xD;
      caused by TTR mutation (ATTRm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodality techniques have been developed to assist in the diagnosis of the diagnosis of&#xD;
      TTR. Among them, 99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD) scintigraphy&#xD;
      is a non-invasive test and it can diagnose TTR from other cause diverse form of cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis and cardiomyopathy. In the study of Gonzalez-Lopez et al, in 120 HFpEF patients,&#xD;
      16 (13.3%) had positive 99mTc-DPD scan. Four patients with positive 99mTc-DPD scan received&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsy and confirmed cardiac amyloid deposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATTRwt could be an important cause of HFpEF and it was often under diagnosed. A recent study&#xD;
      in Spain reported that 13% of patents over age of 60 years with HFpEF and left ventricular&#xD;
      wall thickness of 12mm or more had ATTRwt. However, the prevalence of ATTRwt among patients&#xD;
      with HFpEF is not well-established in Taiwan and Asia. The aim of this study is to determine&#xD;
      the prevalence, clinical characteristics, risk factors and outcomes of ATTRwt related HFpEF&#xD;
      patients in Taiwan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a heterogeneous clinical situation&#xD;
      with multiple underlying causes. The diagnosis of HFpEF is challenging which requires&#xD;
      clinical signs/symptoms of HF, a normal or mildly impaired systolic function measured by left&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), and evidence of diastolic dysfunction. There are no&#xD;
      significant improvements in treatment of HFpEF in recent years and the results in the major&#xD;
      clinical trials for HFpEF were disappointed. One major reason is the heterogeneity of HFpEF,&#xD;
      which contains several diseases under the same entity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small deposits of amyloid are found in the elder hearts in up to 25% of the autopsies. These&#xD;
      deposits are mainly composed by wild-type transthyretin (TTR). Transthyretin amyloidosis&#xD;
      cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR CA) is caused by myocardial deposition of misfolded transthyretin&#xD;
      protein. It is classified into 2 groups by the genetics of Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR):&#xD;
      wild-type (ATTRwt) or hereditary (hATTR or ATTRm). ATTR CA, irrespective of genotype, is an&#xD;
      unrecognized mechanism underlying HFpEF. It was reported wild-type TTR might be an&#xD;
      underdiagnosed cause of HFpEF. However, the prevalence of wild-type ATTR among patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF is not well-established in Taiwan and Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the most convenient method to detect and diagnosis cardiac amyloidosis is&#xD;
      99mTc-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD) scintigraphy6. In the study of&#xD;
      Gonzalez-Lopez et al, in 120 HFpEF patients, 16 (13.3%) had positive 99mTc-DPD scan6. Four&#xD;
      patients with positive 99mTc-DPD scan received endomyocardial biopsy and confirmed cardiac&#xD;
      amyloid deposition6. In addition, technetium-99m TC pyrophosphate (PYP) scintigraphy is also&#xD;
      very useful in diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The propose of this study is to determine the prevalence of ATTRwt among elderly HFpEF&#xD;
      patients in Taiwan. In this study, the investigators will recruit a cohort of HFpEF patients&#xD;
      in Taiwan to define the number of patients who have cardiac amyloidosis by utilizing highly&#xD;
      sensitive heart imaging and blood tests. The investigators will also explore differences in&#xD;
      different risk factors as they relate to heart failure disease progression in cardiac&#xD;
      amyloidosis. According our previous studies, the average age of HFpEF in Taiwan is 65 y/o. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators set age limitation as 60 y/o. However, because 5% ATTRwt were &lt;&#xD;
      60 y/o9, therefore, the investigators also recruit patients &gt;50y/o with risk factors of&#xD;
      ATTRwt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis HFpEF is a heterogeneous clinical situation with multiple underlying causes.&#xD;
      ATTRwt is an underdiagnosed cause of HFpEF but the prevalence is unknown in Taiwan. ATTRwt&#xD;
      can be diagnosed non-invasively by 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy7. The investigators aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the prevalence and clinical characteristics of ATTRwt among patients with HFpEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective(s) / Endpoint(s) Percentage of participants with ATTRwt among patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF in Taiwan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s) / Endpoint(s) To investigate the clinical and echocardiographic&#xD;
      characters in ATTRwt patients and compare with HFpEF patients without ATTRwt&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Population Eligible HFpEF patients with a LVEF of ≧50%, New York Heart Association&#xD;
      (NYHA) class I-IV symptoms: Both in-patients or patients in clinics could be enrolled. These&#xD;
      patients could be newly diagnosed or has been diagnosed. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      pre-stratified according to left ventricular posterior wall thickness (LVPW) ≥12mm or less;&#xD;
      number of subjects with LVPW ≥12mm should account for more than 50% of total subjects&#xD;
      recruited in the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Sample Size Justification The study will prospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      prevalence of ATTRwt among patients with HFpEF. Assume the expected 10% prevalence of ATTRwt&#xD;
      in patients with HFpEF, the target recruitment of 260 HFpEF patients would yield 25 ATTRwt&#xD;
      positive result, which would provide the prevalence estimate with associated 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval at the range of +- 3%. The estimated enrolled time is 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient is ≥ 60 years old or 50 y/o with carpal tunnel syndrome or spinal stenosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient has been diagnosed as HFpEF in their medical history or newly diagnosed as&#xD;
           HFpEF. They have HF symptoms with NYHA Classification of I-IV when diagnosis. The&#xD;
           criteria of HFpEF is according to our previous studies10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. More than 50% of them have LVPW ≥12mm (when diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Written informed consent could be obtained&#xD;
&#xD;
      Key Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients unwilling to join this projects&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with unstable coronary artery disease, plan to receive coronary intervention&#xD;
           within months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients has previous history of heart failure reduced ejection (HFrEF) with a LVEF&#xD;
           &lt;40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients recruitment and study protocol The enrolled and exclusion criteria were&#xD;
           mentioned above. The investigators will enroll 260 HFpEF patients (&gt; 50% with LVPW&#xD;
           thickness &gt;12mm). After receiving informed consent, patients will receive NTproBNP, ECG,&#xD;
           and echocardiography. Then the investigators will arrange 99mTc-PYP scan to detect the&#xD;
           presence of amyloidosis. If patients have these data (ECG, NTproBNP, echocardiogram,&#xD;
           99mTc PYP) within 6 months, the investigators will record and use this data and do not&#xD;
           perform again. In patients with positive 99mTc-PYP scan, the investigators will detect&#xD;
           urinary monoclonal light chain and serum monoclonal light chain. In addition, the&#xD;
           investigators will arrange TTR genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Collection Delegated physicians or study personnel blinded to scintigraphy results&#xD;
           will review the medical records of all patients. Demographic and clinical data will be&#xD;
           collected during outpatient clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Scintigraphy Protocol Planar and single-photon positive emission computed tomography&#xD;
           (SPECT) imaging with 99mTc-PYP was performed with a dual head Philips Precedence&#xD;
           SPECT/CT camera (Philips Healthcare, Guildford, United Kingdom). Patients received 20 to&#xD;
           25 mCi of 99mTc-PYP intravenously and images were obtained at 2 hours over 8 minutes&#xD;
           duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Genotype Testing The TTR mutation was confirmed by sequencing of the TTR gene following&#xD;
           National Taiwan University Hospital established protocols. All 4 exons and their&#xD;
           flanking intron regions of the human TTR gene were amplified by polymerase chain&#xD;
           reaction (PCR). The amplicons were purified by the Gel/PCR DNA Fragments Extraction Kit&#xD;
           (Geneaid, Taipei, Taiwan). Sequencing was performed at the corresponding exons by using&#xD;
           the ABI3730 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).&#xD;
