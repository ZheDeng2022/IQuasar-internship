  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Veterans with diabetes may become overwhelmed with the self-management behaviors needed to&#xD;
      maintain optimal health. Veterans may experience diabetes distress (DD), a concept distinct&#xD;
      from depression, due the amount and frequency of these behaviors. DD negatively influences&#xD;
      the Veteran's engagement in self-management and subsequent HbA1c levels. Previous&#xD;
      interventions do not tailor T2D self-management information to a Veteran's DD, which may be&#xD;
      one reason interventions are ineffective at reducing DD. This proposal examines the impact of&#xD;
      correlating factors (e.g., sociodemographic, psychosocial, and environmental) on DD using&#xD;
      surveys and semi-structured interviews. Then, these findings will be used to design and test&#xD;
      an intervention that provides T2D self-management information in conjunction with&#xD;
      facilitating a connection to supportive services tailored to a Veteran's DD. This proposal&#xD;
      will prepare Allison Lewinski, PhD, MPH, RN for a career as a scientist at VHA focused on&#xD;
      developing methods to improve health outcomes among Veterans.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Diabetes self-management is critical to sustaining optimal health following&#xD;
      diagnosis. Diabetes distress (DD) is a crucial factor that influences a Veteran's engagement&#xD;
      in diabetes self-management. DD is distinct from depression, and includes four domains (i.e.,&#xD;
      regimen, emotional, interpersonal, healthcare provider). The presence of DD negatively&#xD;
      impacts engagement in self-management and HbA1c. Despite interventions aimed at decreasing&#xD;
      DD, these interventions have shown minimal lasting effects. One reason may be because&#xD;
      interventions do not tailor information to an individual's DD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance &amp; Impact: This proposal will be the first to examine the impact of correlating&#xD;
      factors on DD, and then design and test a self-management intervention tailored upon a&#xD;
      Veteran's DD type. This proposal addresses the VHA Strategic Plan Priority areas of utilizing&#xD;
      resources more efficiently and improving the timeliness of services, and the HSR&amp;D Research&#xD;
      Priorities of Population Health/Whole Health and Primary Care Practice. This proposal's&#xD;
      findings can improve both care delivery and health outcomes of Veterans, as the investigator&#xD;
      will help facilitate the Veteran's linkage to ubiquitous, existing VHA and community&#xD;
      services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation: This proposal will develop an intervention that targets sub-optimal T2D&#xD;
      self-management by providing tailored self-management information in conjunction with&#xD;
      connections to supportive services. The investigators will identify how, and to what extent,&#xD;
      DD and its factors, influence a Veteran's self-management behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: Aim 1 will examine the association of psychosocial factors (depression, PTSD),&#xD;
      environmental factors (finances, support), self-management behaviors, and HbA1c with DD.&#xD;
      These Aim 1 data will inform the identification of modifiable factors and selection of the&#xD;
      population for a diabetes self-management intervention for Veterans with T2D. Aim 2 will&#xD;
      describe self-management challenges and preferred learning strategies to inform the&#xD;
      intervention components and delivery approach for Veterans with T2D. Obtaining in-depth&#xD;
      perceptions of DD type, self-management strategies and challenges, and learning preferences&#xD;
      is essential to tailoring intervention components. The purpose of Aim 3 is to design &amp; pilot&#xD;
      test an innovative, tailored T2D self-management information and supportive services&#xD;
      intervention for Veterans with T2D, to promote engagement in self-management behaviors. In&#xD;
      Aim 3 the investigators will determine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention&#xD;
      for Veterans with T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This proposal uses an explanatory, sequential mixed-methods design to describe&#xD;
      DD in a sample of Veterans who receive care at Durham. In Aim 1 the investigators will survey&#xD;
      Veterans (n = 200), and balance enrollment by HbA1C (&lt; 9 or 9) and medication use (insulin,&#xD;
      no insulin). In Aim 2 the investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews with a&#xD;
      sub-sample (n = ~36) of Veterans surveyed in Aim 1. The investigators will balance enrollment&#xD;
      by HbA1C, medication use, and DD level as operationalized by the Diabetes Distress Scale&#xD;
      (low, moderate, high). In Aim 3 the investigators will develop and refine the intervention&#xD;
      using findings from Aims 1 &amp; 2 and strategies successfully used by co-mentors. To develop the&#xD;
      intervention the investigators will conduct semi-structured interviews with stakeholders (n =&#xD;
      ~20: physicians, nurses, administrators) to review components (e.g., learning approaches,&#xD;
      relevant VA/community resources) to ensure relevancy. The investigators will modify&#xD;
      components and the delivery strategy as needed. Then, will test the intervention with 30&#xD;
      Veterans to evaluate feasibility and acceptability, and utilization of recommended supportive&#xD;
      services, using quantitative and qualitative approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation &amp; Next Steps: The next steps include dissemination of findings about DD, and&#xD;
      its correlates, and the development of an IIR. This IIR will be a Phase III efficacy trial&#xD;
      and will be sufficiently powered to test the effects of providing self-management information&#xD;
      and connections to supportive services tailored to a Veteran's DD to improve HbA1c.&#xD;
