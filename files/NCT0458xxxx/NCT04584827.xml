    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effects of the level of metabolites used in routine&#xD;
      on mortality and morbidity in patients who will undergo intracranial surgery with craniotomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      In this study, in patients who are planned to have an intracranial mass operation with&#xD;
      craniotomy, their medical histories, demographic features, comorbidities, preoperative&#xD;
      radiotherapy treatment, the parameters examined in the preoperative routine will be collected&#xD;
      as a file scan (previous operations, GKS, laboratory values). The classification of patients&#xD;
      according to the 2016 World Health Organization Central Classification of Nervous System&#xD;
      Tumors (WHO-CNS classification) and whether it is glial or non glial will be recorded from&#xD;
      the clinical file. Intraoperative; hemodynamic data of patients; heart rate, diastolic,&#xD;
      systolic and mean arterial pressures, fluid and blood products delivered, anesthetic and&#xD;
      other medications, and blood gas samples will be written from the anesthesia document after&#xD;
      the operation is finished. For the study, the application of the anesthesiologist for the&#xD;
      patient will not be interfered. If postoperative patients are sent to the intensive care&#xD;
      unit, their laboratory values and clinical observations (mortality, morbidity, neurological&#xD;
      sequelae, imaging techniques, GOSE (Glasgow outcome skale)) will be recorded. In our study,&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity will be evaluated 30 days postoperatively, and if the patient was&#xD;
      sent to the service from the intensive care unit in this process, the values in the&#xD;
      postoperative clinic (mortality, morbidity, neurological evaluation, imaging techniques,&#xD;
      pathology results) will be recorded from the patient document. If the patient was discharged&#xD;
      30 days before, outpatient data will be recorded. The patients will be classified by&#xD;
      evaluating the collected data (intraoperative hemodynamic data, blood transfusions,&#xD;
      postoperative neurological sequel, postoperative complications and mortality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study; the effects of lactate level on mortality and morbidity will be investigated in&#xD;
      patients undergoing an intracranial mass operation with general anesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>Glasgow Outcome Scale; It is a scale developed to categorize people suffering from head trauma or non-traumatic acute brain injury into broad outcome categories. It shows postoperative mortality and morbidity of patients who underwent intracranial surgery. Glasgow Outcome Scale is a five-point scale. 1 point is considered death and five points as good recovery. As the score increases, morbidity and mortality decrease.</description>
