  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      (Neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer is known to have a negative impact on muscle&#xD;
      tissue resulting in reduced aerobic fitness, skeletal muscle mass and strength. Physical&#xD;
      exercise during treatment may counteract some of these negative effects. However, the effects&#xD;
      of resistance training alone have never been explored. The present study aims to investigate&#xD;
      if heavy-load resistance training during (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy counteracts negative&#xD;
      effects on skeletal muscle in women diagnosed with breast cancer. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      (neo-)adjuvant treatment with chemotherapy will reduce muscle fiber size, impair&#xD;
      mitochondrial function and increase indicators of cellular stress and that resistance&#xD;
      training during treatment will counteract these negative effects. Fifty women recently&#xD;
      diagnosed with breast cancer scheduled to start (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy will be&#xD;
      randomized to either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will&#xD;
      perform supervised heavy-load resistance training twice a week over the course of&#xD;
      chemotherapy (approximately 16-weeks) whereas the control group will be encouraged to&#xD;
      continue with their usual activities. To increase interest in participation, controls will be&#xD;
      invited to a 2-week introduction to the same resistance-training program as the intervention&#xD;
      group following completion of chemotherapy. Muscle biopsies from m. vastus lateralis will be&#xD;
      collected before the first cycle of chemotherapy, after chemotherapy, and 6 months later&#xD;
      (6-month follow-up) for assessment of muscle cellular outcomes. Results from this&#xD;
      intervention will provide further knowledge on how chemotherapy affects muscle tissue and how&#xD;
      resistance training may counteract immediate and long-term treatment side effects. Results&#xD;
      from this intervention will also contribute with knowledge about how to improve exercise&#xD;
      programs that are effective for women undergoing chemotherapy against breast cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of heavy-load resistance training on&#xD;
      muscle cellular outcomes in women with breast cancer undergoing (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the investigators' objectives are to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the effects of a heavy-load resistance training intervention on skeletal&#xD;
           muscle fiber cross-sectional area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate the effects of a heavy-load resistance training intervention on regulators&#xD;
           of muscle fiber size, muscle fiber function, cellular stress and mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Investigate the effects of chemotherapy on skeletal muscle fiber cross-sectional area,&#xD;
           regulators of muscle fiber size, muscle fiber function, cellular stress and&#xD;
           mitochondrial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Explore the effects of heavy-load resistance training on the expression levels of&#xD;
           myokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a two-armed randomized controlled trial with follow-up at six months. With this&#xD;
      design, the investigators can study the main effect and interactions between factors&#xD;
      (groups). Participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants recently diagnosed with breast cancer will be recruited from Uppsala University&#xD;
      Hospital. Based on power calculations, 50 participants will be included. Data will be&#xD;
      collected before the first cycle of chemotherapy, after chemotherapy, and 6 months later&#xD;
      (6-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will perform supervised heavy-load resistance training&#xD;
      twice a week from the week following the start of chemotherapy and throughout the course of&#xD;
      treatment, approximately 16 weeks. Sessions will be performed at a public gym and led by&#xD;
      trained coaches. The following six exercises will be included in the program: seated&#xD;
      leg-press, seated chest press, seated leg-curl, seated row and seated leg-extension performed&#xD;
      in machines and seated overhead-press using dumbbells. The first two weeks of the program&#xD;
      represent familiarization to the training protocol and 1 RM (Repetition Maximum) tests.&#xD;
      During this period, the participants will perform exercises at a light load. After the first&#xD;
      1 RM-test, training will progress in sets and training load before testing of 6- and 10 RM&#xD;
      which will provide the participants with individualized loads. Rest periods between sets will&#xD;
      be two (6 RM training load) and one minute (10 RM training load) for the two different&#xD;
      sessions, respectively. The training load will be adjusted throughout the intervention&#xD;
      period. Participants in the control group are encouraged to continue with their activity as&#xD;
      usual i.e. maintain their habitual physical activity level and not initiate resistance&#xD;
      training during chemotherapy. To increase interest in participation, controls will be invited&#xD;
      to a 2-week introduction to the same resistance-training program as the intervention group&#xD;
      following completion of chemotherapy and offered a 12-month membership at a local gym, free&#xD;
      of charge.&#xD;
