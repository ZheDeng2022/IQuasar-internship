  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of SHR2150 in combination with&#xD;
      chemotherapy plus PD-1 or CD47 antibody in subjects with unresectable/ metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors. Patients will receive the combined regimen in 3-week treatment cycles. During the&#xD;
      Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial, three oral doses of SHR2150 will be combined&#xD;
      with intravenous administration of chemotherapy and PD-1 or CD47 antibody. In the Phase 2&#xD;
      dose expansion portion, patients will be treated with the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of&#xD;
      SHR2150 in combination with chemotherapy plus PD-1 or CD47 antibody.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Identification of T cell inhibitory signals, including PD-1/L1, has prompted the development&#xD;
      of a new class of cancer immunotherapy that could restore an adequate immunosurveillance&#xD;
      against the neoplasm and enhance T-cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. However,&#xD;
      elimination of cancer by T cells is only one step in the cancer-immunity cycle, which enable&#xD;
      providing several therapeutic targets and tailoring of combinations of immune therapies.&#xD;
      SHR2150 is a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 designed to activate&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells and functions as mucosal immunoadjuvants in pre-clinical studies.&#xD;
      This study is a first-in-man, Phase I/II, dose escalation/expansion study of a combined&#xD;
      regimen of SHR2150 in combination with chemotherapy plus PD-1 or CD47 antibody in subjects&#xD;
      with unresectable/ metastatic solid tumors. This study is designed to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, RP2D and clinical efficacy of this regimen.&#xD;
