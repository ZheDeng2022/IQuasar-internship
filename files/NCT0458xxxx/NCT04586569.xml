  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of enhanced&#xD;
      preoperative education using a Pediatric Interactive Relational Agent (PIRA), designed for&#xD;
      children ages 4 through10 years and their families, compared to the standard preoperative&#xD;
      education currently provided. The study will also look at any differences in anxiety between&#xD;
      the two educational groups.&#xD;

    <time_frame>preoperative period - 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This observational tool will be used to determine if there a difference in anxiety between children who got the PIRA and those in the control group. It will look at the incidence and severity of anxiety in children who received the PIRA vs. those who received the standard education.</description>
