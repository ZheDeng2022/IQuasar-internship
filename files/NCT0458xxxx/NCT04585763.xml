      Prospective, multi-center, single-arm study of the M5+ Peripheral IVL system to treat&#xD;
      calcified peripheral arteries.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the safety and performance of the Shockwave M5+&#xD;
      Peripheral IVL System to treat calcified peripheral arteries in pre-market countries, and to&#xD;
      assess continued safety and effectiveness in the US. A minimum of 40 lesions in up to 40&#xD;
      subjects at up to 10 sites in Australia, New Zealand and the US will be enrolled with the aim&#xD;
      of treating at least 20 target lesions with the 8.0 mm IVL catheter. A maximum of three&#xD;
      target lesions may be treated per subject. Subjects with moderate and severely calcified&#xD;
      iliac and femoropopliteal artery disease presenting with Rutherford Category 2 to 5.&#xD;
      Approximately 6 months of enrollment at up to 10 sites in Australia, New Zealand and the US.&#xD;
      Study subjects will be followed through discharge, 30 days, 6 and 12 months. Duplex&#xD;
      Ultrasound (DUS) assessments will be completed at 12 months. Total anticipated study duration&#xD;
      is 18 months. The primary safety endpoint is Major Adverse Events (MAE) at 30 days defined&#xD;
      as: need for emergency surgical revascularization of target limb; unplanned target limb major&#xD;
      amputation (above the ankle); symptomatic thrombus or distal emboli that require surgical,&#xD;
      mechanical or pharmacologic means to improve flow and extend hospitalization ; or&#xD;
      perforations that require an intervention, including bail-out stenting. The primary&#xD;
      performance endpoint is technical success defined as final residual stenosis ≤30% without&#xD;
      flow-limiting dissection (≥ Grade D) of the lesion by angiographic core lab.&#xD;
