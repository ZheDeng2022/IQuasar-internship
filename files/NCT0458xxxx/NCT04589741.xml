    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of CAV / IE chemotherapy&#xD;
      combined with toripalimab in the treatment of patients with advanced or unresectable bone and&#xD;
      soft tissue sarcomas who failed in standard treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, there are many clinical trials of chemotherapy drugs combined with anti-PD-1&#xD;
      antibody in the treatment of tumor, but the clinical study of CAV / IE chemotherapy combined&#xD;
      with anti-PD-1 antibody in the treatment of advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma has not been started, and the related research is still in the blank state. In view&#xD;
      of the above problems, to observe and evaluate the efficacy and safety of CAV / IE&#xD;
      chemotherapy combined with toripalimab in the treatment of advanced or non resectable bone&#xD;
      and soft tissue sarcoma patients, so as to provide more treatment options for patients with&#xD;
      advanced or non resectable bone and soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

    <description>CAV / IE regimen alternate chemotherapy (regimen 1: CTX 1.2mg/m2 D1 + ADM 50mg / m2 D1 + VCR 1.4mg/m2 D1 and scheme 2: IFO 1.5g/m2 D1-5 + vp-16 90mg / m2 D1-5, IV drip). Regimen 1 and 2 were performed alternately, with a cycle of 3 weeks;&#xD;
The patients were treated with toripalimab (240mg, 6ml) intravenously every 3 weeks;&#xD;
If doxorubicin has reached the upper limit or reduced cardiac toxicity, liposome adriamycin (50mg / m2) or IE regimen can be used&#xD;
After 6 courses of treatment, patients with disease control (CR + PR + SD) and tolerable adverse reactions were treated continuously. The study was completed when the researchers considered that the patients were not suitable for continuous medication or the efficacy evaluation was disease progression (PD). No other anti-tumor treatment can be carried out during the treatment.</description>
