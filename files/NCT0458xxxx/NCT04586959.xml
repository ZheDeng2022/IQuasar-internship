    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized non-inferiority phase III study to evaluate&#xD;
      if patients undergoing a minimally invasive surgery for early stage uterine cancer have&#xD;
      cancer cells in the fluid that is obtained at the time of their surgery when a uterine&#xD;
      manipulator is placed versus patients who do not have a uterine manipulator placed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In most cases, patients who have early stage endometrial cancer undergo a surgery to remove&#xD;
      the uterus, cervix, tubes, ovaries, and occasionally lymph nodes. This is usually done&#xD;
      through a minimally invasive (not a large incision) surgery. To accomplish this, the uterus&#xD;
      needs to be manipulated (moved around) to help the surgeon complete your surgery. This is&#xD;
      usually done with a device called a uterine manipulator and the majority of surgeons use this&#xD;
      device in any patient undergoing a minimally invasive hysterectomy (removal of the uterus and&#xD;
      cervix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though the majority of surgeons use a manipulator, there are some surgeons who believe&#xD;
      there is a possibility that cancer cells inside the uterus can be spilled into the abdomen&#xD;
      through the fallopian tubes. This may cause a higher risk of spreading the cancer and or of&#xD;
      the cancer coming back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are very limited research studies directly looking at whether the uterine&#xD;
      manipulator may cause these cells to appear in the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients undergoing a minimally invasive surgery for&#xD;
      early stage uterine cancer have cancer cells in the fluid that is obtained at the time of&#xD;
      their surgery when a uterine manipulator is placed versus patients who do not have a uterine&#xD;
      manipulator placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer program will randomly assign the subjects to one of two groups. One group will&#xD;
      have minimally invasive surgery with the use of a uterine manipulator and the other group&#xD;
      will have minimally invasive surgery without the use of a uterine manipulator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will use the information from this study to decide how best to take care of&#xD;
      patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery for uterine cancer.&#xD;
