  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Kinematic and temporal analysis of the movement helps researchers and clinicians to better&#xD;
      understand the way humans move and interact within the environment in which they live, better&#xD;
      describe the alterations coming from impairments, and finally allow to better tailor&#xD;
      interventions for patients. In this perspective, motion analysis has become, in the last 30&#xD;
      years, a remarkable and important field of research. Even if movement assessment should be a&#xD;
      cornerstone for definition and modulation of rehabilitation interventions, there are still&#xD;
      few motion analysis devices that are able to influence the clinical decision process; motion&#xD;
      analysis labs are among those, but their use is unfortunately limited due to the costs of&#xD;
      instruments and analysis. Other small unobtrusive wearable devices, easier to use and&#xD;
      cost-effective, have been developed, like Inertial measurement units (IMU), composed by&#xD;
      accelerometers and gyroscopes. They could therefore represent an incentive for a more&#xD;
      widespread use of motion analysis within daily clinical activity in Rehabilitaion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) is a simple, widely used, functional test which involves standing&#xD;
      up from a chair, walking three meters, turning, and going back to sit. It is used to evaluate&#xD;
      movement, mobility, dynamic and static balance in people with musculoskeletal impairment,&#xD;
      neurological diseases, aging related conditions, and the quality of life in people with low&#xD;
      back pain. The only and easy outcome considered is the time to completion. Nevertheless, the&#xD;
      application of an IMU to a subject performing TUG can provide other objective, quantitative&#xD;
      data, like temporal and kinematic parameters of the whole test and its sub-phases. The&#xD;
      instrumented TUG (iTUG) has already been applied, mainly in the neurorehabilitation field, in&#xD;
      particular for Parkinson's disease and for post-stroke impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      cLBP is one of the most burdensome health problem worldwide. cLBP has been considered a&#xD;
      bio-psycho-social disease, characterized by pain in the lumbar region, functional&#xD;
      impairments, and condition-related disability. Despite the obvious motor problems affecting&#xD;
      people with cLBP, to the best of our knowledge, chronic low back pain (cLBP) has not yet been&#xD;
      explored using iTUG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of study is to analyse temporal and kinematic parameters of cLBP subjects compared to&#xD;
      BMI and age-matched healthy subjects, through iTUG and to explore the correlations of those&#xD;
      parameters with pain and disability.&#xD;
