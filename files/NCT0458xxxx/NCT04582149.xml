  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of use of a wearable communication&#xD;
      device for critically ill patients who are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated. The study will assess the safety, tolerability, and ease of use of&#xD;
      the EyeControl device, and examine its potential monitoring capabilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critically ill patients, who are mechanically ventilated, suffer not only from their acute,&#xD;
      potentially devastating illness, but also from the lack of ability to communicate in an&#xD;
      effective manner. This is the direct result of the orotracheal tube or tracheostomy required&#xD;
      for the mechanical ventilation, which does not allow speech to be produced. On top of the&#xD;
      mechanical change in air flow, communication challenges result from sedation, neurological&#xD;
      injuries (primary brain injury or secondary encephalopathy), and delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lack of communication can lead to increased frustration, anxiety, and overall psychological&#xD;
      stress and could continue to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). On top&#xD;
      of the subjective discomfort, the inability to communicate in an effective manner may impair&#xD;
      medical care-for example, by failure to assess symptoms such as pain or breathing discomfort&#xD;
      by behavioral cues only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the solutions for communication deficits in mechanically ventilated patients are&#xD;
      mainly using yes/no communication, attempting to write, and communication boards that allow&#xD;
      people to point at defined pictures or letters. Recently, technological advancements led to&#xD;
      incorporation of more sophisticated communication devices, proving the feasibility of an&#xD;
      eye-tracking approach, for example.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EyeControl is a new, wearable, eye-tracking device that facilitates communication by&#xD;
      means of internal feedback to the patients with a bone-conducting speaker. In this way, the&#xD;
      device can ask the patient what he or she wants to say, and the patient replies by eye&#xD;
      gestures such as blinking or moving the eyes in a certain direction. This approach eliminates&#xD;
      the need for calibration, as most eye-tracking devices that use a screen require, and is&#xD;
      relatively easy to operate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and ease of use of the EyeControl device.&#xD;

    <description>The device will record the times in which the patient is awake by monitoring when the patient's eyes are open. This data will later be correlated with outcome measures such as delirium, length of stay, and functional outcome.</description>

    <description>The CAM-ICU will be administered by ICU nurses as standard of care and the examination will be repeated using the device by using multiple-choice questions and asking the patient to choose the correct answers by blinking. Correlation between the responses between collected by nurses and with the device will be assessed.</description>

In this way, the device can ask the patient what he or she wants to say, and the patient replies by eye gestures such as blinking or moving the eyes in a certain direction. Once the patient is able to operate the device, it will stay on the patient for as long as she or he would like it on, or until the patient is successfully extubated or discharged from the ICU, whichever is earliest.</description>
