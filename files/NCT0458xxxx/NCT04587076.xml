  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a chronic disease in which accumulation of excess body fat can result in impaired&#xD;
      health. In cases of severe obesity, weight loss surgery can be necessary as a treatment.&#xD;
      There are different forms of surgery but the common basic principle is to restrict food&#xD;
      intake and decrease the absorption of food in the stomach and intestines. As a consequence,&#xD;
      there is a higher risk of developing nutrient deficiency after surgery and supplementation of&#xD;
      protein, vitamins, and minerals can be necessary. This study evaluates intakes of protein,&#xD;
      vitamins, and minerals in patients with weight loss surgery and compares them to recommended&#xD;
      intakes. Further, this study looks at the role of age, sex, and socioeconomic status in this&#xD;
      context.&#xD;

      Obesity is defined by the World Health Organization as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation&#xD;
      that may impair health. These days, bariatric surgery is considered the most effective&#xD;
      treatment of morbid obesity. In the last decade, the number of bariatric surgeries performed&#xD;
      worldwide constantly increased. Common bariatric surgery procedures include gastric bypass,&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy, adjustable gastric band, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal&#xD;
      switch. After surgery, weight loss is induced by a reduced food volume the stomach can hold,&#xD;
      malabsorption of nutrients, or by a combination of both mechanisms. In consequence, patients&#xD;
      with bariatric surgery have an increased risk of developing nutrient deficiency. Therefore,&#xD;
      guidelines recommend supplementation of critical nutrients, i.e. protein, vitamins, and&#xD;
      minerals, after bariatric surgery. This study assesses intake of these nutrients in patients&#xD;
      with bariatric surgery based on the recommendations provided by the German S3 Guideline Group&#xD;
      on the Surgical Treatment of Obesity and Metabolic Diseases. In particular, this study&#xD;
      assesses the association of therapy adherence with age, sex, and socioeconomic status.&#xD;
