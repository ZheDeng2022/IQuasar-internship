  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a prospective, randomized, within subject controlled design to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of Microsurfaced vs Control cadaveric grafts for coverage of acute&#xD;
      deep-partial or full-thickness burn wounds to promote wound healing. This study will be&#xD;
      performed in 2 parts: Time to wound bed preparedness through 6 weeks (Part A) and wound site&#xD;
      healing, graft take and long-term scar outcomes (Part B). Subjects will be treated with both&#xD;
      control and microsurfaced cadaveric grafts on adjacent deep-partial or full-thickness burn&#xD;
      wounds.&#xD;
