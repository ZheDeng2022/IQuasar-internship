  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are increasingly recognized sex-specific risk&#xD;
      factors for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women. HDP, including preeclampsia and&#xD;
      gestational hypertension, confer a 2- to 3-fold increase in the risk of chronic hypertension&#xD;
      and ischemic heart disease 10-15 years after delivery. Observational data suggest that&#xD;
      breastfeeding can lower maternal blood pressure (BP), risk of metabolic syndrome, and other&#xD;
      markers of cardiovascular risk in the short term and long term, possibly by helping to re-set&#xD;
      the metabolic changes of pregnancy. The investigators recently demonstrated an 11% reduction&#xD;
      in the risk of metabolic syndrome among postpartum women with a variety of complications in&#xD;
      pregnancy, including HDP, who breastfed for &gt; 6 months, compared to those who did not&#xD;
      breastfeed and those who breastfed for shorter durations. An analysis of 622 postpartum women&#xD;
      at Kingston General Hospital showed that breastfeeding women had nearly a 6-mmHg lower&#xD;
      systolic BP than women who did not breastfeed with an apparent dose-response effect of&#xD;
      breastfeeding duration. Women with pregnancy complications including HDP are vulnerable to&#xD;
      early weaning. Interactive, multi-modal approaches targeting a mother's breastfeeding&#xD;
      self-efficacy (i.e., confidence about breastfeeding) have been effective in healthy&#xD;
      postpartum women. However, these have not yet been tested specifically in HDP women, who&#xD;
      stand to derive substantial benefit from breastfeeding. This is an important area to study&#xD;
      since nurse-led breastfeeding supportive interventions can be widely applied to the&#xD;
      postpartum care of women with HDP and can be integrated into comprehensive CVD risk reduction&#xD;
      programs for these women. The primary outcome is postpartum BP, since hypertension is a key&#xD;
      mediating factor in women's heart health. The investigators conducted a feasibility study of&#xD;
      a breastfeeding self-efficacy intervention to enhance breastfeeding outcomes among women with&#xD;
      HDP achieving pre-defined targets of a recruitment rate of &gt;50% , attrition rates of &lt; 30%,&#xD;
      and &gt; 70% participant satisfaction with the intervention, measured at the 6-month time point.&#xD;
      Additionally, data showed trends in both systolic and diastolic BP favoring the intervention&#xD;
      group. The current study is a multi-site open-label randomized trial to assess for a&#xD;
      difference in blood pressure and breastfeeding between groups, and to serve as a cohort of&#xD;
      HDP women for longitudinal follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to assess a nurse-led self-efficacy enhancing breastfeeding&#xD;
      intervention in women who have HDP. The investigators will examine whether this intervention&#xD;
      reduces postpartum blood pressure and improves breastfeeding outcomes in these women. In the&#xD;
      long-term, the investigators will observe to see whether breastfeeding helps to lower the&#xD;
      chance of chronic hypertension or other cardiovascular risk factors, as well as heart disease&#xD;
      or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcomes will be ascertained at the end of the study, which is at 12 months postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is systolic and/or diastolic BP, in mmHg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Breastfeeding outcomes: i. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding (weeks); ii. The&#xD;
           proportion who breastfeed (exclusive or non-exclusive) at 6 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -to evaluate whether women who breastfeed for longer are more likely to engage in&#xD;
      cardiovascular protective behaviors such as weight reduction, healthy eating and higher&#xD;
      levels of physical activity at 12 months postpartum; to explore the biological and&#xD;
      psychosocial determinants of breastfeeding behaviour within 12 months postpartum, measured at&#xD;
      the time of delivery; to assess the risk of future hospitalization or emergency room visit&#xD;
      for any cardiovascular event or procedure within 15 years after delivery, according to: (a)&#xD;
      breastfeeding intervention, (b) total duration of breastfeeding, and (c) other novel&#xD;
      determinants of cardiovascular risk; to collect biosamples among women who recently had HDP,&#xD;
      in order to advance on the understanding of the different phenotypes of women and their&#xD;
      associated cardio-metabolic risk in the short and long-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who had HDP will be recruited from three participating centers. In Quebec there will be&#xD;
      two centers: (1) McGill University Health Centre-Royal Victoria Hospital (MUHC-RVH) and (2)&#xD;
      St. Mary's Hospital Centre (SMHC) and the third site will be in Ontario at the (3) Kingston&#xD;
      General Hospital (KGH). Participants that plan to breastfeed will be randomly divided into&#xD;
      two groups: usual postpartum care + BSE intervention or usual postpartum care. Participants&#xD;
      with HDP who are not planning to breastfeed will also be invited to participate as an&#xD;
      additional observational comparison group. Study outcomes for all participants will be&#xD;
      assessed by completion of questionnaires, home and in-office blood pressure measurement,&#xD;
      basic metabolic biochemical testing and long-term follow-up via linkage with administrative&#xD;
      health data.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Multi-site open-label, randomized control trial, evaluating a nurse-led breastfeeding self-efficacy enhancing intervention for women who had hypertensive disorders of pregnancy recruited at three sites in Canada. Participants that plan to breastfeed will be randomly divided into two groups: one will be given the BSE intervention, the other will not. Both groups will receive same standard postpartum care: routine postpartum hospital breastfeeding support, community breastfeeding support, and postpartum medical visits with obstetrics care provider and cardiovascular risk assessment. Participants who had high blood pressure in pregnancy and are not planning to breastfeed will not be randomized and will receive standard postpartum care excluding breastfeeding care. Outcomes for all participants will be assessed by completion of questionnaires, collecting blood pressure measurements and blood tests and long-term follow-up via linkage with administrative health data.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Self-efficacy is determined by factors such as prior experience, vicarious learning, persuasion of others and physiological state, which in turn impact on one's behaviours and actions. One's sense of self-efficacy is modifiable, and can be readily targeted for intervention. An increasingly studied key determinant of breastfeeding outcomes is breastfeeding confidence, also referred to as breastfeeding self-efficacy (BSE). The investigators will use a nurse-administered validated BSE intervention tool.</description>
