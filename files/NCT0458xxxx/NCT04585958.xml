  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial identifies the side effects and best dose of DS-8201a and olaparib in&#xD;
      treating patients with HER2-expressing cancers that have spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      or cannot be removed by surgery or endometrial cancer. Olaparib is a drug that blocks an&#xD;
      enzyme involved in many cell functions, including the repair of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      damage. Blocking this enzyme may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA,&#xD;
      causing them to die. DS-8201a is an antibody-drug conjugate. This agent has two components:&#xD;
      an antibody component and a chemotherapy component. The antibody component is attached to the&#xD;
      chemotherapy molecules. Upon administration of DS-8201a, the antibody targets and binds to&#xD;
      tumor cells that have abundant HER2 (human-epidermal growth factor receptor 2), which is a&#xD;
      protein on the surface of some tumor cells. The chemotherapy then enters the cells and blocks&#xD;
      DNA replication in the tumor cells with abundant HER2, causing them to die. Giving DS-8201a&#xD;
      and olaparib may shrink or stabilize the cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of trastuzumab deruxtecan&#xD;
      (DS-8201a) in combination with olaparib, and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination in a dose expansion cohort in&#xD;
      patients with uterine serous carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity as measured by objective response rate (ORR),&#xD;
      clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival (PFS), and duration of response (DoR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure baseline HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a central laboratory&#xD;
      and correlate with response in the dose escalation and in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of olaparib and DS-8201a&#xD;
      metabolites when administered in combination in the dose escalation and in the dose&#xD;
      expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine markers of DNA damage response (DDR) in tumor specimens at baseline and&#xD;
      on-treatment in patients with uterine serous carcinoma in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure baseline HER2 expression by immune-mass spectroscopy, and correlate with&#xD;
      baseline central IHC and with response in the dose escalation and in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure the formation of topoisomerase I cleaved complex formation (TOP1cc) in blood&#xD;
      specimens and correlate with response in the dose escalation and in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To measure the formation of TOP1cc in tumor specimens at baseline and on-treatment and&#xD;
      correlate with response in patients with uterine serous carcinoma in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To measure changes in HER2 expression over the course of treatment by IHC and immune&#xD;
      multiple reaction monitoring-mass spectrometry (immunoMRM) and correlate with response in&#xD;
      patients with uterine serous carcinoma in the dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine biomarkers of response and resistance in tumor specimens and blood specimens,&#xD;
      including whole exome sequencing (WES) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of DS-8201a and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because HER2 antibody conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agents&#xD;
             as well as PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic; thus, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use highly effective contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
             barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of&#xD;
             study participation, and for at least 7 months (women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             [WOCBP] only) after the last dose of study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this&#xD;
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the&#xD;
             duration of study participation, and 4 months after completion of DS-8201a and&#xD;
             olaparib administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of non-child-bearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a&#xD;
             documented tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;

             follicle-stimulating hormone [FSH] &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/mL [&lt; 147 pmol/L]&#xD;
             is confirmatory) are eligible. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose&#xD;
             menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the contraception methods&#xD;
             outlined for women of child-bearing potential if they wish to continue their HRT&#xD;
             during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
             post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4&#xD;
             weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval&#xD;
             depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal&#xD;
             status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive&#xD;
             method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the&#xD;
             study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time of&#xD;
             screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months after&#xD;
             the final study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;

          -  For the dose expansion cohort: Patients who have received prior PARP inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of (non-infectious) interstitial lung disease&#xD;
             (ILD)/pneumonitis that required steroids, has current ILD/pneumonitis, or where&#xD;
             suspected ILD/pneumonitis cannot be ruled out by imaging at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically severe pulmonary compromise resulting from intercurrent&#xD;
             pulmonary illnesses including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder&#xD;
             (i.e. pulmonary emboli within three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma,&#xD;
             severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], restrictive lung disease, pleural&#xD;
             effusion, etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with&#xD;
             potential pulmonary involvement (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis,&#xD;
             etc.), or prior pneumonectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to DS-8201a, the inactive ingredients in the drug product, olaparib, or&#xD;
             severe hypersensitivity to other monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any medications or substances that are moderate or strong&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A are ineligible. Because the lists of these agents are&#xD;
             constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical&#xD;
             reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be&#xD;
             counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a medical history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before&#xD;
             randomization/enrollment, symptomatic congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart&#xD;
             Association class IIb to IV), troponin levels consistent with myocardial infarction as&#xD;
             defined according to the manufacturer 28 days prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation to &gt; 470 ms (females) or &gt;&#xD;
             450 ms (males) based on average of the screening triplicate 12-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
             (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with multiple primary malignancies within 3 years, except adequately resected&#xD;
             non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in-situ disease, and other solid tumors&#xD;
             curatively treated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an uncontrolled infection requiring IV antibiotics, antivirals, or&#xD;
             antifungals&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine will require a washout period of&#xD;
             &gt;= 14 days to be eligible for the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with unresolved toxicities from previous anticancer therapy, defined as&#xD;
             toxicities (other than alopecia) not yet resolved to grade =&lt; 1 or baseline. Subjects&#xD;
             with chronic grade 2 toxicities may be eligible per the discretion of the investigator&#xD;
             after consultation with the sponsor medical monitor or designee (e.g., grade 2&#xD;
             chemotherapy-induced neuropathy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because DS-8201a is a HER2 antibody&#xD;
             conjugated to a topoisomerase 1 inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with DS-8201a,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with DS-8201a. These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
