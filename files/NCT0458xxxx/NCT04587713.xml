  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, 2-part, open-label study. Part A will be a formulation bridging and food&#xD;
      effect study in healthy adult subjects. Part B will be an assessment of pharmacokinetics (PK)&#xD;
      in healthy adult Chinese subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In study Part A, healthy adult subjects will receive the following treatments in a cross-over&#xD;
      design with a ≥10-day washout period between doses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment A: Single dose of [Tablet A] TD-1473 proposed commercial tablet formulation on&#xD;
           Day 1 in a fasted state;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment B: Single dose of [Tablet A] TD-1473 proposed commercial tablet formulation on&#xD;
           Day 1 in a fed state;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment C: Single dose of [Tablet B] TD-1473 current clinical tablet formulation on&#xD;
           Day 1 in a fasted state;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment D: Single dose of [Tablet B] TD-1473 current clinical tablet formulation on&#xD;
           Day 1 in a fed state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In study Part B, healthy adult Chinese subjects will receive Treatment A: Single dose of&#xD;
      [Tablet A] TD-1473 proposed commercial tablet formulation on Day 1 in a fasted state.&#xD;
