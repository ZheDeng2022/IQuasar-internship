  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of the study are to learn if TAK-672 can control bleeds in participants with&#xD;
      acquired hemophilia A and if the participants have side effects from TAK-672. Acquired&#xD;
      hemophilia A is when people's immune system attacks specific proteins, known as clotting&#xD;
      factors, in their bodies. This is different from hemophilia A, which is a condition people&#xD;
      are born with.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, the study doctor will check who can take part. For those who can take&#xD;
      part, participants will visit the clinic or hospital when they get their next bleed. They&#xD;
      will receive TAK-672 slowly through a vein. This is called an infusion. They might need extra&#xD;
      infusions of TAK-672 to control the bleed. After their bleed is controlled, participants will&#xD;
      regularly visit the clinic for a check-up and to treat any further bleeds. This will happen&#xD;
      until all participants have received their last dose of TAK-672 to control their 1st bleed.&#xD;
      After this, all participants will visit the clinic 90 days later for a final check-up.&#xD;

    <description>Percentage of severe bleeding episodes with demonstrated response to TAK-672 therapy at 24 hours after the initiation of treatment will be assessed by using a well-defined 4-point ordinal scale - A 'positive response' is defined as 'effective' (bleeding stopped with clinical control and FVIII:C levels of 50% or higher ) or 'partially effective' (bleeding reduced with clinical stabilization and FVIII:C levels of 20% or higher) control of bleeding, as determined by the investigator using a 4-point rating scale (effective - partially effective - poorly effective - not effective). 'Poorly effective' is defined as 'bleeding slightly reduced or unchanged and FVIII:C levels of less than 50%'. 'Not effective' is defined as 'bleeding worsening and FVIII:C levels of less than 50%'.</description>
