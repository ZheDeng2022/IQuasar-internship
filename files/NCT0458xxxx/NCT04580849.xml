  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study that aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of dance classes&#xD;
      via an online platform in people with and without Parkinson's Disease. The intervention will&#xD;
      last 2 months and the classes will be conducted twice a week (60 minutes) using the Zoom&#xD;
      platform. Evaluations will be performed before and after the intervention by means of the&#xD;
      Zoom platform as well and will include questionnaires of quality of life, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, and activities of daily living.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>feasibility (adherence rates)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To assess the feasibility of the study design and procedures. The adherence rate will be calculated by the total number of patients who completed the full course of intervention divided by the total number of patients included at the beginning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>feasibility (patients opinions)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Semi structured interviews will involve gaining patients opinions on the strengths and weaknesses of the intervention</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>feasibility (safety and usability)</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The researches will follow all patients during the intervention regarding safety (i.e. falls) and usability (i.e. internet connection)</description>

    <measure>Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire-8 (PDQ-8)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PDQ-8 is a short-form version to assess quality of life in persons with Parkinson's disease. Each question is scored from 0-4 points and the scores are summed and given as a percentage score (0-100). The higher the score, the worse the patient's condition.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 measures health-related quality of life. This questionnaire has 36-item measure divided into 8 subscales - each subscale can be used independently. Each of the 8 summed scores is transformed into a scale from 0 (negative health) to 100 (positive health)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The scale is used to identify depression and anxiety and presents 14 items. The total score is out of 42. The higher scores indicate greater levels of anxiety and depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part I</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The Part I concerns about non-motor experiences of daily living (e.g. anxiety and depression). This scale has 13 questions and all items have 5 response options. Higher scores indicate greater impact of PD symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Activities-Specific Balance (ABC) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported questionnaire measuring self-efficacy in performing activities without losing balance. The ABC Scale consists of 16 questions that require the patient to rate their confidence on a scale from 0% to 100%. The higher the percentage, the higher level of physical functioning.</description>

    <measure>Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Pre to Post treatment (10 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The test assess the functional mobility strength of lower extremity (measured by the time to complete the test). The higher the time to complete the test, the lower the performance.</description>
