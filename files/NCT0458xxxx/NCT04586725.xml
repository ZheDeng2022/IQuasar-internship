  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterised by a build up of fatty plaque in the&#xD;
      arteries in the lower limbs, resulting in a reduction of blow flow to the muscles. Globally,&#xD;
      it is estimated that 236 million people are living with PAD. A classic symptom of PAD is&#xD;
      intermittent claudication (IC) which is characterised by muscle cramps in the lower limbs,&#xD;
      typically brought on by exercise and relieved at rest. Exercise is recommended at first line&#xD;
      treatment for IC. However to assess IC symptoms in response to an exercise study, maximal&#xD;
      walking capacity (the furthest they can walk before it becomes too painful to walk) is&#xD;
      typically the main measure. A patients walking capacity is assessed by a number of exercise&#xD;
      testing protocols including the six-minute walk test (6MWT), where patients walk for six&#xD;
      minutes with the aim to walk as far as they can in the time allotted. Patient encouragement&#xD;
      has been shown to improve walking performance by as much as 30 meters in heart failure and&#xD;
      respiratory disease populations. However the effect of encouragement on walking performance&#xD;
      in people with IC is yet to be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is characterised by atherosclerotic lesions of the arteries&#xD;
      in the lower limbs, resulting in a reduction of blow flow (Hiatt, 2001). Globally, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 236 million people are living with PAD, with the number of cases increasing by&#xD;
      24% from 2000 to 2010. A classic symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC),&#xD;
      characterised by ischemic muscle pain precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. IC is&#xD;
      associated with various comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia as well as reductions in physical function, quality of life, and balance.&#xD;
      National and international guidelines recommend supervised exercise therapy as first line&#xD;
      treatment for patients with IC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess IC impairment in response to an exercise intervention, maximal walking capacity is&#xD;
      typically the primary outcome in randomised controlled trials (RCT's). This involves a&#xD;
      patient walking for as long as possible until ischemic leg symptoms, fatigue or other&#xD;
      symptoms prevent them from continuing. This is assessed by a number of exercise testing&#xD;
      protocols including the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The American Thoracic Society provide&#xD;
      guidelines for performing a standardised 6MWT including verbal phrases that are conducted&#xD;
      every minute. Conversely, Montgomery and Gardner suggest encouragement every two minutes.&#xD;
      Encouragement has been shown to significantly affect walking performance by as much as 30&#xD;
      meters in heart failure and respiratory disease populations. However the effect of&#xD;
      encouragement on walking performance in people with IC is yet to be investigated.&#xD;
