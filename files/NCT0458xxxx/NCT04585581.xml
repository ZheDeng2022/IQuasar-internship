  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the combination of high intensity exercise&#xD;
      and time restricted eating before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of hyperglycaemia&#xD;
      during pregnancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who are planning a pregnancy will be recruited into a parallel groups randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial where the intervention will consist of high intensity training and&#xD;
      time-restricted eating. The intervention will continue throughout pregnancy. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess whether this lifestyle intervention can effect maternal and&#xD;
      offspring cardiometabolic health.&#xD;
