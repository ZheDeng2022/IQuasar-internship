  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this proposal is to conduct a randomized controlled study aimed at learning the&#xD;
      best method for applying scleral lenses and factors associated with successfully completing&#xD;
      scleral lens application and removal training.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Scleral lens (SL) prescribing has dramatically increased over the past few years likely&#xD;
      because of the advent of better SL designs, better materials, and greater awareness of the&#xD;
      technology. SL market growth has also likely increased because SLs were once reserved for&#xD;
      patients with complex ocular surface diseases, though advances with SL technologies have&#xD;
      allowed SL fitting to include patients with dry eye and even patients who have relatively&#xD;
      uncomplicated refractive errors. While SLs are maintained and cared for much like soft&#xD;
      contact lenses (e.g., they require a contact lens care system), SL wearers also need help&#xD;
      with applying their lenses. Patients specifically are advised by their care provider to&#xD;
      insert their SLs with their fingers (tripod method), a DMV inserter with an open or closed&#xD;
      end (hole potentially aides in vision), or a specialized o-ring that is balanced on a finger.&#xD;
      Our clinic also utilizes a tea light candle with a DMV inserter attached to the top of it&#xD;
      when patients have mobility issues. While work from this investigator's study group has found&#xD;
      that 54% of patients prefer DMV inserters for applying their SLs as compared to the above&#xD;
      other options, these preliminary data were obtained through a cross-sectional electronic&#xD;
      survey from subjects who completed their SL fitting up to two years ago. Therefore, the goal&#xD;
      of this proposal is to conduct a randomized controlled study aimed at learning the best&#xD;
      method for applying SLs and factors associated with successfully completing SL application&#xD;
      and removal training. These data are needed because it will help practitioners with patient&#xD;
      education and because it may increase the likelihood that patients will be successful with&#xD;
      SLs.&#xD;
