      The aim of this study was to explore the efficacy and safety of adriamycin and ifosfamide&#xD;
      combined with sintilimab in the treatment of advanced or unresectable soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At present, there are a number of clinical trials of chemotherapy drugs combined with anti&#xD;
      PD-1 antibody in the treatment of cancer, but the clinical research of chemotherapy&#xD;
      containing adriamycin combined with anti-PD-1 antibody for advanced STS patients is almost&#xD;
      blank. Regimen containing adriamycin is the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced STS&#xD;
      approved by international guidelines. As an innovative PD-1 monoclonal antibody, more phase&#xD;
      II clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in a variety&#xD;
      of cancers. For patients who fail or cannot tolerate first-line treatment, treatment options&#xD;
      are still limited. In view of the above problems, this study aims to observe and explore the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of chemotherapy including adriamycin combined with sintilimab in the&#xD;
      second-line treatment of patients with advanced STS, so as to provide more and better&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with advanced STS.&#xD;
