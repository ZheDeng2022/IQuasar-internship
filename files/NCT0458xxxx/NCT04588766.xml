    <measure>Bristol poop scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Bristol Poop Scale is a 7-point scale and was used to define stool consistency. It has been shown that the Bristol Poop Scale is associated with constipation and colonic transit time in children without constipation (140). Hard stools fit 1 and 2, loose (ideal) stools fit 3, 4, 5, diarrhea types 6 and 7. Therefore, represented by stool consistency scores as hard, loose stools and diarrhea.</description>

    <measure>Gross motor function criterion</measure>
    <time_frame>20 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Scale-88 was created to evaluate the changes in gross motor functions as growth and development continues in individuals with cerebral palsy. It is a standardized, regular, systematic observational test. It has categories that follow each other during normal motor and physiological development. These; are supine, prone, crawling, sitting, laptop, standing, walking, and use of stairs. These categories include activities appropriate to the headings in the sub-items. Scoring is divided into five main categories. It consists of a total of 88 items, 17 in the supine and prone categories, 20 in the sitting category, 14 in the crawling and laptop category, 13 in the standing category, and 24 in the walking, running and stair climbing categories. While these items are tested, gross motor functions are evaluated according to the correct achievement level.</description>

    <measure>The Gross Motor Function Classification System</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Gross Motor Function Classification System was used to classify the gross motor function levels of individuals with CP. This system is a standard classification system developed by Robert Palisano. KMFSS is based on actively initiated movements by the individual, focusing on sitting, position change and mobility. In this five-level system, it is important that the differences between levels are evident in life activities. The differences are determined by the limitations in functional activities, the need for manual movement aids (walkers, canes, crutches, etc.) or wheeled transport vehicles. The quality of the movement is of little importance</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Rome IV criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>5</time_frame>
    <description>Constipation is not a disease but a symptom. Constipation is determined according to Rome IV criteria. Symptoms should have started at least 6 months ago. At least 25% of the defecations; in the form of lumpy or hard stools, straining, feeling of anorectal obstruction, feeling of incomplete emptying, using hand aid (finger emptying effort, pelvic floor support); The frequency of defecation should include two or more of the findings of defecation less than 3 times a week, soft stools if laxative is not used, very rare, and not having sufficient criteria for the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel syndrome. The identified complaints must continue for at least 3 months.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Modified constipation assessment scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This scale, which will be used to evaluate constipation in individuals, was used in 1989 in McMillan SC. et al. It is a valid and reliable scale consisting of 9 questions that can be answered by the individual about the presence and severity of constipation and can be used in children and adults. It contains eight items, each classified as &quot;no problem&quot; by the patient. It is scored as 'no problem' (0 point), 'some problem' (1 point) or 'serious problem' (2 points). The item scores are then added up and the total score ranges from 0 (no constipation) to 18 (worst possible constipation).</description>

    <measure>Constipation severity scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>To measure the severity of constipation, Varma MG. et al. developed by. CSO is a scale that questions the frequency and intensity of defecation of individuals and the difficulty in this process. This scale, which can provide information about constipation symptoms, consists of 16 questions.</description>

    <measure>Six-sided pain scale-6</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>The Hexagonal Pain Scale (YAS-6) was originally developed for use in pediatrics. There are several versions of YAS, some of them six, seven or nine hundred. At the same time, the scale with eleven faces is used in current studies to be compatible with the 0--10 Numeric Rating Scale.</description>
