    <textblock>
      Due to the demographic change, there is a growing demand for professional and institutional&#xD;
      care, as well as the need for 24-hour home care. Care receivers range from elderly people, in&#xD;
      need of assistance with household activities only, to those with a comprehensive need for&#xD;
      round-the-clock care. Caregivers commute between Austria and their respective home country&#xD;
      (mainly Slovakia, Hungary and Romania) in a two or more weeks cycle. Burdensome working&#xD;
      conditions arise mainly due to language problems, isolated coexistence with a person affected&#xD;
      by e.g. dementia, in combination with limited professional education and quality control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is the development and evaluation of a software solution for the&#xD;
      support and quality assurance of 24-hour home care. The application software contains:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an information and education portal (e-learning platform)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a comprehensive electronic care documentation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. an integrated emergency management&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Due to the demographic change, there is a growing demand for professional and institutional&#xD;
      care, as well as the need for 24-hour home care. Due to the cost-efficiency and 24-hour&#xD;
      availability, the 24-hour home care represents a cornerstone of the care of older people and,&#xD;
      with more than 60.000 users in Austria, it represents an important alternative to family&#xD;
      assistance and mobile care. Care receivers range from elderly people, who only need&#xD;
      assistance with household activities, to those with a high need for a round-the-clock care.&#xD;
      Caregivers commute between Austria and the respective home country (mainly Slovakia, Hungary&#xD;
      and Romania) for the care work in a two or more weeks rhythm. Burdensome working conditions&#xD;
      arise mainly due to language problems, isolated coexistence with a person affected by e.g.&#xD;
      dementia in combination with little to no relevant professional education and quality&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the project is the development and evaluation of a distributed client-server&#xD;
      software solution for the support and quality assurance of 24-hour home care. The application&#xD;
      software contains:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. an information and education portal (e-learning platform) with interactive learning&#xD;
           content on common diseases and short videos on recurrent care situations in German, as&#xD;
           well as in Slovak, Hungarian and Romanian as the most frequent languages of the&#xD;
           caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. a comprehensive electronic care documentation that supports quality assurance and&#xD;
           ensures transparency between people involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. an integrated emergency management, which offers caregivers the opportunity to react&#xD;
           quickly and professionally to emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. links to translation pages or networking opportunities with members and relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By using the application software, the quality of care will be supported and further result&#xD;
      in an increase of care quality and quality of life of the older adults cared for. Due to&#xD;
      intense longitudinal evaluation design with more than 100 involved households facilitating&#xD;
      24-hour home care for a period of 12 months, the efficacy will be measured&#xD;
      multi-dimensionally. Common surveys and structured interviews of people with cognitive&#xD;
      impairments tend to lack sensitivity to the interventions studied. Hence, a mixed-method&#xD;
      approach has been selected that integrates 1) investigator observations, 2) interviews with&#xD;
      caregivers, 3) interviews with relative and 4) interviews with care receivers (where&#xD;
      possible). Trained investigators generate reliable ratings via triangulation. Field work and&#xD;
      analysis follows the methodology developed as Toolkit ASCOT (Adult Social Care Outcomes&#xD;
      Toolkit 11) SCT4 (self completion survey).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Three parallel arms investigate 1) the control group, where home care is being continued as before, 2) combined effects of the e-learning platform and the networking platform, and 3) effects of the entire intervention (e-learning platform, networking platform, digital care documentation). The interventions last 12 months, with effects being investigated in two follow-ups after three and 12 months. The main one-sided alternative hypothesis, assumes a positive trend from 1 ) towards 3) in the outcomes studied. Planned contrasts are:&#xD;
control vs. experimental arm 3 (indicating effects of the entire experimental intervention)&#xD;
arm 2 vs. arm 3 (indicating whether arm 3 has additional effects as compared to arm 2)&#xD;
Planned contrasts are ignored, if the overall null hypothesis is not rejected in the ANOVA.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This intervention consists of the e-learning platform and the networking platform from the newly developed client-server software solution &quot;24-h-QuAALity&quot;.&#xD;
The e-learning platform offers concise evidence-based information on common clinical patterns, as well as examples of assistance, physical activity, nutrition and daily routine provided in the caregivers' mother tongues.The caregivers use the e-learning content according to the needs of their clients and their caring skills. After completing the e-learning courses they do a test to prove their knowledge.&#xD;
The networking platform supports caregivers in communicating with other caregivers and relatives of the care receiver, with special consideration of language barriers. The caregivers use the networking platform primarily to get information or exchange it, if there are uncertainties in the care.</description>

The digital care documentation aims at supporting caregivers in managing their daily tasks and facilitates exchange with other health professionals and palliative supply. The caregivers use the care documentation every day. They describe the caring and household activities they have done by their clients. The integrated emergency management empowers caregivers with lifesaving first aid skills and knowledge including an integrated voice communication and emergency call system. The emergency management system is used by caregivers when an emergency happens in which life-threatening diseases have to be managed.</description>
