  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Robotic mastectomy and immediate reconstruction have been introduced recently in 2015.&#xD;
      However, since robotic mastectomy is latest surgical technique, there is a lack of studies&#xD;
      comparing conventional mastectomy and immediate reconstruction with robotic mastectomy&#xD;
      prospectively. For this reason, this study is designed to establish a single institution&#xD;
      cohort study that prospectively collects patients undergoing mastectomy and reconstruction.&#xD;
      And using the established prospective cohort data, a comparative study of robotic mastectomy&#xD;
      with conventional mastectomy and reconstruction, and cost effectiveness and satisfaction of&#xD;
      robotic endoscopic surgery, and cost effectiveness and satisfaction of reconstructive surgery&#xD;
      are to be analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-institution cohort study that prospectively collects patients&#xD;
      undergoing mastectomy and reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' inclusion criteria is as below; adult women over the age of 19, with breast cancer&#xD;
      or high risk of breast cancer (patients with a BRCA1/2 mutation, TP53 mutation, PALB2&#xD;
      mutation, etc) scheduled for therapeutic or prophylactic mastectomy, and want immediate&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients planned for breast-conserving surgery or who do not want immediate reconstruction&#xD;
      will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal number of enrolled patients is 2000.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting data includes patients' clinicopathological factors including height, weight, etc.&#xD;
      And also collecting surgical results, oncological results, cost-effectiveness, and&#xD;
      satisfactions of patients to secure high-level data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The satisfaction of patients using the Breast Q survey, basic characteristics like height,&#xD;
      weight, etc, and patients' photos will be collected preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, patients' data will be collected within 6 months after surgery including&#xD;
      clinical-pathological factors, surgery results (drainage amount, removal date,&#xD;
      complications), postoperative recovery evaluation, complications and adverse reactions, cost,&#xD;
      etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between 6 months and 1 year after surgery, the results of surgery, recurrence, satisfaction&#xD;
      survey, and postoperative photos will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 12 months thereafter, whether adjuvant therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy,&#xD;
      targeted therapy, endocrine therapy) was implemented, surgical results, and recurrence will&#xD;
      be investigated and collected until the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An interim analysis will be done after completing the recruitment of subjects by the 3rd year&#xD;
      after the start of the study and collecting data. Complete the follow-up observation and data&#xD;
      collection of the subjects recruited in the 4-8 years and the final analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorial variables will be examined by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be examined by t-test or ANOVA, and M-W test or K-W test if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival analysis will be examined by Kaplan-Meier plot and log-rank test.&#xD;
