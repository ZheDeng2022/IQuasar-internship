    <textblock>
      RR2 is a medical, home-care, digital therapeutic, wearable device. Its main purpose is to&#xD;
      deliver prescheduled, non-invasive, peripheral neuromodulation therapy, in conjunction with&#xD;
      standard medical care, to relieve AF symptoms, recurrence and overall burden.&#xD;
