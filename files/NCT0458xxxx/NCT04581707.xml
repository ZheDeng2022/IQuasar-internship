  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the performance and safety of two balloon kyphoplasty&#xD;
      systems (Joline®), the single balloon catheter Allevo and Quattroplasty double balloon&#xD;
      catheter Stop'n Go, using BonOs® Inject bone cement for treatment of Vertebral Compression&#xD;
      Fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vertebral compression fracture (VCF) is a very common medical problem and describes the&#xD;
      collapse of a vertebral body (VB) in the spine. VCF can lead to severe pain, decreased&#xD;
      physical function, spinal deformity and in rare cases thoracic or abdominal wall deformities,&#xD;
      that can impair pulmonary and gastrointestinal function. A VCF can occur in patients with&#xD;
      healthy spines upon severe trauma, in patients suffering from osteoporosis or in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently available therapy for VCF includes medical management, surgical treatments and&#xD;
      vertebral augmentation (VA). Medical management consists of bed rest followed by early&#xD;
      mobilization and analgesic medications. Surgical options include spinal stabilization with&#xD;
      rods and screws. VA procedures attempt to stabilize the spine and reduce vertical compression&#xD;
      by adding material to the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kyphoplasty is a commonly performed VA procedure. In kyphoplasty, a surgical instrument is&#xD;
      used to reduce the collapsed VB towards its original shape. Reduction of the fractured VB is&#xD;
      thought to be beneficial since (1) it may reduce anterior directed compressive forces&#xD;
      resulting from kyphosis of the spine due to the fracture, and (2) it may reduce some&#xD;
      physiologic abnormalities due to kyphosis, such as restrictive lung disease or abdominal&#xD;
      compression. After fracture reduction, bone cement is placed in the VB to stabilize the&#xD;
      reduction. Fracture reduction follows the orthopedic general principles of fracture repair:&#xD;
      reduction and stabilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this observational study is to compare the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Quattroplasty double balloon catheter Stop'n GO (Joline®) with the Kyphoplasty single balloon&#xD;
      catheter Allevo (Joline®) combined with BonOs® Inject bone cement for use in VCF reduction,&#xD;
      to confirm the performance of those two devices and to investigate potential major adverse&#xD;
      events associated with the use of the device in patients treated in a controlled setting when&#xD;
      used according to the IFU. Secondary objective is to compare the safety of the Quattroplasty&#xD;
      double balloon catheter Stop'n GO (Joline®) with the Kyphoplasty single balloon catheter&#xD;
      Allevo (Joline®) combined with BonOs® Inject bone cement.&#xD;

    <description>The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is a measure for pain intensity. The score of the sclae ranges from 0 for &quot;no pain&quot; to 10 for &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot;. Patients will report their pain at baseline and at 2 dedicated periods to assess change in pain intensity.</description>

    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is used to assess functional disability. The questionnaire consists of 10 items with each item having 6 statements. All scores are summed, then multiplied by two to obtain the index (range from 0 to 100) with higher score indicating greater disability.</description>
