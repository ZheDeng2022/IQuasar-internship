      A randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of reducing iodine from vitamin and&#xD;
      mineral supplements for pregnant women who have adequate iodine intakes (&gt;165 μg/d from food&#xD;
      alone) on cognitive development of children at 24 months of age.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is known that severe iodine deficiency during pregnancy leads to profound intellectual&#xD;
      disabilities in the child. Following results of a 2004 national survey of school-aged&#xD;
      children showing that mild iodine deficiency had re-emerged in the south-eastern parts of&#xD;
      Australia, the Australian government mandated the addition of iodine to salt used in bread&#xD;
      making to increase population iodine intake. It is also recommended that all pregnant and&#xD;
      lactating women take an additional iodine supplement containing 150 µg/d of iodine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this time, further evidence has emerged from cohort studies that children born to women&#xD;
      with high iodine intake (as well as low iodine intake) have poorer neurodevelopmental scores,&#xD;
      suggesting that more tailored supplementation may be a better strategy. Our PoppiE trial will&#xD;
      determine if limiting iodine supplementation in women who already consume adequate iodine&#xD;
      from food, improves cognitive scores in early childhood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 754 pregnant women from around Australia who are ≤13 weeks of gestation will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomised to receive a standard prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement with a&#xD;
      reduced amount of iodine (20 μg - intervention) or a standard prenatal vitamin and mineral&#xD;
      supplement with 200 μg of iodine (control). The control supplement contains a level of iodine&#xD;
      to match the amount in most commonly used vitamin and mineral supplements sold in Australia.&#xD;
      Infant neurodevelopment at 24 months of age will be assessed using the Bayley-IV and&#xD;
      conducted at participating centres or a location convenient to the family.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A multi-centre, randomised, controlled, clinician, researcher and participant blinded trial with two parallel groups. An independent statistician not otherwise involved in the study or data analysis will generate and keep the randomisation schedule. The computer-generated schedule will allocate women to intervention or control groups in the ratio of 1:1 using randomly permuted blocks of size 6 and 8, with stratification for state of enrolment.&#xD;
Randomisations will be performed by approved study staff via a secure web-based randomisation service.</intervention_model_description>

Study supplement bottles will be identified only by the blinded Product ID to match the randomisation schedule prepared by an independent statistician.&#xD;
Research Personnel will access the Randomisation Module in REDCap and women will be allocated a random, unique, re-identifiable randomisation ID. Women will be issued with supplements labelled to match their unique assigned code.</masking_description>
