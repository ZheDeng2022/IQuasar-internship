  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sedation is a drug-induced depression in the level of consciousness. The clinical objectives&#xD;
      of administering sedation for GI endoscopy are to relieve patient anxiety and discomfort,&#xD;
      improve the outcome of the examination, and diminish the patient's memory of the event. A&#xD;
      number of different sedatives and analgesics can be used to achieve appropriate levels of&#xD;
      sedation for GI endoscopic procedures. The targeted level of sedation may vary depending on&#xD;
      patient and procedural variables, and doses of sedatives should be titrated accordingly to&#xD;
      achieve a safe, comfortable, and technically successful endoscopic procedure. Knowledge of&#xD;
      the pharmacologic profiles of sedation agents is necessary to maximize the likelihood that&#xD;
      the desired level of sedation is achieved.(1) All patients receiving sedation to facilitate&#xD;
      endoscopic procedures should have monitoring of cardiorespiratory parameters before, during,&#xD;
      and after administration of sedation/analgesia. Electronic monitoring may detect early signs&#xD;
      of patient distress and is an adjunct to continuous clinical assessment. Commonly used&#xD;
      monitoring equipment for patients undergoing endoscopic procedures includes pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      single-lead continuous electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, and automated blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring. With the increased use of propofol to facilitate endoscopy in recent years, less&#xD;
      familiar monitoring devices have been introduced, including end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2)&#xD;
      and level of consciousness monitors. Given a recent change in the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines, recommending CO2 monitoring for patients undergoing both&#xD;
      moderate and deep sedation, familiarity with capnography may become necessary.(2) Patients&#xD;
      are at risk of respiratory depression and acute hypercapnia during sedation and recovery from&#xD;
      anaesthesia . Desaturation on pulse oximetry for monitoring of hypoventilation is a late&#xD;
      sign. Moreover, hypoventilation is masked by administration of supplemental O2. ( 3) For a&#xD;
      sedated patient in spontaneous ventilation, hypoventilation (by airway obstruction or central&#xD;
      respiratory depression) will likely precede hypoxemia. Hence, if the patient is monitored&#xD;
      using a capnograph machine, when hypoventilation occurs, PEtCO2 increases and the shape of&#xD;
      the capnography curve is modified.This may trigger an adequate response from the person&#xD;
      monitoring the anesthesia (chin thrust, sedative dose modification, oxygen supplementation)&#xD;
      so as to prevent hypoxemia. (5) Measuring CO2 noninvasively includes capnography and&#xD;
      capnometry. capnography provides numerical and graphical (waveforms) forms, while capnometry&#xD;
      provides only numerical form. (6) Arterial blood gas (ABG) can tell us about the patient's&#xD;
      acid-base balance, which is measured by the hydrogen ion (H) concentration in the blood (pH),&#xD;
      oxygen saturation (SaO2), partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon&#xD;
      dioxide (PaCO2), concentration of bicarbonate (HCO3), base excess and base deficit.(7) ABG&#xD;
      results can indicate how effectively the patient's body is compensating for the acid-base&#xD;
      disturbance and whether the patient's total blood volume is adequate for transporting all the&#xD;
      nutrients that the body's tissues require. (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyopthesis of this trial: is CO2 monitoring through non-invasive methods may provide an early&#xD;
      warning sign of hypoventilation during procedural sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: Measuring end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) that is taken during different&#xD;
      flows of oxygen(O2) supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: Will include O2 saturation, haemodynamics (systolic blood pressure,&#xD;
      diastolic blood pressure and mean blood pressure), time to recovery, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      Ramsay sedation scale (which is used to measure level of sedation through dividing patients&#xD;
      level of sedation into 6 categories ranging from severe agitation to deep coma). (9) Ramsay&#xD;
      Sedation Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient is anxious and agitated or restless, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient is co-operative, oriented, and tranquil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient responds to commands only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient exhibits brisk response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient exhibits a sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient exhibits no response.&#xD;

        : Two days before surgery, patients will visit the outpatient clinic for history taken,&#xD;
        clinical assessment and explanation about the study protocol. Laboratory investigations&#xD;
        will be performed and patients will be informed that they can stop participation in the&#xD;
        study at any time without any loss of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will receive conscious sedation via propofol 1.5 mg/kg and lidocaine 1 mg/kg and&#xD;
        CO2 monitored through non-invasive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        At the end of the procedure, all patients will recover until full consciousness regains and&#xD;
        they are able to follow verbal commands. After the desired spontaneous ventilation, the&#xD;
        patients will be transferred to the recovery room.&#xD;
