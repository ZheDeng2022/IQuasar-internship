  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vision loss is common among older adults and leads to an increased risk for depression and&#xD;
      difficulties in daily tasks, thus requiring dependence on caregivers. This study will assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of providing two virtual interventions, Sahaj Samadhi Meditation (SSM) and&#xD;
      Health Enhancement Program (HEP), to supplement care of patients with irreversible&#xD;
      age-related vision loss (IARVL) and their caregivers, with the goal of enhancing mental&#xD;
      health and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Through a high-quality, single-blind, three-arm mixed-method pilot feasibility study using&#xD;
      randomized treatment assignment, the study team will assess two new innovative interventions,&#xD;
      Sahaj Samadhi Meditation (SSM) and Health Enhancement Program (HEP), both delivered&#xD;
      virtually, to augment clinical care of patients with irreversible age-related vision loss&#xD;
      (IARVL), with the goal of enhancing mental health and quality of life (QOL) for patients&#xD;
      and/or their caregivers. Participants will be blinded to the treatment hypothesis, while&#xD;
      investigators and treating clinicians will be additionally blinded to the intervention. Both&#xD;
      SSM and HEP will be taught over 4 consecutive days in similar sized groups (10 patients&#xD;
      and/or their 10 caregivers) followed by weekly reinforcement sessions for subsequent 11&#xD;
      weeks. Self-rated questionnaires will be used to collect data on quality of life and mental&#xD;
      health symptoms at 0-week and 12-week follow-up&#xD;
