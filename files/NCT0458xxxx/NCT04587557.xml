  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to examine the effects of storytelling with or without contextual information&#xD;
      on children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typical development (TD).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a 2 x 2 x 2 randomized controlled trial with 52 children (26 with ASD and 26 with&#xD;
      TD) recruited in the community and randomized into four groups: 1) ASD Group 1 - storytelling&#xD;
      with contextual information; 2) ASD Group 2 - storytelling without contextual information; 3)&#xD;
      TD Group 1 - storytelling with contextual information; 4) TD Group 2 - storytelling without&#xD;
      contextual information. All stories were photo-based and static in nature. The only&#xD;
      difference between Group 1 and Group 2 was that the stories included and did not include&#xD;
      social contextual information, respectively. Training was delivered in small groups, with&#xD;
      eight sessions across four weeks, two sessions per week, and 30 minutes per session.&#xD;
      Participants' total fixation duration (TFD), total visit duration (TVD), and total fixation&#xD;
      count (TFC) on human faces from 20 photos and a video were recorded using the Tobii eye&#xD;
      tracker.&#xD;
