  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Part A of this study is a Phase 1, First-in-human (FiH), randomized, single-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of AZD3366 following single intravenous (IV) ascending doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of this study is a randomized, single-blind, parallel group placebo-controlled study&#xD;
      to assess the safety, tolerability and PD of a single IV administration of AZD3366 with&#xD;
      concomitant loading doses followed by repeated maintenance dosing of ticagrelor and&#xD;
      acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will provide data on safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of AZD3366 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Three populations (healthy subjects, healthy Japanese subjects and healthy Chinese&#xD;
      subjects) will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted at a single study center in United States of America (USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD (inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet aggregation and capillary bleeding time [CBT]) of an IV administration of single&#xD;
      ascending doses (SAD) of AZD3366 in healthy subjects, healthy Japanese subjects and healthy&#xD;
      Chinese subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of the study will investigate the safety, tolerability, and PD (inhibition of platelet&#xD;
      aggregation and CBT) of a single IV dose of AZD3366 or placebo with concomitant&#xD;
      administration of ticagrelor and ASA by a parallel group cohort consisting of of healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Furthermore, the potential effect of AZD3366 on the PK of ticagrelor will be&#xD;
      investigated. Co-medication with ASA and ticagrelor is chosen based on the Standard of Care&#xD;
      anti-platelet treatment regimen in patients with myocardial infarction.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Staff will remain blinded. For this single-blind study (in which the study center staff have remained blinded during the dosing phase of the study), the randomization code will be available at the SRC meeting and the data will be reviewed unblinded.&#xD;
The pharmacokineticist will remain unblinded during the study conduct, unless otherwise required based on study findings.&#xD;
The following personnel will have access to the randomization list:&#xD;
The AstraZeneca personnel carrying out the labeling and packaging of subject specific treatments&#xD;
The pharmacy personnel preparing study drug at the site&#xD;
The personnel performing the bioanalyses of the plasma/urine samples. The randomization list should be kept in a secure location until the end of the study.&#xD;
In the event of a medical emergency, the treatment received may be revealed by personnel authorized by the principal investigator (PI), after discussing with AstraZeneca.</masking_description>
