  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a phase II trial investigating the efficacy of CBD in paclitaxel- and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy. The trial uses multiple assessments such as&#xD;
      validated PRO-questionnaires and multifrequency vibrometry.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is among the most feared side effects to&#xD;
      cancer treatment. The development of CIPN can lead to omission or even discontinuation of&#xD;
      antineoplastic drugs, possibly affecting efficacy of cancer treatment. There is a lack of&#xD;
      knowledge about the natural course of CIPN and to this date, there are no available methods&#xD;
      for the early detection of CIPN. With no effective prevention or treatment options, the&#xD;
      condition has severe impact on patient quality of life and healthcare expenditure.&#xD;
