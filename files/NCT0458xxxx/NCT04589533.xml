  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a national multicenter study that involves 54 Internal Medicine Units throughout&#xD;
      Italy. It is designed as a replicate of two cross-sectional surveys interspersed with an&#xD;
      educational program. The study is composed by three steps. Phase 1 concerns a retrospective&#xD;
      data collection pertaining to patients with known diagnosis of T2DM. In phase 2 an&#xD;
      educational training (focused on current Diabetes Guidelines recommendations and based on&#xD;
      possible deviations from the best clinical practice observed during phase1) will be conducted&#xD;
      in 36 randomized centres out of the 54 ones enrolled (cluster randomization). The ratio 2:1&#xD;
      has been selected in order to offer to the majority of Centres the opportunity to undergo a&#xD;
      program of training and maximize the potential positive effect of the educational program on&#xD;
      patient management. Randomization will be performed at the beginning of the study. Centres&#xD;
      will be selected according to their ability to prescribe all classes of antidiabetic drugs.&#xD;
      Phase 3 will occur around 6 months after the training and concerns a new data collection&#xD;
      mirroring the previous one. In the phase 1, as well as in the phase 3, the data collection&#xD;
      will be based on the review of the medical records of the last 40 consecutive patients with&#xD;
      T2DM hospitalized in each Centre of Internal Medicine (in total, 80 patients for each&#xD;
      Centre). After a period of 6 months from the hospitalization, a phone call follow up will be&#xD;
      performed to know the clinical status of the patient enrolled, if he/she has been&#xD;
      re-hospitalized after the index admission and current diabetes treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During phase 1 and phase 3, each Center will review the medical records of the last 40&#xD;
      patients (for each phase) with known T2DM and hospitalized for any cause. Therefore, being&#xD;
      the data collection retrospective, patients will be managed according to routine clinical&#xD;
      practice. During phase 2, 36 randomized centers, out of the 54 ones enrolled, will receive an&#xD;
      educational intervention based on outreach visit (EOV), a 3-h face-to-face meeting between a&#xD;
      trained diabetes specialist from outside the Center and the staff of the Center itself. This&#xD;
      method was selected being considered as one of the most effective to modify professional&#xD;
      practice and improve health care outcomes. In addition, at least 50% of the physicians who&#xD;
      are part of the staff of the Center will receive distance learning (FAD). The contents of the&#xD;
      educational program will be defined by the study Steering Committee, on the basis of&#xD;
      guidelines, and possible deviations from the best medical practice detected during phase 1.&#xD;
      In order to minimize the &quot;awareness bias&quot; (i.e. the possibility that participation to the&#xD;
      project significantly influence clinical attitudes in phase 3), only one physician of the&#xD;
      Centers of the &quot;Control&quot; group (not receiving EOV) will be made aware of the study design and&#xD;
      procedures, and he/she will be eventually supported in the study data collection by nurses,&#xD;
      or physicians who do not have the possibility of prescribing, in particular regarding the new&#xD;
      categories of antidiabetic drugs.&#xD;
