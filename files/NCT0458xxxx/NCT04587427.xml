  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The patients in this study had their prostate cancer spread even when the amount of&#xD;
      testosterone in the body was reduced. This is also known as metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, radium-223, is currently available as a treatment for mCRPC. But, in a&#xD;
      clinical trial, researchers found that participants of that trial had medical problems when&#xD;
      receiving radium-223 with certain other cancer treatments. This led researchers to change the&#xD;
      instructions about how doctors should use radium-223 with other cancer treatments. In this&#xD;
      study, the researchers want to learn more about how doctors are now using radium-223 to treat&#xD;
      patients with mCRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no required visits or tests in this study. The researchers in this study will&#xD;
      review information from the patients' medical records and medical claims from hospitals where&#xD;
      the patients received radium-223. The patients in this study will include men in Denmark,&#xD;
      Germany, or the Netherlands. They will not have received radium-223 before. They will have at&#xD;
      least 6 months of medical records before starting treatment with radium-223.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will look at the medical records of patients who first started receiving&#xD;
      radium-223 before there were new instructions about using it with other cancer treatments.&#xD;
      They will also look at the medical records of patients who first started receiving radium-223&#xD;
      after there were new instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will collect the patients' medical records up to December 2020. They will&#xD;
      then count how many patients received other specific cancer treatments with radium-223. They&#xD;
      will compare the results of the patients who received radium-223 before the new instructions&#xD;
      and those who received it after the new instructions.&#xD;

        The study population will include new users of radium-223 during the study periods captured&#xD;
        in each data source. The study period will include time periods before and after the label&#xD;
        change. The &quot;before&quot; period will start in November 2013, the month of radium-223 approval,&#xD;
        and will end the in November 2017, the month when the first Direct Healthcare Professional&#xD;
        Communication (DHCP) letter was sent. The &quot;after&quot; period will include an enrolment phase&#xD;
        during which patients initiating radium-223 in each data source will be identified. The&#xD;
        enrolment phase will last at least 1 year, starting in April 2019 (6 months after the label&#xD;
        change), and will continue through a follow up phase of at least 6 months after the last&#xD;
        new user of radium-223 is identified.&#xD;

This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research.
