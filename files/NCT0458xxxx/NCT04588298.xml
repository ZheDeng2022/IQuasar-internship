    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group, pre-surgical study aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      biological effects, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of different doses of&#xD;
      oral AZD9833 in post-menopausal (and potentially pre-menopausal)women with primary breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in approximately 20 study centers across 3 countries and will be&#xD;
      conducted in two stages (stage 1 and stage 2). After the screening visit and confirmation of&#xD;
      eligibility, evaluable participants will be enrolled across treatment groups. In stage 1, up&#xD;
      to 24 evaluable participants across two treatment groups will be enrolled. A Safety and Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee will convene to review stage 1 data and decide whether further treatment&#xD;
      groups are required in stage 2. Stage 2 may include up to 60 evaluable participants across up&#xD;
      to 5 treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 Group 1: AZD9833 Dose A once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose B once daily&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 (Optional) Group 1: AZD9833 Dose C once daily Group 2: AZD9833 Dose D once daily&#xD;
      Group 3: AZD9833 Dose E once daily Group 4: Fulvestrant 500 mg Group 5: AZD9833 Dose F once&#xD;
      daily (pre-menopausal women)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD9833 doses C, D, E or F could be the same as Dose A or Dose B from stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and concomitant medications information will be collected throughout the&#xD;
      study. Thereafter there will be 28-day follow-up visit after discontinuation of study&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomised, open-label, parallel-group study. The study is divided into two stages as follows:&#xD;
Stage 1: In this stage post-menopausal participants will be randomised in 2 cohorts in 1:1 ratio to receive AZD9833 with 12 evaluable participants in each cohort.&#xD;
Stage 2 (Optional): In this stage post-menopausal participants may be randomised in up to 4 cohorts, which may include up to 3 doses of AZD9833 and/or fulvestrant. Pre-menopausal participants may also be assigned to receive AZD9833.</intervention_model_description>
