  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, first-in-human, open-label study of JAB-8263 to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and assess the DLT. 30 subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumor will be enrolled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      JAB-8263 is a small-molecule inhibitor of the highly conserved bromodomain pockets of the&#xD;
      bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and assess the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of&#xD;
      JAB-8263 as a single agent to adult subjects with advanced solid tumors To assess the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of JAB-8263 To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PDc) To evaluate preliminary antitumor activity of JAB-8263&#xD;
