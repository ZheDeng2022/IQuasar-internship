  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to evaluate efficacy of Bright IDEAS, an evidence-based&#xD;
      problem-solving skills training (PSST) program, as a supportive care intervention for young&#xD;
      adult (YA) cancer patients compared with enhanced usual psychosocial care with 344 young&#xD;
      adult patients newly diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bright IDEAS-YA is a personalized approach to increase problem-solving ability by fostering&#xD;
      positive appraisal of problems as solvable challenges that can be overcome and enhancing&#xD;
      rational problem-solving skills to systematically work through any problem. Bright IDEAS-YA&#xD;
      intervention consists of six 45-minute one-on-one sessions with a trainer who teaches the&#xD;
      participant the Bright IDEAS stepwise approach to problem-solving and guides the participant&#xD;
      through solving their own problems using the Bright IDEAS approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 344 young adult patients newly diagnosed with cancer will be recruited to participate&#xD;
      in this multi-site randomized controlled trial, where the Bright IDEAS-YA intervention will&#xD;
      be compared with enhanced usual psychosocial care. Efficacy will be evaluated by examining&#xD;
      changes in psychosocial outcomes from baseline to post-intervention (3 months) and follow-up&#xD;
      (6 and 12 months). The extent to which changes in aspects of problem-solving ability mediate&#xD;
      the intervention effects will be examined.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Symptoms of Depression, as Measured by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Short-Form (v1.0 8a)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Time 3 (about 6 months from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>Respondents report symptoms on a 5-point rating scale from 1 &quot;never&quot; to 5 &quot;always&quot; in the past 7 days, with higher scores indicating higher levels of negative affect. A total raw summary score is calculated and then translated into a standardized T-score with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.</description>

    <measure>Change in Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - General (FACT-G v4)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to Time 3 (about 6 months from baseline)</time_frame>
    <description>This 27-item measures health-related quality of life and yields an overall General Total score and four subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB), Emotional Well-Being (EWB) and Functional Well-Being (FWB). Respondents rate each item on 5-point Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much) in the past 7 days, where higher numbers indicate higher health state. Each scale is a summary of responses, ranging from 0 to 28 for PWB, SWB, and FWB, 0 to 24 for EWB, and 0 to 108 for General Total.</description>
