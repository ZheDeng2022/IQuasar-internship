    <textblock>
      The COcoa Supplement and Multivitamin Outcomes Study (COSMOS; NCT02422745) is a randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial of cocoa extract supplement (containing a total of 500 mg/d flavanols,&#xD;
      including 80 mg (-)-epicatechin), and/or a standard multivitamin supplement to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer among men aged 60 years and older and women aged 65&#xD;
      years and older. This ancillary study (COSMOS Web) is being conducted among a subset of&#xD;
      participants in COSMOS and will examine whether the cocoa extract supplements affects&#xD;
      cognitive function in older adults.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the COSMOS Web study is to determine whether a dietary intervention with&#xD;
      flavanol-containing cocoa extract has an effect on cognitive function in older adults (age&#xD;
      60+). The study will be conducted in a subset of 4000 participants from the COSMOS&#xD;
      study(NCT02422745). The investigators' recent work (Sloan et al., submitted) showed that&#xD;
      cocoa flavanol consumption over 12 weeks led to improvements in immediate recall on the&#xD;
      ModRey verbal memory task in healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COSMOS Web, the investigators are testing the effect of a dietary intervention with&#xD;
      flavanol-containing cocoa extract on a range of aging-related cognitive measures, as assessed&#xD;
      through a novel online-administered test battery, in a cohort of older participants. Change&#xD;
      in ModRey immediate recall performance over 1 year of cocoa extract consumption will be our&#xD;
      primary outcome measure. Secondary endpoints will include change in ModRey performance at 2-&#xD;
      and 3-year follow-up, and change in performance tests of a novel object recognition task,&#xD;
      executive function/working memory, and spatial memory at 1-, 2-, and 3- years follow-up. This&#xD;
      study will explore whether baseline measures of cognition and nutritional status can predict&#xD;
      differential effects of the cocoa extract supplementation. This study will also explore the&#xD;
      effect of multivitamin intake on the primary and secondary outcomes noted above and test&#xD;
      whether multivitamin intake interacts with flavanol intake from cocoa extract to enhance or&#xD;
      mitigate effects on cognitive outcomes. In a subset of participants evaluated in person, this&#xD;
      study will examine the impact of cocoa extract intake and explore the main and interacting&#xD;
      effects of multivitamins on cognitive changes and brain structure and function appreciated&#xD;
      with magnetic resonance imaging over a 2-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leveraging the COSMOS study, which has randomized 21,442 older adult participants into cocoa&#xD;
      extract and placebo interventions, the study team at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who&#xD;
      administer the parent COSMOS trial, are recruiting ~4000 older adult volunteers to&#xD;
      participate in COSMOS Web (this study) an online cognitive testing battery developed by the&#xD;
      team at Columbia University. These 4000 participants will complete an initial online&#xD;
      cognitive assessment and additional assessments after one, two, and three years of follow-up.&#xD;
      In addition, approximately 200 COSMOS Web participants who live in the Boston area will&#xD;
      complete clinic-based study visits at the Clinical and Translational Science Center at&#xD;
      Brigham and Women's Hospital. During that visit, they will complete a neuropsychological test&#xD;
      battery, for comparison to their performance online. This study will examine the impact of&#xD;
      dietary interventions with cocoa extract and explore the main and interacting effects of&#xD;
      multivitamin intake on cognitive changes and brain structure and function appreciated with&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging over a 2-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the COSMOS trial began, an advanced method to analyze cocoa flavanols was accredited by&#xD;
      AOAC International as a First Action Official Method of Analysis&#xD;
      https://doi.org/10.1093/jaoacint/qsaa132). This updated method relies on a reference material&#xD;
      (RM8403) recently standardized and made commercially available by the U.S. National Institute&#xD;
      of Standards and Technology. While the actual cocoa flavanol content of the COSMOS&#xD;
      intervention remained unchanged throughout the trial, the application of this new analytical&#xD;
      method led to expected changes in how the total cocoa flavanol content is now reported.&#xD;
      Applying AOAC 2020.05/RM8403 to the COSMOS intervention, the total cocoa flavanol content of&#xD;
      the COSMOS intervention is now 500 mg/day. Reporting of (-)-epicatechin content remained&#xD;
      unaffected. Going forward, we will therefore apply AOAC 2020.05/RM8403 and report that the&#xD;
      COSMOS intervention tested 500 mg/day of cocoa flavanols, including 80 mg of (-)-epicatechin.&#xD;
