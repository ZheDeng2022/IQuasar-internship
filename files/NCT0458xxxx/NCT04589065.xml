  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to see if a new device (SCD) is safe and if it can&#xD;
      reduce damage to the kidney enough to allow medications to work to improve heart and kidney&#xD;
      function for use in patients that have moderate to severe heart failure and is at least in&#xD;
      part due to heart failure and it not responding to standard medical therapy. The SCD is a&#xD;
      cartridge used with a commercial hemodialysis unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in the clinical trial once eligibility is confirmed. In&#xD;
      addition to clinical assessments and laboratory testing participants will have surface&#xD;
      echocardiograms during the trial. The SCD treatment will take place for 4 hours on day 1, 3,&#xD;
      and 5 while on hemodialysis.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary hospitalization for acute decompensated chronic systolic heart failure as&#xD;
             defined:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Left ventricular ejection fraction ≤35% as confirmed by baseline imaging&#xD;
                  procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV chronic (≤ 90 days) systolic&#xD;
                  heart failure, with failure to respond to optimal medical therapy (beta blocker,&#xD;
                  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockers&#xD;
                  (ARB) or valsartan/sacubitril, aldosterone antagonist, unless not tolerated or&#xD;
                  contraindicated, and loop diuretic, as needed) for 45 of the last 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR)** ≥ 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 (baseline&#xD;
             defined as the highest known eGFR within 90 days of study enrollment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Worsening renal failure (WRF), defined for the purposes of this study as increase&#xD;
             serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dL from baseline (baseline defined as the lowest known serum&#xD;
             creatinine within 90 days of study enrollment)&#xD;

             the purposes of this study, optimal intravenous diuretic therapy is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Furosemide equivalent total daily dose of 240 mg (furosemide 40mg=1mg bumetanide)&#xD;

             dopamine at ≤ 3 mcg/kg/min will not preclude study inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
