    <textblock>
      An intervention study on the effect of cannabidiol on lean body mass in cancer patients&#xD;
      receiving chemotherapy, at the department of Clinical Oncology at Zealand University&#xD;
      Hospital, Roskilde, Denmark. Fat free mass will be measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. As&#xD;
      secondary outcomes protein and energy intake, nausea, taste alterations and life quality will&#xD;
      be assessed by oral interviews and questionnaires.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the side effects of chemotherapy is loss of lean body mass. With a non-blinded two&#xD;
      armed intervention design this study will examine the effect of cannabidiol on fat free mass&#xD;
      in cancer patients. The study will include patients who are diagnosed with cancer and&#xD;
      scheduled to undergo at least 4 courses of paclitaxel or oxaliplatin based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients receiving cannabidiol (300mg/day) will have no change in lean&#xD;
      body mass at the end of the study. In extension to this, we hypothesize that cannabidiol will&#xD;
      increase the energy and protein intake because of increased appetite and decreased nausea and&#xD;
      emesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and data collection will take place at the department of Clinical Oncology at&#xD;
      Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be included for four courses of paclitaxel or oxaliplatin based&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The length between each chemotherapy course is three weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lean body mass will be measured by impedance spectroscopy before every chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For two and a half months, patients will answer a weekly questionnaire about nausea, appetite&#xD;
      and quality of life in general. The questionnaire is developed for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the questionnaire, the patients will be interviewed about their daily dietary&#xD;
      intake to quantify their energy and protein intake, calculated as percentage of estimated&#xD;
      need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another side effect of chemotherapy is alterations in taste. In this study, we will examine&#xD;
      the patient's taste in sweet and salty. At the day of chemotherapy, the patients will have a&#xD;
      taste test. In the taste test the patients must tell which of the basic flavors they presume&#xD;
      they are consuming, as well as how strong the taste is , on a scale from 1 to 10.&#xD;

    <description>Change in intake of energy assessed by weekly nutritional 24-hour recall interview.&#xD;
Assessment of energy requirement using Harris Benedict- formula estimated from height in cm, weight in kilo, age in years and physical activity level (PAL). Height and weight is derived from bioimpedance measurements in Outcome 1. Age is derived from conversation with the participant. PAL is assessed after conversation with the participant. Energy requirements will be reported as kilojoule (Kj).&#xD;
Correlation between relative fulfilment of energy requirement, and change therein. Energy requirement is estimated by Harris-Benedict formula, including among other assessment of physical activity level.</description>

    <measure>Change in nausea</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks</time_frame>
