      The main purpose of the study is to examine the effect of squat-based exercise approach in&#xD;
      individuals with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare effect to three groups (flywheel exercise group,&#xD;
      electrotherapy modality group and home exercise group) and also decrease the pain, increase&#xD;
      muscle strength, activation values and increase the functional level of individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis is the most common rheumatological disease in the world that primarily results&#xD;
      in progressive cartilage destruction. Changes occurring as a result of osteoarthritis are the&#xD;
      main cause of disability and are most common in the knee joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis; problems such as pain, tenderness, joint stiffness, joint swelling, movement&#xD;
      restriction, joint deformities, loss of muscle strength, decreased functional capacity and&#xD;
      impaired quality of life are observed. The daily life activities of individuals with knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis are restricted by the problems of walking up and down stairs, getting out of&#xD;
      the chair, standing, squatting, walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving the symptoms of the disease is an important goal of the rehabilitation process of&#xD;
      patients with knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In individuals with knee osteoarthritis, joint structure and deformation in cartilage also&#xD;
      show loss of strength with muscles. Strengthening exercises have been used in patients with&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis for a long time. Squat exercise is a type of exercise that is widely used&#xD;
      as a strengthening exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OA is endemic around the world. About 30.8 million adults in the United States and 300&#xD;
      million people worldwide live with OA. OA is a disease of the entire joint involving&#xD;
      structural changes in articular cartilage, subchondral bone, ligaments, capsule, synovial&#xD;
      membrane, and periarticular muscles. Clinically, OA is characterized by joint pain,&#xD;
      tenderness, limitation of movement, crepitus, effusion and varying degrees of non-systemic&#xD;
      inflammation. Pain, stiffness and difficulty in daily life activities due to the negative&#xD;
      impact of functional status are among the main symptoms. The knee is the most affected joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare effect to three groups (flywheel exercise, electrotherapy&#xD;
      modality and home exercise) Flywheel training is a strength training modality that offers the&#xD;
      possibility of performing exercises with eccentric overload and variable resistance as&#xD;
      compared to conventional gravity-based resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrophysical agents are used by physiotherapists to treat a wide variety of conditions.&#xD;
      Electrotherapy modalities especially transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and&#xD;
      ultrasound is used to treat OA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ho: Three different protocols applied in individuals with knee osteoarthritis have no&#xD;
           effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-0: It is effective in three different protocols applied in individuals with knee&#xD;
           osteoarthritis, but three don't have statistically effect on each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-1: Exercise with isoinertial system in individuals with knee osteoarthritis to be&#xD;
           more effective than other treatment protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-2: Electrotherapy (TENS, ultrasound and hot pack or cold pack) and squat-based home&#xD;
           exercise program is more effective than other treatment protocols in individuals with&#xD;
           knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  H1-3: Electrotherapy (TENS, ultrasound and hot pack or cold pack) and squat-based home&#xD;
           exercise program in individuals with knee osteoarthritis to be more effective than other&#xD;
           treatment protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the baseline assessment, the participants were randomized to one of three intervention&#xD;
      groups (ratio 1:1:1) using &quot;Research Randomizer,&quot; an online randomization web service&#xD;
      (https://www.randomizer.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was planned as a double-blind study without knowing the necessary treatment or&#xD;
      experimental condition for both the subject and the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was determined using an Instat sample size calculator. In the WOMAC sections, the&#xD;
      smallest detectable difference and minimal clinically important difference ranged from 0.51&#xD;
      to 1.33 points. This value was used to calculate the sample size (Angst, Aeschlimann, and&#xD;
      Stucki, 2001). Investigators included a two sided alpha value of 0.05, a power of 0.9, and a&#xD;
      sample size of 21 per group. To allow for dropouts, the sample size was set at 25 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure to reach the number of patients, receiving support from other hospitals of the&#xD;
      Medipol Hospital Group Unusual increase in the rate of increase of Covid 19 outbreak, (second&#xD;
      wave, permanent curfew): Online controlled (tele-rehabilitation) exercises&#xD;

      (s) to be used&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be calculated using SPSS for Windows 22 program.&#xD;

    <description>The term isoinertial is derived from the words iso (same) and inertial (resistance), which define the primary concept of the isoinertial system in a terminology or that expresses both the concentric and eccentric phases of the same muscle contraction. Isoinertial refers to resistance used in exercise training, maintaining a constant inertia throughout the range of motion, a constant resistance in all respects, and facilitating maximum muscle strength. All participants received home exercise for 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>The active ROM exercise was performed via knee in extension to full-flexion, then knee in flexion to full-extension exercises, repeated 10 times. The strengthening exercises consisted of quadriceps strengthening by holding maximal isometric contractions for 10 s and performing 10 repetitions. Stretching targeted the gastrocnemius- soleus and hamstring muscle and was performed by asking the patient to stretch the muscle for 30 s and to complete three repetitions for each muscle group.</description>

    <description>The participants in the electrotherapy group received TENS (Intellect; Chattanooga Group, Hixson, TN), therapeutic ultrasound (Intellect 340 Combo) and exercise. TENS was applied via four electrodes around the knee joint: two on the medial and two on the lateral aspect on either side of the joint line for approximately 20 min. For pain relief, the devices were set to a continuous mode (110 Hz, 50 μ). Electrical pulses were asymmetric and biphasic.&#xD;
Therapeutic pulsed ultrasound therapy was administered using a 1-MHz frequency, 0.8 W/cm power ultrasound device with a sound-head area of 5 cm2 and effective radiating area of 3.5-5 cm2 . Ultrasound was applied to the medial and lateral parts of the knee in circular movements for a duration of 5 min with the patient in a supine position.&#xD;
All participants received the same standardized exercise program. The exercises included aerobic, active ROM, strength, and stretching exercises</description>
