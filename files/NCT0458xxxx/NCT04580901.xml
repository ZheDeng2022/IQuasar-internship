  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum depression is a very common and costly illness with numerous, long-term&#xD;
      deleterious effects for women, their offspring and families; yet most women are not treated.&#xD;
      Group IPT delivered virtually offers women a 1st-line, low-cost intervention that overcomes&#xD;
      existing treatment barriers. To test its acceptability and effectiveness, a RCT will be&#xD;
      conducted to compare virtually delivered group IPT immediately to usual care in women in&#xD;
      Ontario Canada who have postpartum depression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression during pregnancy and in the first year following delivery affects 15-20% of women.&#xD;
      Left untreated, these disorders increase the risk of future depressive episodes, postpartum&#xD;
      depression in their partners, as well as emotional, behavioural, and cognitive problems in&#xD;
      offspring. Unfortunately, up to 85% of these women will not receive treatment, which is&#xD;
      estimated to cost the province of Ontario upwards of $6 billion annually. There is&#xD;
      significant stigma surrounding perinatal depression which can result in less help-seeking by&#xD;
      women, as well as a lack of awareness about available non-medication treatment options among&#xD;
      both physicians and patients, even though most women prefer psychotherapy over medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the very strong evidence base for IPT, relatively few clinicians are trained to&#xD;
      deliver IPT. Rather than travelling to tertiary care centres, the delivery of group&#xD;
      psychotherapy virtually via telemedicine or Zoom allows women anywhere in the province to&#xD;
      access this highly effective first-line treatment, thereby increasing access for women with&#xD;
      perinatal depression and improving outcomes for mothers, babies, and families in Ontario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective: To compare the effectiveness of virtual group IPT to usual care in women&#xD;
      with postpartum depression symptoms for reducing depression symptoms and anxiety, improving&#xD;
      mother-infant attachment, and increasing social support, functioning, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: RCT Population: postpartum women, aged 18 or older, with a baby under a year&#xD;
      old Intervention: 12 weeks (15 sessions - 12 acute, 3 maintenance sessions) of group IPT&#xD;
      delivered virtually via Zoom Comparison: 12 weeks of usual care followed by group IPT&#xD;
      Outcomes: Pre-treatment versus post-treatment change in depression symptoms, anxiety,&#xD;
      acceptability, mother-infant bonding, social support &amp; functioning, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women in the study will be able to access care as usual from their physicians and other&#xD;
      therapists throughout the study.&#xD;
