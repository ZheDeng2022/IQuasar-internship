  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a phase 2, open-label study of tofactinib in treatment of patients with&#xD;
      chronic pouchitis. Subjects with chronic active pouchitis will be screened and recruited if&#xD;
      they meet eligibility criteria. Eligible subjects will undergo baseline clinical evaluation,&#xD;
      laboratory testing and a pouch endoscopy. They will then receive oral tofacitinib 10 mg twice&#xD;
      daily for 8 weeks. Clinical and laboratory data will be collected at week 4 and week 8, and&#xD;
      all subjects will undergo a end of treatment pouch endoscopy at 8 weeks. Clinical, laboratory&#xD;
      and endoscopic data at 8 weeks will be compared to the baseline data to evaluate study&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
