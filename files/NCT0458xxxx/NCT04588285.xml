  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a confirmatory investigational medicinal product (IMP) study to investigate the&#xD;
      effects on cognition, functional decline and on neuropsychiatric symptoms of the&#xD;
      Glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enhancing chaperone ambroxol in participants diagnosed with&#xD;
      prodromal and early dementia with Lewybodies (DLB).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited through established network of Norwegian Memory Clinics.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised to ambroxol with proven effect on the lysosomal and&#xD;
      glucocerebrosidase pathology in DLB or placebo. The randomization will be stratified based on&#xD;
      APOE e4 and on the concentration of A-beta in CSF. The frequency of GBA genotypes in the&#xD;
      active treatment and placebo groups will be calculated at study end. The blinded phase will&#xD;
      last for 18 months and an open extension with ambroxol will be offered to all participants&#xD;
      for one additional year. The primary outcomes will be cognition, global function, disease&#xD;
      stage, progression, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Secondary outcomes will be on sleep&#xD;
      disturbances, falls, fluctuations and parkinsonism, and exploratory outcomes will be impact&#xD;
      on the potential biomarkers for drug effects defined as qEEG, DaTSCAN, MRI and Î±-synuclein in&#xD;
      CSF. One hundred seventy-two participants will be recruited in total. Each participant will&#xD;
      orally self-administer or administer by a caregiver ambroxol or placebo at 5&#xD;
      intra-participant dose escalations at 60 mg TID (day 1-7), 120 mg TID (day 8- 14), 315 BID&#xD;
      (day 15-21), 315 mg TID (day 22-28) and 420 mg TID (day 29-550)).Participants will be&#xD;
      subjected to clinical and laboratory assessments to assess the safety, tolerability effects&#xD;
      of ambroxol on blood biomarkers and MRI, DaTSCAN, ECG, EEG and lumbar puncture. Each&#xD;
      participant will undergo 8 hospital visits and 16 telephone visits for the blinded phase of&#xD;
      the study during the first 18 months. Hospital visits will additionally include 1 or 2&#xD;
      screening appointments within 60 days of Day 1 hospital visit (at which participants will&#xD;
      receive the first dose of ambroxol), followed by visits at week 4, week 8, week 24, week 36,&#xD;
      week 52, month 15 and month 18. Participants will receive a telephone call 3 days after&#xD;
      lumbar puncture to record any complaints. Participants will receive 16 telephone calls to&#xD;
      record any drug related adverse events in between hospital visits, between 1-3 days before&#xD;
      and after each dose escalation (day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29, week 12,16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 48&#xD;
      and month 13, 14, 16 and 17). All participants will be offered treatment with the IMP for 12&#xD;
      additional months from month 18 - month 30.&#xD;
