      24-Week Prospective, Double-Blinded, Randomized, Cross-over design in Multicenter Study of 50&#xD;
      unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) and 100 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A&#xD;
      (Neuronox) injection for Cervical Dystonia in patient diagnosed with cervical dystonia&#xD;
      according to clinical diagnosis. It was designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, quality of life and the comparesion the improvement after treatment by of 50&#xD;
      unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) and 100 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A&#xD;
      (Neuronox) injection.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Three documented studies showed the clinical use of botulinum toxin for migraine&#xD;
      prophylaxis.(26) Neubotulinum Toxin Type A, (Neu-BoNT/A), (Neuronox® ) (Medytox Inc,&#xD;
      Ochang-eup, Cheongwon-gu, Cheongju-si, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea), also known as&#xD;
      Meditoxin in Korea, is a newly manufactured BoNT-A (Neu-BoNT/A) that was developed to provide&#xD;
      features close to onabotulinum toxin A (5). Neuronox was tested in a murine model, and its&#xD;
      effect on muscle force generation was equivalent to Botox® (ona-BoNT/A) (6). A previous&#xD;
      multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that Neuronox and Botox® have equivalent&#xD;
      efficacy and safety for the treatment of spastic equinus in children with cerebral palsy (6).&#xD;
      However, 50 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin Type A (Neuronox) and 100 unit of Neubotulinum Toxin&#xD;
      Type A (Neuronox) has not yet been investigated in cervical dystonia. This study is the&#xD;
      extension of the NCT03805152&#xD;
