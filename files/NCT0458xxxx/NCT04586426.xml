      The purpose of this study is to identify the recommended Phase 2 regimen(s) (RP2R[s]) and&#xD;
      schedule for the study treatment (Part 1) and to characterize the safety of the RP2R(s) for&#xD;
      the study treatment (Part 2). The RP2R(s) will describe the combination doses and schedules&#xD;
      of (tal+tec+dara) the treatment combinations to be pursued in Phase 2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple myeloma is a malignant plasma cell disorder characterized by production of&#xD;
      monoclonal proteins (M proteins), which are comprised of pathologic immunoglobulins (Ig) or&#xD;
      fragments of such, which have subsequently lost their normal function. Talquetamab is a&#xD;
      humanized IgG4PAA bispecific antibody designed to target G protein-coupled receptor family C&#xD;
      group 5-member D (GPRC5D) and the CD3 molecule found on T lymphocytes (T cell). Teclistamab&#xD;
      is a humanized IgG4PAA bispecific antibody designed to target B cell maturation antigen&#xD;
      (BCMA) and the CD3 molecule found on T cells. Daratumumab is a human IgG1Ä¸ monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that binds with high affinity to a unique epitope on cluster of differentiation 38&#xD;
      (CD38) in a variety of hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma. Rationale for&#xD;
      combining talquetamab and teclistamab is that, these agents promote the activation of T cells&#xD;
      and induce myeloma cell lysis mediated by secreted perforin and various granzymes stored in&#xD;
      the secretory vesicles of cytotoxic T cells and daratumumab induces lysis of CD38-expressing&#xD;
      tumor cells by a number of mechanisms, including complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC),&#xD;
      antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and antibody-dependent cellular&#xD;
      phagocytosis (ADCP), through activation of complement proteins, natural killer (NK) cells,&#xD;
      and macrophages, respectively. This study consists 3 periods: screening phase (up to 28&#xD;
      days), treatment phase (start of study drug administration and continues until the completion&#xD;
      of the end of treatment [EOT] visit); and a post-treatment follow-up phase (after end of&#xD;
      treatment and up to 16 weeks after last dose of study drug(s) for each participant). End of&#xD;
      study is defined as last study assessment for last participant in study. Total duration of&#xD;
      study is up to 1 year and 6 months. Efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), immunogenicity,&#xD;
      and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points during this study. Participants&#xD;
      safety and study conduct will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
