  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrave (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) extended-release tablet is an approved drug and&#xD;
      indicated to be used with a low calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic&#xD;
      weight management in obese adults (BMI 30 Kg/m2 or greater) or overweight adults (BMI 27&#xD;
      Kg/m2 or greater) with at least one weight related condition such as hypertension or&#xD;
      diabetes. Presently we do not have any evidence for the use of Contrave for weight&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that in participants who have ≥ 5% weight loss&#xD;
      following the completion of a behaviour modification program with meal replacements, Contrave&#xD;
      combined with usual care (dietary and behaviour counselling) will significantly improve&#xD;
      maintenance of weight loss and promote further weight loss, compared to placebo with usual&#xD;
      care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and represents a worldwide&#xD;
      epidemic that is increasing in prevalence and remains a significant problem in Canada and a&#xD;
      burden on our healthcare system. Maintaining long-term weight loss is the &quot;Achilles' heel&quot; of&#xD;
      obesity therapy. Since obesity is considered a chronic disease, we need better interventions&#xD;
      than continued calorie restriction and increased physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sustained weight loss during the first year is a predictive factor for successful weight loss&#xD;
      after 4 years. Clinical trials employing an intensive lifestyle intervention demonstrate that&#xD;
      a 5-10% weight loss translates into important reductions in metabolic and cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      factors. This benefit however, is quite often mitigated by weight regain which could occur in&#xD;
      approximately 50% of patients after 1 year. Further behaviour modification/lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention and or pharmacotherapy are the main pillars for treating weight regain or&#xD;
      achieving weight maintenance. This study will refine our knowledge and understanding about&#xD;
      the most appropriate treatment for weight maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrave (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) extended-release tablet is an approved drug and&#xD;
      indicated to be used with a low calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic&#xD;
      weight management in obese adults (BMI 30 Kg/m2 or greater) or overweight adults (BMI 27&#xD;
      Kg/m2 or greater) with at least one weight related condition such as hypertension or&#xD;
      diabetes. Presently we do not have any evidence for the use of Contrave for weight&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 1 year, phase 4, prospective, pragmatic, randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled and crossover, observational study that will be conducted in two 6 month phases,&#xD;
      across multiple Bariatric Centres of Excellence (BCoE) in Ontario. The first 6 months is the&#xD;
      randomized, double blind, placebo controlled phase and participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to receive Contrave with usual care (dietary and behaviour counselling) or placebo with usual&#xD;
      care. At 6 months and the end of the blinded phase, all participants will be administered&#xD;
      Contrave for the remaining 6 month, open-label phase of the study. In other words,&#xD;
      participants randomly allocated to receive Contrave will continue on Contrave for the final 6&#xD;
      months, and participants randomly assigned to placebo will crossover to treatment with&#xD;
      Contrave for the final 6 months. All subjects will also continue to receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes several follow up visits to assess safety and treatment effects, some in&#xD;
      person and others by telephone or video conferencing. Body weight, blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate, waist circumference, lab tests, and subject completed questionnaires will be collected&#xD;
      as part of usual care or for the study. Changes in medications and any possible side effects&#xD;
      will also be monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify, men and women must successfully complete the BCoE behaviour modification program&#xD;
      and demonstrate ≥ 5% weight loss. All participants will be followed for 1 year with multiple&#xD;
      visits to assess safety and treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to demonstrate that in participants who have ≥ 5% weight loss following the&#xD;
      completion of a behaviour modification program with meal replacements, Contrave combined with&#xD;
      usual care will significantly improve maintenance of weight loss and promote further weight&#xD;
      loss, compared to placebo with usual care.&#xD;

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension, severe hepatic impairment, end-stage renal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months prior to consent&#xD;

          -  Renal impairment defined as eGFR &lt; 60&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Seizure disorder or a history of seizures or following conditions that may predispose&#xD;
             subjects to risk of seizure: history of head trauma, arteriovenous malformation,&#xD;
             central nervous system tumor or infection, or a metabolic disorder that in opinion of&#xD;

          -  Use of other bupropion-containing products (including, but not limited to, Wellbutrin,&#xD;
             Wellbutrin SR, Wellbutrin XL, and Zyban), because the incidence of seizure is dose&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Excessive use of alcohol or sedatives, addiction to cocaine or stimulants (street&#xD;
             drugs), or withdrawal from sedatives&#xD;

             Contrave.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant administration of the antipsychotic thioridazine, since bupropion may&#xD;
             inhibit thioridazine metabolism, thus causing an increase in thioridazine levels and a&#xD;
             potential increased risk of thioridazine-related serious ventricular arrythmias and&#xD;
             sudden death&#xD;
