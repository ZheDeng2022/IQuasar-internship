  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays, most composite resins require the use of an adhesive material prior to application.&#xD;
      For this purpose, etch &amp; rinse (ER) and self-etch (SE) systems have been used for many years.&#xD;
      While many in-vitro studies have been conducted in the literature comparing three adhesive&#xD;
      systems, the number of clinical studies is less and inadequate. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study was to investigate the effect of 3 different adhesive systems commonly used in clinics&#xD;
      on the success of class I composite restorations using the criteria of the World Dental&#xD;
      Federation (FDI) and the United States Public Health Service (USPHS).&#xD;

      Nowadays, most composite resins require the use of an adhesive material prior to application.&#xD;
      For this purpose, etch &amp; rinse (ER) and self-etch (SE) systems have been used for many years.&#xD;
      Compared to SE systems, which are simplified and very easy to use, requiring less technical&#xD;
      precision, traditional ER systems are still very popular and preferred by dentists. However,&#xD;
      current researchers indicate that ER systems are more effective on enamel than dentin and&#xD;
      that this effect is better than SE systems. SE systems are approaches in which the acid&#xD;
      application and washing step are eliminated clinically and the possibility of making mistakes&#xD;
      during the application and manipulation is reduced. An important advantage of these systems&#xD;
      is that demineralization and resin infiltration occurs at the same time. Clinically, the&#xD;
      application times are shorter than traditional systems. Two-steps SE systems have been used&#xD;
      for a long time. In this system, the need for a separate acidic primer application has needed&#xD;
      clinicians reason to search for single-steps bonding agents. And, in recent years,&#xD;
      single-step SE systems also called &quot;all in one&quot;, have been developed that include all steps&#xD;
      of pickling, primer application, and adhesive agent application. However, there are studies&#xD;
      showing that these systems do not perform as well as two-step SE systems. While many in-vitro&#xD;
      studies have been conducted in the literature comparing three adhesive systems, the number of&#xD;
      clinical studies is less and inadequate. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate&#xD;
      the effect of 3 different adhesive systems commonly used in clinics on the success of class I&#xD;
      composite restorations using the criteria of the World Dental Federation (FDI) and the United&#xD;
      States Public Health Service (USPHS).&#xD;
