  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first time in human (FTIH) study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single and repeat doses of GSK3923868 inhalation powder in&#xD;
      both healthy participants and asthmatics. This is a 3-part, randomized, double blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled study of GSK3923868, administered as an inhalation powder blend (GSK3923868&#xD;
      capsules for inhalation) via Mono-dose inhaler in healthy participants (Parts A and B) and in&#xD;
      participants with asthma (Part C). The duration of study participation for each part A, B and&#xD;
      C will be 11, 9 and 8 weeks, respectively.&#xD;
