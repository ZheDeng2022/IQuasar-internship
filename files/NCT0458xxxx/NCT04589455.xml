  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Cannabidiol (CBD) is a non-hallucinogenic plant compound of Cannabis sativa L. and&#xD;
      has gained attention for its potential health purposes, favorable safety profile and low&#xD;
      abuse potential. Mainly sold as food supplements, CBD-containing preparations of different&#xD;
      composition, concentration and quality are widely available in the Netherlands via druggist&#xD;
      stores or via Internet. However, CBD- containing preparations do not yet have a novel food&#xD;
      status and most EU countries are currently applying a tolerance policy for CBD present in- or&#xD;
      derived from hemp products low in THC. Likewise, there are no approved health claims for CBD,&#xD;
      which leads to a situation that products sold by official drugstores do not contain any&#xD;
      indication for use. Last but not least, products are not subject to any official quality&#xD;
      control which creates a situation that consumers are unaware of the CBD content and potential&#xD;
      contamination of the product they purchase. Getting novel food status would an important step&#xD;
      in better regulation. Such a procedure requires a well-documented safety assessment. As part&#xD;
      of this assessment the pharmacokinetics of CBD need to be assessed. The aim of the present&#xD;
      study is therefore to investigate the pharmacokinetics of CBD after single oral&#xD;
      administration of a full-spectrum hemp extract. As fatty food is reported to increase CBD&#xD;
      oral bioavailability, we will also study the effect of a high-fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the pharmacokinetics of CBD following oral administration of a novel&#xD;
      oil-based hemp extract containing 70 mg CBD and to study the effects of a high-fat meal on&#xD;
      the oral bioavailability of CBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single dose randomized crossover intervention study Study population: healthy&#xD;
      human volunteers, men and women from 18 to 60 years old with a BMI from 18 to 25 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): In a random order, research subjects receive a single dose of&#xD;
      hemp extract containing 70 mg CBD in soft gel capsules, both in a fasting state and with a&#xD;
      high-fat meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The plasma-time curve of CBD (quantitively) and 2 of its&#xD;
      metabolites (semi-quantitatively) after intake of the Becanex natural hemp extract. These&#xD;
      data will be evaluated studied applying descriptive pharmacokinetic analysis (maximum peak&#xD;
      height (Cmax), time-to-peak (Tmax), Half-life (T1/2) and area-under-the-curve (AUC)).&#xD;
      Relative bioavailability in the fed versus fasted state will be determined by dividing&#xD;
      individual AUC values.&#xD;
