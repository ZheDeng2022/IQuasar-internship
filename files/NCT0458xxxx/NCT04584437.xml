  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The human immune system is enhanced by exposure to infrared radiation with the wavelength of&#xD;
      5 microns to 20 microns. Humans, at normal body temperature, radiate most strongly in the&#xD;
      infrared at a wavelength of about 10 microns. Infrared energy sustains life and can be used&#xD;
      to treat and prevent diseases, including Covid-19 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High temperature within the fever range obtained from infrared radiation causes the killer&#xD;
      T-Cells to profilate. The Killer T-Cells improves ones immune system. The high temperature&#xD;
      kills the Corona virus. In addition, multi-vitamins and minerals including high doses of&#xD;
      Vitamin C, increase one's immune system. Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant, produces hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide and removes free radicals from the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-clinical trials conducted in Houston, Texas, using Vitality Therapy or the Bible Cure&#xD;
      were successful in curing Covid-19 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore possible that Vitality Therapy or the Bible Cure can be used for the&#xD;
      successful prevention and treatment of coronavirus infections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Donyina has successfully conducted 21 clinical trials and has discovered a three-pronged&#xD;
      approach to prevention, treatment, and curing or management of all diseases. The medical&#xD;
      protocols are based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vital EnergyTM - Far Infrared with the wavelength of 5 to 20 microns,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vital WaterTM - hydrogen-rich, micro-clustered, antioxidant, alkaline water is used to&#xD;
           modify and enhance the pH of the human body, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Vital Minerals and Multi-VitaminsTM - proper nutrients enhance the healing process and&#xD;
           prevent diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The three-pronged approach is known as Vitality TherapyTM or the Bible Cure for all&#xD;
           curable and incurable diseases. God created a perfect body which can heal itself of any&#xD;
           diseases thrown at it, provided the right environment exists. This environment is&#xD;
           achieved by following the three-pronged approach to wellness and longevity. In addition,&#xD;
           the 37.2 trillion mitochondria in the body are rejuvenated to provide energy and reverse&#xD;
           the ageing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Epigenetics documents that all medical conditions thought by the allopathic or&#xD;
           conventional medical system to be due to genetics are now preventable and reversible by&#xD;
           the three-pronged approach of Vital EnergyTM , Vital WaterTM, and Vital Minerals &amp;&#xD;
           Multi-VitaminsTM. In addition, the DNA script can perform at optimal levels to promote&#xD;
           wellness.&#xD;
&#xD;
           What is the difference between Drug Therapy (Pharmaceuticals) and Vitality TherapyTM or&#xD;
           the Bible Cure (Drugless Therapy) approach to disease control, prevention, and&#xD;
           treatment?&#xD;
&#xD;
           The paradigm characterizing drug therapy (i.e., using pharmaceuticals) is as follows:&#xD;
           for a specific disease, drugs or radiations are used for treatment. Thus, the treatments&#xD;
           are disease specific. So, if one has cancer, one may use Chemotherapy for cancer&#xD;
           treatment. If one has another disease such as diabetes, Chemotherapy will be of no use.&#xD;
           One must use a drug that is specific for diabetes, such as insulin or an oral agent like&#xD;
           Metformin HCl (GlucophageÂ®).&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is a new drugless paradigm, which can be exemplified by strengthening the human&#xD;
           immune system. The human body is capable of healing itself from any disease thrown at it&#xD;
           provided the immune system is heightened. Our focus is to strengthen the immune system&#xD;
           by providing the body the energy and essential plant-based and sea food nutrients it&#xD;
           requires for repairs and growth in an optimum pH environment. The external energy is&#xD;
           provided by vital energyTM medical devices and the optimum pH environment is achieved by&#xD;
           drinking vital waterTM produced by medical devices. The nutrients are mainly plant and&#xD;
           seafood based enriched with multi-vitamins and minerals. Acidic foods, like beef, are&#xD;
           generally avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thus, the paradigm shift is from disease-specific treatment offered by allopathic&#xD;
           medical practitioners and Big Pharma to enhancing the human immune system for the&#xD;
           treatment of curable and incurable diseases. We strongly believe that all diseases are&#xD;
           curable because of the heightened immunity. Let us compare Drug Therapy with Drugless&#xD;
           Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           DRUG THERAPY (Odd #s) VITALITY THERAPY or the Bible Cure (Even #s)&#xD;
&#xD;
           (1). Based on artificial chemicals (2). Plants, vitamins, minerals, micro clustered&#xD;
           antioxidant and hydrogen-rich alkaline water, and infrared energy&#xD;
&#xD;
           (3). Artificial therapy (4). Natural therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
           (5). Generally, destroys human life (6).Sustains human life&#xD;
&#xD;
           (7). Destroys human immunity (8).Enhances human immunity&#xD;
&#xD;
           (9). Acidifies the human body (10). Alkalizes the human body&#xD;
&#xD;
           (11). Induces diseases (e.g., Dexamethasone Induces Diabetes) (12). Heals curable and&#xD;
           incurable diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
           (13). Causes the ageing of the body (14). Reverses ageing&#xD;
&#xD;
           (15).. Oxidizes the body (16).Anti-oxidation of the human body&#xD;
&#xD;
           (17). Toxic chemicals (18).Natural products&#xD;
&#xD;
           (19). Destroys brain and nerve cells (20). Brain and nerve cells are regenerated&#xD;
&#xD;
           (21). Destroys cartilage, causing arthritis (22).Regrows cartilage, thus cures arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
           (23). Feeds cancerous cells (24).Destroys cancerous cells&#xD;
&#xD;
           (25). Causes neurodegenerative diseases (26).Cures neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
           (27). Causes neuromuscular disorders (28).Cures neuromuscular disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
           (29). Destroys mitochondria in the body (20).37.2 trillion mitochondria are rejuvenated&#xD;
           to provide energy and reverse the ageing process&#xD;
&#xD;
           (31). Numerous side effects. The drugs and the side effects will, in general, cause&#xD;
           death (32). NO SIDE EFFETS&#xD;
&#xD;
           (33). Approximately 80% of allopathic medicine is quackery. (34)Actual curing of&#xD;
           diseases and no quackery&#xD;
&#xD;
           Let us briefly examine quackery in allopathic medicine. An othopedic surgeon performs&#xD;
           knee sugery at the cost of over $10,000 dollars. Vitality Therapy or the Bible Cure&#xD;
           treats arthritis with Shark Cartilage. The cost is less that $200. The cartilage grows&#xD;
           back. In addition, far infrared energy regrows worn out cartilage.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
           Chemotherapy is generally used to treat cancer. It is noteworthy that chemotherapy is&#xD;
           very strong toxic chemical and kills both good and cancerous cells. The survival rate is&#xD;
           less than 10% at an exorbitant cost to insurance companies and governments. Allopathic&#xD;
           practitioners and Big Pharma earn trillions of dollars annually while KILLING PATIENTS&#xD;
           because drug therapies do not cure diseses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vitality Therapy or the Bible Cure treats all stages of cancer with no side effects. The&#xD;
           body is changed from being acidic to basic. Thus the cancer cells, which cannot survive&#xD;
           in the basic environment, and are killed. The high temperature environment provded by&#xD;
           infrared energy also kills cancerous cells. Treatment cost for cancer is minimal.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Drugs do not cure diseases but just minimize the symptoms. Vitality TherapyTM or the&#xD;
           Bible Cure enhances the immune system for the healing of all diseases and also provides&#xD;
           longevity and disease-free living.&#xD;
&#xD;
           SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION - VIROLOGY &amp; IMMUNOTHERAPY&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hirayama E. et al. J. Virology 2004 (Virology)&#xD;
&#xD;
                This paper is the key to how sauna therapy works against RNA viruses, including&#xD;
                Covid-19. Heat shock protein-70 (HSP70) is increased by sauna therapy and inhibits&#xD;
                viral protein export and replication.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Thus heat kills Covid-19. Please note that there is no Covid-19 in Desert Areas or&#xD;
                Tropical Countries. Covid-19 is imported from cold climate countries to desert and&#xD;
                tropical countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. IMMUNOTHERAPY (High Temperature and Multivitamins and Minerals + Vitamin C)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The immune system is enhanced by infrared energy which increases the body temperature.&#xD;
           The normal body temperature is approximately 36.5 - 37.5 degrees C. Vital energy&#xD;
           irradiation increases the body temperature to the range of 37.5 - 39 degrees C which is&#xD;
           equivalent to fever temperature. The temperature could even be higher than 39 degrees C&#xD;
           or high fever range, depending on the temperature setting of the infrared sauna. The&#xD;
           high body temperature causes an unbearable environment for some pathogens and viruses.&#xD;
           Killer T-cells also rapidly proliferate due to the suitable environment and can also&#xD;
           help fight off the harmful viruses, pathogens and microbes that have invaded the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The body temperature in the fever range has several important functions in the healing&#xD;
           process including, but are not limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. increased mobility of leukocytes ii. enhanced leukocytes phagocytosis iii. endotoxin&#xD;
      effects decreased iv. increased proliferation of T Cells v. enhanced activity of interferon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivitamins and Minerals (+Vitamin C)&#xD;
&#xD;
      High doses of Vitamin C kills pathogens, viruses and disease-causing microbes. High doses of&#xD;
      Vitamin C increases one's immune system. Vitamin C is an anti-oxidant, produces hydrogen&#xD;
      peroxide and removes free radicals from the body. Vitamin C has several other medical&#xD;
      benefits including repairing damaged tissues and organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the cold season, one should use high doses of Vitamin C (5 gm to 10 gm, depending on&#xD;
      the body weight, daily) to prevent and treat colds and influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only side effect of high doses of Vitamin C that I am aware of is that it may cause&#xD;
      diarrhea. However, diarrhea is a good way to clean and detoxify the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some experts interpret the prevalence of Covid-19 pandemic worldwide based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Youthful demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Altitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Warmer temperatures&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Poorer communities&#xD;
&#xD;
           Condition (3) above (i.e. Temperature) was dismissed. It is my opinion that warmer&#xD;
           temperatures play critical role in the control, management and treatment of the&#xD;
           coronavirus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Asia, Europe and North America have pronounced peaks because of cold temperature. A&#xD;
           second wave of the pandemic is hence, expected in winter months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. It is believed that, Latin America and the Caribbean have peaks as a result of&#xD;
           poorer communities (over crowding).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Middle East and Africa have low cases because of warmer temperatures. This is&#xD;
           supported by the temperature effects on coronavirus (Virology) and heightened immune&#xD;
           system when the human body is subject to high temperature (immunotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
           SUMMARY OF VITALITY THERAPY OR THE BIBLE CURE FOR ALL DISEASES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The fundamental principles underlying the Bible Cure or the three-pronged approach to&#xD;
           wellness, longevity and disease-free living are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Humans are living energies and the energy level must be kept as high as possible; ii.&#xD;
           What we eat is ultimately what determines our health, energy level and the state of our&#xD;
           body and alkaline diet is essential to our wellness; iii. The human body shall be kept&#xD;
           in an alkaline condition (pH of 7.3 to 7.4) as pathogens and viruses generally cannot&#xD;
           exist in alkaline medium (Blood pH is 7.365); iv. Water is critical to good health.&#xD;
           Humans are approximately 75% water. Water purity, its alkalinity and anti-oxidative&#xD;
           properties are important to health; v. Multi-Vitamins and minerals are essential to our&#xD;
           wellness; vi. We cannot eliminate stress from our lives. However, we can learn how to&#xD;
           manage it; and, vii. Exercise must be part of our daily routines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It must be noted that these toxic pharmaceuticals do not CURE diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Given the right environment, the body can cure itself of whatever disease thrown at it,&#xD;
           hence disease-free living and longevity are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The effects of ageing are reversed, and the oxidation of the human cells are&#xD;
                prevented, thus one becomes young again;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The therapy provides the much-needed energy to the nervous system and the whole&#xD;
                body;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improves the autonomic functions of the nervous system;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improves and restores the functions of the endocrine system;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Restores the body's communication system;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Strengthens the immune system;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improves of blood circulation;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Increases the level of oxygen in the cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Promotes the regeneration of cells and fast healing;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Activates the water molecules in the body;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Brain and nerve cells are regenerated;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain management - analgesic effect of vital energy;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Destroys cancerous (e.g. breast cancer) and benign (e.g. uterine fibrous) tumors;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Autoimmune diseases like diabetes and HIV/Aids have responded well to Vitality&#xD;
                Therapyâ¢ or the Bible Cure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Neurodegenerative diseases respond positively to the Vitality Therapyâ¢ (Alzheimer's&#xD;
                disease and Multiple Sclerosis);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  There are beneficial effects on neuromuscular disorders (i.e. muscular&#xD;
                dystrophies),&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vitality Therapyâ¢ or the Bible Cure has no side effects as vital energy sustains&#xD;
                life and is the same energy obtained from food during respiration, and;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The 37.2 trillion mitochondria in the body are rejuvenated to provide energy and&#xD;
                reverse the ageing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           CONCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
           We strongly believe that Vitality Therapy or the Bible Cure can prevent and cure&#xD;
           Covid-19 infections. Our pre-clinical trials in Houston, Texas, USA were very&#xD;
           successful. Patients were completely cured.&#xD;
