    <textblock>
      The aim of our study is to prevent unnecessary intensive care unit hospitalizations by&#xD;
      developing a scoring system to detect low-risk patients after elective intracranial&#xD;
      neurosurgery operation.&#xD;

      In this study, the data of patients who are planned to undergo craniotomy by neurosurgery&#xD;
      will be collected as a file scan (medical histories, drugs used, demographic features,&#xD;
      additional diseases, ASA class, pre-operative routine parameters, operation history, GCS,&#xD;
      tumor histology, location, dimensions and intracerebral radiological data, laboratory&#xD;
      values). The pre-operative Quality of Recovery-15 (QoR-15) score will be recorded before the&#xD;
      patient is taken into operation. Intraoperative; hemodynamic data of patients; highest and&#xD;
      lowest values of heart rate, diastolic, systolic and mean arterial pressures, fluid and blood&#xD;
      products given, anesthetic and other drugs administered, duration of anesthesia, duration of&#xD;
      surgery, surgical position, blood loss, urine output and blood gas samples will be written&#xD;
      from the anesthesia document after the operation is over. For the study, the application of&#xD;
      the anesthesiologist for the patient will not be interfered. After the operation; extubation&#xD;
      time, MAS score, use of mechanical ventilation, post-operative complications (moderate to&#xD;
      severe intracerebral hemorrhage on brain CT, intracranial hypertension requiring post op&#xD;
      surgical drainage, development of status epilepticus or seizures, the need for tracheal&#xD;
      intubation and mechanical ventilation after surgery, decrease in GKS, unmanageable agitation&#xD;
      that requires restriction or sedation, need for respiratory failure and oxygen therapy,&#xD;
      serious motor deficit and exitus) will be recorded in the service where the patient is sent.&#xD;
      The post-operative QoR-15 score will be calculated 24 hours after the operation.&#xD;
      Pre-operative and post-operative calculated scores of the patient will be evaluated and&#xD;
      anesthesia recovery score will be created. With this recovery score, post-operative mortality&#xD;
      and morbidity estimates will be made. The length of hospital stay of the patient will be&#xD;
      recorded. Glasgow Result Scale (GOS) score will be determined 30 days after the patient&#xD;
      operation. In this way, 1 month morbidity and mortality of the patient will be evaluated. The&#xD;
      collected results will be statistically associated with anesthesia recovery and operation&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, in our study; post-operative risk prediction score will be created in patients&#xD;
      undergoing intracranial surgery with elective craniotomy.&#xD;
