  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the feasibility and potential outcomes of a first&#xD;
      version of a web-based intervention in occupational therapy focusing on empowering an active&#xD;
      everyday life for people with stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large amount of people with stroke face extensive changes to live an active life and&#xD;
      restrictions in engaging in various activities are common. However, the rehabilitation seldom&#xD;
      focusses on the process of change people with stroke need to go through to adapt to their&#xD;
      changed capacity and reach an active life on new terms. This implies that rehabilitation&#xD;
      needs to be developed to provide activity-based self-management strategies that can&#xD;
      facilitate an active life. Also, there is a need to improve the access to rehabilitation by&#xD;
      making use of digital e- health solutions. Based on these needs, the web-based occupational&#xD;
      therapy intervention &quot;Strategies Empowering activities in Everyday life&quot; (SEE 1.0) has been&#xD;
      developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feasibility trial has a pre-test post-test design without a control group. The trial is&#xD;
      embedded in a mix- method approach combining assessment tools, feasibility registration&#xD;
      forms, intervention logbooks, qualitative interviews and focus groups. The feasibility of the&#xD;
      web-based intervention SEE as well as of the study design, will be evaluated in terms of&#xD;
      acceptability, adherence, values and appropriateness from the perspectives of patients with&#xD;
      stroke and the staff. Also, the potential outcome of SEE will be evaluated quantitatively and&#xD;
      qualitatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will support the continued development of SEE and provide for larger-scale&#xD;
      research studies. The intervention, that combines a focus on empowering an active everyday&#xD;
      life with a web-based format including online meetings, is innovative and is not part of&#xD;
      clinical practice today. Thereby, the results can be valuable for future research and&#xD;
      clinical practice in general. The study protocol and the results will be published in&#xD;
      peer-reviewed scientific journals and presented at conferences.&#xD;

    <measure>The profiles of occupational engagement (POES)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four- and twelve-months post-base line.</time_frame>
    <description>Change in activity pattern/profile.The POES is based on an interview of an 24 h completed diary of time use. The nine items are scored on an ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 4. A higher score indicates a higher level of engagement in activities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four- and twelve-months post-base line</time_frame>
    <description>Change in occupational balance, reflecting a person's subjective perception of having the right amount of activities and the right variation between activities. The OBQ consist of 11 items that are rated on a four-point ordinal scale, scored 0 to 3. The ratings of the OBQ are summed to a total score, ranging between 0 and 33. A higher score implies more satisfaction with the amount and variation of occupations, i.e., a higher level of occupational balance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Occupational values with pre-defined items (Oval-pd).</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four- and twelve-months post-base line</time_frame>
    <description>Change in occupational values, reflecting a person's subjective perception of concrete, symbolic or self-rewarding values in activities. The OVal-pd consists of 18 items rated on a four-point ordinal scale with response options scored 1 to 4. The rating of the OVal-pd can be summed into a general occupational value, ranging between 18-72. .A higher score indicates that the respondent is frequently engaged in valued occupation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life satisfaction questionnaire (Lisat-11)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four- and twelve-months post-base line</time_frame>
    <description>Change in life satisfaction. The Life satisfaction questionnaire consist of 11 items rated on a six-point ordinal scale ranging from 1 to 6. A higher score reflects a higher level of satisfaction.</description>

    <measure>The general self- efficacy scale (S-GSE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to four- and twelve-months post-base line</time_frame>
    <description>Change in general self- efficacy. The S-GSE consist of 10 items that are rated on a four-point ordinal scale, ranging from 1 to 4. The summarized score range between 10-40. A higher score reflects greater sense of general self-efficacy.</description>

    <description>The web-based intervention starts with eight educational modules focusing on engagement in activities and strategies to support an active life. The modules, that is delivered on a secure national health platform, include short education videos followed by self-reflections and digital assignments supporting the change process. The occupational therapist provides feedback after each assignment and, also, meet the patients for face- to- face online guiding sessions at three times during these first two- three weeks of the intervention. Thereafter, an individually tailored activity plan with goals and activity-based strategies are established. During the change process, the patients receive continued support from the occupational therapist until the goals are achieved.</description>

    <description>The patients are provided a person-centered activity-based intervention on the web aiming at facilitating the level of engagement in a variety of activities, at different places in society, together with other people to support an active life. In the long-term, the change to an active life will be reflected in a healthy and balanced pattern of activities.&#xD;
The program provide the patients with tools to &quot;see&quot; their activities in everyday life in a new light and, also, tools to identify activity-based strategies that can empower them to take an active role to prevent and overcome challenging situations in everyday life.</description>
