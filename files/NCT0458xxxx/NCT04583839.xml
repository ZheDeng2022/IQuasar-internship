  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot assessment of Sustaining Women's Engagement and Enabling Transitions&#xD;
      after GDM (SWEET), a GDM-focused intervention that will apply barrier-reduction patient&#xD;
      navigation strategies to improve health after a pregnancy with gestational diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to determine, via a randomized controlled trial of 40 women who have&#xD;
      had GDM, whether those who receive the navigation intervention have improved diabetes-related&#xD;
      health at 1 year after birth compared to those who receive usual care. The SWEET intervention&#xD;
      will provide GDM-specific, individualized navigation services that leverage existing clinical&#xD;
      infrastructure, including logistical support, psychosocial support, and health education,&#xD;
      through 1-year postpartum. Participants will undergo surveys, interviews, and medical record&#xD;
      review at multiple time points. The investigators will also conduct qualitative interviews&#xD;
      with clinical providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) poses a substantial long-term health burden to women due&#xD;
      to the 7-fold increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular disorders. Yet, there are many gaps in the transition period after GDM, which&#xD;
      is a particularly critical time due to enhanced motivation and access. Nevertheless, a&#xD;
      minority of women receive postpartum screening for dysglycemia or have successful transition&#xD;
      to primary care. Although T2DM prevention interventions can be successful, they cannot be&#xD;
      deployed without retention and engagement in care. Addressing the unique barriers experienced&#xD;
      by postpartum women requires innovative models of health care delivery to promote prevention&#xD;
      of T2DM after GDM. One potential intervention with demonstrated successes in other arenas is&#xD;
      patient navigation, a barrier-focused, longitudinal, patient-centered intervention that&#xD;
      offers support for a defined set of health services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is to perform a pilot assessment of Sustaining Women's Engagement and Enabling&#xD;
      Transitions after GDM (SWEET), a GDM-focused intervention that will apply barrier-reduction&#xD;
      patient navigation strategies to improve health after a pregnancy with GDM. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to determine, via a randomized controlled trial of 40 women who have had GDM, whether&#xD;
      those who receive the SWEET navigation intervention have improved diabetes-related health at&#xD;
      1 year after birth compared to those who receive usual care. In order to promote&#xD;
      self-efficacy, enhance access, and sustain long-term engagement, the SWEET intervention will&#xD;
      provide GDM-specific, individualized navigation services that leverage existing clinical&#xD;
      infrastructure, including logistical support, psychosocial support, and health education,&#xD;
      through 1-year postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 will evaluate whether clinical (weight, glycemic control, abdominal circumference, and&#xD;
      blood pressure), health services (postpartum and primary care visit attendance), and&#xD;
      patient-reported (diabetes self-efficacy, activation, and T2DM risk perception) outcomes&#xD;
      differ in women exposed to SWEET versus usual care. Aim 2 will evaluate feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability. This proposal will generate key data for the conduct of a full-scale trial of&#xD;
      a GDM-specific postpartum patient navigation program that will address critical questions&#xD;
      about long-term maternal health and T2DM prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWEET bridges the chasm between care during pregnancy - focused on improving the health of&#xD;
      the pregnant woman and her offspring - and long-term women's health care - focused on chronic&#xD;
      disease management and preventive health. The long-term goals are to understand how to&#xD;
      optimize long-term health after GDM in order to prevent or ameliorate the effects of T2DM&#xD;
      beyond the perinatal period.&#xD;

    <description>Women who are randomized into SWEET will be assigned to a patient navigator. The navigator will meet women during hospitalization, at postpartum appointments, during primary care appointments, and as needed. At these face-to-face meetings, the navigator will perform education about the postpartum OGTT, post-GDM management plan, diabetes mellitus risks, lifestyle modification, and primary care transition. The navigator will facilitate the development of an individualized GDM Care Plan in conjunction with the patient and the medical team. The navigator will assess individual barriers to T2DM screening and prevention. At appointments, the navigator will also ensure a woman understands her diabetes-related care plan and will perform health education and barrier-reducing tasks as needed.</description>
