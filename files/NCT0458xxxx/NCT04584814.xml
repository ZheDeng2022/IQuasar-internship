  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study of 20 newborns, 10 term and 10 preterm, who are going to be placed to 3 phases :&#xD;
      2 hour of basal observation of respiratory rate, heart rate, saturation, NIPS and aEEG&#xD;
      recording, then 2 hours with a 20cycles/minute with &quot;scare ventilator&quot;, and followed for&#xD;
      another 2 hours of 40 cycles/minute with &quot;scare ventilator&quot;&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With this pilot study the investigator's want to see if the &quot;scare respirator&quot; can modify the&#xD;
      vital signs of the newborn (NB) and if there is a relationship according to the frequency per&#xD;
      minute given by the scare respirator and the patient's respiratory rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;scare respirator&quot; has been used many times to prevent central apnea in the newborn. This&#xD;
      involves using a mechanical ventilator, but instead of connecting it to the patient's trachea&#xD;
      to inflate his lungs, the air flow is connected to a surgical glove that inflates and&#xD;
      deflates, with the optimal respiratory rate that the patient should have. This will be placed&#xD;
      on the back to stimulate it tactically giving the necessary impulse of inspiration so that&#xD;
      the patient alone can acquire the movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the development of this study is that it has been seen that the &quot;scare&#xD;
      respirator&quot; could avoid central apneas, but no studies have been done on the change in&#xD;
      respiratory rate that occurs with the device or if it bothers the NB or alters its&#xD;
      wakefulness sleep pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is intended to evaluate 20 NBs, 10 term children and 10 premature infants, during 3&#xD;
      observation periods. Heart rate (HR), Respiratory rate (RR) and saturation, pain scale and&#xD;
      aEEG sleep wake pattern will be evaluated; first a rest period between feeds as baseline,&#xD;
      then with a scare respirator at 20 cycles per minute and finally at 40 cycles per minute. The&#xD;
      differences of qualitative and quantitative variables will be assessed with ad-hoc&#xD;
      statistical tests.&#xD;
