  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body image is one of the leading concerns for young people. These concerns may can have&#xD;
      serious consequences, including anxiety, depression, risk taking behaviours, eating disorders&#xD;
      and suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extensive body of research highlights the negative effects associated with viewing&#xD;
      idealistic media among adolescents. More recently, research has looked at harnessing media&#xD;
      and technology to develop and disseminate material that counteracts these harmful effects.&#xD;
      Using 'edutainment' (entertainment with educational content) to develop and disseminate&#xD;
      interventions is a novel avenue of research. Micro-interventions (brief, low intensity,&#xD;
      self-administered interventions), offer an alternative to traditional, intense interventions&#xD;
      that may be unsuitable for milder concerns. Body image micro-interventions have proven&#xD;
      effective at providing immediate and short-term improvements in body image among women. To&#xD;
      date, body image micro-interventions have been focused on adult samples, with little research&#xD;
      exploring how this intervention model may cater to adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of a brief body image video micro-intervention to improve body image and acceptance&#xD;
      of appearance diversity among girls, in addition to appearance-related internalised racism&#xD;
      among the Black subgroup of girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The body image video micro-intervention is a 3-minute episode from Girls Room; a mini-series&#xD;
      developed to address risk factors for body image. The series was developed through a&#xD;
      collaboration between Lena Waithe, Dove (Unilever) and the Centre for Appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparison control group will watch a 3-minute episode from an equivalent popular series&#xD;
      which does not contain any appearance-related content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the outcomes of interest, post-video acceptability checks will also be&#xD;
      assessed to determine viewers' enjoyment, engagement, and identification with the video, as&#xD;
      well as their intent to re-engage and share.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To undertake this project, 1848 adolescent girls will be recruited via an external research&#xD;
      agency. Female-identifying North American citizens, aged 12-18 years old will be recruited,&#xD;
      stratified to include 50% Black and 50% non-Black adolescents. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomised to watch either the Girls Room episode, or control episode, at either 25%, 50% or&#xD;
      100% length of exposure. Before watching the video, they will complete baseline measures of&#xD;
      demographics, state body satisfaction, acceptance of diversity of appearance, and&#xD;
      appearance-related internalised racism (Black girls only). They will then be exposed to the&#xD;
      video, before completing the measures again (post-exposure), along with acceptability checks.&#xD;
      Participants will then be provided with a debrief of study aims and a list of support&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body image is one of the leading concerns for young people. This is particularly concerning,&#xD;
      given that body dissatisfaction is a key risk factor for serious mental and physical health&#xD;
      issues, including anxiety, depression, risk taking behaviours, eating disorders and suicidal&#xD;
      ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An extensive body of research highlights the negative effects associated with viewing&#xD;
      idealistic media among adolescents. More recently, research has looked at harnessing media&#xD;
      and technology to develop and disseminate material that disrupts and counteracts these&#xD;
      harmful effects. 'Edutainment', entertainment with educational content, is an effective&#xD;
      method for delivering and modelling health promotion material in mainstream media. Further,&#xD;
      it offers an alternative to traditional, intense interventions that are, at times,&#xD;
      unnecessary or unsuitable for milder concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body image micro-interventions have proven effective at providing immediate and short-term&#xD;
      improvements in body image among adult women, and research is beginning to explore their&#xD;
      impact among young people. A recent study found that evidence-informed body image animations&#xD;
      produced immediate and short-term improvements in children's body satisfaction, media&#xD;
      literacy, and self-efficacy in addressing appearance teasing. However, these effects were&#xD;
      less potent for older children (i.e., adolescents); which may be attributable to the use of&#xD;
      cartoons, as opposed to real-life characters. The effects of viewing real-world depictions of&#xD;
      positive body image attitudes and behaviours has yet to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In collaboration with Dove (Unilever) and Lena Waithe (an Emmy-Award winning American&#xD;
      screenwriter, producer and actress), body image experts from the Centre for Appearance&#xD;
      Research (CAR) developed a series of brief videos that depict real-life characters addressing&#xD;
      key risk factors for body image concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the acceptability and impact of viewing one 5-minute episode of&#xD;
      Girls Room (Episode 1: One of One') on the body image of 13-18-year-old girls from the US.&#xD;
      The research questions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does watching Girls Room result in improved body image and acceptance of diversity of&#xD;
           appearance among adolescent girls compared with watching an equivalent series that is&#xD;
           popular among adolescent girls and typical of content on Instagram?&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Are these effects moderated by the ethnicity of the viewer (Black versus all other&#xD;
           ethnicities)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What degree of exposure to Girls Room (25% v 50% v 100% of content) elicits changes in&#xD;
           body image and acceptance of diversity of appearance in comparison with an equivalent&#xD;
           series that is popular adolescent girls and typical of content on Instagram?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does watching Girls Room result in reduced appearance-related internalized racism among&#xD;
           Black adolescent girls compared with watching an equivalent series that is popular and&#xD;
           typical of content on Instagram?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study adopts an experimental pre-post 2 x 2 x 3 design, which includes following three&#xD;
      independent variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ethnicity of viewer (2 Levels) i. Black ii. Non-Black (this will include all other&#xD;
           ethnicities expect Black)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Video condition (2 levels) i. Body image video (Girls Room) ii. Equivalent series that&#xD;
           is popular among adolescent girls and typical of content on Instagram (Chicken Girls)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exposure time (3 levels) i. 25% ii. 50% iii. 100%&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three outcome measures (dependent variables) of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. State Body Image (primary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. State Acceptance of Diversity of Appearance (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. State Appearance-related Internalized Racism- to be measured among Black girls only&#xD;
           (secondary outcome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. State Mood&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also one moderator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Ethnicity of the viewer (Black vs. Non-Black)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current content is aimed at improving body image risk factors and increasing knowledge&#xD;
      and protective factors prevalent amongst adolescent girls. Therefore, the research will&#xD;
      utilise a representative sample of North American girls aged 12-18 years old. They will be&#xD;
      stratified to be 50% Black and 50% other ethnicities, who are current users of Instagram or&#xD;
      YouTube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the agreed upon research objectives and in alignment with project timelines, the&#xD;
      recruitment process will be out-sourced to an external professional recruitment agency. The&#xD;
      agency's brief will outline the following inclusion criteria; female North American citizens,&#xD;
      aged 12-18 years old; English speaking, not participated in academic or market research&#xD;
      elated to mental health or social media in the preceding 6 months. Participants will be&#xD;
      offered agency credit for their participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 1,848 (308 girls per cell; 174 Black; 174 other ethnicities) is necessary&#xD;
      for 90% power to dectect a small effect (Cohen's f = 0.1), and based on the assumption that&#xD;
      there will be a correlation between Time 1 (pre) and Time 2 (post) measures of 0.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls Room, a body image mini-series, was developed in collaboration with Lena Waithe, Dove&#xD;
      and CAR. Video content was informed by empirical evidence related to body image prevention&#xD;
      and intervention. The series consists of five, 3-minute videos, with each video targeting a&#xD;
      key risk factor for body image (see below). The five videos aired on Instagram TV (IGTV) in&#xD;
      March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Girls will not be briefed on the purpose of the study, the research questions, or their&#xD;
      condition prior to or during study participation. However, they will be given sufficient&#xD;
      information to provide informed consent. They will also be advised that they may be asked the&#xD;
      same questions twice throughout the study. After completing the study, participants should be&#xD;
      fully debriefed and provided with sources of support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online study will include validated, age-appropriate, self-report measures that assess&#xD;
      demographics and the immediate impact of video exposure on adolescents' body image and&#xD;
      associated risk and protective factors. Outcome assessments will be conducted at two time&#xD;
      points, including immediately before (time one) and after video exposure (time two).&#xD;
      Assessments and video exposure will occur within one session. The survey will be conducted&#xD;
      online, at home, and should take no longer than 25 minutes for participants to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and survey dissemination will be conducted by a third-party research agency. The&#xD;
      agency will contact eligible participants via their parents, with consent required by both&#xD;
      parent and child. Following consent, the child will participate in a once-off survey that&#xD;
      consists of four phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline assessments of demographics, body image, acceptance of appearance diversity,&#xD;
           internalised racism (Black participants only), mood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Randomisation into exposure condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Video exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Post-exposure assessments of body image, acceptance of appearance diversity,&#xD;
           internalised racism (Black participants only), mood and acceptability checks (Enjoyment,&#xD;
           Engagement, and Identification, Re-engagement, and Sharing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be provided with a debrief of study aims and a list of support&#xD;
      sources.&#xD;
