  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of a&#xD;
      common elements intervention delivered by community mental health workers for adults with a&#xD;
      history of adverse childhood experiences. &quot;Common elements&quot; interventions build cognitive,&#xD;
      emotional, interpersonal and behavioral skills to help address trauma-related distress and&#xD;
      build resilience. This will be accomplished using a wait-list controlled randomized control&#xD;
      trial with Apache adults ages 18-65 with recent suicide ideation and/or binge substance use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed-methods study with qualitative data informing adaptation and evaluation of a&#xD;
      common elements intervention delivered by community mental health specialists, named &quot;My&#xD;
      Pathway to Healing.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apache partners selected a wait-list randomized control trial, as it is a rigorous study&#xD;
      design for understanding whether an intervention works and was endorsed by the community, to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of the My Pathway to Healing intervention delivered by community&#xD;
      mental health specialists (CMHS). This intervention consists of an initial assessment to&#xD;
      determine treatment priorities and safety. It integrates psychoeducation and addresses safety&#xD;
      (when identified as a problem area). It can also include teaching relaxation, cognitive&#xD;
      coping, exposure-trauma memories, exposure-live, cognitive restructuring, behavioral&#xD;
      activation, and problem solving. The intervention used in the tested arm of our study will be&#xD;
      adapted to the specific context and culture of White Mountain Apache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those randomized into the My Pathway to Healing group will receive 5-15 hour-long sessions&#xD;
      with a community mental health specialist, taking place over 12 weeks. The exact number of&#xD;
      sessions will depend on presentation and symptom level using a stepped care approach where&#xD;
      participants receive only what they need, but the provider can provide additional sessions if&#xD;
      needed (i.e., increased element dosage; additional optional elements for specific issues).&#xD;
      Those randomized into the wait-list control will continue to receive the standard case&#xD;
      management via the Apache surveillance system. These wait-list control participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wait until all N=50 My Pathway to Healing participants have started the program and&#xD;
      then will be offered the program on a rolling basis based on availability of providers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, will be asked to partake in 5 study assessments. For intervention participants&#xD;
      these assessments will take place at: baseline, after their last intervention session&#xD;
      (endline) and 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-endline. For control participants, these assessments&#xD;
      will take place at: baseline, 12 weeks post-baseline (the maximum time the intervention would&#xD;
      last; will be referred to as an endline) and 4, 8 and 12 weeks post-endline. These assessment&#xD;
      visits will be conducted by the Research Program Assistants who will serve as the independent&#xD;
      evaluators. Assessments will take approximately 45-90 minutes to complete.&#xD;

    <description>Investigators will use the Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test (ASSIST) to measure alcohol and substance use. This 15-item questionnaire screens for all levels of problems or risky substance use (alcohol, illegal drugs, and prescription drugs). A risk score is provided for each substance, and scores are grouped into low, moderate, or high risk, providing a comprehensive view of substance use. This scale ranges from 0-27+. A total score of 0-3 indicates low risk/no intervention. A total score of 4-26 indicates moderate risk/brief intervention. A total score of 27+ indicates high risk/more intensive treatment.</description>

    <measure>Mental Health and Wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>Weekly from baseline to 12 weeks post baseline (during intervention sessions)</time_frame>
    <description>The Client Monitoring Form will be used to track the mental health and well-being of intervention participants on a week-to-week basis. There are 17-questions that measure both presence and severity of symptoms commonly associated with depression and anxiety. Questions are asked on a scale of 0 (None of the time) to 3 (Almost all of the time). A higher score indicates a worse outcome. Additionally, clients are asked if they are utilizing other mental health services, and screened for suicidal and homicidal ideation, with reporters mandated to record what actions were taken in reaction to recording any such ideation.</description>
