      This study conducted to determine the effects of two oral care protocols containing sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate or saline solution in the prevention of oral mucositis (OM), mucositis degree,&#xD;
      and recovery time in children with cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study conducted as a randomized controlled trial with a parallel design with two groups;&#xD;
      Study group/ Oral care protocol with saline solution Control group/ Oral care protocol with&#xD;
      sodium bicarbonate solution&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis; There is a difference in oral mucositis (OM) between groups. There is a&#xD;
      difference in the degree of OM between groups. There is a difference in the OM recovery time&#xD;
      between groups. There is a difference in demographic variables in patients with and without&#xD;
      mucositis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample was comprised of 43 children with cancer aged 1-17 years, received&#xD;
      chemotherapy for ≥3 days at inpatient clinics, and whose families agreed to their&#xD;
      participation in the study. Patients excluded who have oral ulceration or mucositis, taking&#xD;
      any antiviral or antifungal therapy for OM before enrollment in the study. This trial was a&#xD;
      triple blinded which the patients/parents, nurses, and the investigators have no idea about&#xD;
      the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, patients were allocated by the blocked randomization. After naturally&#xD;
      separating the gender variable into 2 layers, the age was divided into 5 layers as &quot;&lt;1 year,&#xD;
      1-3 years,&gt;3-6 years, 6-12 years,&gt;12 years&quot;, and the diagnosis variable was divided into 3&#xD;
      layers as &quot;ALL, AML and oncological tumors.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Socio-Demographic Data Collection Form, International Child Mucositis Rating Scale (CHIMES),&#xD;
      and Mucositis Follow-up Form used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The child who do not have mucositis and who will be hospitalized for more than 3 days for&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be distributed to the groups by stratified randomization method, the&#xD;
      information of the patients will be obtained with the sociodemographic data collection form,&#xD;
      oral care training will be given to the patient and the family, oral care protocol will be&#xD;
      applied and it will be evaluated daily with the CHIMES and Mucositis Follow-up Form, and the&#xD;
      severity of mucositis according to the World Health Organization Mucositis Assessment Index,&#xD;
      the mean score of the CHIMES, recovery time will be monitored through the Mucositis Follow-up&#xD;
      Form.&#xD;
