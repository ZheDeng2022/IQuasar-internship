  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the acceptability and feasibility of a program to&#xD;
      reduce barriers to community participation for adults aging with physical disabilities&#xD;
      adapted from an evidence-based program for adults post-stroke.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will test the working hypothesis that the adapted program, focused on resolving&#xD;
      environmental barriers and building self-management skills in the home and community, will be&#xD;
      feasible and superior to usual care for daily activity performance and participation outcomes&#xD;
      in adults aging with physical disabilities.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>In-Home Occupational Performance Evaluation (I-HOPE)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 6-month follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The In-Home Occupational Performance Evaluation will be used to measure current activity patterns of participants, identify activities that are difficult but important to them, and identify the environmental barriers that influence those activities (person-environment fit). Activity score: minimum value .5, maximum value 1, where a higher score indicates fewer problematic activities. Barrier scores: minimum value 0, maximum value 5, with higher scores indicating greater influence of barriers on activity.</description>

    <measure>Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNLI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Reintegration to Normal Living Index is a disability-related quality-of life-instrument that will be used to measure participants' satisfaction with their home and community participation and has been validated on a population of community-dwelling individuals with chronic conditions. It uses an 11-item, 10 point visual analog scale with higher scores indicating greater reintegration to normal living.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Activity Supplement 2015</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Health and Retirement Study is a longitudinal study designed to address important questions on the challenges and opportunities of aging. The activity supplement questionnaire will be used to provide descriptive information on activity participation. Modifications have been made to allow for additional qualitative responses describing barriers and limitations to activities. The HRS allows participants to indicate whether or not the complete a task, with or without help. It does not provide a numerical score.</description>

    <measure>Fall Prevention Strategy Survey (FPSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The Fall Prevention Strategy Survey is a self-report instrument addressing protective behaviors related to fall risk among adults. It is an 11-item survey, scores range from 0 to 22 with higher scores indicating use of more fall prevention strategies.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Participation frequency, importance and self-efficacy measure</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline and 6-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The participation frequency, importance and self-efficacy measure addresses four areas of participation: routines, recreation, responsibilities and relationships. Twenty-five different activities are rated by the participant on a 1-5 Likert-type scale in the areas of frequency, importance, and self-efficacy to complete the activity. Higher scores indicate greater frequency, importance and self-efficacy.</description>

    <intervention_name>Removing Environmental Barriers to Independent Living (REBIL)</intervention_name>
    <description>REBIL is a complex intervention with two essential components: (1) removing environmental barriers and home hazards in the home tailored to the participant's unique abilities and limitations and (2) strategy training with the participant to help participant to be able to identify barriers in the home and community and identify potential resources and strategies to remove the barriers. Treatment includes one assessment session and four 75-minute visits in the home with an occupational therapist over 8 weeks, followed by a 6 -month assessment session by a blinded rater.</description>

    <description>The waitlist attentional control group will receive an initial assessment session then four 75 minute interview visits from an occupational therapy graduate assistant, followed by a 6-month assessment session by a blinded rater. After the 6-month follow-up is completed this group will receive the REBIL intervention.</description>
