  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the&#xD;
      systemic pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of icenticaftor in participants with&#xD;
      varying degrees of hepatic impairment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multi-center study with parallel groups. The study employs a single-dose,&#xD;
      open-label design in subjects with mild, moderate, or severe hepatic impairment along with&#xD;
      matched healthy control subjects with normal hepatic function. Subjects with normal hepatic&#xD;
      function will be matched with subjects with hepatic impairment for gender, age (± 10 years),&#xD;
      body weight (± 15%), and smoking status (smoker or non-smoker).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to a total of 48 participants will be enrolled in this study (approximately 8 in each mild&#xD;
      [Child-Pugh A], moderate [Child-Pugh B], severe hepatic impairment [Child-Pugh C] groups),&#xD;
      and up to 24 healthy control subjects). Each participant will receive a single oral dose of&#xD;
      300 mg of icenticaftor (QBW251) on Day 1 under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of an up to 28-day screening period (Days -28 to -1), a baseline&#xD;
      evaluation (Day -1) prior to treatment on Day 1, and a follow-up period of 7 days for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK) sample collection (pre-dose, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 48,&#xD;
      72, 96, 120, 144 and 168 hours post-dose). A safety follow-up contact will be done 30 days&#xD;
      after administration of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of hepatic impairment on the&#xD;
      systemic PK, safety, and tolerability of icenticaftor in participants with varying degrees of&#xD;
      hepatic impairment.&#xD;
