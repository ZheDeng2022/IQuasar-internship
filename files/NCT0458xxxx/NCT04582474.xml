  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guideline has been implemented in&#xD;
      Burkina Faso and is used across primary health facilities to assess children under the age of&#xD;
      5 years. A part from a rapid diagnostic test (RDT) for malaria, no other point of care in&#xD;
      vitro diagnostic tests are widely used to improve disease diagnosis and inform treatment&#xD;
      decisions. Dengue fever has been reported in Burkina Faso since 1925 and the recent epidemics&#xD;
      in 2016 and 2017 have prompted the government to validate and deploy a clinical management&#xD;
      algorithm for Dengue and a case reporting process to support surveillance for a targeted&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The organisation Terre des hommes has digitalised IMCI and implemented the module through its&#xD;
      Integrated electronic Diagnosis Approach (IeDA) programme across primary health care centers&#xD;
      (PHCs) in the country with proven impact on clinical care and proven reduction in antibiotic&#xD;
      prescriptions. Many recognize the need to update the IMCI guideline with current evidence.&#xD;
      However this is challenging and may require large clinical trials. The advantage of&#xD;
      electronic clinical decision support systems is plural: they improve quality of care through&#xD;
      increased adherence and feedback information to the system; they strengthen surveillance&#xD;
      systems by connecting relevant patient related data and provide geo-tagged coordinates for&#xD;
      targeted responses; and they can become evidence-adaptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic module of the Burkina Faso Dengue clinical management guideline accompanied&#xD;
      with dengue rapid diagnostic tests has the potential to improve the diagnosis of non-malaria&#xD;
      fevers in particular during &quot;dengue seasons&quot; and improve the efficiency of surveillance for&#xD;
      this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators aim to assess the usability and the performance of the&#xD;
      dengue module for patient management in primary health care facilities.&#xD;
