  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) infects nearly two billion people and has become the leading infectious&#xD;
      cause of mortality worldwide, due in part to inadequate diagnostic and prognostic tests.&#xD;
      Older diagnostic tools, such as acid-fast staining, and newer diagnostic tests, such as&#xD;
      nucleic acid amplification, are either insensitive, expensive, or not suitable for use at the&#xD;
      clinical point-of-care. Therefore, novel diagnostic tests are needed to diagnose active TB&#xD;
      disease among adults, people living with HIV (PLHIV), and children in TB-endemic countries.&#xD;
      In this project, the investigators will conduct clinical evaluation studies of emerging TB&#xD;
      diagnostic tests among (1) hospitalized adults, (2) ambulatory adults in outpatient clinics,&#xD;
      and (3) children &lt;12 years suspected of having active TB disease. the investigators will also&#xD;
      maintain a biorepository of well-characterized clinical specimens that can be used for either&#xD;
      retrospective validation of TB diagnostic tests, establishing a reference LAM test, or to&#xD;
      share with partners developing novel TB diagnostics, including new LAM antibodies. The&#xD;
      project will be coordinated at the University of Washington, and conducted in partnership&#xD;
      with clinical research partners in South Africa, including Umkhuseli Innovation and Research&#xD;
      Management (UIRM) and the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS). The project team is&#xD;
      well-equipped to serve as a central clinical research site to evaluate new and emerging&#xD;
      point-of-care TB diagnostics, particularly novel urinary LAM assays, at the on-site TB&#xD;
      Diagnostics Research Laboratory at Edendale Hospital in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa.&#xD;

    <description>TB positive: A person with a positive Xpert MTB/RIF test or TB culture on any bodily fluid specimen that was obtained/tested within 5 days of enrollment.&#xD;
Probable TB: A person with compatible symptoms, signs, histopathological specimens and imaging for TB, but without a positive TB culture or Xpert test on any specimen; empirically initiated on TB treatment.&#xD;
TB negative: A person with a primary hospital diagnosis other than TB, who has no clinical suspicion for TB, and no diagnostic TB testing ordered by the treating team.&#xD;
TB negative (TB excluded): A person with all reference microbiological testing for TB returning negative, including negative Xpert, negative TB culture, other investigations for TB negative (e.g. histopathology, imaging) and either clinical improvement in the absence of anti-TB therapy or alternate diagnosis determined. In addition, no incident TB diagnosis made (including empiric anti-TB treatment initiation) within the 2 months following enrollment.</description>

Chest radiograph or abdominal ultrasound consistent with TB&#xD;
Close TB exposure or immunologic evidence of M. tuberculosis infection&#xD;
