  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on Italian patients with haemophilia A in prophylaxis treatment with&#xD;
      Turoctocog alfa under routine clinical conditions. The purpose of the study is to investigate&#xD;
      the therapeutic scheme in a population of patients treated with Turoctocog alfa and to&#xD;
      investigate the participation in recreational activities, the level of physical activity, and&#xD;
      quality of life. Participants will get NovoEight® (Turoctocog alfa) as prescribed to them by&#xD;
      the study doctor. The study will last for about 12 months. Participants will be requested to&#xD;
      fill in the Questionnaires investigating the participation in recreational activities, the&#xD;
      level of physical activity, and quality of life.&#xD;

    <description>Points&#xD;
The following sections of the BHERO questionnaire will be used:&#xD;
Haemophilia Activities List (HAL: measures the impact of haemophilia on self-perceived functional abilities in patients (42 questions in 7 domains). Scores from 1 (worst) to 6 (best). The final score is the sum of all the scores.)&#xD;
Recreational and sport activities&#xD;
Brief pain inventory, exploring the presence and intensity of physical pain, and its impact on performance of daily activities.&#xD;
International Physical Activities questionnaire (IPAQ) score (Score&lt;700 = Inactive Patient, Score 700 to 2519 = Sufficiently active patient, Score ≥ 2520 = Active or very active patient.</description>
