  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      36 patients will be enrolled in a pilot trial. Eligible patients (receiving CI at OSU) that&#xD;
      consent to participate into the study will be enrolled. A simulation with visualize cochlear&#xD;
      substructures will be created for each patient, and surgeon will conduct virtual surgery with&#xD;
      various cochlear implant electrode types and using different techniques for optimal&#xD;
      positioning. Based on the feedback from the simulation platform, the surgeon will find the&#xD;
      optimal CI electrode and surgical technique using the virtual simulation and a formal plan&#xD;
      will be recorded to guide the actual surgery. Patient demographic information, medical&#xD;
      history and pre op audiogram will be collected once enrolled. Post-op images will be used to&#xD;
      identify the actual electrode location (scalar location (SL), modiolar distance (MD) and and&#xD;
      angular insertion depth (AID). At 6- and 12-months post-op, word score (CNC) will be obtained&#xD;
      as primary clinical outcomes and AZBio scores will also be obtained and evaluated as a&#xD;
      secondary clinical outcome. All outcomes data to be collected for SA3 are considered as part&#xD;
      of routine clinical care for patients undergoing CI at our institution. The prospective data&#xD;
      collection plan will ensure these data will be collected timely with high quality. OSU IRB&#xD;
      approval has been obtained for this study (OSU IRB# 2020H0080: Virtual Reality simulation for&#xD;
      patient specific surgical rehearsal in cochlear implantation - OSU#2) pending additional&#xD;
      amendments as needed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Patients undergoing pre-operative CI simulation will have improved outcomes as&#xD;
      measured by SL, MD and audiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this aim is to demonstrate clinical feasibility and to collect preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy data for using the pre-operative simulation with active feedback for CI patients.&#xD;
      This will be achieved by prospectively using the CI simulation system and evaluating both&#xD;
      technical and clinical audiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.4.1 Pre-operative Simulation: Prior to surgery, a simulation with visualization of cochlear&#xD;
      microstructures will be created for each patient, and the surgeon will conduct iterative&#xD;
      virtual surgery with active feedback to determine the optimal surgical approach and cochlear&#xD;
      implant electrode position. Based on the feedback from the simulation platform, the surgeon&#xD;
      will determine the optimal CI electrode and surgical technique using the virtual simulation&#xD;
      to plan the actual surgery. Post-implant feedback will be displayed to the surgeon. Once&#xD;
      parameters (SL, MD, AID) are optimized, a surgical plan will be recorded and used during the&#xD;
      actual surgical procedure. A surgical plan will consist of the implant type, cochleostomy&#xD;
      site, and insertion techniques used for optimal placement. This will be added to the patient&#xD;
      electronic medical record to be referenced immediately prior to surgery. Additionally, the&#xD;
      simulator will save all performances with the optimized performance being made available for&#xD;
      review on the simulator at any time (3-dimensional playback).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.4.2 Clinical Outcomes: Aided speech perception testing in the CI ear will be administered&#xD;
      at 6- and 12-months post activation using monosyllabic words (CNC Word test) presented at 60&#xD;
      dB SPL (A-weighted) as well as sentences (AzBio) in quiet and at +10 signal-to-noise ratio.&#xD;
      Percent correct will be calculated for each test and will serve as the primary clinical&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.4.3 User Evaluation: Simulator evaluation (user interface, usefulness, potential usage in&#xD;
      future, and overall satisfactory) and feedback/comments from the surgeon about the simulation&#xD;
      platform will continued to be collected pre and post-operatively to provide insight into&#xD;
      continued future improvement of the simulation platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C.4.5 Reproducibility and Rigor:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Demographic information as well as post-op CI location parameters (SL,&#xD;
      MD, AID), pre/post-op CNC and AzBio scores will be summarized with descriptive statistics:&#xD;
      mean/SD, median/IQR for continuous variables and count/percentage for categorical data.&#xD;
      Changes of the CNC /AzBio scores overtime will be analyzed using linear mixed models to&#xD;
      account for the association of measures from the same patient at different time points, and&#xD;
      to deal with missing data assuming missing data will occur randomly. Exploratory analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted to (1) evaluate the association of the CI location parameters with the&#xD;
      post-op CNC scores; (2) compare the post-op CI location parameters with the CI patients&#xD;
      without pre-op simulations that are reported in the literature and/or those who have&#xD;
      undergone CI insertion in this institution (historical controls at OSU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: For this pilot study, a sample size of 30 patients is proposed to evaluate&#xD;
      selected feasibility issues, assess the adequacy of instrumentation, and collect preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy data (along with historical data) for the design of a larger prospective, randomized&#xD;
      trial. For the improvement of the clinical outcome (CNC) after CI, a sample size of 30&#xD;
      patients produces a one-sided 90% upper confidence limit of variance &lt;1.5 when the sample&#xD;
      variance of the improvement of CNC is 1.0. Up to 36 patients will be enrolled to account for&#xD;
      potential attrition due to various unexpected reasons during the period from the enrollment&#xD;
      to implant surgery, to 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
