    <textblock>
      Mental contamination-an internal experience of dirtiness evoked in the absence of physical&#xD;
      contact with an external source-has been linked to the development and maintenance of&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following exposure to sexual abuse or assault (Adams et&#xD;
      al., 2014; Badour et al., 2013; Brake et al., 2017). Mental contamination has been associated&#xD;
      with greater PTSD severity (Rachman et al., 2015) and higher elevations in specific PTSD&#xD;
      symptom clusters (particularly those of intrusive reexperiencing, negative cognitions/mood,&#xD;
      and arousal/reactivity; Brake et al., 2019; Fergus &amp; Bardeen, 2016). Additionally,&#xD;
      trauma-related mental contamination has been linked to a number of negative posttraumatic&#xD;
      emotions such as shame, guilt, disgust, and anger (Fairbrother &amp; Rachman, 2004; Radomsky &amp;&#xD;
      Elliott, 2009) Despite clear and consistent links between mental contamination and&#xD;
      problematic posttraumatic outcomes following sexual trauma, there is a dearth of research&#xD;
      investigating how existing or promising new interventions for PTSD impact mental&#xD;
      contamination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is an efficacious and effective 12-session manualized&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention for PTSD that is considered a gold-standard&#xD;
      empirically-supported treatment for PTSD that is recommended by the American Psychological&#xD;
      Association (APA, 2017). In addition to PTSD symptom improvement, CPT has also demonstrated&#xD;
      benefit for improving feelings of shame and guilt, which are often seen among individuals&#xD;
      with trauma-related mental contamination (Nishith et al., 2005; Resick et al., 2002, 2008).&#xD;
      Cognitive reappraisal, a primary technique employed in CPT, involves challenging one's view&#xD;
      of an emotionally-eliciting situation to alter its emotional impact (Gross &amp; John, 2003).&#xD;
      However, some investigators have suggested that cognitive reappraisal may be less effective&#xD;
      in targeting moral emotions such as shame, guilt, and self-disgust that are based on an&#xD;
      individual's standards and virtues (Finlay, 2015). Self-compassion (SC; i.e., self-directed&#xD;
      care and kindness; forgiveness; and feelings of common humanity; Neff, 2003) has been&#xD;
      proposed as an alternative method for addressing trauma-related shame and preliminary&#xD;
      evidence suggests a 6-session self-compassion intervention may have benefit for reducing both&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms and trauma-related shame (Au et al., 2017). Given the centrality of shame,&#xD;
      guilt, and self-disgust to the experience of mental contamination, and the fact that mental&#xD;
      contamination often arises in response to experiences involving moral violation or betrayal&#xD;
      (Millar et al., 2016; Rachman, 2010), a SC intervention for PTSD may also offer promise as a&#xD;
      standalone or adjunctive intervention for reducing trauma-related mental contamination. A&#xD;
      test of these interventions for their impact on reducing trauma-related mental contamination&#xD;
      is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will use Single Case Experimental Design to isolate and evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of CPT and SC in reducing both PTSD symptoms and trauma-related mental contamination&#xD;
      among individuals with PTSD resulting from sexual trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: 1) explore whether participants demonstrate reductions in mental contamination and PTSD&#xD;
      symptoms in response to 12-sessions of CPT or 6-sessions of a SC intervention; 2) evaluate&#xD;
      whether presentation of either treatment first yields differences in symptom reduction for&#xD;
      PTSD and/or mental contamination symptoms; 3) evaluate whether the addition of the&#xD;
      alternative module will enhance reductions in PTSD symptoms and mental contamination; 4)&#xD;
      evaluate if such reductions are maintained during follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual inspection analysis and statistical methods will be used to draw conclusions regarding&#xD;
      the effects of the interventions on PTSD symptoms and mental contamination.&#xD;

      In this multiple baseline single case experimental design with phase shift, up to 100&#xD;
      participants will be screened to identify 12 eligible individuals to participate in all study&#xD;
      procedures. After the baseline assessment, participants will be randomized (1:1 ratio) to&#xD;
      either a two or four-week baseline phase (assessment-only). Participants will then be&#xD;
      randomized (1:1 ratio) to either a 12-session CPT intervention or a 6-session self-compassion&#xD;
      intervention. All participants will complete one orientation session at the beginning of the&#xD;
      first treatment phase. Following a second three-week baseline phase, all participants will&#xD;
      then shift into the alternate intervention. Participants will be invited to complete a&#xD;
      post-treatment and one-month follow-up assessment. In total, participants who take part in&#xD;
      this research study will be in this research study for up to 34 weeks and will attend up to&#xD;
      20 in-person study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals interested in participating in this study will complete a phone screening to&#xD;
      determine if they are likely to be eligible and can be scheduled for an in-person diagnostic&#xD;
      intake to take place at the Stress Trauma and Recovery Research Collaborative (STARRC) within&#xD;
      the UK Clinic for Emotional Health (i.e., the PI's research lab space located on Waller&#xD;
      Avenue in an office park rented by the University of Kentucky) or via HIPAA compliant Zoom.&#xD;
      All participants will be provided with details regarding the phone screen questions and will&#xD;
      be required to provide implied consent over the phone before proceeding with the phone&#xD;
      screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intake session, the participant will first be given a written and verbal&#xD;
      description of the study and informed consent. The consent form will be presented to the&#xD;
      participant on a tablet, or remotely, through REDCap in which they will be asked to provide a&#xD;
      digital signature. They may request a paper copy if preferred. If consent is provided, they&#xD;
      will be given the option to be emailed a copy. The PI or designated staff will discuss the&#xD;
      informed consent form with the participant volunteer. The consent process will take place in&#xD;
      a quiet and private room or online via HIPAA compliant Zoom. Participants may take as much&#xD;
      time as needed to make a decision about their trial participation and may take the document&#xD;
      home if desired. The person obtaining consent will thoroughly explain each element of the&#xD;
      document and outline the risks and benefits, alternative treatment(s), and follow-up&#xD;
      requirements of the study. Participants will be informed that they can withdraw from the&#xD;
      research at any time. Procedures and consent forms will comply with the requirements of the&#xD;
      UK Institutional Review Board and Office of Research Integrity's Best Practices for Remote&#xD;
      Informed Consent. The experimenter will then complete a consent post-test with participants.&#xD;
      If a participant screens out of the study due to a consent capacity issue, any data from that&#xD;
      participant that may have been previously collected during the phone screening and/or online&#xD;
      surveys will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant privacy will be maintained and questions regarding participation will be&#xD;
      answered. No coercion or undue influence will be used in the consent process. No&#xD;
      research-related procedures will be performed prior to obtaining informed consent. All&#xD;
      signatures and dates will be obtained. A copy of the signed consent will be given to the&#xD;
      participant. Signed electronic consents will be maintained and stored through REDCap and will&#xD;
      be separated from participant data. We do not have reason to expect that participants are&#xD;
      likely to have impaired consent capacity in this study. However, in a previous study our lab&#xD;
      conducted where we did have this expectation we included a consent capacity evaluation&#xD;
      document and found that we liked using it as an extra check that participants were aware of&#xD;
      the study details and what they were agreeing to, and could state back to us in their own&#xD;
      words what they could do if they became uncomfortable or decided they wished to take a break,&#xD;
      skip sections, or discontinue the study. It is now our lab's standard operating procedure to&#xD;
      include this measure in all in-person studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any study personnel member who obtains informed consent from a patient will not serve as that&#xD;
      participant's assigned therapist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon referral to the study via the recruitment methods described above, participants will&#xD;
      complete a brief telephone screening. The screen will predominantly be conducted by trained&#xD;
      undergraduate/post-baccalaureate research/clinic assistants, however the PI, Co-Is, or a&#xD;
      supervised graduate students/post-doctoral scholars may also conduct the phone screens.&#xD;
      Screening forms for individuals who are deemed to be ineligible for the study will be&#xD;
      shredded. Likely eligible participants, determined by the phone screen, will be invited to&#xD;
      attend the intake in-person in the PI's research lab at the Clinic for Emotional Health or&#xD;
      via HIPAA-compliant video conferencing service (i.e., Zoom via the UK HealthCare portal). As&#xD;
      described above (see &quot;Informed Consent&quot; section), a study assessor (i.e., doctoral students&#xD;
      in clinical psychology/post-doctoral scholar/PI/Co-Is) will review study procedures with&#xD;
      potential participants and ask them to provide their informed consent. After informed consent&#xD;
      is provided, an interview-based diagnostic assessment will be administered in order to&#xD;
      confirm clinical inclusion/exclusion criteria. This assessment visit will be video or&#xD;
      audio-recorded provided participants give their consent for this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, participants will be asked to complete a battery of self-report questionnaires, which&#xD;
      will assess symptoms of anxiety/depression, level of functioning (e.g., quality of life),&#xD;
      experiential avoidance, self-compassion, and perceptions of how their history of sexual&#xD;
      trauma have impacted their life. Those who are deemed ineligible after this assessment will&#xD;
      be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will then be randomized to either a two- or four-week baseline where&#xD;
      they will complete weekly measures of PTSD symptoms mental contamination, trauma-related&#xD;
      shame and guilt, and symptoms of anxiety/depression. This battery will be repeated each week&#xD;
      during therapy sessions, along with additional post-session ratings about treatment&#xD;
      credibility and therapeutic alliance. Participants will then be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two treatment orders (CPT, SC or SC, CPT) and will be scheduled for their next study session&#xD;
      either in-person or via HIPAA compliant Zoom. All participants will first be scheduled for a&#xD;
      therapy orientation session prior to beginning either CPT or SC. The therapy orientation&#xD;
      session will be used to develop rapport between the therapist and participant, and will&#xD;
      involve an interview to assess for details of the index traumatic event and experiences of&#xD;
      trauma-related mental contamination. Following completion of each treatment (12 or 6&#xD;
      sessions), participants will be asked to provide satisfaction ratings and written qualitative&#xD;
      feedback on their experience with the treatment they received. Participants will then enter a&#xD;
      second three-week return to assessment period where they will continue to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires weekly before beginning the second treatment module. Participants will also&#xD;
      complete a post-treatment questionnaire packet and continue to track their symptoms weekly&#xD;
      for three weeks following the conclusion of treatment via self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All therapy sessions will last for approximately 60-90 minutes in duration. It is important&#xD;
      to note that the therapeutic strategies involved in both treatments are all common,&#xD;
      evidence-based cognitive-behavioral- or mindfulness-based strategies. The treatments involve&#xD;
      reading from an established manual (Cognitive Processing Therapy for PTSD or Compassion-Based&#xD;
      Therapy for Trauma-Related Shame and Posttraumatic Stress) and completing homework&#xD;
      assignments outside of the treatment session. These treatment sessions will be audio- or&#xD;
      video-recorded provided participants give their consent for this; this will allow study staff&#xD;
      to rate sessions for fidelity to the protocol and will be used for clinical supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All self-report questionnaires will be completed online via REDCap. This survey platform is&#xD;
      designed specifically for collection of research data, and therefore meets the privacy&#xD;
      standards imposed on health care records by the Health Insurance Portability and&#xD;
      Accountability Act (HIPAA). Questionnaires will be completed on-site using a study iPad or&#xD;
      participants will be sent a link via email to complete the survey batteries during their own&#xD;
      time. Finally, although we anticipate that most patients will prefer to complete these&#xD;
      measure electronically, we can provide paper and pencil versions of the questionnaires if&#xD;
      requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be accomplished via phone screening questions, diagnostic interview, and&#xD;
      self-report questionnaires attached below. Through these measures we will collect data&#xD;
      regarding participants' experiences with psychological symptoms, life functioning, and&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measures will be administered according to the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intake and Final Treatment Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic Interview for Anxiety, Mood, and Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Disorders (DIAMOND) interview (Only at Intake) Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS)&#xD;
      with SAFE-T Risk Assessment Demographics (Only at Intake) PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) -&#xD;
      Weekly Posttraumatic Experience of Mental Contamination (PEMC) - Weekly Trauma-Related&#xD;
      Symptom Inventory (TRSI) - Weekly Trauma-Related Guilt Inventory (TRGI) - Weekly Overall&#xD;
      Depression Severity and Impairment Scale (ODSIS) - Weekly Overall Anxiety Severity and&#xD;
      Impairment Scale (OASIS) - Weekly Centrality of Events Scale (CES) Self-Compassion Scale&#xD;
      (SCS) Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-Revised (OCI-R) Brief Experiential Avoidance&#xD;
      Questionnaire (BEAQ) Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form&#xD;
      (Q-LES-Q) Patient Satisfaction Form (final treatment sessions only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Orientation Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Services Tracking Form (Intake only) Trauma Interview&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Session (Weekly):&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCL-5 - Weekly PEMC - Weekly TRSI - Weekly TRGI - Weekly CSSRS - Weekly (in-person sessions&#xD;
      only) Treatment Services Tracking Form - Weekly (in-person sessions only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Session (Weekly):&#xD;
&#xD;
      ODSIS - Weekly OASIS - Weekly Helping Alliance Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II) - Patient and&#xD;
      Therapist CEQ (post-1st treatment sessions only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of Aim 1 is to collect descriptive information regarding prevalence of trauma&#xD;
      history and PTSD, perceptions of connections between trauma history and substance use, and&#xD;
      interest in trauma-informed treatment. This information will be utilized to a) support the&#xD;
      feasibility of a future grant application and b) identify potential patients for the&#xD;
      treatment portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though the primary focus of Aim 2 is to collect data regarding feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and patient feedback regarding areas of modification to inform a future grant proposal, we&#xD;
      plan to utilize a randomized, nonconcurrent multiple baseline design across participants&#xD;
      (Barlow et al., 2009; Kazdin, 2011). This is a form of single-case experimental design that&#xD;
      provides a time and cost-effective method of evaluating initial efficacy or effectiveness of&#xD;
      an intervention while controlling for the passage of time and repeated assessment in small&#xD;
      numbers of patients. Patients will be randomized to either a 2- (n=3) or 4-week (n =3)&#xD;
      baseline assessment phase where weekly self-report measures will be completed prior to&#xD;
      initiating each treatment. Randomizing to varying baseline periods enables assessments of&#xD;
      whether symptoms change (only or more rapidly) when the intervention is applied (i.e., each&#xD;
      participant acts as their own control). Participants will also be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      order that they receive the treatment, with a 3-week return to baseline between treatments to&#xD;
      allow us to examine how symptoms change within each intervention period. This design allows&#xD;
      for causal inferences and controls for many threats to internal validity. Consistent with&#xD;
      established guidelines, quantitative data analysis will primarily be conducted via visual&#xD;
      inspection of graphed data within- and between-subjects to evaluate the magnitude and rate of&#xD;
      change across the baseline and treatment phases (Barlow et al., 2009; Kazdin, 2011). This&#xD;
      will be supplemented by examining within-person mean difference effect sizes for each outcome&#xD;
      using a d-statistic developed for single case designs and calculating the percentage of&#xD;
      patients who evidence reliable change on symptom measures (Jacobson &amp; Truax, 1991; Shadish et&#xD;
      al., 2014).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  individuals with a history of sexual trauma meeting past-month diagnostic criteria for&#xD;
             PTSD (meeting diagnostic status on the DIAMOND and score greater than or equal to 36&#xD;
             on the PCL-5) and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  reporting current experiences of trauma-related mental contamination (greater than or&#xD;
             equal to 10 on the PEMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  fluent in English&#xD;

             a stable dose for at least 4 weeks prior to beginning the study and are willing to&#xD;
             maintain a stable dosage throughout the study period; this procedure allows for a&#xD;
             broader range of participants and avoids having outcomes assessment confounded by the&#xD;
             initiation of medication during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Finally, patients must be willing to refrain from additional trauma-related treatment&#xD;
             for the duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We will exclude individuals diagnosed with psychological conditions that may be better&#xD;
             addressed by alternative treatments; these conditions include&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  psychotic disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  dissociative identity disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  unmanaged (i.e., unmedicated or currently experiencing a manic/hypomanic episode)&#xD;
