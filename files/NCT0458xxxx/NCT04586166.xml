      SASS (Single-incision Versus Retropubic Mid-Urethral Sling (Solyx) for SUI During Minimally&#xD;
      Invasive Sacrocolpopexy) will be a multicenter, prospective, randomized, single-blind&#xD;
      non-inferiority trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SASS aims to compare the efficacy of a single-incision (SIS) versus a retropubic mid-urethral&#xD;
      sling (RP) placed at the time of minimally invasive sacrocolpopexy in women with pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse and objectively confirmed stress urinary incontinence (SUI).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Participants will be masked during the five-year follow-up period. Precautions will be taken to minimize unmasking the study groups. Since RP (retropubic) slings require two suprapubic stab incisions, identical sham incision will also be performed in the SIS (Single-Incision Sling) group.</masking_description>

    <description>The PFDI-20 has a total of 20 questions and 3 scales (Urinary Distress Inventory, Pelvic Organ Prolapse Distress Inventory, and Colorectal-Anal Distress Inventory). The outcomes of this questionnaire will be evaluated stratified by compartment. Each item produces a response of 0 to 4, the average response in each scale is multiplied by 25 to obtain the scale score (range 0 to 100). The total score is the sum of the three scale score with a range of 0-300. Higher values indicate a greater degree of bother.</description>
