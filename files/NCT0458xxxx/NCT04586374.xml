      G-Forces On Retrieved ChildrEn (Pilot) Study is a feasibility study looking at the effect of&#xD;
      G-Forces in vivo during episodes of paediatric critical care transport. The study aims to (i)&#xD;
      understand the relationship between the physics of transport on physiological parameters and&#xD;
      (ii) assess whether syringe driver delivery (previously demonstrated to be affected by&#xD;
      G-forces in vitro), is responsible for physiological variations in transported paediatric&#xD;
      patients requiring vasoactive/inotropic infusions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Throughout the UK, paediatric transport services are responsible for the stabilisation and&#xD;
      transport of critically unwell children. This involves moving children from district general&#xD;
      hospitals to receive specialist care in tertiary centres and moving children between tertiary&#xD;
      and quaternary centres in order to provide the appropriate level of specialist care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically unwell children often require infusions of essential, life-saving medications&#xD;
      during episodes of transport. Disruption of these infusions can be destabilising and even&#xD;
      life-threatening. Examples of essential infusions include the use of prostin in&#xD;
      duct-dependent congenital heart disease, vasoactive/inotropic medications in shock and&#xD;
      sedation and muscle relaxants to ensure comfortable, safe transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically unwell patients often require support in the form of inotropes/vasopressors to&#xD;
      support cardiac contractility and alter vascular tone and are commonly used in the treatment&#xD;
      of shock. Physiological response to vasoactive/inotropic drugs is rapid and measurable in&#xD;
      terms of cardiovascular status through observing changes in heart rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
      oxygenation of peripheral tissues (pulse oximetry). As such these medications offer the&#xD;
      potential to observe whether syringe driver delivery variations as mediated through the&#xD;
      effect of g-forces exert measurable physiological instability in transported patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G-Forces Pilot is a prospective, observational, case-control, feasibility study investigating&#xD;
      the effect of G-forces as measured by an accelerometer against physiological parameters of&#xD;
      heart rate, invasive blood pressure measurement and oxygen saturations in vivo during&#xD;
      episodes of transport. The study aims to understand the relationship between the physics of&#xD;
      transport on physiological parameters and to assess whether syringe driver delivery&#xD;
      (previously demonstrated to be affected by G-forces in-vitro), is responsible for&#xD;
      physiological variations in transported patients requiring vasoactive/inotropic infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to examine this relationship by obtaining and analysing data on&#xD;
      physiological parameters in patients during episodes of transport to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Whether G-forces experienced by being in a moving ambulance affect the stability of&#xD;
      patient physiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) How variations in syringe driver delivery mediated through the effects of G-Forces&#xD;
      affect patients in transit as evidenced through instability in physiological parameters&#xD;
      whilst receiving vasoactive/inotropic infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be examined by the comparison of a control and study group. The control group will&#xD;
      consist of patients with full monitoring (including an arterial line), without&#xD;
      vasoactive/inotropic support. The study group will consist of patients with full monitoring&#xD;
      (including an arterial line) receiving vasoactive/inotropic support through a syringe driver.&#xD;
      Data analysis will assess the strength of correlation between patient observations and&#xD;
      experienced g-forces recorded during the episode of transport to answer the study question.&#xD;

    <description>Beat to beat, wave-form data from physiological parameters of heart rate, oxygen saturations and invasive arterial blood pressure measured during transport will provide a set of continuous data outputs. Calculating the correlation coefficient will indicate the strength of relationship between physiological parameters and the experienced G-forces with the aim of answering two questions:&#xD;
Do G-forces (the acceleration and deceleration forces) experienced by being in a moving ambulance, affect the stability of patient observations - heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturations.&#xD;
Do G-forces experienced by being in a moving ambulance, affect the delivery of vasoactive/inotropic drug infusions which in turn affects the stability of observations.</description>
