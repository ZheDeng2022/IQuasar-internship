    <textblock>
      Blood transfusion is at the heart of the therapeutic arsenal when there is a hemorrhage&#xD;
      and/or blood loss during a surgery. There are two types of transfusion: the homologous one&#xD;
      (blood from a compatible donor) and the autologous or autotransfusion method (which is done&#xD;
      with the patient's own blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although homologous transfusions can save lives, it can cause significant adverse events.&#xD;
      Since then, multiple solutions have been developed to avoid exposing patients to these risks.&#xD;
      It is in this context that was born the &quot;Patient Blood Management&quot; (PBM). Thus, the strategy&#xD;
      in this PBM has been defined as &quot;the appropriate use of blood and blood components, with the&#xD;
      aim of minimizing the use of allogeneic transfusions&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, particular interest has been given to autologous transfusion or&#xD;
      autotransfusion or cell salvage, the general purpose is to reduce (or even stop) the use of&#xD;
      allogeneic products and to reduce the risks associated with the ABO compatibility system, as&#xD;
      well as all the adverse effects associated with allogeneic plasma and platelet transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most autotransfusers available on the market operate by centrifugation. Autotransfusion is&#xD;
      already a solution in Patient Blood Management and its efficiency and safety have already&#xD;
      been optimized. However, there is still a need to improve the quality of the treated blood&#xD;
      with an easier-to-use device that could improve the quality of the blood concentrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, with the current devices, it may happen that the use of allogeneic transfusions,&#xD;
      plasma and platelets transfusions, is necessary in addition to autologous red blood cells&#xD;
      thus reducing the interest of autotransfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that i-SEP has developed a new autotransfusion device based on a&#xD;
      filtration method. Unlike competing devices, the i-SEP device allows the concentration of not&#xD;
      only red blood cells (as competitive devices) but also platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the i-SEP device is used in typical clinical applications of autotransfusion:&#xD;
      cardiovascular and orthopedic surgeries, where there is a risk of hemorrhage and/or blood&#xD;
      loss for example ≥ 500mL in cardiac surgery and ≥ 300mL in orthopedic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a screening phase (≤ 21Days), surgery phase when the i-SEP device is used&#xD;
      (Day 0), a post-surgery phase (Day 1 - Day 6), a first follow-up visit (Day 7 ± 3) and a&#xD;
      second follow-up visit (Day 30 ± 7).&#xD;

      Blood transfusion is at the heart of the therapeutic arsenal when one wishes to preserve the&#xD;
      hemodynamic balance of a patient. There are two types of transfusion: the homologous one&#xD;
      (blood from a compatible donor) and the autologous or autotransfusion method (which is done&#xD;
      with one's own blood / by the patient's own blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although homologous transfusions can save lives, it may lead to non-negligible adverse&#xD;
      events. Among these events, immunological consequences such as allo-immunization against red&#xD;
      blood cells' antigens from the donor blood can be cited. Some infections have also been&#xD;
      reported following allogenic transfusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, multiple solutions have been developed to avoid exposing patients to these risks.&#xD;
      It is in this context that was born the &quot;Patient Blood Management&quot; (PBM). Thus, the strategy&#xD;
      in this PBM has been defined as &quot;the appropriate use of blood and blood components, with the&#xD;
      aim of minimizing the use of allogeneic transfusions&quot;. In this context, particular interest&#xD;
      has been given to autologous transfusion or autotransfusion or cell salvage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principle of Intra-Operative Cell Salvaged (IOCS) allows intravenous administration of&#xD;
      the patient's own blood collected at the surgical site or postoperative wound during&#xD;
      hemorrhagic surgery. It is used mainly in cardiac, vascular, transplant and elective&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeries and tends to spread to other surgeries such as neurosurgery, obstetrics&#xD;
      and urology.The IOCS has multiple benefits, primarily autologous (the patient gets his own&#xD;
      blood), immediate availability in the operating room, reduced costs of patient care, and the&#xD;
      recycling of otherwise lost blood products. It is part of blood saving techniques that avoid&#xD;
      the use of homologous blood. Indeed, the general purpose of IOCS is to reduce (or even stop)&#xD;
      the use of allogeneic products and to reduce the risks associated with the ABO compatibility&#xD;
      system, as well as all the adverse effects associated with allogeneic plasma and platelet&#xD;
      transfusions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most autotransfusers available on the market operate by centrifugation. Autotransfusion is&#xD;
      already a solution in Patient Blood Management and its efficiency and safety have already&#xD;
      been optimized. However, there is still a need to improve the quality of the treated blood&#xD;
      with an easier-to-use device that could improve the quality of the blood concentrate.&#xD;
