  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to gain preliminary evidence regarding the&#xD;
      acceptability, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of a combined intervention of Stellate&#xD;
      Ganglion Blockade (SGB) and psychoeducation on trauma symptoms and health behaviors in&#xD;
      patients exhibiting early PTSD symptoms after cardiac arrest (CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1 (Feasibility outcomes): Gain preliminary evidence regarding the acceptability,&#xD;
      tolerability, and safety of conducting a randomized trial that evaluates a single SGB&#xD;
      treatment in conjunction with psychoeducation among CA patients with early PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim 1 (Treatment-related outcomes): Test, whether SGB/psychoeducation treatment in&#xD;
      CA patients with clinically significant PTSD symptoms is associated with reduced cardiac&#xD;
      anxiety, PTSD symptoms, and improved health behaviors (physical activity and sleep duration),&#xD;
      assessed objectively by a wrist-worn accelerometer for 4 weeks post-discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year in the U.S., 500,000 people experience sudden cardiac arrest (CA), caused by&#xD;
      electrical disturbances across cardiac tissue, leading to marked arrhythmia that ultimately&#xD;
      results in the heart ceasing to pump blood to the brain, lungs, and other organs. Due to&#xD;
      advances in bundled post-arrest care, cardio-cerebral resuscitation, and effective cooling&#xD;
      protocols, a substantial proportion of patients who receive guideline-based care (nearly 1 in&#xD;
      3 for out-of-hospital and ~50% for in-hospital CA) now survive this once universally fatal&#xD;
      condition. While most survivors retain their cognitive function and physical independence,&#xD;
      many grapple with CA's psychological consequences in the context of learning that they were&#xD;
      &quot;clinically dead.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, many describe the CA experience as traumatic, and up to 1 in 3 CA survivors&#xD;
      subsequently develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Not only is PTSD common in CA&#xD;
      patients, but there is evidence that PTSD after CA may influence health behaviors and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of early PTSD and cardiac anxiety symptoms after CA requires timely intervention.&#xD;
      Recent studies show that SGB is a safe and acceptable intervention for reducing PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      in combat veterans. SGB treatment has never been tested to treat PTSD induced by acute&#xD;
      medical events such as CA.&#xD;

    <description>The session will be 30 minutes in duration, to be administered by a health professional with experience working with CA patients, the goal will be to establish rapport and help patient identify anxious situations, thoughts, and bodily feelings related their recent CA that could lead to avoidant behavior.&#xD;
Explain how many of these feelings are common in CA survivors, and they are often unrelated to their risk of its recurrence. Explain how the body has a fight-or-flight system that is controlled in part by the stellate ganglion and explain how blocking the action of this part of the body can reduce the feelings of anxiety that commonly occur. Discuss how certain activities such as exercise can increase feelings of anxiety around bodily sensations, but continued engagement could reduce that fear and that exercise is helpful for recovering from CA</description>
