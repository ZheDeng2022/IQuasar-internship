      Mechanical ventilation (MV) is used to reduce work and reverse or prevent fatigue of the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles, decrease oxygen consumption and maintain gas exchange. In addition to&#xD;
      the benefits given to patients undergoing MV, there is a high risk of accumulating bronchial&#xD;
      secretions, related to pathology and / or therapeutic intervention. Pulmonary hyperinflation&#xD;
      is widespread in patients in intensive care centers (ICUs) as a bronchial hygiene therapy,&#xD;
      being used in 40% of 64 Australian ICUs as demonstrated by Dennis et al., Through contact&#xD;
      with physical therapists. Mechanical hyperinflation associated with tracheal aspiration is&#xD;
      able to increase the amount of secretion aspirated when compared to isolated aspiration in&#xD;

      Evaluate the change in respiratory mechanics through collection in two moments after the&#xD;

      (VAC), peak pressure (Ppico). The population will consist of patients from the Post-Operative&#xD;
      Unit (UPO), unit intensive care (UCI) and emergency room, from the Institute of Cardiology,&#xD;
      of both sexes, over 18 years old, mechanically ventilated more than 48 hours and the sample&#xD;
      consisting of 50 individuals. These will be submitted to the use of the pulmonary&#xD;
      hyperinflation maneuver in the mechanical ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized crossover clinical trial in which the individuals selected for the study&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive isolated tracheal aspiration (Control Group) and pulmonary&#xD;
      hyperinflation through the mechanical ventilator associated with tracheal aspiration&#xD;
      (Intervention Group). Randomization will be performed through the randomization.com website&#xD;
      by a 1: 1 crossed block, allocating the patient to one of the groups and, after 24 hours,&#xD;
      another technique will be performed. In addition, a control aspiration will be performed 2&#xD;
      hours before both techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For basal aspiration, the patient will be placed in the supine position with the head&#xD;
      elevated at 30º, will be submitted to a single aspiration with a size 12 probe (Mark Med),&#xD;
      with a vacuum adjusted to -40cmH2O of pressure, with basic asepsis care being maintained for&#xD;
      performing the technique35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, patients will be ventilated for 1 minute with 100% inspired oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2), followed by three aspirations for 15 seconds and with an interval of 30 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the participants of the intervention group, the calculation of the ideal tidal volume for&#xD;
      each patient will be performed, after which they will be positioned in the supine position,&#xD;
      the head elevated to 30º in assisted pressure-controlled ventilation mode, increasing 10&#xD;
      cmH2O in inspiratory pressure and, in assisted ventilation mode. controlled by volume, we&#xD;
      will increase 50% of the tidal volume for a period of 10 minutes, observing the Ppeak that&#xD;
      cannot exceed 40 cmH2O and the drive pressure that cannot exceed 15 cmH2O in both ventilation&#xD;
      modes, and then a new aspiration will be performed. in the same way as the control group. The&#xD;
      hemodynamics data will be taken from the multiparametric monitor of the hospitalization units&#xD;
      (philips) and the respiratory mechanics data will be collected from the mechanical ventilator&#xD;
      screen (Servo S; Drager; Newport), before and after the techniques. The volume of secretion&#xD;
      will be stored in the collection flask (Water Seal 120 ml) and weighed using a high precision&#xD;
      scale, discounting the weight of the collection flask.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be signed by the responsible family member, containing&#xD;
      information and explanations about the present study and the researcher will be available to&#xD;
      explain doubts and questions at the time and afterwards through the telephone present at the&#xD;
      ICF. All procedures will be performed under the supervision of the physiotherapist at the&#xD;
      hospital. It is understood that this research may offer a minimal risk to volunteers,&#xD;
      according to resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council, since they may have some&#xD;
      discomfort and / or their hemodynamic situation altered by the application of the&#xD;
      aforementioned physical therapy technique. As a counterpart, in case the predicted risk&#xD;
      occurs, the subjects will receive all the necessary care from the researcher, together with&#xD;
      the unit's physiotherapist and medical team, if necessary. The benefits to the subjects refer&#xD;
      to the possibility of improving their respiratory function and bronchial hygiene.&#xD;
