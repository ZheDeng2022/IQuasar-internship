      The purpose of this study is to validate and utilize a personalized medicine approach to&#xD;
      identify potential treatments with current FDA approved CFTR modifiers for non-approved CF&#xD;
      gene mutations. The study will perform ex vivo testing of CFTR function and current marketed&#xD;
      CFTR modulating drugs on expanded nasal cells at Cincinnati Children's Human Nasal Epithelium&#xD;
      (HNE) Core Laboratory. The results will be confirmed and translated into bedside care through&#xD;
      an N of 1 trial to determine effectiveness of treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a protocol for the development of personalized treatments from bench to bedside for&#xD;
      rare CF mutations. The protocol will start with the current FDA-approved CFTR modulators and&#xD;
      continue to add newly developed CF drug therapies to the potential treatment testing options&#xD;
      as they are approved for market. This is a single-center study enrolling subjects with rare&#xD;
      CFTR variants who are prescribed CFTR modulators by their treating physician. This decision&#xD;
      may be based on the patient's genotype (e.g., a patient with a CFTR mutation known to respond&#xD;
      to drug) or based on preclinical HNE model testing; regardless, the decision to start a&#xD;
      modulator is made by the subject's physician, not by the study team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The N-of-1 design includes a basic research component using nasal brushings which will be&#xD;
      expanded in the HNE Core Lab and tested with CFTR modulating drug therapies. Based on the HNE&#xD;
      culture's reactivity to the tested CFTR modulating drugs, an N-of-1 trial will be initiated&#xD;
      to test if this translates to therapeutic benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CFTR modulating drugs that are currently FDA approved and will be tested in this study&#xD;
      include ivacaftor and the combination drugs orkambi (ivacaftor/lumacaftor), symdeko&#xD;
      (ivacaftor/tezacaftor), and trikafta (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor). All will be used in&#xD;
      clinically prescribed dosages and within the FDA approved age ranges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HNE testing, subjects will fall into two pools. The first will have already undergone HNE&#xD;
      model testing with positive results. These subjects will proceed directly to N-of-1 testing&#xD;
      without additional ex vivo studies. The second group will have been referred for N-of-1&#xD;
      testing based on their CFTR genotype, having not previously undergone HNE testing. This group&#xD;
      will have HNEs harvested at the initial visit, and HNE testing will occur in parallel to&#xD;
      N-of-1 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the N-of-1 portion of this trial, subjects will undergo a 14-day run-in period, followed&#xD;
      by an observational 28-day block of non-treatment. This will be followed with a 14-day&#xD;
      washout period, and then by a 28-day block of modulator treatment, with a final 14-day&#xD;
      washout period and a 14-day follow-up period before study completion. Repeated assessments&#xD;
      will occur at the beginning and end of each 28-day block. Participants will therefore be on&#xD;
      study for approximately 112 days. This protocol will remain open indefinitely to develop&#xD;
      treatment options for patients with new and not well defined forms of Cystic Fibrosis and&#xD;
      CFTR disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this time, CFTR modulator drugs can only be filled in specialty pharmacies, and is not on&#xD;
      formulary at CCHMC. While the development of a specialty pharmacy was in process at CCHMC,&#xD;
      this progress has halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because the drugs cannot be filled&#xD;
      internally, the Investigational Drug Service is unable to dispense them or provide placebo&#xD;
      for blinded studies. Because understanding the individual response to these compounds and the&#xD;
      relationship of that response to HNE models is critical, this study will move forward in an&#xD;
      open-label fashion. If the CCHMC specialty pharmacy is successfully opened, we anticipate a&#xD;
      revision to modify this protocol to a double-blinded, placebo-controlled crossover, however,&#xD;
      this is not currently possible. This change has been discussed with the funding agency (NIH /&#xD;
      NIDDK), who are in agreement.&#xD;
