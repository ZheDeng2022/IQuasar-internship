      The primary objective of this study is to examine acceptability, patterns of use, rates of&#xD;
      adherence, safety , and measured levels of drug when high risk men who have sex with men&#xD;
      (MSM) are provided open-label tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC) for PrEP in South Korea.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are 1) to evaluate HIV incidence among study participants, 2) to&#xD;
      evaluate risk behavior and risk compensation among study participants, and 3) to identify&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators of PrEP among study participants. The design of this study is a&#xD;
      prospective, open-label cohort study assessing PrEP implementation in tertiary hospital&#xD;
      infectious diseases clinics in South Korea for 1 year. Baseline data will be collected 1&#xD;
      months before initiation of PrEP, and the date of initiation of PrEP. All persons receiving&#xD;
      PrEP should be seen at 1 month since PrEP initiation and at least every 3 months to assess&#xD;
      side effects, adherence, and HIV acquisition risk behaviors. Drug concentration will be&#xD;
      measured every 6 months. It is anticipated that approximately 100 Korean MSM will be enrolled&#xD;
      in this study.&#xD;

      1. Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
           • To examine acceptability, patterns of use, rates of adherence, safety , and measured&#xD;
           levels of drug when high risk MSM are provided open-label TDF/FTC for PrEP in South&#xD;
           Korea&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate HIV incidence among study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate risk behavior and risk compensation among study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To identify barriers and facilitators of PrEP among study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study design Prospective, open-label cohort study assessing PrEP delivery in tertiary&#xD;
           hospital infectious diseases clinics in South Korea for 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. HIV testing and the documentation of results are required to confirm that&#xD;
                     patients do not have HIV infection when they start taking PrEP medications.&#xD;
                     HIV Ag/anti HIV Ab combo assay should be performed before starting PrEP.&#xD;
                     Negative result of HIV Ag/anti HIV Ab combo assay within 1 week should be&#xD;
                     ascertained before PrEP initiation. Results from rapid test with oral specimen&#xD;
                     or unreliable testing results cannot be acknowledged.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Renal function with estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl) should be evaluated&#xD;
                     before starting TDF/FTC. TDF/FTC can be prescribed for persons with eCrCl ≥60&#xD;
                     ml/min. Any person with an eCrCl of &lt;60 ml/min should not be prescribed PrEP&#xD;
                     with TDF/FTC.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Testing for hepatitis B virus (HBsAg, HBsAb) and hepatitis C virus (HCV Ab)&#xD;
                     should be performed before starting PrEP. Hepatitis B virus vaccination is&#xD;
                     recommended for MSM without HBsAb.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Acute HIV infection must be excluded by symptom history, physical examinations&#xD;
                     and appropriate HIV testing before PrEP is prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. If HIV testing shows intermediate results, clinician should hold PrEP&#xD;
                     initiation, make efforts to identify symptoms and signs of acute viral&#xD;
                     infections, and do follow up HIV testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Follow up and monitoring during PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. All persons receiving PrEP should be seen at 1 month since PrEP initiation and&#xD;
                     at least every 3 months to assess side effects, adherence, and HIV acquisition&#xD;
                     risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. All persons receiving PrEP should be seen at least every 3 months to assess&#xD;
                     for signs or symptoms of acute infection and repeat HIV testing (HIV Ag/anti&#xD;
                     HIV Ab combo assay). If acute infection is suspected, HIV RNA testing should&#xD;
                     be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Confirmative HIV testing (western blot assay) and HIV RNA testing should be&#xD;
                     performed for persons with positive results of screening assay (HIV Ag/anti&#xD;
                     HIV Ab assay). Resistance testing should be performed for persons with&#xD;
                     confirmed HIV infection during PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. If acute HIV infection is suspected during PrEP, PrEP should be stopped,&#xD;
                     combination antiretroviral therapy with TDF/FTC+boosted protease inhibitor&#xD;
                     (darunavir/ritonavir) or TDF/FTC + dolutegravir should be prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. All persons receiving PrEP should be seen at least every 3 months to monitor&#xD;
                     eCrCl.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. Sexually active persons receiving PrEP should be seen at least every 6 months&#xD;
                     to conduct tests for sexually transmitted infections (i.e. syphilis,&#xD;
                     gonorrhea, chlamydia).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  7. Assessments of bone health are not routinely recommended before the initiation&#xD;
                     of PrEP or for the monitoring of persons while taking PrEP. However,&#xD;
                     assessment for bone health can be considered for any person who has a history&#xD;
                     of pathologic fractures or who has significant risk factors for osteoporosis&#xD;
                     mineral density PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. All persons receiving PrEP should be seen at least 12 months to evaluate the&#xD;
                     need to continue PrEP as a component of HIV prevention considering HIV&#xD;
                     acquisition risk behavior, adherence, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Measurement Baseline data will be collected 1 months before initiation of PrEP, and the&#xD;
           date of initiation of PrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All persons receiving PrEP should be seen at 1 month since PrEP initiation and at least every&#xD;
      3 months to assess side effects, adherence, and HIV acquisition risk behaviors. During every&#xD;
      visits including screening visit, below measures are assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic testing: HIV testing with a fourth generation HIV Ag/Ab test, HIV RNA assay,&#xD;
           serologic test for syphilis using VDRL or RPR, screening for gonorrhoea and chlamydia&#xD;
           using nucleic acid amplification test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographics and sexual behaviors: demographic and sexual behavioral data are&#xD;
           collected by trained interviewers using standardized questionnaires including residence,&#xD;
           living situation, employment, insurance status, income, housing/food instability, drug&#xD;
           use, number of anal sex partners, episodes in the past 3 months, condom use, partner HIV&#xD;
           serostatus, sexual position, etc.&#xD;
