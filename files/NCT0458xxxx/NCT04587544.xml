  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gouty arthritis is a type of autoinflammatory arthritis that generates higher levels of pain&#xD;
      with only minimum movement in the joint. The pain is shown to have a negative correlation&#xD;
      with the physical function, reduced peak ankle joint angular, mobility velocity , and&#xD;
      physical function. As such, the investigator can conclude that gout arthritis led to raises&#xD;
      intolerance foot pain, physical inactivity, and joint mobility reduction. Currently,&#xD;
      intermittent drugs use for pain relief is suggested to contribute to the renal impairment&#xD;
      side effect. However, the investigator found that there is a limited study that investigated&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention among people with gouty arthritis. The pain among people&#xD;
      with gouty arthritis has also been shown to increase the degree of depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      depression. Also, the high levels of pain, psychological distress, anxiety, and depression&#xD;
      were found as the risk factor of poor Quality of Life (QOL). Cold therapy (cryotherapy)&#xD;
      application has been proven as useful adjuvant therapy on pain among people with gouty&#xD;
      arthritis. CWI therapy has twofold reduced the inflammation. Firstly, it attenuates metabolic&#xD;
      processes in stressed tissues and slowing cytokine and myokine up-regulation that mediates&#xD;
      inflammation. Second, CWI induces microvasculature vasoconstriction by perfusing stressed&#xD;
      tissue and reducing the circulatory of tissue access to inflammatory cells. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      high prevalence of gouty arthritis has been presented in North Celebes, Indonesia. Moreover,&#xD;
      more than 50% of patients are too late for effective therapy and they had observed tophi for&#xD;
      7 to 9 years before presenting for treatment. These empirical issues indicate that it is&#xD;
      vital to investigate gouty arthritis-related risk factors to protect Indonesians from this&#xD;
      disease. The investigator aims to investigate a unique analysis of the CWI (20-30C) therapy&#xD;
      effect on pain, joint mobility, stress, anxiety, depression, QOL (encompasses PCS and MCS),&#xD;
      physical activity (MET-h/week) in the multicenter-community setting with a longitudinal study&#xD;
      design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research was conducted at North Celebes, Indonesia. Participants were recruited using&#xD;
      the multi-stage sampling method, which began in July 2019. North Celebes Province was&#xD;
      conveniently selected in the first stage sampling, which had the highest prevalence of gouty&#xD;
      arthritis. North Celebes province is stratified it into 15 regions. In the second stage, two&#xD;
      regions of fifteen regions were randomly selected, including urban and rural areas. Tomohon&#xD;
      City is the one urban area that has been able to engage in this partnership. Seven Community&#xD;
      Health Service (CHS) centers in Tomohon City have been randomly chosen in the final level.&#xD;
      Four qualified professional nurses collected all the data. The data source of diagnoses was&#xD;
      their medical records in the Public Community Health Services (CHS) of Tomohon City. The&#xD;
      sample calculation utilized G-Power 3.1 software with the alpha level (α) of 0.01, power&#xD;
      (1-ß) of 0.80, and the effect size is 0.9, the total estimated sample size required 31 in&#xD;
      each group. An estimated 20% dropout rate increases; the sample size is 36 for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variable description 1.1.1. Participants Characteristic Blood pressure and BMI were examined&#xD;
      in a standardized medical examination. Demographic data were collected by using a&#xD;
      self-designed questionnaire. The questionnaire included the demographic characteristics of&#xD;
      the participant, including age, gender, marital status, educational level, income,&#xD;
      occupation, family gout history, gouty arthritis drug consumption, alcohol consumption, and&#xD;
      smoking status. The translated food frequency questionnaire was employed with Cronbach's&#xD;
      alpha as 0.95.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.2. Pain The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) instrument has 10 centimeters length. The standard&#xD;
      scale anchored by &quot;no pain&quot; marked as a score of 0 and the &quot;worst imaginable pain&quot; marked as&#xD;
      a score of 10 cm. The higher score identifies greater pain intensity. The reliability test&#xD;
      showed that VAS was good (r = 0.94, p = 0.001). The reliability test of the VAS instrument&#xD;
      has been done in Indonesia with the Cronbach's alpha as 0.89.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.3. Joint mobility The range of knee joint motion was calculated using an International&#xD;
      Standard Orthopedic Measurement (ISOM) goniometric. Its method using the Sagittal Frontal&#xD;
      Transverse Rotation (SFTR) system to an accuracy of 10. Goniometry provides an objective&#xD;
      assessment tool to measure the range of motion. The validity and reliability of Goniometry&#xD;
      are 0.98 and 0.97, respectively. The validity score of the Indonesian version is 0.97, and&#xD;
      the Cronbach alpha as 0.51.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.4. Stress, anxiety, depression The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21)&#xD;
      questionnaire is used to measure the negative states of three mental health conditions:&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and stress using a self-report 4-point Likert scale. Data was collected&#xD;
      by reflects the thoughts, feelings, and behavior. The result will be defined by the total&#xD;
      scores of responses from the 7-item subscale of this questionnaire. The Cronbach's alphas of&#xD;
      Indonesian translated is 0.72 to 0.87.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.5. Quality of Life (QOL) 36 Health Survey (SF-36) questionnaire was employed to estimate&#xD;
      QOL. It included Physical Component Summary (PCS), Mental Component Summary (MCS). Total QOL&#xD;
      range from 0 to 100. The Indonesia version of the SF-36 questionnaire has tested the&#xD;
      reliability with the Cronbach's alphas 0.7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1.6. Physical activity (MET-h/week) The physical activity level was investigated as&#xD;
      metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-hr/week by using three questions based on the modified&#xD;
      Physical Activity Guideline from the Advisory Committee for Americans and the Godin&#xD;
      Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. The investigator then categorized participants based on&#xD;
      the exercise type (that is divided into the following categories: mild (e.g., yoga, bowling,&#xD;
      or floor-sweeping), moderate (e.g., gym, baseball, or badminton), and strenuous exercise&#xD;
      (e.g., hiking, soccer, or running)), duration in minutes and exercise intensity they&#xD;
      presented during a typical week. The investigator multiplied the amount of mild, moderate,&#xD;
      and strenuous exercise hours and duration by 3, 5, and 9, respectively. By summing the&#xD;
      exercise pattern of the separate things, the investigator measured total weekly PA in&#xD;
      arbitrary units.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The per-protocol method was employed to deal with the missing data. Each participant is&#xD;
      allowed to immediately report the adverse event during the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chi-square and t-test were employed to analyze the homogeneity of subject characteristics&#xD;
      between the experimental and control group. The Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) model&#xD;
      was applied to compare the differences pain, joint mobility, stress, anxiety, depression, QOL&#xD;
      (included PCS and MCS), physical activity (MET-h/week) within one-month intervention between&#xD;
      the intervention and control group. The interaction between group and time was also further&#xD;
      analyzed to determine if the mean differences in their pain, joint mobility, stress anxiety,&#xD;
      and depression, QOL, and physical activity between groups differed significantly over time.&#xD;
      p&lt;0.05 was applied as statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed&#xD;
      using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) vers. 25.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
      Besides, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was also employed to analyze the mediating effect&#xD;
      between variables through the Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS) vers. 24. Then the&#xD;
      investigator evaluate the measurement and structural models by utilizing the goodness fit&#xD;
      index.&#xD;
