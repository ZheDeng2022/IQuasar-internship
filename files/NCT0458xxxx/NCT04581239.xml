    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to find out the effects of active versus passive lower extremity&#xD;
      neuralmobilizations combined with lumbar traction and lumbar mobilization in patients with&#xD;
      lumbarradiculopathy. The study was conducted in shalamar hospital Lahore and was completed&#xD;
      within 6 month of time duration. Sample size of twenty four patient consists of both male and&#xD;
      female aged between 45 years to 65 years. Each group contain 12 patients. Group A received&#xD;
      active neural mobilizations whereas group B received passive neural mobilization along with&#xD;
      lumber traction and mobilization. Patients were re assessed at the end of 6 weeks through SLR&#xD;
      , NPRS and ODI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lower back pain is found to be one of the common health condition approximately 80% of&#xD;
      individual experience back pain once in their lives. Radicular lower back pain is also a&#xD;
      disorder that involves the dysfunction of the nerve roots of lumbosacral region. Its symptoms&#xD;
      include radiating pain with numbness, paraesthesia and muscle weakness. In general population&#xD;
      the annual prevalence of lumber radiculopathy varied from 9.9% to 25% .. Many of the spinal&#xD;
      structures notably ligaments, paravertebral muscles, facet joints, spinal nerve roots and&#xD;
      annulus fibrosis have been considered as the main cause of the pain. Clinical examinations&#xD;
      mostly aim to clarify that whether a nerve root has mechanical impingement. The common&#xD;
      clinical diagnostic tests include tests for tendon reflexes, straight leg raise test(SLR),&#xD;
      sensory deficits and motor weakness. Several clinicians and researchers have come up with&#xD;
      several debates for the treatment of Lower back pain. But not many studies have come up that&#xD;
      actually authenticates that how much effective are physical therapy interventions. The common&#xD;
      treatments for radical lower back pain includes physical modalities like TENS, ultrasound,&#xD;
      Heat and Cryotherapy, lumbar traction and lumbar spinal mobilizations. Kinesiotherapy&#xD;
      including ROM exercises and strengthening are also used to treat lower back pain. Neural&#xD;
      mobilization techniques actually help in restoring the plasticity of nervous system.&#xD;
      Plasticity of nervous system is actually the ability of the nerve surrounding structures to&#xD;
      adapt of shift according to other structures. The aim of mobilization is actually to increase&#xD;
      the collagen flexibility that helps in maintaining the integrity and movement of the nerve&#xD;
      according to its surrounding structures. Radiculopathy management and lower back pain&#xD;
      management have a direct link with neural mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, evidence lacks whether active or passive lower extremity neural mobilization is more&#xD;
      effective. Thus, the purpose of the current study is to compare the effects of active and&#xD;
      passive neural mobilization in the management of lumbar radiculopathy, in combination with&#xD;
      mechanical traction and joint mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2016 an RCT was conducted and concluded the efficacy of neural mobilization techniques in&#xD;
      patients with radicular low back pain. They concluded that neural mobilizations techniques in&#xD;
      radicular low back pain are effective. They stated that these techniques reduce the pain,&#xD;
      functional disability and enhance the physiological functioning of the nerve root in patients&#xD;
      in low back pain with lumbosacral radiculopathy . In 2014 A comparative study was conducted&#xD;
      and found that lower extremity neural mobilizations along with conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      such as lumbar traction and lumbar mobilizations improves the agility in lower extremity and&#xD;
      reduces pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2013 a Study was conducted to observe observed the effects of neural mobilizations in the&#xD;
      patients with radicular low back pain and concluded that patients treated with neural&#xD;
      mobilizations showed better VAS score. They stated that further research is needed in order&#xD;
      to assess the long-term effects of treatment and treatments provided on more than one&#xD;
      occasion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of active verses passive lower&#xD;
      extremity neural mobilizations combined lumbar traction and lumbar mobilization so that in&#xD;
      future this study should be helpful for other researchers to determine which therapy is most&#xD;
      helpful in rehabilitation of the patients with radicular low back pain signs and symptoms.&#xD;
