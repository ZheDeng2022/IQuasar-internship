    <textblock>
      Thrombosis of the external hemorrhoids (TEH) is one of the most frequent complain during&#xD;
      pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paucity of the medical literature on this topic has recently been underlined in the&#xD;
      European guidelines for hemorrhoid treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective study is to compare the efficacy and safety of conservative&#xD;
      versus surgical treatment of TEH in pregnant women&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Thrombosis of external haemorrhoids (TEH) is a quite frequent acute condition that affects&#xD;
      women during the pregnancy arousing great concern and impacting quality of life. TEH may&#xD;
      present as an acute hemorrhoidal crisis with severe pain and bleeding. Up to 21.8 % of&#xD;
      pregnant females complaining of dyschezia present with a thrombosed external haemorrhoid and&#xD;
      during last three months, 7.8 % of pregnant females experience a TEH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic changes in women body can be related to the onset of TEH and even if haemorrhoidal&#xD;
      thrombosis does not represent a life-threatening condition during the pregnancy, on the other&#xD;
      hand the pain can deteriorate the emotional and physical status arousing worries which affect&#xD;
      the health system with high costs due to several accesses to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of TEH is mainly directed to the relief of symptoms, especially pain control.&#xD;
      Nowadays conservative and surgical management of TEH during the pregnancy have been&#xD;
      demonstrated both effective and safe. Nevertheless, a conservative approach is more accepted&#xD;
      as the patient's ability to tolerate the symptoms of her condition would dictate the need for&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the common practice most patients prefer to be treated conservatively experiencing&#xD;
      resolution of their symptoms. On the other hand excision of thrombosed external haemorrhoids&#xD;
      results in more rapid symptom resolution, lower incidence of recurrence, and longer remission&#xD;
      intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the pregnancy the administration of conservative medications is quite limited due to&#xD;
      the possible side effect of such drugs on the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective study is to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      conservative and surgical treatment in patients affected by TEH during pregnancy. With regard&#xD;
      to surgical management, thrombectomy and local excision of external haemorrhoids were&#xD;
      compared.&#xD;
