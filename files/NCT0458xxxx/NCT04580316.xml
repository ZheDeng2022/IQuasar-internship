  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study aimed to assess the effect of parental active/passive presence technique&#xD;
      (PAP/PPP) on the overall behavior of preschool children with different intelligence and fear&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This randomized controlled trial recruited 150 healthy children, 3-6 years old, with&#xD;
      no history of previous dental pain/treatment, IQ level ≤70 to ≤110. After sample collection,&#xD;
      in the first visit, children were stratified according to their Intelligence Quotient into 3&#xD;
      equal groups (high, average, low) in which each group was further equally and randomly&#xD;
      divided into 2 sub-groups (test and control). In the second visit, before intervention with&#xD;
      preventive measures, dental fear was assessed using facial image scale. During intervention,&#xD;
      the control sub-groups were managed using PPP technique, while the test sub-groups were&#xD;
      managed using PAP technique. Overall behavior was assessed using Frankl behavior rating scale&#xD;
      at the end of the 2nd visit. Data was analyzed using chi-square test and logistic regression&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The PAP technique had significantly higher odds of positive behavior than the PPP&#xD;
      technique (P=0.002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: Children with low intelligence showed higher dental fear and negative behavior&#xD;
      in the dental setting. PAP technique had significant positive effect on the children's&#xD;
      overall behavior with different fear and intelligence levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The design of the study was a randomized controlled clinical trial with an allocation ratio&#xD;
      of 1:1. Children enrolled in this study were stratified based on their IQ into three groups;&#xD;
      high, average and low IQ groups. In each of these three groups, children were randomly and&#xD;
      equally allocated into study and control subgroups. Thus, this study included 6 subgroups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Visual Screening and History taking were carried out to identify children who fulfilled the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria. Parental meeting was also conducted to explain the child entire research&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children were recruited from the Outpatient clinic of Pediatric Dentistry Department in&#xD;
      Faculty of Dentistry at Alexandria University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IQ test for each selected child took place in a quiet closed room (special need clinic).&#xD;
      The preventive measures were applied in the pediatric clinic of the department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first visit, children who fulfilled the inclusion/ exclusion criteria were evaluated&#xD;
      by IQ test then divided into 3 equal groups (50 children) according to their level of&#xD;
      intelligence IQ as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High IQ Children group (HIQ): with score of (110 and above)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Average IQ Children (AIQ): with score of (90-109)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Low IQ Children (LIQ)(with the normal intelligence range): with score of (70-89) In the&#xD;
           second visit, fear was measured in each group followed by random allocation into test&#xD;
           and control subgroups and then the implementation of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In each group (50 children), 25 children in subgroup S (study group) were managed&#xD;
                using Parental Active Presence (PAP) technique, while the other 25 children in&#xD;
                subgroup C (control group) were managed using Parental Passive Presence (PPP)&#xD;
                technique. Parental Active / Passive Presence technique was accompanied with&#xD;
                Tell-Show-Do (TSD) Technique (Addelston, 1959). During this management, dental&#xD;
                preventive measures were applied.&#xD;

    <description>Frankl's Behavior Rating Scale (FBRS) (Frankl, Shiere and Fogels, 1962) At the end of the second visit, after the application of preventive measures, each child overall behavior in each group was evaluated according to Frankl's Behavior Rating Scale (FBRS). It is a four group scale used to assess and evaluate the behavior of a child starting from Rating no. 1 (- -) with the most negative child behavior to Rating no. 4 (++) with the most positive child behavior.</description>

    <description>Facial Image Scale (FIS) (Buchanan and Niven, 2002) to account for fear state and is entered into the analysis as a confounder.&#xD;
Dental fear was measured in the second visit by administration of Facial Image Scale (FIS). This measurement was done to every child in each group before the start of dental treatment. It is comprised of a row of five faces ranging from very happy face to very unhappy one. Children were asked to point at which face they feel most like at that moment. The face is scored by giving a value of one to the most positive affect face and five to the most negative affect face. The faces with 1 and 2 indicated a low dental fear , while the faces with the value of 4 and 5 indicated high dental fear</description>
