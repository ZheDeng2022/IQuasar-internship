  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the main purpose for this experiments are as follows: 1. Patients with stage ⅡB-ⅢB cervical&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma who received full dose radiotherapy will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      combined TP regimen weekly treatment group and 3-week treatment group for the short-term&#xD;
      efficacy and safety observation; 2. All enrolled patients will be tested for HPV subtype&#xD;
      infection; the relationship between the sensitivity and curative effect of concurrent&#xD;
      radiotherapy and chemotherapy will be analyzed, and at the end of the test, HPV subtypes will&#xD;
      be tested again and changes will be analyzed to provide more clinical evidence for the&#xD;
      reasonable comprehensive treatment and precision medical treatment of advanced cervical&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

    <description>External radiotherapy of linear accelerator, CT simulation positioning, and intensity modulated radiotherapy will be applied for external radiotherapy. The prescribed dose is 95% PTV 45-50.8Gy/25-28 times (1.8Gy/time), the maximum and minimum in the target area do not exceed ±10% of the prescribed dose, and the increase in enlarged lymph nodes will reach 50-66GY. At the same time, the total dose of 192Ir high-dose rate intraluminal after-loading irradiation is 30-36Gy (EQD2: 40-48GY), and external pelvic irradiation is not available on the day of intraluminal after-loading irradiation.</description>
