  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increased prevalence of opioid use disorder (OUD) and associated overdoses and adverse&#xD;
      events has led to a substantial increase in the number of patients being seen at emergency&#xD;
      departments (ED). Thus, the ED may be an ideal location for identifying patients in need of&#xD;
      OUD treatment and can serve as the first touch point in the OUD continuum of care to promote&#xD;
      medication assisted treatment initiation. Contingency management (CM) is an effective method&#xD;
      for promoting treatment initiation and adherence that has not been thoroughly evaluated for&#xD;
      this purpose. The primary aim of the current study is to develop and assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of a protocol for delivering CM to increase&#xD;
      combined buprenorphine + nalaxone (referred to as BUP hereafter) initiation and continuous&#xD;
      adherence for OUD in an existing ED &quot;bridge&quot; program (e.g., Bridge plus CM; B+CM) relative to&#xD;
      standard care. Secondary objectives include identifying behavioral and neuropsychological&#xD;
      correlates to treatment outcomes, including delay discounting, reinforcer demand, and&#xD;
      neurological soft signs.&#xD;
