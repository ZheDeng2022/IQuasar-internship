      Phase 4, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      switching virologically suppressed adults living with HIV on bictegravir/tenofovir&#xD;
      alafenamide/emtricitabine to dolutegravir/lamivudine&#xD;

      Randomized, open-label, active-controlled study of virologically suppressed participants&#xD;
      living with HIV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who provide written informed consent and meet all the eligibility criteria will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 1 (n=148): FDC of DTG/3TC (50mg/300mg) administered orally, once daily (QD),&#xD;
      without regard to food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group 2 (n=74): Stay on baseline regimen consisting of FDC of B/F/TAF (50mg/200mg/&#xD;
      25mg) (taken as prescribed) without regard to food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by gender and race at entry given that this study aims to&#xD;
      enroll at least 30% of participants who are female and African American.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be responsible for using their insurance plan to obtain coverage for&#xD;
      DTG/3TC and or B/F/TAF, in addition to any labs required by the study. This expectation is&#xD;
      clearly outlined in the informed consent. The study team will work with participants to&#xD;
      minimize their co-pays for study medications and labs through the use of manufacturer and&#xD;
      other external assistance programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration will be 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants planned: Approximately 222 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population: HIV-1 infected adult participants who are virologically suppressed (HIV-1&#xD;
      RNA&lt;50 copies/mL) on FDC of B/F/TAF (50mg/200mg/ 25mg) ≥ 3 months prior to screening&#xD;
