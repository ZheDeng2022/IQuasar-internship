  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;Insul-In This Together&quot; intervention is designed for teens with Type 1 Diabetes and&#xD;
      their parents. This study seeks to evaluate an evidence-based family intervention for teens&#xD;
      with type 1 diabetes and their parents to offset the psychosocial and diabetes&#xD;
      self-management risks. This information will provide a more in-depth understanding of&#xD;
      family-based program efficacy for teens with adolescents and provide more judicious and&#xD;
      streamlined intervention options to be offered in diabetes clinics in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will collect survey and biomedical data to assess this program in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial with 165 families (including an adolescent and parent/caregiver) will be&#xD;
      enrolled, complete surveys, provide biomedical data via continuous glucose monitors and&#xD;
      receive a 6-week psychosocial intervention. The results of this study will inform future&#xD;
      intervention redesign to provide more judicious interventions to be disseminated across&#xD;
      diabetes care.This study will evaluate the relative efficacy of each of the individual&#xD;
      intervention components and also identify the mechanisms of actions (mediators) that are most&#xD;
      impacted by these types of interventions as well as most linked to long-term outcomes for&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;

    <description>The intervention group will participated in the The Insul-In This Together intervention, which consists of 6 weekly 30-minute online family sessions to discuss topics related to diabetes distress and parent-teen communication. Sessions include structured education, discussions, and skill-building activities related to parental involvement, parental monitoring, and parent-adolescent conflict. The intervention will be conducted by the PI or clinically trained research staff via Zoom. Online surveys, and glucose monitoring data will be captured at baseline and 3,6 and 12-month follow-ups. Brief surveys will also be conducted at 2-, 4-, and 6-week follow-ups (after every 2 sessions for the intervention group and later the control group). Participants will be asked to provide A1C test results that will be collected via chart review or from participants sharing their test results at baseline, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up.</description>

Brief surveys will also be conducted at 2-, 4-, and 6-week from baseline.
