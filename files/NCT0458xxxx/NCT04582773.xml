  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) affects 16 million children at any one time and is&#xD;
      responsible for the deaths of over 500,000 children under 5 years of age each year. Treatment&#xD;
      for severe acute malnutrition is based on the Community-based Management of Acute&#xD;
      Malnutrition (CMAM) model. The current methods used for detecting high risk children have not&#xD;
      prevented 5% mortality observed in regions using this program. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      provide evidence that objective methods for detecting high risk children can be used to&#xD;
      optimize efficiency of Community-based Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) treatment&#xD;
      programs and thus improve child health outcomes.&#xD;

      A prospective observational study in inpatient care within community-based management of&#xD;
      acute malnutrition(CMAM) program run by the nongovernmental organization called Alliance for&#xD;
      International Medical Action (ALIMA) within the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital,&#xD;
      Maiduguri, Nigeria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to validate the BedsidePEWS scores as a measure of severity&#xD;
      of illness in children who are treated as inpatients for severe acute malnutrition and to&#xD;
      compare the BedsidePEWS scores with other risk factors associated for mortality and relapse&#xD;
      of children with severe acute malnutrition. The design is a prospective observational study&#xD;
      of 1000 children admitted as inpatients in a CMAM program in Maidaguri Teaching Hospital in&#xD;
      Maidaguri, Nigeria. Data collection (estimated duration 4-5 months) involves vital signs, and&#xD;
      risk factor assessment every 12 hours for duration of hospitalization. Blood test for&#xD;
      hemoglobin and malaria will be done once upon admission. Outcomes will be measured every 12&#xD;
      hours and include mortality and/or escalation and de-escalation of care. Logistic regression&#xD;
      with significance testing will be used to compare BedsidePEWS scores and risk factors between&#xD;
      patients and among individual patients within the outcome categories. Exploratory sensitivity&#xD;
      analyses will repeat the main logistic regression analyses to evaluate the performance of&#xD;
      partial BedsidePEWS score in patients with missing data of 1-3 of the 7 components, by&#xD;
      randomly removing 1-3 data elements from the score calculation from patients, and by removing&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure from scoring.&#xD;
