  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multisite (but all within the UTSW IRB), observational study assessing&#xD;
      the relationship of hope to anxiety and depression, QoL, and social support over time in the&#xD;
      first year after cancer diagnosis or relapse in AYA (ages 15-29 years of age).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principal investigators' ongoing work suggests hope is a target for intervention to&#xD;
      improve quality of life (QoL) and reduce anxiety and depression (A/D) among adolescents/young&#xD;
      adults (AYA). No study to the investigators' knowledge has evaluated the promising impact of&#xD;
      hope interventions in AYA cancer patients. To address this gap, the investigators will expand&#xD;
      the investigators' prior research on hope, A/D, and QoL to AYA receiving care across three&#xD;
      diverse healthcare systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for participation within 3 months of their initial/relapse cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis. Eligible patients (and the parent/caregiver for minor patients) will be approached&#xD;
      in a private area of the clinic or hospital room to explain the research aims and informed&#xD;
      consent process. After obtaining informed consent/assent (from parents if patients are under&#xD;
      18, from AYA if patient is 18 or older), participants (patients) will utilize an iPad to&#xD;
      complete measures via Redcap.&#xD;

    <description>Hypothesis a: Greater than 50% of eligible patients will enroll and complete at least two time points in the study.&#xD;
Hypothesis b: Enrollment and study completion rates will differ by site, with the site with the most psychosocial risk (low socioeconomic status as measured by insurance type (private, public, uninsured)) having the lowest enrollment and study completion rates.&#xD;
Hypothesis c: Enrollment and study completion rates will differ by treatment type. Those receiving treatment that has the most frequent clinic/hospital visits (as measured by chemotherapy versus radiation only/surgery only) will have the highest completion rates.</description>
