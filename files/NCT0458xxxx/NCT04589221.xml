    <textblock>
      Rationale: Oral processing behaviours (i.e. eating rate, bite size, chews per bite) play an&#xD;
      important role in the onset of satiation and satiety and laboratory studies have shown that&#xD;
      people who eat quickly consume more energy during an ad libitum meal. Therefore, one possible&#xD;
      approach to control the energy intake is to encourage eating behaviour that slow the rate of&#xD;
      calorie intake of the meal. Numerous studies that use external cues and prompts to change the&#xD;
      eating rate (e.g. utensil, devices) have shown to produce clinically meaningful results.&#xD;
      However, the long-term efficacy of these external manipulation to eating rate remains unclear&#xD;
      and have difficulties in adherence. Texture led changes to oral processing behaviours&#xD;
      therefore offer an exciting opportunity to adapt an individual's response to structure&#xD;
      properties of the food being consumed in a way that maintains the associated eating&#xD;
      experience and satiety from food intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no studies to date have investigated how differences food processing influence food&#xD;
      texture characteristics and oral processing behaviour and the subsequent impact on energy&#xD;
      intake for commonly consumed meals. The proposed study will explore the impact of food&#xD;
      texture and oral processing characteristics on energy intake for the minimally-processed and&#xD;
      ultra-processed foods or meals, to explore the impact of food processing on texture, oral&#xD;
      processing and energy intakes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objectives of the study are to characterise the differences in sensory&#xD;
      perception, and oral processing behaviours (i.e. eating rate, bite size, chew per bite, oral&#xD;
      exposure time etc.) of foods and meals that differ in their degree of processing (Part 1),&#xD;
      and to further investigate how texture-based differences in oral processing behaviour&#xD;
      influence ad-libitum energy intake (Part 2). This study is also aimed to see how is the&#xD;
      texture-based differences in oral processing behaviour modified by degree of food processing&#xD;
      (i.e. un-, minimally-processed, processed and ultra-processed foods) (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Part 1) Randomised non-blinded feeding trial where participants taste up to 48&#xD;
      food items over 3 test sessions; Part 2) 2x2 randomised crossover design where participants&#xD;
      receive 4 treatments (i.e. 4 test meals) over 4 test sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy females and males (n=30 for Part 1; n=50 for Part 2) aged 21-50&#xD;
      years with BMI between 18-25 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Part 1) Participants will taste and evaluate up to 48 food items over 3&#xD;
      sessions in randomised order. Session 1 involves tasting of up to 16 food items and computer&#xD;
      task to rate and evaluate their perception and health behaviour. Sessions 2-4 involve&#xD;
      evaluation of sensory characteristics, video-recordings of participants eating, and wrist&#xD;
      worn accelerometer to track wrist movement while tasting up to 48 food items.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to characterise the differences in sensory perception, and&#xD;
      oral processing behaviours (i.e. eating rate, bite size, chew per bite, oral exposure time&#xD;
      etc.) of foods and meals that differ in their degree of processing, and to further&#xD;
      investigate how texture-based differences in oral processing behaviour influence ad-libitum&#xD;
      energy intake. In addition, this study is also aimed to see how is the texture-based&#xD;
      differences in oral processing behaviour modified by degree of food processing (i.e. un-,&#xD;
      minimally-processed, processed and ultra-processed foods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 2 parts. A maximum of 30 participants will be recruited to complete Part 1&#xD;
      (1 screening session &amp; 3 test sessions); and a maximum of 50 participants will be recruited&#xD;
      to completed Part 2 (4 test sessions) of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1) Sensory perception and health behaviour for foods varying in degree of processing and&#xD;
      nutrient source will be evaluated using a Health Behaviour Questionnaire and food perception&#xD;
      and health behaviour task. Perceived sensory and oral processing behaviour differences&#xD;
      between a series of commercially available and commonly consumed foods (e.g. carrot, apple,&#xD;
      meatball, etc.) will be assessed using sensory descriptive analysis on 100mm Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS), and video recording, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2) In addition, the sensory and oral processing behaviour, satiety and ad-libitum energy&#xD;
      intake across different meals (e.g. rice with meat and vegetable, meat with potato and salad,&#xD;
      etc.) will be assessed using video recording, sensory and appetite assessment on 100mm VAS,&#xD;
      and a weighing food balance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will require participants to attend either 4.5 hours (Screening and Part&#xD;
      1), 9.5 hours (Screening and Part 2) or 12.5 hours (Screening, Parts 1 and 2). All&#xD;
      participants will be required to join for one-time screening prior to the study. Participants&#xD;
      will require to fast for three-hour (Part 1) and at least one hour (Part 2) before their&#xD;
      scheduled lunch-time test sessions. Each session will last for approximately one hour&#xD;
      (Screening, Part 1), or two hours (Part 2), as indicated accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the situation of participant dropout, the data that have been collected until the time of&#xD;
      withdrawal will be kept and analysed. The reason is to enable a complete and comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Foods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1) Commercially available and commonly consumed foods (e.g. carrot, apple, meatball,&#xD;
      etc.) Part 2) Consist of components previously tested in Part 1 and comprise foods that are&#xD;
      commercially available, safe for human consumption and prepared in line with safe hygienic&#xD;
      food preparation (e.g. rice with meat and vegetable, meat with potato and salad, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening (Session 1, 1- 1.5 hour):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential participants will be asked to give informed consent before taking part in any&#xD;
      of the research activities. Participants are to complete a screening questionnaire and to&#xD;
      taste five different basic taste solutions (sweet [sucrose, 3.2-100 mmol/L], salty [sodium&#xD;
      chloride, 3.2-100 mmol/L], bitter [caffeine, 0.25-0.79 mmol/L], sour [citric acid, 0.63-5&#xD;
      mmol/L] and umami[monosodium glutamate, 1-31.6 mmol/L]) to assess their taste discrimination&#xD;
      ability. Basic anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, skinfold measurements and&#xD;
      percentage body fat using a Bioelectrical Impedance Analyser will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successfully screened participants will proceed to complete a Health Behaviour Questionnaire&#xD;
      and taste no more than 16 samples to rate and evaluate their perception and health behaviour&#xD;
      for the foods varying in degree of processing and nutrient sources at the remaining of the&#xD;
      screening session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (3 test sessions, 1 hour each):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory and oral processing behaviour of commercially available food samples will be&#xD;
      assessed. A maximum of 30 participants will be recruited for this part of the study.&#xD;
      Participants will taste no more than 16 samples in each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to taste each food sample and evaluate on liking, familiarity and&#xD;
      the sensory attributes such as overall flavour intensity, firmness, crunchiness, chewiness,&#xD;
      saltiness and sweetness. A mandatory inter-stimulus break of one minute will be enforced&#xD;
      between each sample to reduce possible fatigue and allow time to cleanse your palate with&#xD;
      water and crackers provided. All evaluations will be administrated and collected using a&#xD;
      computer. Participants will also be video-recorded during the sessions for collection of oral&#xD;
      processing data (i.e. eating rate, bite number, bite size etc). In addition, Participants&#xD;
      will be asked to wear a wrist worn accelerometer (M5StickC ESP32-PICO Mini loT Development&#xD;
      Kit, China) on the hand they eat with to track the wrist movement while eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 (4 test sessions, 2 hour each):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensory, oral processing characteristics and ad libitum energy intake for different meals&#xD;
      will be assessed in this part. A maximum of 50 participants will be recruited for this part&#xD;
      of the study. Participants who completed Part 1 will be invited to join the Part 2, however&#xD;
      the participation is not mandatory. Participants will attend 1 session per week for four&#xD;
      consecutive weeks to evaluate up to 4 ad libitum test meal across for lunch-time sessions,&#xD;
      i.e. 1 ad libitum test meal per session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will be required to fast from 11.00 pm the evening before and refrain from&#xD;
      engaging in vigorous physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each test day, participants will be asked to arrive at CNRC between 8.00-9.00am and&#xD;
      complete a set of appetite ratings disguised as &quot;Mood Questions&quot; (pre-breakfast rating).&#xD;
      Following the pre-breakfast rating, participants will receive a standardised, fixed portion&#xD;
      breakfast and mid-morning drink/snack to take away with them and consume at fixed intervals&#xD;
      during the morning (before the lunch). The purpose is to equilibrate their appetite need&#xD;
      state ahead of the ad-libitum test meal at lunch session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will consume the breakfast within 15 minutes, after which complete a second set&#xD;
      of appetite ratings (post-breakfast ratings). Participants will refrain from consuming&#xD;
      anything except water and continue to complete the appetite rating at 15 or 30 minutes'&#xD;
      intervals, prompted with reminder set on their mobile device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After approximately 2 hours, participants will consume the mid-morning drink/ snack within 15&#xD;
      minutes. Participants will then continue to rate their appetite at 15 minute intervals before&#xD;
      coming to CNRC for their lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lunch session will be scheduled from midday onwards and will begin with a set of appetite&#xD;
      rating (pre-lunch rating). Participants will be served an ad libitum test meal (~800g to&#xD;
      1000g) along with a glass of water, and instructed to taste a mouthful of the meal and rate&#xD;
      its sensory characteristics. Participants will then be asked to consume the ad libitum test&#xD;
      meal in their normal way and to eat until comfortably full. Participants' eating behaviour at&#xD;
      lunch will be recorded in order to analyse and behaviourally code their oral processing&#xD;
      behaviour (i.e. eating rate, bite number, bite size etc). In addition, Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to wear a wrist worn accelerometer on the hand they eat with to track the wrist&#xD;
      movement while eating. After completed eating, participants will be required to complete&#xD;
      post-lunch appetite ratings at 15minutes interval for 90minutes, and bring a food diary home&#xD;
      for recording their food and beverage intake for the rest of the test day.&#xD;
