  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to prospectively compare the standard supine (control group) and the&#xD;
      semi-sitting position (head elevation of 30°; intervention group) in endoscopic endonasal&#xD;
      pituitary surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endonasal endoscopic approach (EEA) for pituitary surgery is standardly performed with&#xD;
      the patient in supine position (SP). The semi-sitting position (SSP) is routinely used for&#xD;
      the traditional microscopic transsphenoidal approach and also for posterior fossa surgery.&#xD;
      The SSP results in lower intracranial pressure when compared to the supine position due to&#xD;
      decreased venous congestion. As a result, intraoperative bleeding may be reduced, potentially&#xD;
      leading to decreased surgical morbidity and improved surgical workflow. Studies during&#xD;
      endoscopic sinus surgery have shown a significant reduction of blood loss when the patient is&#xD;
      placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position with a head elevation of 30°. This study is to&#xD;
      prospectively compare the standard supine (control group) and the semi-sitting position (head&#xD;
      elevation of 30°; intervention group) in endoscopic endonasal pituitary surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will be placed in semi-sitting position. To achieve the semi-sitting position, the patient is placed in supine position. The operating table is then separated and flexed to elevate the torso (angle of 30°). The head, which is fixed in a head clamp, is slightly flexed to bring the floor of the sella right in front of the surgeon and gently rotated toward the operating team.</description>
