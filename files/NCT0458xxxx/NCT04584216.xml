    <textblock>
      A prospective study is conducted to evaluate the effect of the steam eye mask with acupoints&#xD;
      stimulation on eye fatigue and dry eye symptoms in VDT users. The effects and safety of the&#xD;
      single therapy by the moist heat of approximately 40 degree C for 20 minutes with eyebrows&#xD;
      acupoints massage for the first 3 minutes are evaluated in the single application study, and&#xD;
      the effects and safety of the repeated therapy by the moist heat applied and massage&#xD;
      acupoints on eyebrows once per working day for two weeks are evaluated in the repeated&#xD;
      application study.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of symptoms and mood state (Visual Analog Scale, VAS) evaluated by participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The severity of symptoms and mood state are evaluated using a VAS by each participant. A VAS is a horizontal line, 100mm in length, anchored by word descriptors at each end. Participants mark on the line the point that they feel their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring the length from the left hand end of the line to the point that they mark. The five symptoms to be evaluated are: tiredness of eyes, dryness of eyes, grittiness of eyes, blurred vision, and ocular discomfort. Each symptom is relieved as the VAS score decreases. The mood states to be evaluated are: relaxation and comfort. Each mood state is enhanced as the VAS score increases.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The computer visual syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) evaluated by participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>19 days</time_frame>
    <description>The computer vision syndrome questionnaire (CVS-Q) is applied to evaluate the visual health of workers exposed to the computer screen. This questionnaire consists of sixteen items with the response options of the severity (frequency and intensity) of each particular symptom and the overall symptom severity (CVS score). The score of each ocular discomfort is calculated by the frequency multiplies the intensity. The frequency for each symptom is answered by the subject as never, occasionally, and often/always which are coded as 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The intensity is defined for two options as 1 for moderate and 2 for intense, respectively. Moreover, the score obtained for each item will then be coded as 1 while the multiplied score is 1 or 2; and 2 while the multiplied score is 4. The results can be compared between different individuals or in the same individual at different times and circumstances. The higher score a subject gained, the worsen ocular condition he/she experienced.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The quality of life (Dry-Eye-Related Quality of Life Score, DEQS) evaluated by participants.</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Dry-Eye-Related Quality of Life Score can assess various aspects of Quality of Life including its mental aspect. This questionnaire consists of 15 items related to dry eye symptoms(0 to 4, 0 as never, the less score as mild) and influence(1-4, the less score as rare) on daily life, and the overall degree of Quality of Life Score impairment is calculated as a summary score. The subject also grades the overall for the past week, including subject's eye symptoms and how they have affected subject's daily life, it will be graded from 1 to 6, the lower score means the subject is in better condition. DEQS score is decreased as Quality of Life Score is improved.</description>

    <measure>Staining of ocular surface evaluated by an examiner</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Ocular surface damage is assessed by staining cornea and conjunctiva. The liquid of fluorescein is instilled by the micropipette to stain the ocular surface. The staining of ocular surface is graded on a scale of 0 to 3 on the cornea and both areas of the conjunctiva, and then summed (Total range in 0-9 points) for each eye, according to the van Bijsterveld system.</description>
