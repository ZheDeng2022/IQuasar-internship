  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, the use of Extracorporeal Blood Purification (EBP) in everyday clinical practice&#xD;
      is becoming increasingly common, particularly in critical care settings. The efficacy of most&#xD;
      of these treatments on removal of inflammatory mediators is the main rationale behind the use&#xD;
      of EBP in critically ill patients with multiorgan dysfunction. Nonetheless, there are still&#xD;
      some doubts as to the clinical efficacy of bacterial toxins and cytokines removal and many&#xD;
      clinical trials aiming at exploring the effect of EBP on long-term outcomes of septic&#xD;
      patients have failed to demonstrate consistent results regarding 28 day- or&#xD;
      hospital-mortality rates. The primary aim of this observational prospective web-based&#xD;
      registry is to define the possible clusters of critically ill patients - treated with&#xD;
      extracorporeal blood purification therapies worldwide - who are homogeneous regarding both&#xD;
      clinical and treatment characteristics and seem to benefit the most from EBP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since May 2019, our research group has developed, implemented, and nationally spread the&#xD;
      &quot;ARRT registry&quot; with the aim to describe the subpopulations of critically ill patients that&#xD;
      benefit the most from EBP therapy with oXiris (6). The project is currently ongoing,&#xD;
      involving more than 50 centers in Italy, with data from more than 65 patients treated with&#xD;
      oXiris. Differently from other registries, the ARRT registry runs on a web-based platform&#xD;
      easily accessible from internet-based technologies, including smartphones, that offers a&#xD;
      user-friendly approach, facilitates data uploading, and enhances research collaboration.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it adopts a proactive approach, in the sense that it includes several automatic&#xD;
      calculators and decision support tools that might help clinicians to personalize treatments&#xD;
      directly at the bedside (e.g. automatic calculation of clinical scoring systems, ideal body&#xD;
      weight, mechanical ventilation setting, antibiotic adjustment according to renal function,&#xD;
      etc.). All these tools can provide the clinician with real-time feedbacks. This web-based&#xD;
      registry provides a clear example of translational medicine and translational research where&#xD;
      data from clinical practice feed a database for clinical research and, contemporaneously, the&#xD;
      database research tools improve clinical practice. Finally, this web-based registry allows&#xD;
      each participating center to instantaneously evaluate its own data and obtain real-time basic&#xD;
      statistics for each recorded variable (e.g. age at enrollment, main comorbidities, baseline&#xD;
      serum creatinine, mortality rate, rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria, etc.), thus allowing&#xD;
      for continuous monitoring of outcomes and local practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, these features may prove particularly useful during treatment of critically ill&#xD;
      septic patients with multiorgan dysfunction. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has been&#xD;
      characterized by high prevalence of patients with severe multiorgan dysfunction, high&#xD;
      mortality rate, lack of ICU resources, and the need for ICU discharge in a rapid, but safe,&#xD;
      manner. The association between acute kidney injury and COVID-19 infection is well&#xD;
      established. Organ crosstalk and systemic inflammation are the most accredited causes of&#xD;
      Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in these patients. Several EBP therapies have been proposed to&#xD;
      attenuate systemic inflammation and/or support renal function in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, no data is currently available on application and feasibility of EBP therapies&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients or on their outcomes. Notably, the ARRT registry was able to effectively&#xD;
      capture clinical data on systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and outcomes in patients&#xD;
      treated with oXiris during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. In this regard, the implementation&#xD;
      of a similar registry at the global level might prove effective for supporting clinicians&#xD;
      involved in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 infection and multiorgan dysfunction&#xD;
      worldwide.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria: patients who meet all the following inclusion criteria may be included&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Admission to ICU&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Indications for at least one of the following extracorporeal blood purification&#xD;
             treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) / Intermittent Hemodialysis (IHD) /&#xD;
                  Hybrid therapies for renal support/replacement;&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Immunomodulation therapy in critically ill patients using hemodiafilters with&#xD;
                  larger pore sizes characterized by enhanced transmembrane clearance of larger&#xD;
                  molecules (such as cytokines), hemodiafilters with enhanced unselective&#xD;
                  absorption of cytokines and/or endotoxins, cartridges with enhanced absorption of&#xD;
                  cytokines and/or endotoxins, techniques aimed at improving extracorporeal removal&#xD;
                  of cytokines and/or endotoxins.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It should be underlined that the lack of established guidelines on the use of membranes for&#xD;
        extracorporeal blood purification (and on RRTs in general) leads to variability in clinical&#xD;
        practice and treatments are initiated in accordance with the judgement of the responsible&#xD;
        physician. Under these circumstances, it is preferable to keep inclusion criteria as wide&#xD;
        as possible so as to obtain a real picture of clinical practice worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria: besides contraindications to the use of the EBP adopted (as from the&#xD;
        manual of instructions), there are no exclusion criteria.&#xD;
