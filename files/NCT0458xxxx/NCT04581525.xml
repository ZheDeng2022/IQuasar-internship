  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine whether a form of non-invasive brain stimulation can help reduce pain&#xD;
      in people with persistent neuropathic pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at the effects of a painless, non-invasive form of brain stimulation,&#xD;
      called transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. tDCS is thought to increase the&#xD;
      brain's ability to change. Participants will be assigned to one of three groups by chance.&#xD;
      Two groups will receive tDCS at a level expected to increase the brain's ability to change,&#xD;
      while the other group will receive tDCS at a level not thought to affect the brain's ability&#xD;
      to change.&#xD;

    <description>This self-reported assessment measures intensity and quality of pain. Scores can range from 0 to 45. A decrease in score indicates an improvement in pain.</description>

    <description>This self-reported assessment provides information regarding an individual's perception of their health and quality of life. Scores range from 0 to 100. An increase in score indicates an improvement in perceived health and quality of life.</description>
