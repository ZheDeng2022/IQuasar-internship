  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are more than one million (&gt; 40,000 cases per year in France) of osteoarticular&#xD;
      infections (OAI) yearly in the world. The number of these infections is constantly increasing&#xD;
      due to an increase in life expectancy associated with an increase in prosthesis fitting, as&#xD;
      well as an increase in comorbid factors. These are severe pathologies associated with&#xD;
      mortality (5%) and significant morbidity (40%), responsible for functional sequelae with an&#xD;
      individual cost (prolonged hospitalization, altered quality of life, disability) and societal&#xD;
      (sick leave, partial disability). or total, temporary or permanent) extremely high. In&#xD;
      addition, reinfection rates within two years of treatment are high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BJIs are a group of clinical entities that have in common the invasion and progressive&#xD;
      destruction of bone and cartilage tissue by bacterial-like microorganisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staphylococcus spp is the main pathogen (&gt;50%) in BJI and is associated with particularly&#xD;
      difficult to treat infections, with a high rate of chronicity and relapses, especially in&#xD;
      case of implanted material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difficulty in managing these infections is partly linked, on the one hand, to the fact&#xD;
      that the pathogens are in &quot;persistent&quot; metabolic forms and in intracellular reservoirs which&#xD;
      make them insensitive to conventional antibiotics and, on the other hand, the absence of&#xD;
      reliable markers of the infection and above all of its clinical resolution, which complicates&#xD;
      clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESPRI-IOAC is a consortium of 4 partners (private-public) from Lyon area and which aims at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  studying the translational value of BJI preclinical models&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identifying biomarkers of infection in preclinical models and at assessing them in a&#xD;
           prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is part of the global ESPRI-IOAC consortium, and represent the clinical&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a prospective study of patients treated for BJI in the infectious disease department of&#xD;
      the Hospices Civils de Lyon, La Croix-Rousse, for osteo-articular infections due to&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus, or for simple mechanical revision or for cruciate ligament surgery,&#xD;
      the objective of which is to highlight biomarkers of interest in the diagnosis of chronic BJI&#xD;
      and, or predictive of the therapeutic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The translational value of the experimental models used in the BJI will also be studied.&#xD;
