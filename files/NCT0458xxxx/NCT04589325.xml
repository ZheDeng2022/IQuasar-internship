  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the clinical onset of type 1 diabetes (T1D) is acute, the progression of T1D occurs&#xD;
      over many years often in a patchy manner with inflammation in certain lobes of the pancreas,&#xD;
      leaving other lobes unaffected and long-lasting beta cells remain functional decades after&#xD;
      diagnosis. Psoriasis share several aspects with T1D, e.g. the patchy inflammatory infiltrate&#xD;
      consisting of tissue-resident memory (TRM) T cells, leaky blood vessels that facilitate&#xD;
      leukocyte migration and the increased risk for systemic conditions. Moreover, interleukin&#xD;
      (IL)-17 has shown to be increased in both persons with psoriasis and T1D. Activation of&#xD;
      IL-17/IL-22 pathway is viewed to be both a hallmark of psoriasis and human T1D. Ixekizumab,&#xD;
      an anti-IL17 biological agent, has shown marked therapeutic value in the treatment of&#xD;
      subjects with psoriasis in several randomized trials and is currently an approved clinical&#xD;
      therapy. Due to the many similarities in the current view of pathogenesis and manifestation&#xD;
      of T1D and psoriasis it is possible that Ixekizumab can also influence the disease process of&#xD;
      T1D.&#xD;

      In this double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective trial, patients with newly diagnosed T1D&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either Ixekizumab or placebo in addition to their conventional&#xD;
      therapy. The primary aim is to examine the effect of Ixekizumab on endogenous insulin&#xD;
      production when administered to persons with newly diagnosed T1D. The planned study duration&#xD;
      is 52 weeks with an extension phase for 3 years and includes 127 patients at 19 centers in&#xD;
      Sweden. During the extension phase the participants will be examined during a visit after 1&#xD;
      and 3 years after the end of the study regarding insulin production (C-peptide and proinsulin&#xD;
      secretion during a Mixed Meal Tolerance Test), glycaemic control, T1D auto-antibodies and&#xD;
      insulin doses.&#xD;
