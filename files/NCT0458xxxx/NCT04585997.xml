  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mepolizumab is an anti-interleukin-5 ( IL-5) monoclonal antibody that neutralizes IL-5 and&#xD;
      reduces eosinophil counts in both sputum and blood. Omalizumab is an anti-immunoglobulin E&#xD;
      (IgE) monoclonal antibody (mAb) used in the treatment of severe allergic eosinophilic asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that in patients with the dual phenotypes of severe allergic and&#xD;
      eosinophilic asthma, that Mepolizumab is as effective as Omalizumab. However, this trial will&#xD;
      also identify key clinical biomarkers that will clarify which patients will respond best to&#xD;
      each of these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be the first direct clinical comparison of these agents and will apply expert&#xD;
      clinical characterization, along with cutting edge biotechnology to better inform treatment&#xD;
      choices for severe asthma. This is an important and urgent management problem facing the&#xD;
      Australian pharmaceutical scheme, where imprecision in prescribing will result in reduced&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness as well as substantial and sustained costs.&#xD;

      'Choosebetweenamab' will compare active treatment arms (Mepolizumab and Omalizumab) for&#xD;
      efficacy and adverse events in a Phase 4, parallel arm, randomized controlled trail setting&#xD;
      with computer generated randomization (permuted block randomization, with block sizes of 4 or&#xD;
      6, stratified by baseline eosinophil count using a median split). There is no placebo&#xD;
      control. Particpants will not be blinded but masking will be used for people assessing&#xD;
      outcomes and analyzing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      'Chossebetweenamab' will also include a secondary outcome substudy (ISS 11066) to assess&#xD;
      biomarkers of efficacy response to treatment using single cell sequencing of peripheral blood&#xD;
      cells. Blood samples are taken from the randomized patients in each treatment arm&#xD;
      (Mepolizumab and Omalizumab) at baseline and gene expression changes assessed using&#xD;
      transcriptomic single cell sequencing of patient white blood cells. The data generated from&#xD;
      this will be compared to the clinical outcomes of 'Choosebetweenamab' at all follow-up time&#xD;
      points. Single cell gene expression and cell type cluster patterning will be compared to the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes to identify baseline predictors (gene and cell type) of&#xD;
      treatment efficacy.&#xD;
