  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of virtual reality after scoliosis surgery&#xD;
      in pediatric patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To evaluate postoperative pain scores and postoperative opioid use in pediatric&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis surgical patients using virtual reality (VR) as a method of immersive&#xD;
      distraction compared with standard electronic use postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Patients age 11-17 undergoing idiopathic scoliosis surgery on Enhanced Recovery&#xD;
      After Surgery (ERAS) spine protocol at our institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Participants will be randomized to intervention arm (VR) or control arm&#xD;
      (iPad). Baseline pain and anxiety scores will be assessed. On postoperative day 1, each&#xD;
      patient will receive a visit by the research assistant who will assess pain scores, PCA use,&#xD;
      etc. The intervention group will be offered a VR device for up to 30 minutes. The control&#xD;
      group will be offered an iPad for up to 30 minutes. This visit will be performed twice on&#xD;
      postoperative day 1. Follow up survey will be conducted at 48-72 hours and 7-10 days&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;

It contains 6 statements (i.e., 'I feel calm', with 1=Not at all, 2=Somewhat, 3=Moderately, 4=Very much). Scores range from 6-24, with 6 signifying no anxiety and 24 points signifying the highest level of anxiety. Higher score indicates a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Patient Satisfaction at 48-72 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>At approximately 48-72 hours postoperatively</time_frame>
    <description>To assess patient satisfaction, qualitative satisfaction will be documented. Patient satisfaction and overall experience are commonly linked to pain experienced during a hospitalization, and as a result, satisfaction with the use of VR as a method of pain control will be one of the outcomes. Patients will simply be asked by the researcher assistant, qualitatively, how satisfied they were with their experience with the device, and their comments will be recorded. Collected answers will be divided into positive and negative comments, and any emerging themes will be identified.</description>
