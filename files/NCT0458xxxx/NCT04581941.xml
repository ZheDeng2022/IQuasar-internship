  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is an effective therapy for patients with medically refractory&#xD;
      essential tremor. However, DBS programming is not standardized and multiple clinic visits are&#xD;
      frequently required to adequately control symptoms. The investigators aim to longitudinally&#xD;
      record brain signals from patients using a novel neurostimulator that can record brain&#xD;
      signals. The investigators will correlate brain signals to clinical severity scores to&#xD;
      identify pathological rhythms in the absence of DBS, and we will study the effects of DBS on&#xD;
      these signals in order to guide clinical programming.&#xD;

      The development of newer technologies has allowed clinicians and researchers to better&#xD;
      understand pathophysiological underpinnings of different disorders managed with&#xD;
      neuromodulation. The is now the ability to stream brain signals from a newly FDA approved&#xD;
      device, the Medtronic Percept. The investigators will study the longitudinal effects of DBS&#xD;
      on the brain signals that are found to correlate with tremor severity as measured with&#xD;
      wireless wearable sensors.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with essential tremor who have clinically been deemed candidates for DBS (Deep Brain Stimulation) surgery. Deep brain stimulation is an FDA approved therapy that involves surgical implantation of electrodes in deep brain targets and an implantable pulse generator delivers electrical pulses. This intervention is not part of the study. The investigators are going to recruit patients who receive the Medtronic Percept device, which allows for brain signal recordings (this feature is FDA approved). The investigators will be conducting an observational study using this device to collect data that the subjects receive as standard of care.</description>
