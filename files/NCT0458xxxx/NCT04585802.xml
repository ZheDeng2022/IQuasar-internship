    <textblock>
      A new approach to investigate suicidal processes belongs to the broader neurocognitive&#xD;
      picture and are so-called implicit associations. In dual process models of information&#xD;
      processing a second functioning mode, the automatic processing mode, complements the&#xD;
      conscious processing. Suicidal persons tend to have a stronger implicit association with&#xD;
      &quot;death&quot; than non-suicidal persons. In this study, implicit associations between different&#xD;
      unconscious cognitive constructs are compared among suicidal and non-suicidal patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, an adapted version of the computer-based reaction time task (IAT-S) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four different versions of IATs are tested in this study. In the first version the implicit&#xD;
      association between &quot;self / others&quot; and &quot;death / life&quot; is assessed (1). The second and third&#xD;
      version measures the emotional evaluation of &quot;death&quot; (2) and &quot;life&quot; (3). In addition, in the&#xD;
      fourth version the implicit association between death / life and internal / external locus of&#xD;
      control is assessed (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implicit associations of these four IAT-S versions are compared between three groups:&#xD;
      patients with suicidal behavior, patients with suicidal ideation, and a clinical group&#xD;
      without previous suicide attempts and without suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following hypotheses are made: in all four versions of the IAT-S, patients with previous&#xD;
      suicidal behavior will have stronger implicit associations: between &quot;self&quot; and &quot;death&quot; as&#xD;
      well as &quot;death&quot; and &quot;internal locus of control&quot; compared to all other groups. With a more&#xD;
      &quot;positive&quot; evaluation of &quot;death&quot; and a more &quot;negative&quot; evaluation of &quot;life&quot; than all other&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, four versions of the suicide-specific implicit association tests (IAT-S) are&#xD;
      carried out. Previous studies have shown that suicidal persons have stronger associations&#xD;
      between the constructs &quot;self&quot; and &quot;death&quot;. Furthermore, the strength of these implicit&#xD;
      associations increases the risk of suicidal behavior in the follow-up period of six months by&#xD;
      a factor of six. In these previous studies, the implicit &quot;self-death association&quot; (the&#xD;
      so-called death-identity bias) was investigated. This study will additionally examine an&#xD;
      implicit emotional evaluation (death-evaluation-bias). Therefore, two new versions of the&#xD;
      IAT-S, which measure how death vs. life are emotionally evaluated, are being tested. In&#xD;
      addition, a fourth version of the IAT-S was added and aims to clarify the implicit&#xD;
      association between death / life and internal / external locus of control. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that an internal locus of control is a protective factor and an external locus of&#xD;
      control a risk factor for suicide attempts. In the present study, these four IAT-S versions&#xD;
      are carried out with different groups of patients: patients with a suicide attempt (1),&#xD;
      patients with suicide ideation (2) and patients with neither a suicide attempt nor suicide&#xD;
      ideation (3). This cross sectional design allows us to test for group differences in regard&#xD;
      to unconscious implicit associations. Hypothesis are described separately for each version of&#xD;
      the IAT-S.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death association: patients in group 1 will have a higher implicit association between self&#xD;
      and death than patients in group 2 and that patients in group 2 have a significantly higher&#xD;
      implicit association between self and death than patients in group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death evaluation: patients in group 1 will have more &quot;positive&quot; evaluations of &quot;death&quot; than&#xD;
      patients in group 2 and patients in group 2 have a more &quot;positive&quot; evaluations of death than&#xD;
      patients in group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Locus of control: patients in group 1 will have a stronger association between internal locus&#xD;
      of control and death (a) and external locus of control and life (b) than patients in group 2,&#xD;
      and that patients in group 2 have a significantly stronger association between internal locus&#xD;
      of control and death (a) and external locus of control and life (b) than patients in group 3.&#xD;
