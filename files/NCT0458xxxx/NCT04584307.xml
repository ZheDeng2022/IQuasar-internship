      The purpose of this clinical trial is to examine the role of an immune modulatory drug (IMID)&#xD;
      in combination with elotuzumab, in a lenalidomide-free approach to maintenance therapy&#xD;
      following second unplanned autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT) for&#xD;
      relapsed multiple myeloma.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a diagnosis of relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma who will&#xD;
             be undergoing a second unplanned autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant for&#xD;
             their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health&#xD;
             information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or obtained&#xD;
             separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2 within 14 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have had measurable disease, defined as one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  monoclonal protein (M-protein): ≥ 0.5g/dL on serum protein electrophoresis or ≥&#xD;
                  200 mg of monoclonal protein on a 24-hour urine protein or involved serum light&#xD;
                  chain ≥ 10 mg/dl at time of relapse, leading to decision to proceed to&#xD;
                  transplant; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  biopsy proven plasmacytoma that can be assessed by physical exam or imaging; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  if non-secretory, ≥10% plasma cells on BM biopsy/aspirate at time of relapse or&#xD;
                  plasmacytoma as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  NOTE: Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) (on a 24-h collection) is required, no&#xD;
             substitute method is acceptable. Urine must be assessed to establish response if the&#xD;
             baseline urine M-spike is ≥ 200 mg/24 h at the time of enrollment. Please note that if&#xD;
             both serum and urine M-components are present prior to transplant, both should be&#xD;
             assessed in order to evaluate response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received any number and type of previous treatments for myeloma&#xD;
             including elotuzumab or pomalidomide, but not simultaneous administration of these two&#xD;
             agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous allogeneic transplant is allowed provided the patient is not receiving&#xD;
             ongoing therapy for GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous CAR-T transplantation or other BMCA directed therapy is also allowed provided&#xD;
             there is no evidence of residual cytokine release syndrome or cytokine release&#xD;
             encephalopathy syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject&#xD;
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pomalidomide will not be provided the study and therefore study subjects must have&#xD;
             confirmed access to pomalidomide for use during the study established at time of&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Furthermore, subjects must meet all of the following applicable inclusion criteria 45-90&#xD;
        days post-transplant to be treated on this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from transplantation to ≤grade 2 non- hematologic&#xD;
             toxicity, with the exception of alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of progression of myeloma noted within 45 days post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Demonstrate adequate organ function as defined in the protocol; all screening labs to&#xD;
             be obtained within 14 days prior to initiation of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have two negative pregnancy tests (serum or&#xD;
             urine): within 14 days and 24 hours prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential unless they are surgically&#xD;
             sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are&#xD;
             naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential and males must be willing to abstain from&#xD;
             heterosexual activity or to use 2 forms of effective methods of contraception from the&#xD;
             time of informed consent until 5 months for females, and 7 months for males after&#xD;
             treatment discontinuation. The two contraception methods can be comprised of two&#xD;
             barrier methods, or a barrier method plus a hormonal method. Interventions such as&#xD;
             IUD, tubal ligation, hormonal (birth control pills, injections, hormonal patches,&#xD;
             vaginal rings, or implants), or partner's vasectomy, all count as one method. For&#xD;
             WOCBP, a second form must also be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject&#xD;
             to understand and comply with study procedures for the entire length of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be willing to provide BM, stool and blood samples during the study&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known additional malignancy that is active and/or progressive requiring treatment;&#xD;
             exceptions include basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical or&#xD;
             bladder cancer, or other cancer for which the subject has been disease-free for at&#xD;
             least three years. Patients who have undergone a curative procedure for another&#xD;
             malignancy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active central nervous system (CNS) metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with any investigational drug within 30 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned transplant is considered part of tandem approach for newly diagnosed MM&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe hypersensitivity reaction to any monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pomalidomide is an agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with pomalidomide, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with pomalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history of testing positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
             or known acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) might be enrolled if the viral load&#xD;
             by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is undetectable with/without active treatment and&#xD;
             absolute lymphocyte count &gt;= 350/ul. Such subjects may stay on antiviral therapy&#xD;
             during study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a positive test for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBV sAg) or&#xD;
             hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV antibody) indicating acute or chronic&#xD;
             infection might be enrolled if the viral load by PCR is undetectable with/without&#xD;
             active treatment. Such patients may stay on viral therapy while on treatment.&#xD;
