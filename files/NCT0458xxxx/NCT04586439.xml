&#xD;
          -  A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive&#xD;
             serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG]) pregnancy test at screening and a&#xD;
             negative urine pregnancy test on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm after enrollment (Day 1) in the&#xD;
             study and a female participant must agree not to donate eggs (ova, oocytes) during the&#xD;
