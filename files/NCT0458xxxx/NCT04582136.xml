    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-center, double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2&#xD;
      clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in patients with active&#xD;
      systemic lupus erythematosus despite receiving standard background therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six large rheumatological referring centers across from China will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two phases. The first phase is a 24-week randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, from which the primary end point will be generated,&#xD;
      and the second phase is a 24-week open-labeled extension trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study enrolls SLE patients between 18~65 years old who have SLEDAI-2K score ≥4 (not&#xD;
      including scores for anti-dsDNA antibody and hypocomplementemia), despite conventional&#xD;
      treatment (e.g., immunosuppressants, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs,&#xD;
      anti-hypertensive drugs, and/or topical medications). In addition, subjects must be&#xD;
      serologically active (positive anti-dsDNA antibody and/or hypocomplementemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomly assigned by 1:1 ratio to receive sirolimus (1.5mg/day) or placebo&#xD;
      for the first 24-week phase. In the second 24-week open-labeled phase, sirolimus patients&#xD;
      receive the same dose of sirolimus, and placebo group are switched to receive sirolimus at&#xD;
      1.5mg/day&#xD;

    <description>The SLEDAI-2K is an established, validated SLE activity index. It is based on the presence of 24 features in 9 organ systems and measures disease activity in SLE patients in the previous 30 days. It is weighted according to the feature. Features are scored by the assessing physician if present within the last 30 days with more severe features having higher scores, and then simply added to determine the total SLEDAI 2K score, which ranges from 0 to 105, with higher scores representing increased disease activity.</description>

BILAG: assesses disease extent, severity (range: A [severe] to E [no disease]). SLEDAI-2K: assesses improvement in disease activity (range: 0 to 105; higher score = higher severity). PGA: assesses worsening in participant's general health status (0.0= 'no lupus activity' to 10.0 = 'extremely active lupus').</description>
