    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) the severity of&#xD;
      periodontal disease is significantly higher compared to patients without OSA in every aspect,&#xD;
      including PI, PD, CAL and BOP. The number of lost teeth is hypothesized to be also higher in&#xD;
      patients with obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: evaluation of periodontal status in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analytical cross-sectional study will be conducted at the Department of Therapeutic&#xD;
      Dentistry of the Sechenov University, Moscow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators are planning to recruit 150 patients: 1) patients with OSA confirmed by&#xD;
      polysomnography -75 participants aged between 35 and 65; 2) patients without OSA -75&#xD;
      participants of a similar age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be sub-divided into three sub-groups&#xD;
      according to OSA severity: 2A group - patients with mild apnea severity; 2B group - patients&#xD;
      with medium apnea severity; 2C group - patients with severe apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will undergo a dental examination including the following parameters: plaque&#xD;
      index (PI; Silness &amp; Loe, 1964), bleeding on probing (BOP), and touch depth of the pocket&#xD;
      (PD), the level of clinical attachment loss (CAL). Investigators will also evaluate the&#xD;
      number of lost teeth.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a chronic inflammatory disease which is associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of many diseases, including bone and cardiovascular disease (Adamkiewicz et al., 2018).&#xD;
      The high prevalence and severity of periodontal inflammatory diseases is a current problem in&#xD;
      dentistry. A growing body of literature suggests that there is a link between periodontitis&#xD;
      and systemic diseases. Nevertheless a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established&#xD;
      yet for most of the diseases, and the mediators of the association are still being identified&#xD;
      (Bui et al., 2019). In recent years, several studies have revealed a possible link between&#xD;
      periodontitis and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The main oral symptom of OSA is dry mouth&#xD;
      due to oral breathing, which is a significant risk factor for periodontal disease. Chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis is characterized by the destruction of the supporting tissues of the teeth&#xD;
      through complex cascades of inflammatory responses, and OSA seems to share common pathways,&#xD;
      acting synergistically (Ryan Price et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the periodontal health in patients with obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (OSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within an analytical cross-sectional study 150 patients will be examined: 75 patients with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnoea and 75 patients without OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of sleep apnea will be set after the standard polysomnography in the Domino&#xD;
      program. The severity of OSA will be determined according to AHI index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be sub-divided into three groups&#xD;
      according to sleep apnea severity: 2A group - patients with mild sleep apnea severity; 2B&#xD;
      group - patients with medium sleep apnea severity; 3ะก group - patients with severe sleep&#xD;
      apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After confirming the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea patients undergo dental&#xD;
      examination. Investigators will use a manual periodontal probe to provide basic periodontal&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of plaque accumulated in cervical part of the teeth will be registered by the&#xD;
      plaque index (PI; Silness &amp; Loe, 1964). The activity of the inflammation will be assessed&#xD;
      with use of Bleeding on probing index (BOP). The Pocket Touch Depth (PD) will and the level&#xD;
      of clinical attachment loss (CAL) will be recorded. The number of lost teeth will also be&#xD;
      estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risk factors for periodontal disease will also be evaluated (body weight index&#xD;
      (BMI), smoker status).&#xD;
