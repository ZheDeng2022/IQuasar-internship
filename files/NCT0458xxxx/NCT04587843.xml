      Contrave (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) extended-release tablet is an approved drug and&#xD;
      indicated to be used with a low calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic&#xD;
      weight management in obese adults (BMI 30 Kg/m2 or greater) or overweight adults (BMI 27&#xD;
      Kg/m2 or greater) with at least one weight related condition such as hypertension or&#xD;
      diabetes. It is unknown how many or which medical treatments for weight loss, such as&#xD;
      Contrave work in the subjects who have had bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Contrave combined with usual&#xD;
      care (dietary and behaviour counselling) compared to placebo with usual care, in patients who&#xD;
      have inadequate weight loss or significant weight regain following bariatric surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with increased mortality and morbidity and represents a worldwide&#xD;
      epidemic that is increasing in prevalence and remains a significant problem in Canada and a&#xD;
      burden on our healthcare system. Maintaining long-term weight loss is the &quot;Achilles' heel&quot; of&#xD;
      obesity therapy. Treatment for obesity with surgery is increasing because it has been shown&#xD;
      to produce the best results for long-term weight loss and improving obesity related risk&#xD;
      factors and diseases. But, these benefits are often reduced by inadequate weight loss or by&#xD;
      weight regain in many patients after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrave (naltrexone HCl and bupropion HCl) extended-release tablet is an approved drug and&#xD;
      indicated to be used with a low calorie diet and increased physical activity for chronic&#xD;
      weight management in obese adults (BMI 30 Kg/m2 or greater) or overweight adults (BMI 27&#xD;
      Kg/m2 or greater) with at least one weight related condition such as hypertension or&#xD;
      diabetes. It is unknown how many or which medical treatments for weight loss, such as&#xD;
      Contrave work in the subjects who have had bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 1 year, phase 4, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study&#xD;
      that will be conducted across multiple Bariatric Centres of Excellence (BCoE) in Ontario.&#xD;
      Consenting participants will be randomly assigned to receive Contrave with usual care&#xD;
      (dietary and behaviour counselling) or placebo with usual care. All subjects will also&#xD;
      continue to receive usual care. The study includes several follow up visits to assess safety&#xD;
      and treatment effects, some in person and others by telephone or video conferencing. Body&#xD;
      weight, blood pressure, heart rate, waist circumference, lab tests, and subject completed&#xD;
      questionnaires will be collected as part of usual care or for the study. Changes in&#xD;
      medications and any possible side effects will also be monitored during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To qualify, men and women must have had prior bariatric surgery (roux en-y gastric bypass or&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy) at a surgical Center of Excellence within the Ontario Bariatric Network,&#xD;
      and have inadequate weight loss or significant weight regain, based on the following OBN&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. &lt; 10% total body weight (TBW) loss at 6 months or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. &lt; 20% TBW loss at 12 months or;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Weight regain of &gt; 25% of weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of Contrave combined with usual care&#xD;
      (dietary and behaviour counselling) compared to placebo with usual care, in patients who have&#xD;
      inadequate weight loss or significant weight regain following bariatric surgery.&#xD;

             subjects to risk of seizure: history of head trauma, arteriovenous malformation,&#xD;
             central nervous system tumor or infection, or a metabolic disorder that in opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator may contraindicate treatment with Contrave and increase risk of&#xD;
             seizure (e.g. hypoglycemia, hyponatremia)&#xD;

          -  use of other bupropion-containing products (including, but not limited to, Wellbutrin,&#xD;

             Contrave&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  concomitant administration of the antipsychotic thioridazine, since bupropion may&#xD;
             inhibit thioridazine metabolism, thus causing an increase in thioridazine levels and a&#xD;
             potential increased risk of thioridazine-related serious ventricular arrythmias and&#xD;
             sudden death&#xD;
