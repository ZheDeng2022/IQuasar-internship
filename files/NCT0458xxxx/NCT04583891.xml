  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goals of this project are to provide the first rigorous test of a scalable&#xD;
      and publicly accessible mobile health intervention (IntelliCare) to address emotional&#xD;
      distress in women with breast cancer, and to test the impact of human coaching as a way to&#xD;
      increase engagement with digital health interventions to improve outcomes. To achieve these&#xD;
      goals, an innovative experimental study design, known as a Sequential, Multiple Assignment,&#xD;
      Randomized Trial (SMART), will be used to test the effects of the IntelliCare apps on&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as the added value of human support to improve&#xD;
      participant engagement. 313 breast cancer survivors diagnosed within the past 5 years and who&#xD;
      screen positive for elevated symptoms of depression and/or anxiety will be recruited.&#xD;
      Participants will initially be randomized to receive the IntelliCare apps or app-delivered&#xD;
      patient education (control) for 8 weeks, and the impact of the IntelliCare apps on reducing&#xD;
      symptoms of depression and anxiety in breast cancer survivors relative to control will be&#xD;
      tested (Aim 1). We will monitor the app usage data of participants who receive the&#xD;
      IntelliCare apps. Those who are high-engagers will continue to use the apps with no change.&#xD;
      Those who are low-to-moderate engagers will be rerandomized after 1 week to either receive&#xD;
      added coaching vs. not (i.e., no change) in addition to the apps. The hypothesis is that&#xD;
      added coaching to address barriers to app usage will lead to greater engagement with the apps&#xD;
      (Aim 2), for low-to-moderate engagers. Finally, semi-structured exit interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with participants that receive the IntelliCare apps and coaching. Interviews will&#xD;
      capture survivors' perceptions about the extent to which, and how, tailoring the apps and&#xD;
      coaching specifically for breast cancer survivors may improve intervention outcomes and&#xD;
      engagement (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <description>The Patient Education app will contain content relevant for general distress management. This includes information about thoughts/worries, prevalence of mood symptoms, CBT strategies for coping with negative affect, and other information typical of education-based mental health apps. The structure of this app will closely mirror patient education websites and apps which mimic the form and structure of apps that target cancer survivors and that primarily provide educational information about cancer and related symptoms.</description>
