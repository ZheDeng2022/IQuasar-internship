  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The CLOZAPINE study is designed as a multisite study across 5 sites and is a clinical trial,&#xD;
      involving human participants who are prospectively assigned to an intervention. The study&#xD;
      will utilize a stringent randomized, double-blinded, parallel group clinical trial design. B2&#xD;
      group will serve as psychosis control with risperidone as medication control. The study is&#xD;
      designed to evaluate effect of clozapine on the B1 participants, and the effect that will be&#xD;
      evaluated is a biomedical outcome. The study sample will be comprised of individuals with&#xD;
      psychosis, including 1) schizophrenia, 2) schizoaffective disorder and 3) psychotic bipolar I&#xD;
      disorder. The investigators plan to initially screen and recruit n=524 (from both the&#xD;
      existing B-SNIP library and newly-identified psychosis cases, ~50% each) in order to enroll&#xD;
      n=320 (B1 and B2) into the RCT.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical hypotheses underlying this experiment are that (i) B1 individuals are uniquely&#xD;
      responsive to the pharmacological properties of clozapine because they have low Intrinsic EEG&#xD;
      Activity (IEA), an index of compromised cortical neuronal responsiveness. This is plausibly&#xD;
      associated with both (ii) reduced excitatory and (iii) reduced inhibitory stimulation in&#xD;
      cortex and that IEA will track this altered excitatory/inhibitory balance and parallel&#xD;
      clinical antipsychotic response. Furthermore, (iv) B2 probands (based on their high IEA) will&#xD;
      not respond to clozapine. In this study clozapine response is measured by a 'super-APD'&#xD;
      (AntiPsychotic Drug) drug response, a response in addition to what is seen with a usual APD&#xD;
      (e.g., risperidone). The investigators believe that the 30-35% of individuals who show a&#xD;
      'super-APD' clozapine response in schizophrenia in the pivotal study will be predominantly in&#xD;
      B1, because the B1 completers will no longer be diluted by the other non-responders like B2s.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators postulate that &gt;50% of B1 will show a unique therapeutic action&#xD;
      of clozapine (beyond general APD action), contrasted with the usual predicted response of B1&#xD;
      to risperidone or of B2 to clozapine or risperidone.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Individuals who previously participated in a B-SNIP trial who have already been biotyped will be grouped accordingly.&#xD;
New incoming individuals will have their Biotype completed. Those with Biotypes 1 and 2 will be recruited into this protocol. Anyone with Biotype 3 will be excluded from this protocol, but their information will be retained for use in a later study.&#xD;
Biotypes 1 and 2 will be separated into two groups. Each Biotype, B1 and B2, will be randomized between risperidone and clozapine to create parallel comparator groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Week 4, Week 10 and Week 18</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the PANSS total score from the clinical trial baseline (W4) to the end of treatment (W18) will be a primary outcome measure. We predict that B1/clozapine will show a significantly larger change in the PANSS score from W4 to W18, compared to B1/risperidone, B2/clozapine and B2/risperidone. We will also examine the patterns of change in the PANSS score during the 'stable treatment' phase (W10-W18), across the same study groups. A mixed-effect repeated-measures ANCOVA [2(Biotypes) × 2(clozapine/risperidone) × 2(time points] will be used. We also predict that the reduction in the PANSS scores will correlate with increased IEA in B1/clozapine but not in B1/risperidone, B2/clozapine or B2/risperidone. Multivariate prediction models will be used.</description>
