  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project goals are to improve combat readiness of U.S. Soldiers and sustain the&#xD;
      availability of the military to deploy by, 1) decreasing the number of days not physically&#xD;
      ready for duty after diagnosis of a diaphyseal tibial stress fracture, 2) decreasing the need&#xD;
      for a physical profile or medical discharge board after bone stress injury, and 3) decreasing&#xD;
      the recurrence rates of bone stress injuries.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will examine the utility of a novel, non-operative, anabolic bone agent in the&#xD;
      treatment of diaphyseal tibial stress fractures (DTSF). Teriparatide has been well studied in&#xD;
      basic science and clinical studies to conclude its positive effects on building bone mass and&#xD;
      preventing fractures in post-menopausal women. This allowed the medication to gain it an FDA&#xD;
      indication for treatment in these groups. The investigators seek to explore additional uses&#xD;
      for this anabolic agent in an at risk study population that has an imbalance of bone stress&#xD;
      and bone formation resulting in a bone stress injury (BSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only prior study to examine the effect of teriparatide on fracture healing demonstrated&#xD;
      an absolute difference in the time to heal a fracture in the treatment groups, but was under&#xD;
      powered to detect a difference. Given these positive results members of the research team&#xD;
      have used these findings to administer teriparatide at the 20mg dose to young adult NCAA&#xD;
      collegiate athletes who have DTSFs and other BSIs. The promising preliminary clinical&#xD;
      observations have led the investigators to hypothesize that teriparatide will have a positive&#xD;
      effect on bone healing and return to duty among service members with DTSFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A powered, prospective, controlled randomized study design will be utilized. Study subjects&#xD;
      are to be recruited from the basic training corps at Fort Jackson via convenience sample.&#xD;
      Soldiers who experience pain in the mid-shaft of the tibia during basic training will be&#xD;
      evaluated and diagnosed according to the standard of care. Based on direct discussions with&#xD;
      physical therapists stationed at Fort Jackson this diagnosis is often made by using a&#xD;
      combination of bone scan and plain radiographs. After diagnosis, soldiers with a DTSF present&#xD;
      to the physical therapy department for treatment and guidance for their progression of&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There will be a 1:1 randomization into either the placebo arm or the 20mg teriparatide treatment arm. Soldiers will then receive training on how to self-administer study medication in a supervised setting. Both arms will receive 500mg of supplemental calcium to take orally, daily. They will then be released for the four week convalescent leave.</intervention_model_description>
