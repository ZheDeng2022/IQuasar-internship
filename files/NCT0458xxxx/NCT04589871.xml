  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is claimed to be a global burden and a key health issue that affects the&#xD;
      large weight-bearing joints of the lower extremity such as the knee and hip joints. The study&#xD;
      was aimed to find out the efficacy of the tapping technique in addition to the supervised&#xD;
      exercise protocol on pain intensity and functional status of an individual with&#xD;
      patella-femoral arthritis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was based on a controlled pretest-posttest experimental group design. After initial&#xD;
      screening, forty individuals (mean age 55years, ranged 40-60years) with patello-femoral&#xD;
      arthritis randomly (n=20each) assigned into two group A and B. Group A received taping&#xD;
      technique in addition to the supervised exercises protocol while group B received supervised&#xD;
      exercises protocol only. Both the groups received their specified treatment 5 consecutive&#xD;
      days in a week for 4weeks. Data collected for the variables (VAS and WOMAC) at day1&#xD;
      pre-intervention (baseline) and at day 28th post-intervention. The t-test used for within and&#xD;
      between group analysis with keeping the p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

    <description>Functional status of knee assessed by functional subscale of The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). It has eight test-questions. The test questions are scored on a scale of 0 - 4, which correspond to: None (0), Mild (1), Moderate (2), Severe (3), and Extreme (4). The scores for each subscale are summed up, with a possible score range of 0-32 for Physical Function.</description>

    <description>Fixmull stretch and Leukotape (rigid tape) were used in taping to guide the patellar trajectory orientation while performing the movement. Individuals were asked to lay down in supine position with knee in a slightly bent position. Fixomull stretch was used as an adhesive pre-wrap to protect the skin and provide some of the checking force. The main check strap was provided by stripes of rigid tape (Leukotape). The knee cap was taped, started on the outer aspect of the knee cap and pulled inwards. Finished at the back of the inside of the knee. Two further pieces of tape (Fixomull Stretch and Leukotape) applied distal to the patella unloaded the infrapatellar fat pad.</description>
