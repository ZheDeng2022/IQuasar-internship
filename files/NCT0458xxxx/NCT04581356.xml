  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pilot, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the effect of the sickle cell&#xD;
      medication voxelotor on exercise capacity, as measured by cardiopulmonary exercise testing&#xD;
      (CPET) in patients 12 years of age and older with sickle cell anemia (SCA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess exercise capacity by cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) before&#xD;
      and after 8 weeks of voxelotor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with genetically severe forms of sickle cell disease, including Hgb SS, Hgb S beta 0&#xD;
      thalassemia, Hgb SC Harlem, etc., age 12 or older, with stable Hgb and Hgb F will be&#xD;
      recruited. Enrolled subjects will have study labs drawn, undergo baseline CPET in the&#xD;
      exercise lab, then take voxelotor 1500mg daily for 2 months, followed by repeat study labs&#xD;
      and a second CPET. Each subject's CPET results before and after voxelotor will be compared,&#xD;
      and the study labs before and after voxelotor will be compared. Each subject will be compared&#xD;
      to him/herself.&#xD;

    <description>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as assessed by patient reported outcome via Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at end of treatment study visit.&#xD;
The PGIC asks patients to rate their overall improvement relative to their baseline state at the beginning of the study on a 7-point scale.&#xD;
No change (or condition has got worse)&#xD;
Almost the same, hardly any change at all&#xD;
A little better, but not noticeable change at all&#xD;
Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference&#xD;
Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change&#xD;
Better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference&#xD;
A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference</description>
