      This purpose of this study is to examine an aggressive method of blood pressure control that&#xD;
      involves home blood pressure monitoring and management of medications by a team of clinical&#xD;
      pharmacists in coordination with a primary care physician.&#xD;

    <description>Primary Care Physicians and vCCC Pharmacists will be asked for feedback on feasibility of implementation via a survey. The vCCC pharmacists and PCPs will be surveyed to assess feasibility and changing views of feasibility. Brief, validated scales will be delivered via email (REDCap surveys) to assess the construct of feasibility.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 months Post Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic Pharmacists will be asked for feedback on feasibility of system wide adoption. We will conduct one-time semi-structured qualitative interviews with the Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic pharmacists. The Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic pharmacist will be interviewed to assess implementation factors including the auto-referral process and open-ended questions on the process and suggestions for improvement.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic arm participants use a home blood pressure monitor and routine blood pressure measurements will be uploaded to a dashboard monitored by clinical pharmacists. Blood pressure will be managed aggressively by the clinical pharmacists in coordination with Primary Care Physicians.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control Intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control intervention will consist of providing the participant with educational material and a home blood pressure monitor. The patients in the control group will not have support from Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic pharmacists. Routine blood pressure measures using their device will not be collected via the dashboard and will not be available for pharmacist review. Participants will continue to see their physicians for their usual care for blood pressure management.</description>

    <intervention_type>Other</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Virtual Collaborative Care Clinic</intervention_name>
    <description>The vCCC will operate under a collaborative care agreement with the Primary Care Physicians as an extension (and not a replacement) of their care. Trained clinical pharmacists will monitor blood pressure and prescribe and adjust medications under the license of, and in communication with, the patient's Primary Care Physician. As part of the Primary Care Physician's team and per Primary Care Physician's directions, the pharmacists may coordinate blood pressure management with other clinicians such as cardiologists or nephrologists co-managing patients blood pressure.</description>
