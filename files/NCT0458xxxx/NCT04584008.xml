    <textblock>
      This a prospective real-world navigation study using tumor DNA sequencing technology to&#xD;
      sequence genes of previously treated and refractory gastrointestinal tumors, which are&#xD;
      generally considered to be highly heterogeneous and complex, to screen potential molecular&#xD;
      targeted drugs for individualized treatment. This study may provide feasibility and response&#xD;
      information, which will be the basis for designing better randomized trials, which may change&#xD;
      the pattern of cancer treatment. If the hypothesis is finally proved, it will help doctors&#xD;
      and molecular biologists to choose the best drug (or combination of drugs) based on the&#xD;
      individual oncogenomics of each patient.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open label, real-world study to evaluate the feasibility of matched&#xD;
      molecular targeted therapy in patients with refractory gastrointestinal cancer based on tumor&#xD;
      molecular characteristics as standard treatment failure. This is a non-randomized trial&#xD;
      designed to test molecular matching strategies based on patient genome information. The&#xD;
      molecular tumor board (MTB) will recommend treatment, but the treatment decision is up to the&#xD;
      attending physician. FoundationOne CDx was used for tissue genomic analysis. If possible,&#xD;
      PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC), tumor mutation load (TMB), and microsatellite instability&#xD;
      (MSI) status will also be evaluated. Based on this information, MTB, composed of&#xD;
      multidisciplinary experts, will focus on the selection of customized, best matched drugs or&#xD;
      combinations to target most of the genomic changes in each patient, also taking into account&#xD;
      potential drug toxicity. The final treatment will be based on the choice of oncologists, who&#xD;
      will formulate treatment plan by combining MTB discussion, patient preference, attention to&#xD;
      complications, consideration of drug toxicity, insurance coverage of off label drugs and&#xD;
      availability of clinical trials of research drugs, thus reflecting the actual clinical&#xD;
      practice nowadays in China. The acquisition of drugs follows the actual situation in the real&#xD;
      world and is not within the scope of this study design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principles of MTB treatment recommendations can be referred to the NCI-MATCH trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 1: FDA / NMPA approval; clear evidence and mechanism; concomitant diagnostic&#xD;
      relationship between drug and target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 2: The drug reaches the clinical end point (objective response rate, PFS or OS); there&#xD;
      is evidence of target inhibition; there is strong evidence to predict relationship between&#xD;
      the target and the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 3: The drug has evidence of clinical activity and target inhibition; there is some&#xD;
      evidence to predict the relationship between target and drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 4: Pre-clinical evidence of anti-tumor activity and evidence of target inhibition;&#xD;
      there is hypothesis to predict the relationship between target and drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and sign informed consent will be analyzed for tumor&#xD;
      mutation by FoundationOne CDx detection. Biopsy specimens of metastatic foci can be selected&#xD;
      for gene detection. If there is no targeted therapy among patients, the archived diagnostic&#xD;
      tumor samples can also be used for detection. If the patient has received targeted therapy,&#xD;
      the investigators will try to obtain biopsy samples after treatment. If the sample cannot be&#xD;
      tested or the test results are not satisfactory, additional slices need to be sent to the&#xD;
      laboratory. If the repeated test fails, repeat biopsy if the clinical conditions permit, or&#xD;
      patients should be included in the unmatched treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the interventability of gene mutations depends on genomic changes, allele&#xD;
      frequency, and diagnosis. This study will combine the recommendations of MTB and gene testing&#xD;
      reports to determine the interventability of mutated genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional mutation: cancers have FDA or NMPA approved therapies, or there are matching&#xD;
      drugs in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-interventional mutation: there is no FDA or NMPA approved treatment for cancers, and no&#xD;
      matching drug is available in clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTB should at least be composed of attending doctors, molecular pathology experts and&#xD;
      bioinformatics experts. The research center is responsible for the establishment and holding&#xD;
      of MTB. As management of patients enrolled in this study is essential, the research&#xD;
      committee, including but not limited to the main investigator of the study and the treated&#xD;
      medical oncologist, can provide advice as needed between MTB meetings to avoid treatment&#xD;
      delays. By analyzing the genomic variation of patients, independent MTB recommends molecular&#xD;
      targeted therapy that can inhibit the mutation directly or through related pathways or be&#xD;
      included in relevant clinical trials. The independent research committee will use the&#xD;
      &quot;N-to-1&quot; model of precision medicine to propose a matching therapy consisting of at least one&#xD;
      drug that targets molecular changes. The investigators expect 50-70% of patients to carry&#xD;
      intervening variants, and that proportion is rising rapidly as learning more about these&#xD;
      pathways and drugs. The investigators expect that about 40% of patients with intervening&#xD;
      variants will be able to receive molecular targeted &quot;matching&quot; therapy.&#xD;
