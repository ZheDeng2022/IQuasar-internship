      Objectives: Assess the efficacy of multiple dose oral administration of Saltikva, an&#xD;
      attenuated strain of Salmonella Typhimurium expressing IL-2, in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer on standard chemotherapy (either FOLFIRINOX or Gemcitabine/Abraxane and&#xD;
      Saltikva).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale: The addition of Saltikva to the standard of care regimen for Stage IV&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer will significantly prolong the overall survival and prolong the&#xD;
      time to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: unresectable, metastatic pancreatic cancer patients 18 years of age or&#xD;
      older&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study agent is Saltikva, an attenuated Salmonella Typhimurium containing the gene for&#xD;
      human IL-2 (Salmonella-IL2). Salmonella is a human pathogen typically spread via contaminated&#xD;
      water supplies or foodstuffs. After ingestion, these bacteria invade the intestinal mucosa&#xD;
      and colonize the gut associated lymphoid tissues, the liver, and the spleen. If pathogenic,&#xD;
      symptoms persist for 7 to 14 days. These organisms are thought to be facultative&#xD;
      intracellular parasites, which can persistently infect the endothelium, kupfer cells, and&#xD;
      parenchymal cells of the liver for up to 12 weeks. The liver is considered a 'safe-site' for&#xD;
      Salmonella as the preferred organ of residence after infection. The carrier state is&#xD;
      eventually eradicated by the stimulation of cell-mediated and secretory immunity. Saltikva is&#xD;
      a Salmonella based cancer therapeutic that has been genetically altered so it is incapable of&#xD;
      causing any disease and is unable to mutate to a wild-type form of Salmonella, thus can never&#xD;
      become pathogenic or harm anyone. Furthermore, Saltikva has been shown to preferentially&#xD;
      invade and colonize within solid tumor tissues at a ratio of 1,000-10,000:1 over the normal&#xD;
      'safe-sites' of the liver. In addition, the Salmonella of Saltikva carries the gene for a&#xD;
      powerful anti-cancer immune stimulant, Interleukin-2. Thus, Saltikva's mode of action is to&#xD;
      invade and colonize solid tumors after oral ingestion, release a powerful immune stimulant&#xD;
      directly within the tumor microenvironment thus avoiding systemic side effects, and imparts&#xD;
      an immunologic mediated cancer cell kill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The addition of Saltikva to the standard of care regimen for Stage IV metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer will significantly prolong the overall survival and prolong the time to&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for study design Two standard of care chemotherapeutic regimens are used for&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer, namely, FOLFIRINOX and a Gemcitabine-based regimen. Despite these&#xD;
      regimens, the median survival from Stage 4 metastatic pancreas cancer is 11.1 and 6.8 months,&#xD;
      respectively. Oncologists choose these regimens based on the assessment of which regimen will&#xD;
      be tolerated by the individual patients the FOLFIRINOX regimen is significantly more toxic&#xD;
      and not as well tolerated as a gemcitabine based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the significant lethality of metastatic pancreatic cancer and numerous studies&#xD;
      conducted world wide with the two chemotherapeutic strategies that will be used in this&#xD;
      trial, the investigators will use historical controls as comparison to the study arms in this&#xD;
      trial. Furthermore, because the outcomes of chemotherapy only in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer has been well documented, the investigators do not see the need for a&#xD;
      control arm in this study. Lastly, although the patient numbers are small, the preliminary&#xD;
      data is quite promising, and it would be considered unethical to have a control arm in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
