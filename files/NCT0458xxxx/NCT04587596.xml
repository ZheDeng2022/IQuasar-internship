  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the research project is to quantify GP practice staffs' knowledge of chronic pain,&#xD;
      their attitudes towards people with chronic pain and their management of a hypothetical&#xD;
      patient with chronic pain, following a pain education session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also seeks to explore GP practice staffs' experience of receiving the pain&#xD;
      education, their understanding of pain following the education and if they perceive the&#xD;
      education session has impacted upon their daily practice.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inappropriate, biomedical based views of chronic pain are commonly held by health care&#xD;
      professionals (HCPs) and these in turn can result in patients receiving sub-optimal care out&#xD;
      of step with current guidelines. It has been found that healthcare professionals management&#xD;
      techniques did not reflect recognised treatment guidelines and this was associated with their&#xD;
      biomedical view of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain education/training sessions for health care staff may be an important step towards&#xD;
      improving patient care for chronic pain. It has been found that there was improvement in&#xD;
      nurses' knowledge after 2 different pain education sessions delivered to nurses however there&#xD;
      was no long term follow up. Furthermore, no studies have targeted all members of staff at a&#xD;
      GP surgery who will interact with the patient, and thus impact upon the care they receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain Neuroscience education (PNE) is an approach to pain education which uses pain science&#xD;
      information to shift the belief system of the receiver away from a biomedical understanding&#xD;
      of pain to a more biopsychosocial understanding of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have shown that this education can decrease biomedical attitudes in&#xD;
      health care students. Thus, it may be that this education could produce similar positive&#xD;
      effects in GP practice staff that could have positive implications for the care of patients&#xD;
      with chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus this study aims to assess the impact on attitudes and beliefs of pain education upon&#xD;
      staff at a GP surgery in Middlesbrough. Attitudes and beliefs will be assessed before and&#xD;
      after the delivery of education. In addition participants will be invited to attend one of&#xD;
      two focus groups to further discuss their findings or thoughts about the lecture.&#xD;
