      This is prospective, randomized study. The main objective of the study is to compare the&#xD;
      clinical efficacy and safety of two therapies for the treatment of prolonged atherosclerotic&#xD;
      lesions of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment below the knee, TASC II type D -&#xD;
      femoropopliteal distal bypass with a synthetic ePTDE-grafts and recanalization with&#xD;
      angioplasty and stenting using a biomimetic intervowen nitinol stent in patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic peripheral arterial disease after 24 months. Secondary objectives are to identify&#xD;
      predictors of restenosis and occlusions of the operated segment and compare the quality of&#xD;
      life of patients after the procedure.&#xD;

      Steno-occlusive lesion of the superficial femoral and popliteal artery is observed from 2.5%&#xD;
      to 14.5% (National guidelines for the management of patients with vascular arterial&#xD;
      pathology, Russian Consensus Document, 2010) of patients in different age groups. The&#xD;
      standard technique of autovenous femoral-femoral or femoral-popliteal bypass surgery has&#xD;
      shown its five-year effectiveness in 66-73.7% of patients (Remote endarterectomy versus&#xD;
      supragenicular bypass surgery for long occlusions of the superficial femoral artery:&#xD;
      Medium-term results of a randomized controlled trial (The REVAS trial ). by Suzanne S.&#xD;
      Gisbertz, Rudolf P. Tutein Nolthenius, Gert Jan De Borst, Lyckle Van Der Laan, Tim Th C&#xD;
      Overtoom, Frans L. Moll, Jean Paul PM De Vries 2010). However, these results are&#xD;
      significantly impaired by femoral-popliteal bypass grafting below the knee joint, or&#xD;
      femoral-tibial revascularization. In this position, five-year patency is 33-50% (Johnson WC,&#xD;
      Lee KK A comparative evaluation of polytetra-fluoroethylene, umbilical vein, and saphenous&#xD;
      vein bypass grafts for femoral-popliteal above-knee revascularization: a prospective&#xD;
      randomized Department of Veterans Affairs cooperative study. J. Vasc. Surg). Patients whose&#xD;
      own vein was previously used for coronary artery bypass grafting or has a small diameter and&#xD;
      extensive lateral branches are also very problematic for surgery. At the same time, in&#xD;
      patients with relatively compensated chronic ischemia of the lower extremities (CLI category&#xD;
      2-3 according to the Rutherford classification) and the absence of autologous material for&#xD;
      shunting, it is possible to continue with optimal drug therapy. In the case of critical lower&#xD;
      limb ischemia (category 4-6 according to the Rutherford classification), revascularization is&#xD;
      indicated in order to preserve the limb (National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      of diseases of the lower limb arteries, Section 7, pp. 59-61. Moscow, 2019). A common&#xD;
      operation of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting of these arteries allows you&#xD;
      to restore blood flow through your own arteries. However, with physiological flexion and&#xD;
      extension of the hip and knee joints, there is a pronounced deformation of the stented&#xD;
      popliteal and superficial femoral arteries both in the axial and angular directions. This is&#xD;
      accompanied by breakage of the stents, or their restenosis and thrombosis. So, according to a&#xD;
      number of authors, the two-year incidence of stent breakages in the superficial femoral&#xD;
      artery ranges from 20% to 46% (Duda SH, Bosiers M, Lammer J, et al. Drug-eluting and bare&#xD;
      nitinol stents for the treatment of atherosclerotic lesions in the superficial femoral&#xD;
      artery: Long-term results from the SIROCCO trial. J Endovasc Ther 2006; 13: 701-710), and the&#xD;
      frequency of restenosis and occlusions from 21.8% to 53.3% (Laird JR, Katzen BT, Scheinert D,&#xD;
      et al. Nitinol stent implantation vs. balloon angioplasty for lesions in the superficial&#xD;
      femoral and proximal popliteal arteries of patients with claudication: Three-year follow-up&#xD;
      from the RESILIENT randomized trial. J Endovasc Ther 2012; 19: 1-9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the possible solutions to the problem of stent breakage in the femoral-popliteal&#xD;
      position is a modified method of their manufacture by braiding from nitinol wire. Pilot&#xD;
      two-year studies with braided stents have indeed shown resistance to breakage in this&#xD;
      position. Moreover, the frequency of restenosis was observed in 27.2% of patients (M. Werner,&#xD;
      A. Paetzold, U. Banning-Eichenseer, S. Scheinert, M. Piorkowski, M. Ulrich, Y. Bausback, S.&#xD;
      Bräunlich, A. Schmidt, D. Scheinert. Treatment of complex atherosclerotic femoropopliteal&#xD;
      artery disease with a self-expanding interwoven nitinol stent: midterm results from the&#xD;
      Leipzig SUPERA 500 registry // EuroIntervention 2014; March 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, a recent study, where the authors studied the effectiveness of stenting of&#xD;
      long lesions (200 mm or more) of the femoral-popliteal segment with BRM stents, showed&#xD;
      unsatisfactory indicators (45%) of the patency of the stented segment within 2 years (Lin Y,&#xD;
      Tang X, Fu W, Kovach R, George JC, Guo D. Stent fractures after superficial femoral artery&#xD;
      stenting: risk factors and impact on patency. Journal of Endovascular Therapy. 2015 Jun; 22&#xD;
      (3): 319-26). This fact proves the need for a comparative study on such a cohort of patients&#xD;
      using a interwoven nitinol stent, devoid of some of the disadvantages of usual BRM stents (as&#xD;
      described above), which will improve the efficiency of this procedure both in the early and&#xD;
      late postoperative period. Recently published by authors (Garcia L, Jaff MR, Metzger C,&#xD;
      Sedillo G, Pershad A, Zidar F, Patlola R, Wilkins RG, Espinoza A, Iskander A, Khammar GS&#xD;
      Wire-interwoven nitinol stent outcome in the superficial femoral and proximal popliteal&#xD;
      arteries: twelve-month results of the SUPERB trial) the results of the effectiveness of such&#xD;
      a procedure within 12 months, but with a shorter average length of the lesion (78.1 mm)&#xD;
      showed encouraging results (the primary 12-month patency was 78.9%), which gives hope for&#xD;
      good results even with long lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technology description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recanalization with angioplasty and stenting: Under local anesthesia, a standard endovascular&#xD;
      approach is performed and the affected arterial segment is visualized. Perform transluminal&#xD;
      or subintimal recanalization of the occluded segment of the arteries with a hydrophilic guide&#xD;
      wire. Next, balloon angoplasty of the recanalized segment is performed. After control&#xD;
      angiography, a biomimetic braided nitinol stent is placed throughout the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug therapy includes pre-procedure aspirin (160-300 mg / day), starting at least one day&#xD;
      before, and intra-procedure heparin (100 U / kg body weight intravenously). After the&#xD;
      procedure, all patients are prescribed aspirin (100 mg per day) for a long time and&#xD;
      clopidogrel (75 mg per day) for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoropopliteal distal bypass with a synthetic ePTFE graft: Under general anesthesia, 2&#xD;
      standard open surgical approaches are performed: one to the common femoral artery,&#xD;
      superficial femoral artery and deep femoral artery; the second - to the third portion of the&#xD;
      popliteal artery, the tibioperoneal trunk and the anterior tibial artery. After systemic&#xD;
      heparinization, clamps are applied to the arteries. A longitudinal arteriotomy of the&#xD;
      popliteal artery is performed, and a distal end-to-side anastomosis is formed between the&#xD;
      artery and the graft. Next, the graft is passed into the groin wound. Longitudinal&#xD;
      arteriotomy of the common femoral artery. A proximal end-to-side anastomosis is formed&#xD;
      between the shunt and the common femoral artery. Clamps are removed from arteries, blood flow&#xD;
      is started, surgical hemostasis, wound drainage, layer-by-layer wound closure is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug therapy includes pre-procedure aspirin (160-300 mg / day), starting at least one day&#xD;
      before, and intra-procedure heparin (100 U / kg body weight intravenously). After the&#xD;
      procedure, all patients are prescribed aspirin (75-100 mg per day) for a long time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two methods of treatment of&#xD;
      prolonged atherosclerotic lesions of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment below the&#xD;
      knee within 24 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the effectiveness of two methods of treatment of prolonged atherosclerotic&#xD;
           lesions of the arteries of the femoropopliteal segment below the knee joint after 24&#xD;
           months (primary patency, primary-assisted patency, secondary patency, TLR, MALE);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety of two methods of treatment of prolonged atherosclerotic lesions of&#xD;
           the arteries of the femoral-popliteal segment below the knee joint in the early&#xD;
           postoperative period (hematoma, peripheral neuropathy, purulent-infectious complications&#xD;
           of the surgical access area) and after 24 months (MACE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the quality of life in patients after surgery after 1, 12 and 24 months;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess prognostic factors for adverse outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and female patients &gt; 18 years old with diagnosed atherosclerotic occlusive lesion of&#xD;
      the femoropopliteal segment below the knee (TASC II type D) requiring surgical correction,&#xD;
      recruited in accordance with the inclusion / exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature data review of studies on endovascular (using intervowen biomimetic nitinol&#xD;
      stents) and open revascularization (femoral-popliteal distal bypass) arteries of the&#xD;
      infrainguinal segment shown (Scheinert, D., Grummt, L., Piorkowski, M., Sax, J., Scheinert,&#xD;
      S., Ulrich, M., ... Schmidt, A. (2011). A Novel Self-Expanding Interwoven Nitinol Stent for&#xD;

      Endovascular Therapy, 18 (6), 745-752. Https://doi.org/10.1583/11-3500.1), that 2-year&#xD;
      primary patency after endovascular revascularization using a biomimetic intervowen nitinol&#xD;
      stent was 76.1 ± 4.5%. At the same time, the two-year primary patency after femoropopliteal&#xD;
      distal bypass surgery using an artificial ePTFE grafts is about 40% (Eickhoff JH, Broomé A,&#xD;
