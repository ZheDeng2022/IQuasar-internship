  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Succinylcholine is a medication (depolarizing muscle relaxant) that is used as part of an&#xD;
      anesthetic (going to sleep for surgery). This medication can cause significant muscle&#xD;
      soreness. Rocuronium is a medication (non-depolarizing muscle relaxant) that some anesthesia&#xD;
      providers believe may reduce muscle soreness caused by succinylcholine if given prior, but&#xD;
      this has been controversial. Some anesthesiologists pretreat patients with rocuronium before&#xD;
      giving patients succinylcholine, and some do not. The purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      effect of pretreatment with rocuronium on muscle soreness associated with succinylcholine&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After IRB approval from Indiana University Hospital and with written and verbal informed&#xD;
      consent from each patient, 300 ASA I, II and III outpatients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) under general anesthesia will be&#xD;
      enrolled in this randomized-controlled study. The participants and the study personnel&#xD;
      performing post-op assessments will be blinded. Anesthesia providers cannot be blinded during&#xD;
      this study since anesthesia providers will be required to draw up the study drugs as well as&#xD;
      managing the wait time between rocuronium and succinylcholine. Patients are assigned to one&#xD;
      of three groups (n = 100 each group). Each participant will undergo a standard IV induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia (Lidocaine 1mg/kg, propofol 1-2 mg/kg titrated to effect, and succinylcholine&#xD;
      (administered as indicated by study group assignment). Study group details are as follows:&#xD;
      Group 1 (Control) to receive no rocuronium pretreatment and 1 mg/kg of succinylcholine.&#xD;
      Groups 2 and 3 to receive 0.05 mg/kg up to 5 mg of rocuronium; patients ranged from 50-120&#xD;
      kg. In Group 2, succinylcholine administration will occur at 1.0 mg/kg at t = 1 minute after&#xD;
      pretreatment with rocuronium. In Group 3, succinylcholine will be administered (1.0 mg/kg) at&#xD;
      t = 2 minutes after pretreatment. The Succinylcholine-induced fasciculations will be noted on&#xD;
      study assessment data sheet as either present or absent. . Myalgia assessment is to occur&#xD;
      post-succinylcholine administration at t =3 hours and t = 24 hours and will be rated as&#xD;
      described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myalgia assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will by queried at the above time points about muscle pain and scored based on&#xD;
      their answers as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0 - no pain /no muscle stiffness&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - mild muscle pain and/or stiffness at 1 or more sites that does not limit daily&#xD;
           activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Moderate muscle pain and/or stiffness at 1 or more sites that does not limit daily&#xD;
           activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Moderate generalized muscle pain and/or stiffness limiting daily activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Severe muscle pain and/or stiffness at 1 or more sites limiting movement and&#xD;
           preventing daily activity&#xD;

    <description>Succinylcholine administration produces uncoordinated muscle movement called fasciculation. The investigators are interested in recording whether pretreatment with rocuronium prevents fasciculation and whether fasciculation is correlated with the presence of myalgias.</description>

             than 30 mg PO morphine equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will also be excluded if their comorbid medical conditions require a true&#xD;
             rapid sequence induction as precurarization with rocuronium increases the time to&#xD;
