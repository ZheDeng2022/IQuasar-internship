  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the cumulative incidence of all adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs), including serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse event of special interest (AESI),&#xD;
      among participants who have been administered niraparib as per the approved indications.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a long-term prospective, observational post-marketing surveillance study of niraparib&#xD;
      in participants with ovarian cancer (including fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer)&#xD;
      who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy or who had&#xD;
      complete or partial response to 2 or more lines of platinum-based chemotherapy or who have&#xD;
      been treated with 3 or more prior chemotherapy regimens with either: BRCA mutation&#xD;
      irrespective of platinum sensitivity; or platinum-sensitive HRD positive. The study will&#xD;
      assess the safety and effectiveness of niraparib for its approved indication with real-world&#xD;
      setting in South Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 600 participants. The data will be collected&#xD;
      prospectively at the study sites will be recorded into electronic case report forms (e-CRFs).&#xD;
      All the participants will be assigned to a single observational cohort:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Participants With Ovarian Cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multi-center study will be conducted in South Korea. Data collection will be based on&#xD;
      routinely scheduled and emergency visits during a 24-month surveillance period or until end&#xD;
      of the study whichever occurs first after drug administration. The overall duration of the&#xD;
      study will be approximately 6 years.&#xD;

    <description>TTD is defined as the time interval from the date of initiation of treatment until discontinuation of treatment, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who have not discontinued treatment, or died, will be censored at the last known time that the participant was on treatment.</description>

    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>From the date of first dose administration until disease progression or death due to any cause whichever occurs first (up to 24 months)</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time interval from the date of initiation of treatment until objectively documented disease progression, or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Participants who do not have disease progression, or have not died, will be censored at the last known time that the participant was progression-free. Progressive disease (PD) is defined as at least a 20 percent (%) increase in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. The determination of disease progression will be at the Investigators discretion per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 criteria.</description>
