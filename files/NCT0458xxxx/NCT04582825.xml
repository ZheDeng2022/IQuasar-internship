    <textblock>
      Stroke is the second leading cause of death and one of the main contributors to disability.&#xD;
      Patients who survive the acute phase of ischemic stroke and those with transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack (TIA) are at high risk of subsequent vascular events. Importantly, recurrent strokes&#xD;
      are associated with a higher social and economic impact, higher case fatality, and worse&#xD;
      clinical outcome than first-ever strokes. The burden of post-stroke complications, residual&#xD;
      deficits, and inadequate medical and psychosocial care all contribute to long-term disability&#xD;
      and reduced quality of life in these patients. The Department of Neurology of the Medical&#xD;
      University Innsbruck undertook the STROKE-CARD trial (NCT02156778) between 2014 and 2018 with&#xD;
      follow-up until 2019 to evaluate the efficacy of the Post-Stroke disease-management program&#xD;
      STROKE-CARD care. After implementation of STROKE-CARD care, the investigators aim to document&#xD;
      the quality of post-stroke care and compare outcome parameters to historical cohorts and the&#xD;
      change over time. Furthermore the investigators aim to gain a large data-resource for future&#xD;
      research of biomarkers, disease mechanisms, prognosis and imaging mechanisms for R&amp;D.&#xD;

      Stroke is the second leading cause of death and one of the main contributors to disability.&#xD;
      Patients who survive the acute phase of ischemic stroke and those with a transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack (TIA) are at high risk of subsequent stroke. Importantly, recurrent strokes are&#xD;
      associated with a higher social and economic impact, higher case fatality, and worse clinical&#xD;
      outcome than first-ever strokes. The burden of post-stroke complications, residual deficits,&#xD;
      and inadequate medical and psychosocial care all contribute to long-term disability and&#xD;
      reduced quality of life in these patients. Furthermore, effects on quality of life and&#xD;
      long-term functional independence are particularly under-investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Department of Neurology of the Medical University Innsbruck undertook the STROKE-CARD&#xD;
      trial (NCT02156778) between 2014 and 2018 with follow-up until 2019 to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      of the Post-Stroke disease management program STROKE-CARD care. The aim is to evaluate this&#xD;
      program in a large multicenter cohort and to establish a biobank of stroke and TIA-patients&#xD;
      for future research and development projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In brief, the pragmatic and easily implementable STROKE-CARD care program reduced&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk and improved health-related quality of life and functional outcome in&#xD;
      patients with acute ischemic stroke or TIA in a timeframe of 12 months after the index event.&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of STROKE-CARD care on a large basis and over a longer period, an&#xD;
      evaluation of approximately 5,000 patients is warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whereas disease management programs typically rely on expert opinion, the STROKE-CARD&#xD;
      initiative moved from a purely empirical approach to a highly structured, individualized, and&#xD;
      evidence-based procedure with professional outcome analysis. The STROKE-CARD concept will be&#xD;
      implemented in clinical practice and can serve as a model for other disease management&#xD;
      initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute and short-term management of stroke and TIA has improved tremendously over the past&#xD;
      years with substantial advances in acute therapy, implementation of comprehensive pathways&#xD;
      for stroke and TIA, and approval of novel highly effective preventive treatments. As a main&#xD;
      unmet challenge in stroke medicine, strategies of long-term care have to be developed and&#xD;
      rigorously tested in order to maintain improved short-term patient outcome in the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STROKE-CARD care reduced the one-year cumulative absolute risk of CVD and ameliorated the&#xD;
      patients' health-related quality of life at 12 months (EQ-5D-3L overall utility score,&#xD;
      P&lt;0.001). These findings were consistent in subgroups according to age, sex, and index event&#xD;
      and were robust in the per-protocol analysis. Among pre-specified secondary outcomes assessed&#xD;
      at 12 months, the investigators observed improvements in all individual dimensions of the&#xD;
      EQ-5D-3L and in one-year functional outcome, that each met the multiplicity-adjusted&#xD;
      threshold for statistical significance. Only a few previous trials of disease management&#xD;
      programs in stroke and TIA patients have focused on recurrent CVD or quality of life as&#xD;
      primary or secondary endpoints and none has considered long-term functional outcome after one&#xD;
      year. The previous trial was limited to a 12-month follow-up in selected individuals and the&#xD;
      sustainability of benefits of STROKE-CARD care in a large nationwide cohort over a longer&#xD;
      follow-up period remains to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to detect post-stroke complications, to estimate the patient's demand for&#xD;
      nursing services, and support guideline-compliant secondary prevention with full achievement&#xD;
      of target levels, lifestyle modifications, and in-person outcome assessment at 3 and 12&#xD;
      months after the index-event, assessment of functional status (impairment), activity&#xD;
      (disability), and participation (handicap and health-related quality of life). Additionally,&#xD;
      yearly follow-up telephone interviews for cardiovascular outcome and health parameters will&#xD;
      be conducted. In case of clinically indicated in-person follow-ups, the interviews will be&#xD;
      done in person during the clinical visits. After the implementation of STROKE-CARD care, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to document the quality of post-stroke care and compare outcome parameters&#xD;
      to historical cohorts and the change over time. Furthermore, the investigators aim to gain a&#xD;
      large data resource for future research of biomarkers, disease mechanisms, prognosis and&#xD;
      imaging mechanisms for R&amp;D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the Post-Stroke Disease Management program STROKE-CARD in a&#xD;
      large multicenter cohort of stroke and TIA-patients and to establish a large clinical&#xD;
      well-defined cohort. Furthermore, the investigators aim to gain a large data resource for&#xD;
      future research of biomarkers, disease mechanisms, prognosis and imaging mechanisms for R&amp;D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To document and monitor the quality of the Post-Stroke Disease Management program in&#xD;
      different centers and compare outcomes to the historical cohort, as well as other published&#xD;
      data. Furthermore, the investigators aim to constantly improve post-stroke care. This&#xD;
      registry can facilitate to monitor and document the effect on the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no formal safety endpoints in this study. No experimental procedures will be&#xD;
      applied to patients and most of the procedures done are within the clinical routine.&#xD;
      Potential side effects of optimal secondary stroke prevention are recorded.&#xD;
