      This work is an implementation science study that examines different aspects of implementing&#xD;
      a single intervention. The intervention consists of asking community health centers to&#xD;
      implement an outreach strategy to screen patients for colorectal cancer and for social&#xD;
      determinants of health in community health centers at the same contact point. These are both&#xD;
      clinical targets that the CHCs feel that their patients need and want to offer at a higher&#xD;
      rate. The intervention consists of outreach to patients in need of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      screening (CRC) to offer fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening and screening for social&#xD;
      determinants of health (SDOH). In this implementation science study, the intervention is an&#xD;
      evidence-based intervention being implemented in real-world clinical practice. The&#xD;
      intervention is the outreach to offer FIT and SDOH, conducted by clinic staff. Both&#xD;
      evidence-based screening activities-FIT and SDOH screening-are used in the practices included&#xD;
      in the study but pairing them is intended to increase efficiency and patient-centeredness by&#xD;
      addressing health related social needs that may impact patients' ability to engage in cancer&#xD;
      screening. The study aims to test the effect of implementing the intervention on clinical and&#xD;
      process outcomes. Clinical outcomes are CRC screening and SDOH screening. Analysis of process&#xD;
      outcomes includes measuring what organizational factors influence implementation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This trial uses a randomized stepped wedge study design. This pragmatic design involves a sequential, randomized roll-out of the intervention across the four participating clinical sites or &quot;clusters&quot; over 8 week intervals or &quot;steps.&quot; The intervention is the paired outreach to patients in need of CRC screening to offer FIT screening and screening for SDOH. The participants who will be enrolled are CHC staff who will provide input on the implementation processes and outcomes.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The intervention is the implementation of a paired outreach strategy to patients in need of colorectal cancer screening to offer FIT testing and to complete screening for social determinants of health. These screening activities are part of routine practice but the intervention that is being implemented is the paired outreach for both CRC screening and SDOH screening.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Study participants include community health center staff participating in interviews about&#xD;
        the implementation of the intervention. Up to four community health center staff members at&#xD;
        each of the four community health centers will participate in key informant interviews&#xD;
        twice per year. Patients will receive the paired screening intervention as part of their&#xD;
        routine care and will not be individually recruited for the study because the intervention&#xD;
        is being offered as part of routine care.&#xD;

    <ipd_access_criteria>Outside investigators will need an approved concept proposal to analyze study data and spend the requisite time with study staff to learn about the data elements needed to conduct the proposed analysis. With the assistance of our analytic team, s/he will draft a detailed analysis plan and present to the core group of co-investigators. The discussion at this meeting ensures adequate knowledge of the data, and the presenter gains much insight into how the analysis can be most useful and how it relates to previous analyses. Once the plan is approved by this group, it must also be approved by the CHCs that provide the de-identified data. Following approval by the appropriate IRBs and confirmation that it meets HIPAA requirements, s/he may sign a DUA to use a secure, de-identified dataset to complete only the approved analyses and write the manuscript(s) offsite. A formal data analysis plan application and DUA are still in development. Requests should be directed to jdaly@hasph.harvard.edu.</ipd_access_criteria>
