    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind and placebo controlled clinical study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of brightening microneedle patch on facial solar lentigines.&#xD;
      Subjects who are 30 to 65-year-old with solar lentigines on their faces will receive&#xD;
      brightening microneedle patches on facial solar lentigines once a day for 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Afterwards, facial images and skin detectors will be used to analysis their skin, according&#xD;
      to various skin tone indexes and skin response score sheets.&#xD;

      Method: 35 subjects, Fitzpatrick Skin Type II to IV. Each subject has at least two brown&#xD;
      solar lentigines on the face, and the two spots are independent, each with a clear boundary&#xD;
      and diameter ≥ 0.5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes 1 screening visit (Day -1), wash-out period (2 weeks before the trial),&#xD;
      trial period (4 weeks in total), and 3 return visits for detecting (baseline detecting at the&#xD;
      end of the wash-out period, the 2nd week and the 4th week of the trial period).&#xD;
