      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new medical device&#xD;
      (Atoldys/ Lexilens glasses) on the improvement of reading skills of young dyslexic subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyslexia is defined as a specific learning disability that is characterized by reading&#xD;
      difficulties, in the absence of intellectual disability, neurological or psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder, uncorrected sensory disturbance (sight, hearing) or an educational deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dyslexia appears in the child from the earliest stages of learning in the form of a&#xD;
      difficulty in mastering the learning of reading. This disorder is manifested by a generally&#xD;
      hesitant reading, slowed down, full of errors, requiring a lot of effort for the child and&#xD;
      may impact his reading comprehension. The dyslexia-related deficiency is of variable&#xD;
      intensity depending on the individual; it may be accompanied by calculus disorders&#xD;
      (dyscalculia), oral language (dysphasia), motor coordination (dyspraxia) or attention&#xD;
      disorders with or without hyperactivity. In nearly 40% of cases, a child affected by Dys&#xD;
      disorders presents several learning disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the causes of dyslexia are not yet clearly established. The wide variety of symptoms&#xD;
      and disorders associated with dyslexia does not facilitate the identification of precise&#xD;
      neurobiological / psycho cognitive mechanisms. There are therefore several theories:&#xD;
      phonological, visual, temporal, cerebellar or proprioceptive auditory processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, following work published in 2017, an anatomical cause based on Maxwell's spots&#xD;
      could also be a cause of dyslexia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate a new medical device (class I CE marked) to compensate&#xD;
      this probable anatomical cause: the Atoldys/ Lexilens glasses&#xD;
