      the investigators purpose is to predict hypotensive condition that can develop after general&#xD;
      anesthesia induction by measuring the Tricuspid Annular Plane Systolic Movement (TAPSE),&#xD;
      which is an echocardiographic parameter.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intraoperative hypotension development might increase myocardial damage, acute kidney damage,&#xD;
      and septic complications, and have an effect on mortality increase. For this reason,&#xD;
      prevention of an unwanted hypotensive event has an important role in reducing mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity. The prediction of the risk of hypotension is generally based on the evaluation of&#xD;
      the comorbid status and volume status of patients .It is already known that right ventricular&#xD;
      systolic dysfunction has prognostic value in various pathological cases. It is quite&#xD;
      difficult to evaluate the RV function with echocardiography because of the complex geometry&#xD;
      of RV. Although RV function has been evaluated only visually for many years, guidelines have&#xD;
      been published as a result of recent studies by the American Society of Echocardiography. In&#xD;
      this respect, abnormal RV function should be suspected when one of the criteria of S '&lt;10 cm&#xD;
      /s, TAPSE &lt;16 mm, RVFAC &lt;35%, or R-MPI (Tissue Doppler)&gt; 0.55. Normal and abnormal function&#xD;
      is distinguished more reliably when combining more than one RV function measures. TAPSE is a&#xD;
      parameter with which the apex-basal shortening can be easily measured, providing specific&#xD;
      data on global RV function. It depends less on optimal image quality than other RV function&#xD;
      measurements, and is an easy-to-measure criterion. Low TAPSE is not very common; however, it&#xD;
      was measured in people with no heart disease due to diagnostic misclassification and&#xD;
      excessive ends of the normal spectrum. the investigators think that despite the lack of&#xD;
      cardiac disease, cardiac reserve functions of each patient may have limits in terms of&#xD;
      development of hypotension in general anesthesia induction. The investigators considered that&#xD;
      TAPSE, which decreased within normal limits in patients without cardiac disease, could&#xD;
      predict hypotension development in general anesthesia induction, and planned study for this&#xD;
      purpose.&#xD;
