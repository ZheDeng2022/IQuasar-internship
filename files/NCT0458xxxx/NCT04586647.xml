  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the Noom Healthy Weight Program, a digital&#xD;
      behavior change weight loss intervention, creates a positive relationship with food, compared&#xD;
      to a waitlist control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomized, controlled pilot study evaluating relationships towards&#xD;
      food in overweight and obese Noom Healthy Weight participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions (intervention, waitlist&#xD;
      control). In the intervention condition, participants will have immediate access to the full&#xD;
      Noom program after consenting to Noom's Research Policy, which states the collection of in&#xD;
      app user data for research purposes. In the waitlist control condition, participants will be&#xD;
      informed that they are on a waiting list and will be provided access to the full Noom program&#xD;
      after 4 months after consenting to Noom's Research Policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noom will have access to participants' username and email address. Before the start of the&#xD;
      program, participants in both conditions will be emailed a survey containing the validated&#xD;
      questionnaires mentioned below. The survey will also ask for demographic information such as&#xD;
      race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Survey responses will be linked to weight data by&#xD;
      email address, but all data will be de-identified prior to analysis. The same survey, without&#xD;
      demographic questions, will be sent to participants again at program end (4 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of a curriculum, provided through daily articles that users are&#xD;
      encouraged to read; logging features for weight, meals, and physical activity; in-app groups;&#xD;
      and a virtual coach, who will communicate with participants via in-app messaging. During the&#xD;
      first week of the study, participants will be introduced to the program, the Noom app, and&#xD;
      their coach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaches will use a secure dashboard to monitor patient progress, which is used to increase&#xD;
      engagement and motivation. Participants are encouraged to log their weight and physical&#xD;
      activity on a weekly basis, and meals daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is to assess self-reported eating behaviors via the Three&#xD;
      Factor Eating Questionnaire following a 4 month weight loss intervention (Noom Healthy Weight&#xD;
      program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes assessing disordered eating habits and mindfulness will be measured via&#xD;
      the Disordered Eating Attitude Questionnaire and the Mindful Eating Scale. Mean weight loss&#xD;
      differences between groups will also be measured.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome of this study is to assess self-reported eating behaviors via the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire following a weight loss intervention This assessment is designed to measure 3 dimensions of human eating behavior: cognitive restraint of eating (Factor I - 20 items), disinhibition (Factor II - 16 items), and hunger (Factor III - 15 items). The minimum score for factors I-II-III is therefore 0-0-0, and maximum possible score is 20-16-15. Part I includes items 1-36 and are rated either 1-True or 0-False. Part II includes items 37-51 and is rated on a 4-point scale with the exception of item 50, which is rated on a 6-point scale.&#xD;
