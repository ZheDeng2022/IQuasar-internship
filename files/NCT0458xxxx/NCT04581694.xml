  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute renal failure (ARF) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is a frequent&#xD;
      complication, with significant clinical consequences. History of chronic kidney disease and&#xD;
      the use of a large amount of iodinated contrast for planning and procedure are among the main&#xD;
      risk factors for the development of this complication. The present study aims to: (1) define&#xD;
      the role of non-contrast imaging modalities in pre-procedure planning; (2) evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility and safety of a new TAVI technique without using iodinated contrast; (3) to&#xD;
      determine the incidence of acute renal failure in patients with aortic stenosis and chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease undergoing TAVI, using the new technique without contrast. The study will be&#xD;
      divided into two stages. In the pilot phase, 25 consecutive patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (stage ≥ 3a) will have the TAVI planning and procedure performed without the use of&#xD;
      iodinated contrast, but with all the steps subjected to verification by the standard&#xD;
      technique, to ensure the safety of the patient. The occurrence of the combined primary safety&#xD;
      outcome composed of adverse clinical events within 30 days (defined by the VARC-2 criteria)&#xD;
      in less than 20% of cases will be used to define the continuity of the study. In the second&#xD;
      phase, 50 patients with chronic kidney disease stage ≥ 3b will be submitted to TAVI with the&#xD;
      &quot;zero contrast&quot; technique. The primary outcome assessed at this stage of the study will be&#xD;
      the incidence of AKI within 7 days after TAVI using the new technique in this high-risk&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      This will be a prospective, single-center, single-arm clinical trial, to be carried out at&#xD;
      the Heart Institute of Hospital das Clínicas, Faculty of Medicine, University of São Paulo&#xD;
      (InCor - HC - FMUSP). The study will be divided into two phases. The first phase (&quot;pilot&quot;)&#xD;
      will test the concept, feasibility and safety of using a &quot;zero contrast&quot; strategy to carry&#xD;
      out the planning and procedure of TAVI through transfemoral access with the self-expanding&#xD;
      bioprosthesis Evolut R / Pro in 25 consecutive patients with CKD. The second phase (&quot;zero&#xD;
      contrast&quot;) will include 50 patients with CKD who will be submitted to transfemoral TAVI with&#xD;
      the Evolut R / Pro bioprosthesis using the &quot;zero contrast&quot; approach, seeking to evaluate the&#xD;
      results of the procedure and the incidence of AKI with the new strategy.&#xD;

    <description>The incidence of AKI up to 7 days after TAVI will be the primary outcome of the &quot;zero contrast&quot; phase.&#xD;
Acute renal failure will be defined according to the VARC-2 criteria and classified into 3 stages:&#xD;
Stage 1: 1.5-1.99-fold increase in serum creatinine compared to baseline OR absolute increase of 0.3 mg / dL OR urine output less than 0.5 mL / kg / h for more than 6 hours, but for less than 12 h;&#xD;
Stage 2: 2.0-2.99-fold increase in serum creatinine compared to baseline OR urine output below 0.5 mL / kg / h for more than 12 hours, but for less than 24 hours;&#xD;
Stage 3: greater than 3-fold increase in serum creatinine compared to baseline OR baseline serum creatinine equal to or greater than 4.0 mg / dL with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg / dL OR urine output less than 0, 3 mL / kg / h for 24h or more OR anuria for 12h or more. The need for renal replacement therapy, regardless of other criteria, is classified as stage 3 AKI.</description>
