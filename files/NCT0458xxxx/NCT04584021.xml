      Introduction: Work stress has become more and more important in the last years as it affects&#xD;
      both health and productivity of workers. In the last years, different wearables devices have&#xD;
      started to be used to monitor stress at work to understand their consequences on daily life&#xD;
      activity and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: to establish whether wearable wristbands are devices capable of determining the&#xD;
      work stress level of workers from a research center in Galicia, for which different variables&#xD;
      related to the work stress level and quality of life of these workers will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: The only inclusion criterion is to be a worker from a research center&#xD;
      from Galicia. As for exclusion criteria, will not be allowed to participate those workers who&#xD;
      are close to retirement ( &lt;5 years), have health issues that hinder participation in the&#xD;
      study, or present skin hypersensitivity or allergic reactions due to the materials the&#xD;
      wristbands are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to determine the viability, sample size, cost, and duration of the&#xD;
      study. This is an observational, analytic, and longitudinal study. In other words, in this&#xD;
      study different variables from the population of interest will be observed and recorded&#xD;
      without any direct intervention, so as to establish causality associations between these&#xD;
      variables. It is considered as longitudinal since a six-months tracking of the variables will&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the statistical analysis, different tests will be performed to analyse the&#xD;
      distribution, correlation, and association of the different features, as well as the&#xD;
      significant differences between them at different points of the study (detailed below).&#xD;

      Introduction: Stress is a natural phenomenon within the human body that prepares the organism&#xD;
      for action. However, due to the current life and work habits and demands, stress goes beyond&#xD;
      what is beneficial and starts to suppose a burden. Nowadays, work stress, which is defined as&#xD;
      &quot;a harmful reaction, which people have to deal with, to the pressures and undue demands&#xD;
      placed on them at work&quot;, has gained importance as it affects both health and productivity of&#xD;
      workers. If stress persists over time, it can lead to the syndrome known as Burnout, which&#xD;
      implies deep exhaustion, and inefficiency. In the last years, different wearable devices have&#xD;
      started to be used to monitor stress at work with the aim of understanding their consequences&#xD;
      on physical activity and sleep quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To establish whether wearable wristbands are devices capable of determining the&#xD;
      work stress level of workers from a research center in Galicia. To this end, it will be&#xD;
      determined the work stress level and quality of life of these workers to conclude if the&#xD;
      devices measure the work stress with precision. Also, different physical activity, sleep and&#xD;
      occupational functioning patterns will be identified to study the relation between them and&#xD;
      the work stress level and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Analysis: The study will be carried out with workers from a research center from&#xD;
      Galicia, being this the only inclusion criterion. As for exclusion criteria, workers will not&#xD;
      be allowed to participate if they are expected to retire in a period of 5 years or less, have&#xD;
      significant health issues that hinder the participation in the study, or present skin&#xD;
      hypersensitivity or allergic reactions caused by the materials the wristbands are made of.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pilot study to determine the viability, sample size, cost, and duration of the&#xD;
      study. Likewise, a pilot project has also been designed in this study in order to&#xD;
      &quot;demonstrate that the planned measurements, the data collection instruments and the data&#xD;
      management system are feasible and effective&quot;. This is an observational, analytical, and&#xD;
      longitudinal study. That is, in this study different variables of the population under study&#xD;
      will be observed and recorded without intervention and with the aim of establishing causal&#xD;
      associations between variables. It is considered longitudinal because variables will be&#xD;
      followed for 6 months, continuously recording and monitoring physical activity and the&#xD;
      quality of sleep (wristbands), and in a specific way, variables related to work stress,&#xD;
      quality of life, and perception of the quality of sleep and the level of physical activity&#xD;
      (specific evaluation tools).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the statistical analysis, and once the data are preprocessed, for the collected&#xD;
      variables the Kolmogorov-Smirnov will be applied to check if they behave as a normal&#xD;
      distribution. Otherwise, posterior analysis with non-parametric tests will be performed. The&#xD;
      correlation of the numeric variables will be analysed through the Pearson or Spearman's Rho&#xD;
      correlation depending on the sample distribution. A Chi-Square test will be used to assess&#xD;
      the association between categoric variables unless the observed frequencies are &lt;5%, for&#xD;
      which a likelihood ratio test would be used. Regarding the association between quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative variables, the mean comparison with a T and ANOVA test, or a Mann Whitney and&#xD;
      Kruskal Wallis test, as appropriate, will be performed. To finish, with the aim of&#xD;
      determining whether there are significant differences between the results of the beginning,&#xD;
      mid-term and final evaluations, a Wilcoxon test will be applied.&#xD;
