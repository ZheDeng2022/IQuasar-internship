  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and insomnia are more prevalent in Veterans than in the general&#xD;
      community. Furthermore, insomnia is comorbid in 36-91% of individuals with AUD and&#xD;
      jeopardizes recovery by increasing their risk for relapse and complicating their clinical&#xD;
      profile. The VA/DoD guidelines recommend four medications for the treatment of AUD. Among&#xD;
      them, topiramate (TOP) has demonstrated promise in improving abstinence and decreasing heavy&#xD;
      drinking but without any clinical improvement in sleep continuity. The recommended treatment&#xD;
      for insomnia is Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), and it has shown efficacy&#xD;
      in improving insomnia but with minimal benefit in improving abstinence. The proposed study&#xD;
      will evaluate whether augmenting TOP with CBT-I bolsters recovery in AUD, by improving&#xD;
      abstinence and decreasing insomnia. If this strategy shows good clinical results and the&#xD;
      findings are replicated in a multi-center trial then the combination of TOP with CBT-I should&#xD;
      be considered a standard component of the initial management of AUD with insomnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) and insomnia are both more prevalent among Veterans than in the&#xD;
      general population. While insomnia is 3-9 times more prevalent in AUD than in the general&#xD;
      population, patients with comorbid AUD and insomnia suffer from higher severity of AUD with&#xD;
      increased alcohol craving, reduced quality of life, impaired interpersonal functioning,&#xD;
      higher risks for suicidal behavior and relapse during early abstinence. There are limited&#xD;
      options to treat drinking behavior and insomnia due to side effect profile (disulfiram) or&#xD;
      only modest impact on drinking outcomes (naltrexone and acamprosate). Topiramate (TOP), an&#xD;
      FDA-approved medication for seizures and migraines, showed moderate effect sizes in achieving&#xD;
      abstinence and decreasing craving, when compared to placebo, in a recent meta-analysis.&#xD;
      However, TOP therapy did not provide clinical improvement in objective sleep or subjective&#xD;
      insomnia. Furthermore, hypnotic medication treatments with trazodone, gabapentin, and&#xD;
      ramelteon have shown variable impact for sleep disturbance and abstinence. By contrast, all&#xD;
      four studies evaluating Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) have shown a large&#xD;
      magnitude of effect for treating insomnia but with minimal to no effect on abstinence. Thus,&#xD;
      combining TOP and CBT-I will strengthen their recovery and improve their overall functioning.&#xD;
      This combination treatment will be the first personalized intervention in treating Veterans&#xD;
      with AUD and comorbid insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of treatment-seeking Veterans with AUD (N=174) will be initially treated with TOP&#xD;
      200 mg a day for six weeks, and then randomized to receive either CBT-I (N=87) or Sleep&#xD;
      Hygiene Education (SHE, a behavioral placebo intervention) (N=87) weekly for the next eight&#xD;
      weeks. The investigators will conduct CBT-I following the standard protocol using 30-minute&#xD;
      sessions to deliver its components (Sleep Restriction, Stimulus Control, Sleep Hygiene and&#xD;
      Cognitive Therapy). A post-intervention visit will be conducted eight weeks after the&#xD;
      intervention phase. The primary outcome measure will be the Percent Days Abstinent (as&#xD;
      computed from the Time Line Follow Back interview) and the insomnia severity (as assessed&#xD;
      using the Insomnia Severity Index). Also, the investigators will track other aspects of&#xD;
      alcohol use, sleep and daily functioning using TLFB, PACS, sleep diaries, BDI, and the STAI&#xD;
      to test whether successful treatment of drinking and insomnia will be associated with better&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in AUD. It is hypothesized that in Veterans with AUD, the combination of&#xD;
      TOP+CBT-I, as compared to TOP+SHE group, will lead to 1) a more significant percentage of&#xD;
      days abstinent from alcohol, and 2) superior sleep-related outcomes along with pre-post&#xD;
      treatment effect sizes comparable to the meta-analytic norms. If these hypotheses are&#xD;
      supported, the findings will need to be validated in a larger multi-center trial. If&#xD;
      validated, the findings would support: 1) including insomnia treatment as a standard&#xD;
      component of the initial protocol for treating AUD comorbid with insomnia, and 2) using&#xD;
      TOP+CBT-I combination treatment to manage this subpopulation of AUD patients.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Eight weeks of behavioral sleep intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Time Line Follow Back measure (TLFB): The TLFB provides assessment of drinking using a calendar format for the number of standard alcoholic beverages consumed per day. A standard drink, as defined by the National Institutes of Health, is 12 oz of regular beer, 5 oz of regular wine, or 1.5 oz of distilled spirits (e.g. whiskey). Numerous indices may be derived from the TLFB, such as the Percent Days Abstinent (PDA) proposed in this study. The PDA is derived as the percentage of days an individual reports being abstinent from alcohol within a given assessment time period.</description>

    <measure>Change in Insomnia Severity Index - Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Eight weeks of behavioral sleep intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI): This 7-item (0-4 Likert scales) measure yields a total score of 28. The norms for the scale are as follows: 0-7 represents no clinically significant insomnia; 8-14 represents sub threshold insomnia; 15-21 represents clinical insomnia (moderate severity); 21-28 represents clinical insomnia (severe). The scale provides a measure of severity of insomnia (overall), a measure of insomnia subtype, a measure of the diurnal effects of insomnia, and a measure of sleep &quot;satisfaction&quot;. The ISI will be completed at baseline and for all the subsequent study-related visits.</description>

    <description>CBT-I is conducted weekly for eight sessions during which the subjects meet individual with the study clinician for 45 minutes on the first session and for 30 minutes for sessions 2-8. Session 1 serves as an orientation and the onset of Sleep Restriction Therapy. Sessions 2 &amp; 3 deliver the three main components that include, Sleep Restriction Therapy, Stimulus control, and Sleep Hygiene. All the sessions excluding the last two sessions are dedicated to the titration of total sleep time and to ensure patient adherence. The fifth session is used to deliver a specific form of cognitive therapy. The final session is used to engage the patient in a relapse-prevention didactic (i.e., to review how insomnia becomes chronic and strategies that abort an extended episode of insomnia).</description>

    <description>This non-active control arm of behavioral sleep intervention consists of psychoeducation on sleep hygiene, sleep-related disturbances, and the effects of stress on sleep that will be delivered weekly for 8 weeks, for a time duration that is identical to the CBT-I sessions. The effect of stress on sleep is a commonly used control condition in insomnia clinical trials. SHE is preferred to a monitor-only condition as it will control for contact with the therapist and elapsed time during sessions.</description>
