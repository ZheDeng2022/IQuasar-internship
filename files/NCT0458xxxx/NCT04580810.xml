  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will conduct a randomized clinical trial comparing levels of treatment initiation,&#xD;
      engagement, and alcohol outcomes for a novel treatment strategy (CBT4CBT delivered in the&#xD;
      Black church) compared with traditional outpatient specialty addiction treatment for a large&#xD;
      sample of Black adults with AUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized clinical trial is to determine which setting (church or&#xD;
      specialty clinic) (1) has better treatment initiation and retention rates and (2) better AUD&#xD;
      outcomes as measured by percentage of days abstinent (PDA) (8 weeks, 3, 6 and 9 months follow&#xD;
      up).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial focusing on rates of treatment initiation,&#xD;
      engagement, and outcome in Black adults assigned to CBT4CBT in the Black Church relative to&#xD;
      the standard of care for this population. This study is focusing on individuals with AUD as&#xD;
      the needs assessment indicated that as the most common substance use problem in this setting.&#xD;
      Moreover, our focus groups and work with Church staff has indicated that alcohol use is less&#xD;
      stigmatized within the Black and the Church communities than other substance use. Thus, while&#xD;
      individuals with other substance use will be included, positioning the study as focusing&#xD;
      primarily on alcohol use will avoid potential issues of stigma and thus may facilitate&#xD;
      recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selecting a comparison condition for this novel intervention strategy is complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the primary rationale for delivering treatment in the Black church setting is that this&#xD;
      national network is seen as a trusted institution in the Black community, our research&#xD;
      questions center around (1) whether delivering CBT4CBT in the Black church is a safe and&#xD;
      effective alternative to standard care, (2) whether it engages and retains individuals better&#xD;
      than standard specialty care, (3) the extent to which this strategy reaches individuals who&#xD;
      would not otherwise seek treatment for AUD, (4) what kinds of individuals are particularly&#xD;
      suited to this setting, and (5) the relative costs of this novel form of treatment delivery.&#xD;
      Thus, a standard specialty care at Midwestern Connecticut Council on Alcohol (MCCA) as the&#xD;
      comparison condition was selected. MCCA is a non-profit, community-based provider in the&#xD;
      predominantly Black Dixwell neighborhood, not far from Dixwell Church and has a positive&#xD;
      reputation in the Black community. The primary treatment modality is group therapy. In 2019,&#xD;
      MCCA treated over 500 unique individuals (44% female, 35% African American, 20% Latino). MCCA&#xD;
      staff are diverse and multidisciplinary. Clinic Director Steven Palma has agreed to provide a&#xD;
      dedicated triage slot for this study so individuals can be admitted and assigned a group&#xD;
      within one week, reducing a key barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study settings will be balanced in several ways, with few barriers to care, both in&#xD;
      the same neighborhood, and assignment of participants to a group within one week of&#xD;
      randomization, thus preserving equipoise and balancing attractiveness of both sites to&#xD;
      participants as much as possible. They will differ primarily in setting (church versus&#xD;
      specialty care), in treatment content (CBT4CBT with spirituality elements versus group&#xD;
      treatment with some CBT content), and group leaders (CHAs versus masters-level staff).&#xD;
