  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Xerostomia is defined as the subjective sensation of dry mouth, and may be associated with a&#xD;
      reduction in saliva secretion and composition. It is one of the most common complaints found&#xD;
      in patients after irradiation in the head and neck area. This complaint is found in a large&#xD;
      majority of patients during radiotherapy, continuing for several years after stopping&#xD;
      radiotherapy (93% during radiotherapy and 40 to 60% after two years post-radiotherapy). The&#xD;
      advent of IMRT (Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy) has reduced this complaint, but it&#xD;
      still concerns 40% of patients undergoing post-radiotherapy affecting the head and neck.&#xD;
      Xerostomia is responsible for pronunciation difficulties, dysphagia, dysgeusia, alteration of&#xD;
      the oral condition leading to a significant alteration of the quality of life. This complaint&#xD;
      is maximal in the first six months following radiotherapy, then stabilizes or even regresses&#xD;
      in the year following radiotherapy but can persist well beyond the end of the irradiation. At&#xD;
      present, there are few treatments that have been shown to be truly effective. Systemic&#xD;
      treatments (sialogues, cholinergic agonists, parasympathomimetic and muscarinic agonists,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, etc.) allow partial improvement with delayed and not prolonged&#xD;
      effectiveness. Many studies evaluating the efficacy of these therapies have shown&#xD;
      contradictory and insufficient results (less than half of the patients present an improvement&#xD;
      under treatment), without ever allowing a complete cure. Surgical treatments by submaxillary&#xD;
      gland transfer have also been studied, but at the price of significant morbidity&#xD;
      (cervicotomy, risk to the chin nerve in post-radial areas, etc.). Conformational radiotherapy&#xD;
      with intensity modulation has made it possible to reduce the severity of xerostomia but does&#xD;
      not make it possible to free oneself from this complication. Patients often find themselves&#xD;
      reduced to symptomatic adjunctive treatments (gland massage, sprays, hydration,&#xD;
      acupuncture...) without curative treatment. There is therefore a real need to respond to the&#xD;
      complaint expressed by many patients by proposing an effective and long-lasting therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-radiation xerostomia appears from the first days after irradiation and for very low&#xD;
      doses (from a dose received of 5 Gy). A first phase appears in the first 10 days following&#xD;
      radiotherapy, with regression of salivary secretion by blocking the muscarinic membrane&#xD;
      receptors of acinar cells and destruction of the endothelial cells responsible for glandular&#xD;
      angiogenesis. With increasing doses, apoptosis of stem cells and acinar cells of the salivary&#xD;
      glands follows, leading to atrophy and irreversible fibrosis beyond 60 Gy, due to the lack of&#xD;
      renewal of acinar stem cells. Four phases in the pathophysiology of post-radial xerostomia&#xD;
      are thus described. Phases 1 and 2, appearing respectively between 0-10 days and 10-60 days,&#xD;
      are characterized by a severe decrease in saliva production, first without a decrease in&#xD;
      amylase production or in the number of acinar cells in phase 1 and then with a decrease in&#xD;
      amylase and in the number of acinar cells in phase 2. This acute phase, initially reversible,&#xD;
      is thought to be related either to apoptosis of acinar cells or to acinar cell membrane&#xD;
      dysfunction. Then phases 3 and 4, appearing respectively between 60-120 days (stability of&#xD;
      the secretion and number of acinar cells) and between 120 and 240 days, are characterized by&#xD;
      a senescence of mature acinar cells, which are not renewed due to sterilization of the&#xD;
      glandular stem cells, leading to a definitive deterioration of the secretory functions by&#xD;
      glandular atrophy and irreversible fibrosis. A study by the QUANTEC (Quantitative Analyses of&#xD;
      Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) group showed that severe xerostomia (defined as a&#xD;
      decrease of more than 25% in the amount of saliva produced) could be seen in IMRT when the&#xD;
      four major salivary glands were given a dose &gt;25Gy or if at least one parotid gland was not&#xD;
      preserved at a dose &lt;20Gy. The pathophysiology of post-radial xerostomia has similarities&#xD;
      with that of other causes of xerostomia. Gougerot-Sjögren's syndrome is characterized by&#xD;
      salivary gland infiltration by B and T macrophages and lymphocytes targeting salivary&#xD;
      muscarinic receptors. This is followed by inflammation and lymphocytic infiltration with&#xD;
      replacement of glandular acinar cells by fibrosis associated with cellular apoptosis and thus&#xD;
      glandular atrophy. The complaint of xerostomia and objective reduction of saliva secretion&#xD;
      are frequently found in post-irradiation therapy, used for the treatment of thyroid cancer.&#xD;
      Indeed, salivary glandular cells have a strong affinity for Iodine-131 leading to&#xD;
      inflammation of the ductal epithelium and endothelial cells, resulting in ductal and&#xD;
      glandular fibrosis. These pathophysiological changes during Gougerot-Sjögren and&#xD;
      post-irradiotherapy are correlated with sialendoscopic findings: stenosis, sialadenitis,&#xD;
      sialadochitis, mucous plugs, erythema... . However, studies have shown the effectiveness of&#xD;
      sialendoscopy in improving the symptomatology of xerostomia and in increasing salivary&#xD;
      production, by simple irrigation (of serum alone or associated with local injection of&#xD;
      corticosteroids) and root canal dilatation in patients with these non-lithiasic pathologies.&#xD;
      Therapeutic success would be attributable to the removal of mucosal plugs, removal of&#xD;
      stenosis and reduction of inflammation (25). This is all the more so since the saliva flow&#xD;
      produced by the acinar cells and the salivary ionic composition (by ductal ionic&#xD;
      reabsorption) are strongly dependent on the ductal flow, and therefore on the presence of&#xD;
      possible stenosis or mucous plugs. The improvement of the symptomatology and salivary&#xD;
      production would be visible in the immediate postoperative period (from the first weeks),&#xD;
      with a prolonged therapeutic effect beyond several months, after a single sialendoscopy.&#xD;
      Recently, a study has shown the efficacy of sialendoscopy to improve chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      xerostomy symptoms using Ac-PSMA-617 for the treatment of prostate cancer, which is also the&#xD;
      cause of Grade 1 xerostomia. Our study is based on the pathophysiological similarity of&#xD;
      post-radial xerostomy with Gougerot-Sögren's syndrome and post-irradial xerostomy. The&#xD;
      promising results of recently published sialendoscopic studies in these two pathologies allow&#xD;
      us to envisage a potential benefit of sialendoscopy in a post-radial context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the context of this work, the investigators will compare sialendoscopy associated with a&#xD;
      local injection of corticosteroids to the usual management based on the hygieno-dietary rules&#xD;
      (HDR) consisting of regular drinking and a diet with a high dose of corticosteroids.&#xD;
