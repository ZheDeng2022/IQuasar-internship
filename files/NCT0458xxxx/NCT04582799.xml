    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide,&#xD;
      resulting in a social and economic burden that is substantial and increasing. Exacerbations&#xD;
      affect the prognosis and quality of life of patients with COPD. Hospital mortality of&#xD;
      patients admitted for a hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD is approximately 10% and the&#xD;
      long-term outcome is poor. In addition, hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD have serious&#xD;
      negative impacts on patient quality of life, lung function and costs. Thus, prompt treatment&#xD;
      of exacerbations may impact the clinical progression of COPD by ameliorating quality of life&#xD;
      and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care for patients with COPD exacerbation that need ICU admission for management&#xD;
      of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and severe respiratory acidosis is non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV). When NIV fails (arterial pH remains &lt; 7.30), invasive ventilation through&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation is initiated to restore adequate gas-exchange. Extracorporeal&#xD;
      circuits designed to remove CO2 (ECCO2R) may enhance the efficacy of NIV to remove CO2 and&#xD;
      avoid the worsening of respiratory acidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent matched cohort study with historical control, showed that: (a) the hazard of being&#xD;
      intubated was three times higher in patients treated with &quot;NIV-only&quot; than in patients treated&#xD;
      with &quot;NIV-plus-ECCO2R&quot;; (b) hospital mortality was significantly lower in &quot;NIV plus ECCO2R&quot;&#xD;
      than in &quot;NIV-only&quot; [8% (95% CI 1.0-26.0%) vs. 33% (95% CI 18.0-57.5%), respectively].&#xD;
      However, ECCO2R-related complications were observed in almost half of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consistency of the above discussed data, and the observation of the continuous increase&#xD;
      use of ECCO2R despite the lack of solid evidence confirm that the equipoise regarding the use&#xD;
      of ECCO2R may justify a randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether patients with&#xD;
      respiratory acidosis refractory to NIV should be intubated and take the risks associated with&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation, or should be connected to ECCO2R to avoid intubation, but&#xD;
      run the risk of the potentially serious ECCO2R-related complication The main objective of&#xD;
      this randomized multicenter clinical trial is to test the hypothesis that in patients with&#xD;
      acute life-threatening exacerbation of COPD, use of ECCO2R could increase event-free survival&#xD;
      as compared to standard of care.&#xD;

      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide,&#xD;
      resulting in a social and economic burden that is substantial and increasing. Exacerbations&#xD;
      affect the prognosis and quality of life of patients with COPD. Hospital mortality of&#xD;
      patients admitted for a hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD is approximately 10% and the&#xD;
      long-term outcome is poor. In addition, hypercapnic exacerbation of COPD have serious&#xD;
      negative impacts on patient quality of life, lung function and costs. Thus, prompt treatment&#xD;
      of exacerbations may impact the clinical progression of COPD by ameliorating quality of life&#xD;
      and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological hallmarks of COPD patients include expiratory flow limitation and&#xD;
      small airway closure. Under these circumstances, a prolonged expiratory time is the&#xD;
      compensatory mechanism patients adopt to maintain a stable tidal breathing. COPD&#xD;
      exacerbations result in higher respiratory rates and reduced expiratory time, leading to&#xD;
      dynamic hyperinflation, elevated intrathoracic pressures, and excessive work of breathing.&#xD;
      Alteration of the balance between (a) the decreased capacity of the respiratory muscles to&#xD;
      generate pressure, and (b) the increased mechanical respiratory load due to expiratory flow&#xD;
      limitation and small airway closure leads to CO2 retention. The consequent reduction of&#xD;
      alveolar ventilation leads to a further worsening of CO2 retention and increased work of&#xD;
      breathing. This vicious circle is the underlying mechanisms responsible of acute respiratory&#xD;
      failure requiring admission in the intensive care unit (ICU) for ventilatory support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care for patients with COPD exacerbation that need ICU admission for management&#xD;
      of acute hypercapnic respiratory failure and severe respiratory acidosis is non-invasive&#xD;
      ventilation (NIV). When NIV fails (arterial pH remains &lt; 7.30), invasive ventilation through&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation is initiated to restore adequate gas-exchange.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extracorporeal circuits designed to remove CO2 (ECCO2R) have been used in patients with acute&#xD;
      hypercapnic respiratory failure since ECCO2R may enhance the efficacy of NIV to remove CO2&#xD;
      and avoid the worsening of respiratory acidosis. Although available studies are limited to&#xD;
      case series, several ECCO2R devices have been developed and proposed for the clinical use in&#xD;
      patients with COPD. These systems often represent modifications of renal replacement therapy&#xD;
      circuits, and are characterized by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. veno-venous by-pass systems&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. extracorporeal blood flow of 0.3-0.5 litres/min&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 13 Fr bore catheters or a single co-axial catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. very low doses or no heparin&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. minimal volumes for &quot;priming&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technological implementation of ECCO2-R is therefore closer to device for renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy than full ECMO. CO2 is removed through a double-lumen catheter and&#xD;
      constantly propelled, by a non-occlusive rotating pump, though an artificial membrane lung (a&#xD;
      filter adding oxygen and removing carbon dioxide) connected to a source of 100% O2 (flow 6-8&#xD;
      liters/min). These systems are able to reduce PaCO2 by 20-25%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent matched cohort study with historical control, compared &quot;NIV-plus-ECCO2R&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;NIV-only&quot; in patients at risk of NIV failure, and showed that (a) the hazard of being&#xD;
      intubated was three times higher in patients treated with &quot;NIV-only&quot; than in patients treated&#xD;
      with &quot;NIV-plus-ECCO2R&quot;; (b) hospital mortality was significantly lower in &quot;NIV plus ECCO2R&quot;&#xD;
      than in &quot;NIV-only&quot; [8% (95% CI 1.0-26.0%) vs. 33% (95% CI 18.0-57.5%), respectively].&#xD;
      However, ECCO2R-related complications were observed in almost half of the patients. A recent&#xD;
      systematic review evaluated the efficacy and safety of ECCO2R in patients with hypercapnic&#xD;
      respiratory failure across 12 studies and showed that the majority of patients were either&#xD;
      successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation or sustained on NIV, avoiding intubation.&#xD;
      However, this high success rates, was associated with a high frequency of potentially severe&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consistency of the above discussed data, and the observation of the continuous increase&#xD;
      use of ECCO2R despite the lack of solid evidence confirm that the equipoise regarding the use&#xD;
      of ECCO2R may justify a randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether patients with&#xD;
      respiratory acidosis refractory to NIV should be intubated and take the risks associated with&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation, or should be connected to ECCO2R to avoid intubation, but&#xD;
      run the risk of the potentially serious ECCO2R-related complication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this randomized multicenter clinical trial is to test the hypothesis&#xD;
      that in patients with acute life-threatening exacerbation of COPD, use of ECCO2R could&#xD;
      increase event-free survival as compared to standard of care. Event free survival is defined&#xD;
      as survival at day 28 free of any of the followings: (a) development of sepsis; (b)&#xD;
      occurrence of a second episode of COPD exacerbation requiring or not mechanical ventilation;&#xD;
      (c) occurrence of severe hypoxemia; (d) prolonged mechanical ventilation (e) death.&#xD;
