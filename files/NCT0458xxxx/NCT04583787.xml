    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the feasibility of myocardial Standardized Uptake Volume (SUV)&#xD;
      assessment by means of X- (Single photon emission tomography) SPECT/Computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
      to assess normal reference value under rest and stress in a homogeneous population without&#xD;
      Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and to assess the variation of absolute quantitative SUV&#xD;
      measurements under rest and stress. The values will be evaluated in comparison with perfusion&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET)/CT (using 82Rb as perfusion tracer) and CT coronary&#xD;
      angiography (CTCA) with contrast medium.).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will receive a 82Rb-PET/CT with CT based coronary angiography (CCTA) as part of clinical care. Subsequently, patients will undergo a stress-rest 99mTc-sestamibi myocardial perfusion SPECT, which will be evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Absolute flow quantification (assessed by PET/CT)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 minutes at Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Consistency of quantitative parameters assessed by xSPECT compared to the &quot;gold standard&quot; which includes absolute flow quantification (assessed by PET/CT). The feasibility of myocardial SUV assessment by means of X-SPECT/CT will be tested by correlating the automatically calculated values with automatically calculated, PET-derived absolute blood flows. Rationale: values of quantified myocardial uptake are expected to be reliable the more they correlate with absolutely quantified myocardial blood flow in the myocardium, given the expected proportionality between uptake and subtending coronary blood flow.</description>

    <description>Consistency of quantitative parameters assessed by xSPECT compared to the &quot;gold standard&quot; which includes the presence of significant coronary stenoses (CTCA). Normal reference values under rest and stress in a homogeneous population without CAD will be evaluated in comparison with perfusion 82Rb-PET/CT and CT coronary angiography (CTCA) with contrast medium. Rationale: a coronary artery disease can be ruled out in patients with normal 82Rb-PET and without detectable stenoses on CTCA, thus identifying a subpopulation of normal patients, wherein reference normal values can be provided.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determination of uptake patterns that are suggestive for CAD</measure>
    <time_frame>one point assessment after interventions at day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Values of quantified myocardial uptake (SUV) will be identified and correlated to pathological perfusion patterns as determined by 82Rb-PET/CT.&#xD;
Rationale: it is expected that patients with pathological PET imaging and reduced flow rates also present with reduced myocardial uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi.</description>

    <measure>Quantitative 99mTC-sestamibi uptake values of the whole myocardium</measure>
    <time_frame>one point assessment after interventions at day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative 99mTC-sestamibi uptake values of the whole myocardium, analysis of the diagnostic accuracy. Values will be correlated to image-driven diagnosis of CAD Rationale: it is foreseen that a diagnosis can be provided by finding reduced myocardial uptake of 99mTc-sestamibi</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Comparison of PET/CT, standard Myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) and new quantitative 99mTc-sestamibi xSPECT/quantitative computerized tomography (QCT) in the same patient</measure>
    <time_frame>one point assessment after interventions at day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of PET/CT, standard MPS and new quantitative 99mTc-sestamibi xSPECT/QCT in the same patient. Using the final clinical diagnosis of CAD, the diagnostic accuracy of each methodology will be tested by means of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.&#xD;
Rationale: it is expected that a quantitative approach can increase the diagnostic accuracy of SPECT by enhancing its sensitivity in case of globally reduced myocardial perfusion, similarly to what gained by quantitative PET</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interobserver variability of all imaging modalities</measure>
    <time_frame>one point assessment after interventions at day 2</time_frame>
    <description>Interobserver variability of all imaging modalities. A kappa- correlation coefficient will be calculated for all three modalities.&#xD;
Rationale: the quantitative data should provide higher interobserver consistency in the evaluation of patients with suspected CAD with SPECT, thus allowing for similar variability compared to quantitative PET.</description>
