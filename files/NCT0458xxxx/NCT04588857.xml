  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a frequent cause of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)&#xD;
      in men. One fourth of men older than 70 have moderate to severe LUTS that impair their&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL). Prostatic artery embolization (PAE) is a new minimally invasive&#xD;
      technique proven effective in reducing LUTS comparable to the mainstay treatment - the&#xD;
      transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common side effect of PAE is a collection of inflammation-related symptoms known as&#xD;
      the postembolization syndrome (PES). The symptoms include pelvic pain, fever, nausea, and&#xD;
      transient worsening of LUTS (painful and difficult urination). PES is a self-limiting&#xD;
      condition that is treated symptomatically with painkillers and antipyretics. However, PES can&#xD;
      be so severe that the patients experience high fever, shivers, dysuria and urgency mimicking&#xD;
      a septicemia from the urinary tract. It is a clinical challenge to avoid exposure to&#xD;
      unnecessary antibiotics treatment in those situations. A subset of patients may need&#xD;
      admission to the hospital for observation, especially in case of fever. Usually, PES resolves&#xD;
      within a week after PAE. Steroids have been successfully used to reduce the incidence and&#xD;
      severity of PES after a number of procedures in interventional radiology. The investigators&#xD;
      postulate that steroids can have a similar effect in reducing PES after PAE. In this study,&#xD;
      the efficacy of single high dose postprocedural dexamethasone (DEXA) administration in&#xD;
      reducing PES after PAE will be evaluated, compared to placebo.&#xD;
