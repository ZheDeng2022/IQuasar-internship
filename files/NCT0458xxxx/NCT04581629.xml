      A Phase 2b open label, dose finding study to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy&#xD;
      of CLTX-305 (encaleret) in Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (ADH) Type 1&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant hypocalcemia Type 1 is a rare familial genetic form of hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
      Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (ADH) Type 1 is typically passed down from affected parents&#xD;
      to their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2b open label, dose finding study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      CLTX-305 (encaleret) in Autosomal Dominant Hypocalcemia (ADH) Type 1 as well as the effects&#xD;
      of CLTX-305 (encaleret) on blood calcium concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated duration of this study is 41 months. This study plans to evaluate multiple&#xD;
      doses of the investigational drug CLTX-305 (encaleret), in addition to safety and efficacy.&#xD;
      CLTX-305 is administered orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into 3 Periods followed by a Long-Term Extension (LTE):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periods 1: Up to 8 study participants will be admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 7 days,&#xD;
      where they will be administered different doses of CLTX-305 (encaleret) for up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: Participants from Period 1, and up to 10 new study participants will be admitted to&#xD;
      the NIH Clinical Center for 7 days, where they will be administered different doses of&#xD;
      CLTX-305 (encaleret) for up to 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3: 24 weeks during which eligible study participants who completed Period 2 will take&#xD;
      CLTX-305 (encaleret) at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LTE: Up to 25 months during which eligible study participants who completed Period 3 will&#xD;
      take CLTX-305 (encaleret) at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants may:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in Period 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in Period 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in both Period 1 and Period 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in Period 3 after completing Period 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in LTE after completing Period 3&#xD;
