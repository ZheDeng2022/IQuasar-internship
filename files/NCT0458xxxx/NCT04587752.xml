      This study will perform a clinical trial with adolescent girls to pilot a new&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) for weight-related bullying testing (1) feasibility, (2)&#xD;
      acceptability, and (3) initial efficacy. The treatment will be conducted via audio/video&#xD;
      telehealth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Youth with obesity are more likely to be bullied than healthy-weight peers and weight-related&#xD;
      bullying is the most common form of bullying. Treating bullying during childhood could reduce&#xD;
      immediate and long-term health consequences, but there are no established individual-level&#xD;
      treatments for weight-related bullying despite recommendations that they could improve&#xD;
      children's health. This study will develop and test a new treatment for adolescent girls&#xD;
      (11-17 years old) who have experienced bullying due to weight. The treatment will address&#xD;
      traumatic stress and potentially co-occurring or developing problems with unhealthy&#xD;
      weight-control behaviors, disordered eating, and weight. The treatment will be conducted via&#xD;
      audio/video telehealth to increase accessibility and is therefore available to anyone in the&#xD;
      United States who meets eligibility criteria.&#xD;
