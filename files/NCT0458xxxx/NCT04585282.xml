      Objective to explore whether cbt-i plus is more effective and feasible for patients with&#xD;
      insomnia complicated with anxiety and depression than the traditional cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: cbt-i plus is superior to cbt-i in efficacy and feasibility.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study was to explore the treatment of cognitive behavioral enhancement of&#xD;
      insomnia (cbt-i plus), which was randomly divided into cbt-i plus intervention group (Study&#xD;
      Group) and cbt-i intervention group (control group). The study group used the unified&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy manual for insomnia (cbt-i plus) for one-to-one individual&#xD;
      treatment intervention, once a week, 45-50 minutes each time, a total of 8 times; the control&#xD;
      group used the unified cognitive behavioral therapy manual for insomnia (cbt-i) for&#xD;
      one-on-one treatment intervention, once a week, 45-50 minutes each time, a total of 8 times.&#xD;
      The related indexes were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after&#xD;
      enrollment, and were followed up at 12 weeks and 24 weeks after enrollment. Hypothesis: cbt-i&#xD;
      plus is superior to cbt-i in efficacy and feasibility.&#xD;
