  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest pain remains one of the most common, potentially serious presenting complaints for&#xD;
      adults emergency department visits with approximately 7.6 million yearly visits in the united&#xD;
      states. The priority for emergency physician is to determine whether these patients with&#xD;
      acute chest pain have a potential life threatening underlying etiology. The great challenge&#xD;
      is to differentiate patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and those with other&#xD;
      more benign conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a global tendency for ED physician to over investigate chest pain patients , even in&#xD;
      low-risk patients. This kind of practice leads to resource over-utilization and a huge health&#xD;
      costs waste contrasting with no outcomes improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, physicians have been searching tools, ranging from specific diagnostic tests&#xD;
      to entire strategies of evaluation, to appropriately stratify the risk in patients with chest&#xD;
      pain in order to simultaneously prevent major adverse cardiac events and reduce unnecessary&#xD;
      testing and hospitalizations. Many bioclinical scores have been developed, such as the TIMI&#xD;
      score and the GRACE score.The HEART score is one of the more recently proposed model derived&#xD;
      through a process involving expert opinion and review of medical literature. It is calculated&#xD;
      based on admission data of medical history, EKG, age, cardiovascular risk factors and&#xD;
      troponin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEART score was created specifically to identify ED patients presenting with&#xD;
      undifferentiated chest pain who were at low risk as well as patients at high risk of&#xD;
      short-term MACE occurrence. HEART score has been widely reported to outperform the TIMI and&#xD;
      the GRACE scores. Several scientific societies are encouraging the use of HEART score, for&#xD;
      evaluating patients with chest pain suggestive of ACS in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of our investigation is to validate HEART score as a prognostication tool among ED&#xD;
      patients with chest pain in teaching hospitals in Tunisia.&#xD;

      Chest pain remains one of the most common, potentially serious presenting complaints for&#xD;
      adults emergency department visits with approximately 7.6 million yearly visits in the united&#xD;
      states. The priority for emergency physician is to determine whether these patients with&#xD;
      acute chest pain have a potential life threatening underlying etiology. The great challenge&#xD;
      is to differentiate patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome and those with other&#xD;
      more benign conditions. Obviously, medical history, clinical examination, and laboratory&#xD;
      values may help to identify patients with true ACS. None are sufficiently accurate to be used&#xD;
      independently. Thus, about 5% of ACS patients are inappropriately discharged annually.&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a global tendency for ED physician to overinvestigate chest pain patients&#xD;
      with further, often more invasive testing, even in low-risk patients. This kind of practice&#xD;
      leads to resource overutilization and a huge health costs waste contrasting with no outcomes&#xD;
      improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, physicians were searching tools, ranging from specific diagnostic tests to&#xD;
      entire strategies of evaluation, to appropriately risk stratify patients with chest pain in&#xD;
      order to simultaneously prevent major adverse cardiac events and reduce unnecessary testing&#xD;
      and hospitalisations. Based on the principal that a prompt quick and accurate identification&#xD;
      of patients who are at high and low risk of developing major adverse cardiac events is&#xD;
      paramount, and in order to optimally allocate ED and hospital resources, many bioclinical&#xD;
      scores have been developed. One of the most known risk scores is TIMI score, which was&#xD;
      originally derived and validated in a population of in-patients with unstable angina and non&#xD;
      ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Its main performance is to predict early&#xD;
      occurrence of major cardiovascular events (MACE). However, TIMI score like many other&#xD;
      specific scores gave conflicting results when applied on chest pain patients in the ED. The&#xD;
      HEART score is one of the more recently proposed model derived through a process involving&#xD;
      expert opinion and review of medical literature. It is calculated based on admission data of&#xD;
      medical history, EKG, age, cardiovascular risk factors and troponin levels. The HEART score&#xD;
      was created specifically to identify ED patients presenting with undifferentiated chest pain&#xD;
      who were at low risk as well as patients at high risk of short-term MACE occurrence. HEART&#xD;
      score has been widely reported to outperform the TIMI and the GRACE scores. Several&#xD;
      scientific societies are encouraging the use of HEART score, for evaluating patients with&#xD;
      chest pain suggestive of ACS in the ED. A recent systematic review comprehensively compared&#xD;
      the leading clinical prediction rules for chest pain, including the TIMI, the HEART, and the&#xD;
      GRACE scores. Among the three risk stratification tools, the HEART score was found to be the&#xD;
      most useful for managing patients with undifferentiated chest pain who present to the ED&#xD;
      because it is simple, easy, and quick to use and it also has been validated in several&#xD;
      studies conducted in the ED. Additional studies providing further worldwide data about the&#xD;
      validation of this risk score will empower emergency physicians' decision making when relying&#xD;
      on this score in ruling in or ruling out their chest pain patients. The goal of our&#xD;
      investigation is to validate HEART score as a prognostication tool among ED patients with&#xD;
      chest pain in teaching hospitals in Tunisia.&#xD;
