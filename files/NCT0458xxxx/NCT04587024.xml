  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In solid organ transplant recipients, poor adherence to immunosuppressant medications carries&#xD;
      the risk of graft rejection (needing a new transplant), post-transplant complications, and&#xD;
      increased healthcare costs. Additionally, nonadherence to immunosuppressant medications is&#xD;
      imperative to short- and long-term outcomes. The rate of nonadherence in this population&#xD;
      varies vastly. Because of lacking objective and accurate nonadherence measurements, both to&#xD;
      immunosuppressant drugs and medical indications, the true implications and prevalence of&#xD;
      nonadherence is not yet well understood. Therefore, investigators believe that mobile health&#xD;
      (mHealth) technology has the potential to allow clinicians and researchers to more&#xD;
      comprehensively address and understand nonadherence in solid organ transplant recipients. The&#xD;
      aim of this study is to conduct a randomized control trial to compare medication adherence&#xD;
      among liver and kidney transplant patients who use the mHealth system against controls who do&#xD;
      not.&#xD;

    <measure>Medication Adherence via Medication Level Variability Index (MLVI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To compare medication adherence of solid organ transplant recipients, specifically liver and kidney transplants, using the mobile DOT (mDOT) application (i.e., intervention) to those who did not use the mDOT application (i.e., control). We will compare medication adherence between intervention and control arms using the Medication Level Variability Index (MLVI), a validated measure of adherence derived from the standard deviation of measured drug levels. We will look at the difference in MLVIs between the two solid organ transplant groups.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient reported adherence depending on their scores from the immunosuppressant therapy instrument (ITAS questionnaire) will be measured. This is a binary measure where A stands for 0% none, B stands for 1%-20%, C stands for 21-50%, D stands for greater than 50%.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Reported QoL as assessed by the PedsQL</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported QoL outcomes as measured by PedsQL to measure quality of life and medication adherence. Items are reversed scored and linearly transformed to a 0-100 scale, so that higher scores indicate better HRQOL (Health-Related Quality of Life).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>mHealth Usability Measurement</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported usability measured using the Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ), a 16-item questionnaire with score range of 1 to 16 with higher score indicating better usability. This will be done in the mHealth intervention arm only</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patterns of Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>To examine the patterns of medication adherence in transplant recipients in both groups to better understand baseline medication adherence. We will be doing this by looking at the adherence streaks (number of doses taken over number of doses expected).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Provider workflow as assessed by patient usage of the mDOT app</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Provider clinical workflow will be measured by evaluating patient usage on the app.</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported QoL as assessed by the SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Reported QoL Short Form (SF)-36 to measure quality of life and medication adherence. The scoring is scaled at 0 as the lowest and 100 as the highest. The lower the score, the more disability.</description>
