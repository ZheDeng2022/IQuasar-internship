  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of FTX-6058 in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and&#xD;
      multiple-dose study evaluating safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, with an open-label&#xD;
      initial food effect and CYP3A drug-drug interaction study, of FTX-6058 in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study in adult&#xD;
      subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will comprise 5 parts and will be conducted in healthy adult subjects and adult&#xD;
      subjects with sickle cell disease (SCD) (Part E only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD)&#xD;
      study in up to 8 cohorts of healthy adult subjects. Part B will be a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in up to 6 cohorts of&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects dosed once daily for 14 days. Part C will be an open-label pilot food&#xD;
      effect study in healthy adult subjects randomized to take FTX-6058 with and without a&#xD;
      high-fat meal, and Part D will be an open-label study to evaluate the potential of FTX-6058&#xD;
      to induce CYP3A (using midazolam) in healthy adult subjects. Part E will be a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study in adult subjects with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FTX-6058 in&#xD;
      healthy adult subjects and adult subjects with sickle cell disease as measured by the&#xD;
      frequency of adverse events. Secondary endpoints include evaluation of the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of single dose and multiple dose FTX-6058 in healthy adult subjects, pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      multiple dose FTX-6058 in adult subjects with sickle cell disease, evaluation of the&#xD;
      potential effect of food on FTX-6058 and evaluation of the potential for CYP3A induction by&#xD;
      FTX-6058 in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Major surgery, hospitalization, infection, significant bleeding, cerebrovascular&#xD;
             accident or seizure, or transfusion within 14 days prior to study enrollment through&#xD;
             conclusion of study follow-up period; elective surgery planned for the time period of&#xD;
             the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Sickle cell complication requiring hospitalization in the past 14 days or &gt; 6 total&#xD;
             VOCs over the past 12 months requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of opioids and/or opiates (unless used for chronic pain management),&#xD;
             anticoagulants, or medications that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to&#xD;
             starting study drug or anticipated need for any of these agents during the study.&#xD;
             (Pain meds for chronic pain management or VOC events occurring during the study may be&#xD;
             administered at the discretion of the investigator.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of voxelotor or hydroxyurea within 60 days prior to starting study drug.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Significant abnormalities in hepatic biochemical tests that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, are outside the typical range seen with SCD. Potential subjects are to&#xD;
             be excluded if alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥3× ULN&#xD;
             or albumin &lt;2.0 mg/dL or direct (conjugated) bilirubin ≥1.5 mg/dL or prothrombin&#xD;
             time/international normalized ratio &gt; 1.5 ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects with end stage renal disease defined as glomerular filtration rate &lt;10&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73m², using Schwartz formula or serum creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dL and calculated&#xD;
             creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min. Subjects on dialysis are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with abnormal laboratory results indicative of any significant medical&#xD;
             disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude the subject's&#xD;
             participation in the study or potentially obscure the interpretation of the scheduled&#xD;
             assessments. Screening laboratory assessments may be repeated up to twice at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects being treated with antiretroviral agents (such as didanosine and stavudine).&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, or hepatitis C such&#xD;
             that subjects are currently on therapy or will be placed on therapy during the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subjects receiving regularly scheduled transfusions to reduce levels of HbS.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Clinically diagnosed substance use disorder for alcohol or other illicit drugs of&#xD;
             abuse. Positive urine drug screen at screening or on day of admission for substances&#xD;
             other than marijuana or prescribed opioids/opiates for chronic pain management is&#xD;
             exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Pregnant or lactating female; or female of childbearing age unable or unwilling to&#xD;
             comply with birth control or abstinence during the course of the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Subject is investigative site personnel or member of their immediate family (spouse,&#xD;
             parent, child or sibling whether biological or legally adopted).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Heart rate corrected QT interval-Frederica's method (QTcF) &gt;450 msec male and &gt;470&#xD;
             msec female.&#xD;
