  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women who have experienced a sexual assault in the past six weeks and use&#xD;
      alcohol. The research involves completing a five week behavioral treatment for stress and&#xD;
      alcohol use. Participants will complete surveys during visits. Participants may also be asked&#xD;
      to complete brief daily assessments on their smart phones.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed Stage IA/IB study is to establish feasibility of an&#xD;
      integrated cognitive-behavioral intervention for reducing alcohol use disorder (AUD) and&#xD;
      posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among women who experienced a sexual assault&#xD;
      within the past six weeks. The intervention will be tested in an open label trial to make&#xD;
      final modifications to evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      five to six week integrated intervention with standardized repeated measures during a&#xD;
      one-month follow-up. Next, a pilot randomized controlled trial will be conducted among 54&#xD;
      recent sexual assault victims to evaluate feasibility and preliminary efficacy in reducing&#xD;
      AUD severity and PTSD symptoms. Ecological momentary assessments (EMA) will be used to assess&#xD;
      alcohol use, craving, and affect during the five-week treatment phase.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Alcohol Use Disorder symptoms on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The 10-item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test is a screening tool that will be used to gather data about participants' alcohol consumption, drinking behaviors, and alcohol related-problems. This screening measure is rated on a 5-point scale and based in terms of standard alcoholic drinks. A score of 8 or more is associated with harmful or hazardous drinking, a score of 13 or more in women, is likely to indicate alcohol dependence.</description>

    <measure>Change in Percent Drinking Days on The Time Line Follow-Back</measure>
    <time_frame>Participants will report on drinking during the 30 days prior to initiation of the study, and every day until study completion completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) will be used to assess heavy drinking in the past 30-days. This calendar-assisted interview yielded estimates in terms of the number of standard drinks consumed daily in the past 30 days used to obtain retrospective self-report of alcohol use by using a calendar and other memory prompts to stimulate recall.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to complete the 20-item Posttraumatic Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (PCL-5) to measure traumatic stress symptoms corresponding with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders -5 PTSD criteria. Items are rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely) with higher scores indicating greater traumatic stress symptoms. Total scores will be used.</description>

    <measure>Change in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms on The Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Clinician-Administered Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Scale for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (CAPS-5) is the gold standard in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) assessment. It is a structured 30-minute interview that can be used to diagnosis PTSD. Items focus on symptom presence, onset and duration of symptoms, subjective distress, impact on functioning, and symptom improvement.</description>

    <measure>Change in Depression Symptoms on The Beck Depression Inventory-II</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) is a widely used self-report measure for attitudes and symptoms of depression. The BDI-II includes 21 self-report items and takes approximately 5-minutes to complete. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale ranging from 0 to 3. The maximum total score is 63. A total score of 0-13 is considered minimal range, 14-19 is mild, 20-28 is moderate, and 29-63 is severe.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Anxiety Symptoms on The Beck Anxiety Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and after completion of study visits, approximately six weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) assesses symptoms of anxiety via 21-item self-report. The BAI reliability discriminates anxiety-disordered from non-anxiety disordered patients and demonstrates excellent convergence with related anxiety scales. The values for each item are summed yielding an overall or total score for all 21 symptoms that can range between 0 and 63 points. A total score of 0 - 7 is interpreted as a &quot;Minimal&quot; level of anxiety; 8 - 15 as &quot;Mild&quot;; 16 - 25 as &quot;Moderate&quot;, and; 26 - 63 as &quot;Severe&quot;.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be able to comprehend English.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A score of 3 or greater on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT-C)&#xD;

             anxiety disorder, or obsessive-compulsive disorder). The inclusion of subjects with&#xD;
             affective and other anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of&#xD;
             the co-existence of mood and other anxiety disorders among patients with AUD and PTSD&#xD;
             (Norman et al., 2018; Zinzow et al., 2012). Subjects may meet the Diagnostic and&#xD;
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria for another substance use&#xD;
             disorder if AUD is the primary substance of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects experiencing significant withdrawal symptoms, as evidence by a score of 10 or&#xD;
             more on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol (CIWA). These subjects&#xD;
             will be referred for clinical detoxification and may be re-assessed for study&#xD;
             eligibility after medically supervised detoxification has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals considered an immediate suicide risk, with current suicidal ideation and&#xD;
             intent. These individuals will be referred directly for treatment.&#xD;
