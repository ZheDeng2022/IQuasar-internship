  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of patients benefiting from an intensification of OMA treatment at 3 months,</measure>

    <measure>Proportion of patients benefiting from an intensification of OMA treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, at 6 months and at 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of patients who received an OMA dose greater than 300mg per dose and/or an administration interval of less than 4 weeks apart at 0, 6 and 9 months.</description>

    <measure>Life Quality</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3, 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the percentage and absolute change in DLQI score (Dermatology Life Quality Index score) versus baseline between patients who received a dose escalation and patients who received a standard dose of OMA.&#xD;
The DLQI is a dermatology-specific quality of life scale validated in the UCS. It assesses the impact of the disease on different aspects of life such as symptoms, feelings, activities of daily living, leisure, work, school and personal relationships. The total score ranges from 0 to 30 points: 0-1 = No effect of urticaria on the patient's life; between 2-5 = Mild effect of urticaria on the patient's life; between 6-10 = Moderate effect of urticaria on the patient's life; between 11-20 = Very strong effect of urticaria on the patient's life and between 21-30 = Extremely strong effect of urticaria on the patient's life.</description>

    <description>Comparison of the percentage and absolute change in Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) score versus baseline between patients who received a dose escalation and patients who received a standard dose of OMA.&#xD;
The Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire (CU-Q2oL) for Chronic Urticaria Quality of Life Questionnaire is a tool specifically designed to assess the quality of life of patients with Chronic Urticaria Syndrome and its variant for angioedema (AE-QoL). It is a 23-item self-administered questionnaire that asks patients to rate how often each problem affects them on a Likert scale with several options (minimum 1: not at all; maximum 5: a lot). Higher scores indicate poorer quality of life.</description>

    <measure>The angioedema activity</measure>
    <time_frame>at 3, 6 and 9 months</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of the percentage and absolute change in AAS28score versus baseline between patients who received a dose escalation and patients who received a standard dose of OMA.&#xD;
The AAS for angioedema activity score developed by Weller et al. consists of 5 questions to assess the severity of angioedema episodes. A severity grade increasing between 0 and 3 is assigned for each question. The final score corresponds to the sum of the scores for each day over a 28-day period (ASA28) and ranges from 0-420 (ASA28).</description>
