      This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of first-line, risk-stratified&#xD;
      rituximab-based MCD treatment in Malawi in a single-arm, phase II clinical trial. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 27 subjects with newly diagnosed or previously treated MCD (who&#xD;
      have not previously received rituximab) requiring treatment (B symptoms or hemoglobin &lt;10&#xD;
      g/dL). Subjects will be treated with four weekly doses of rituximab. High-risk subjects&#xD;
      (defined as patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &gt;2 or&#xD;
      hemoglobin &lt;8 g/dL) will also receive etoposide chemotherapy. Subjects will be followed for&#xD;
      one year for toxicity and two years for survival. The primary outcome will be safety, defined&#xD;
      as the frequency of ≥Grade 3 treatment-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (AEs). Secondary outcomes will be event-free survival (death, progression, or development of&#xD;
      NHL) and 1- and 2-year overall survival (OS). The investigators also aim to compare the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of first-line rituximab treatment for MCD in Malawi to chemotherapy (using&#xD;
      the investigators' historical controls).&#xD;
