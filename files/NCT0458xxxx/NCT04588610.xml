    <textblock>
      In anorexia nervosa,the eating disorder (ED) is the cause of thinness. In severe obesity, the&#xD;
      overweight is a symptom. This symptom, however, is only the consequence of possibly&#xD;
      deregulated eating behavior. The literature, focusus a specified ED of DSM-V: Binge Eating&#xD;
      Disorder (BED) or Binge Eating, whom estimated prevalence in the severely obese population&#xD;
      varies from 1.4 to 49% depending on the studies. The other ED, called unspecified ED (or&#xD;
      EDNOS for Eating Disorder Non Otherwise Specified in the English literature), are much less&#xD;
      known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence rate of unspecified ED (EDNOS or&#xD;
      &quot;non-BED ED&quot;) in subjects with severe obesity (BMI&gt; 35) consulting for medical or surgical&#xD;
      management in a General Hospital Center CSO (Specialized Obesity Center) using an adapted&#xD;
      version of the QEWP-R, called the QEWP-RA.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When it comes to weight problems, no one today disputes with anorexia nervosa that thinness&#xD;
      is only a symptom. Thinness is the consequence of a multifactorial food restriction, in other&#xD;
      words the consequence of an Eating Behavior Disorder (ED). The diagnosis of anorexia nervosa&#xD;
      is made relative to the presence of diagnostic criteria listed in the DSM-V (Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual V). Everyone recognizes the need for multidisciplinary care that is not&#xD;
      limited to the prescription of re-nutrition. Imposing an increase in energy intake has never&#xD;
      been enough to cure patients with anorexia. The multidisciplinary support offered to these&#xD;
      subjects also seeks to understand and treat the biopsychosocial determinants that perpetuate&#xD;
      the mechanisms of food restriction and most of the therapeutic support is based on a&#xD;
      psychotherapeutic, individual and / or family approach. The excess weight of subjects with&#xD;
      severe obesity (Body Mass Index&gt; 35) suffers from a lower etiopathogenic consideration. In&#xD;
      obese people, excess weight is, too often, considered more as the problem to be treated than&#xD;
      as the consequence of a more complex problem. Thus, the main therapeutic means still&#xD;
      currently used are based on simplistic thermodynamic fundamentals and are based on an imposed&#xD;
      food restriction (diet) or even undergone (bariatric surgery procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence rate of unspecified ED (EDNOS or&#xD;
      &quot;non-BED ED&quot;) in subjects with severe obesity (BMI&gt; 35) consulting for medical or surgical&#xD;
      management in a General Hospital Center CSO (Specialized Obesity Center) using an adapted&#xD;
      version of the QEWP-R, called the QEWP-RA (questionnaire on eating and weight pattern-revised&#xD;
      and modified).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the prevalence rate of ED not specified in the QEWP-RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single-center, non-interventional study involving the human person (Category 3&#xD;
      of the Jardé law).&#xD;

    <description>The main objective of this study is to assess the prevalence rate of unspecified ED (EDNOS or &quot;non-BED ED&quot;) in subjects with severe obesity (BMI&gt; 35) consulting for medical or surgical management in a General Hospital Center CSO (Specialized Obesity Center) using an adapted version of the QEWP-R, called the QEWP-RA.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the prevalence rate of &quot;BED&quot; subjects obtained from 3 different questionnaires (Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Pattern-R (QEWP-R), Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and the Binge Eating Scale (BES)).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 jour</time_frame>
    <description>The QEWP-R (used to diagnose Binge Eating Disorder / Purging Bulimia Nervosa / Nonpurging Bulimia Nervosa)&#xD;
The EDE-Q : 28 item self-report questionnaire. It concerns behaviors over a 28-day time period and retains the scoring system of 0-6: 0 = behaviour was absent and 6 = behaviour was present daily or to an extreme degree&#xD;
The BES is composed of 16 items corresponding to groups of sentences including one to be selected from 3 to 4 propositions, which best describe how one feels. For each item, the subject has to choose the formulation that best corresponds to his current situation, which results in a score varying between 0 and 3 or between 0 and 2 for each item. Half of the items measure eating behaviours and the other half assess feelings or cognitions occurring during compulsive episodes. It gives a total score (from 0 to 46) that reflects the severity of the BED. A score greater than or equal to 18 indicates significant bulimic hyperphagia.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To compare the psychopathological profiles of &quot;BED&quot; subjects and &quot;EDNOS&quot; subjects (comparison of averages (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS), Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ),Emotional Eating Scale(EES)).</measure>
    <time_frame>1 jour</time_frame>
    <description>The HADS consists of two parts: (a) 7 questions for screening for depression, and (b) 7 questions for screening for anxiety disorders. Each question receives a score between 0 and 3. The score for each part is obtained by adding the items that make up the part. The higher the score, the greater the severity of the corresponding symptoms.&#xD;
The DEBQ is a 33-item self-report questionnaire to assess three distinct eating behaviors in adults: (1) emotional eating, (2) external eating, and (3) restrained eating. Items on the DEBQ range from 1 (never) to 5 (very often), with higher scores indicating greater endorsement of the eating behavior.&#xD;
The EES Self-reported frequency of emotional eating is measured with the 25-item EES. Each item is scored on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (no desire to eat) to 5 (overwhelming desire to eat). Total scores range from 25-125. Higher scores indicate more emotional eating.The EES Scale yields 3 subscales: anger/ Frustration, anxiety and depression.</description>
