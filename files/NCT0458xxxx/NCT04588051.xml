  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There have been lack of clinical studies on the role of drug treatment in patients who&#xD;
      develop progressive disease with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Amongst HCC patients who&#xD;
      become intolerant or refractory to sorafenib, cabozantinib has been shown by phase III&#xD;
      clinical trial (CELESTIAL) to prolong the overall survival of patients, as compared to&#xD;
      placebo. It is expected more patients will be treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors in&#xD;
      future, hence it is clinically important to study the efficacy and toxicity of cabozantinib&#xD;
      after treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, both MET activation and upregulation of regulatory T cells are implicated in&#xD;
      resistance mechanism to immune checkpoint inhibitors. Immuno-modulatory effects of&#xD;
      cabozantinib have been described in vitro and in murine models for several cancers. Moreover,&#xD;
      cabozantinib appears to exert its effect on regulatory T cells (Tregs) via the HGF/c-Met&#xD;
      pathway, where this receptor signaling cascade mediates multiple immune cell functions. HGF&#xD;
      was shown to suppress DC function and in turn induce Tregs (CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3) in a murine&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) autoimmunity model. HGF cultured monocytes differentiate into&#xD;
      monocytic cells that produce soluble factors that favor immune suppressive conditions ideal&#xD;
      for tumor progression. Above immunomodulatory effects could enable cabozantinib to reverse&#xD;
      the immunosuppressive phenotype in patients after failure with immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The starting dose of cabozantinib of 60mg once daily in the current study is chosen in&#xD;
      accordance with approved dose by FDA for treatment of advanced HCC&#xD;
