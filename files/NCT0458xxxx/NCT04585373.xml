    <textblock>
      The main reason to conduct this research is to find the comparison of kinseotaping according&#xD;
      to time duration that is 24 hours, 48 hours and 72 hours in knee osteoarthritis patients. We&#xD;
      can find the impact of kinseo-taping on pain, balance and functional status of patients.&#xD;

      Osteoarthritis is a common, slowly developing disease which is enhance with age, it is also&#xD;
      called as metabolic disease, which includes destruction and repair mechanisms that begin by&#xD;
      bio chemical and mechanical injury. Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative disease.&#xD;
      Because of aging and due to obesity and sedentary lifestyle risk factor in prevalence of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis is increased. Cartilage is the main tissue affected by osteoarthritis and&#xD;
      causes following symptoms including pain, stiffness, joint swelling and also decrease the&#xD;
      range of motion. It is the one of main cause of deformity which results in poor quality of&#xD;
      life. Knee osteoarthritis is most occurring from all types of joint disease. The WHO&#xD;
      estimated that Osteoarthritis will become the fourth main cause of disability the year 2020.&#xD;
      Knee pain may affect knee flexibility and cause functional disability. Quadriceps muscle&#xD;
      weakness is one of the most marked disability impairment that is seen in knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      patients. This linked to functional limitations which increase fall risk and slower walking&#xD;
      speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength test showed that knee osteoarthritis patient have 25% to 45% loss of knee&#xD;
      extension strength and 19% to 25% loss of knee flexion strength. The prevalence and incidence&#xD;
      of knee osteoarthritis is greater in patient with age 30-65 years then adults population.&#xD;
      Approximately 80% patients of knee osteoarthritis experience from movement restriction and&#xD;
      20% are not able to perform daily living activates and 11% experience from personal care. In&#xD;
      developed countries knee osteoarthritis affects 17% to 30% of elderly population over age of&#xD;
      65 years and more prevalence in women than men. It is evaluate that by 2020 the approximately&#xD;
      number of people diagnosed with osteoarthritis will be 57% and those individuals whose is&#xD;
      affected by movement limitation will be approximately 66% Osteoarthritis is most prevalent&#xD;
      form of joint arthritis. Knee osteoarthritis accounts for pain and functional disability in&#xD;
      19.2-27.8% of people age &gt;45, approximately 37%of individual age &gt;60 had knee osteoarthritis&#xD;
      in plain radiography. Knee osteoarthritis is 4.9%over age 26 years, 16.7% among individual&#xD;
      over 45 years and 12.1% over age 60 years. Osteoarthritis is rheumatologic disease which&#xD;
      affects 80% of individual above 55 years. The current world wide prevalence of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis is 3.8% and women are affected more often 4.8% then men. In united state knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis prevalence's increases by 66-100% by 2020. The main goal of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis treatment is to decrease pain and maintain loss of physical function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among other conservative techniques use in knee osteoarthritis patients, the use of different&#xD;
      kind of taping approaches for treatment of knee osteoarthritis patients. Kinseotaping was&#xD;
      described use in clinics for pain management and motor function enhancement in patients of&#xD;
      musculoskeletal injuries. Kinseotaping improve muscle flexibility and muscle strength it also&#xD;
      improve proprioception in patients of musculoskeletal symptoms. It has been shown that&#xD;
      elastic tape could increase local circulation, decrease edema, and maintain joint stability.&#xD;
      Kinseotaping method is an alternative elastic taping techniques which is specially designed&#xD;
      waterproof, hypo allergic elastic tape. This tape should apply directly on skin and left for&#xD;
      several days. This tape would provide therapeutic effects.Kinseo-taping has high elastic&#xD;
      adhesive material and also high stretching capacity to give free mobility at applied area.&#xD;
      This kinseotaping improve knee pain by improving patellofemoral alignment and decrease&#xD;
      mechanical stress on soft tissue. The kinseotaping is elastic woven cotton strip with heat&#xD;
      sensitive acrylic adhesive and can stretch 120%-140% of its original length. It has been&#xD;
      suggested that kinseotaping provide cutaneous stimulation which reduce pain by activating&#xD;
      mechanoreceptors and improve muscle excitability Kinseotaping reverse the pain signals&#xD;
      through stimulating sensory nerve endings of skin. It has been evaluated that taping on&#xD;
      patella can improve patellar proprioception and sense of mechanical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2019 study compares the effect of quadriceps taping with patellar taping to check balance&#xD;
      and functional performance in patients of knee osteoarthritis. The result showed that both&#xD;
      quadriceps and patellar taping equally improve balance and functional level of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients. Another research was conducted in 2019in which they describe the&#xD;
      immediate effects of kinseotaping on gait function and pain in older patients of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis. Result showed that kinseotaping significantly improved gait and balance and&#xD;
      it also decreased the pain during ambulation. In 2018 study evaluate the gait speed after&#xD;
      applying kinseotaping on quadriceps femoris muscle in knee osteoarthritis patients. Their&#xD;
      result suggest that time needed to perform 10 meter walk test would decreased after 3 days of&#xD;
      application of kinseo-taping.In 2017study conducted research on effects of kinseotaping on&#xD;
      pain and functional outcome in knee osteoarthritis patients ,their result revealed that&#xD;
      therapeutic kinseotaping is effective in short term management of pain and disability in knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis patients.&#xD;
