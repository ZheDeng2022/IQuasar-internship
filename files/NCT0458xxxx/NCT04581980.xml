  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the effect of different intensities of exercise on levels of the&#xD;
      hormone, ghrelin. In addition, we will be examining the relationship between any exercise&#xD;
      induced changes in ghrelin and insulin sensitivity, obesity, and vascular function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity increases the risk of disease. We will examine the impact of moderate and high&#xD;
      intensity exercise on the hormone ghrelin and its two forms, acyl (AG) and des-acyl (DAG),&#xD;
      which are suggested to influence appetite, glucose metabolism and vascular function. We will&#xD;
      determine whether differential changes in total ghrelin, AG and DAG are associated with&#xD;
      changes in appetite, insulin sensitivity and vascular function. Subjects will be categorized&#xD;
      as; either lean or obese (BMI), and either normal fasting glucose or impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerant (oral glucose tolerance test). Each participant will undergo body composition&#xD;
      analysis, and a maximal treadmill cardiopulmonary exercise test to determine lactate&#xD;
      threshold and maximal oxygen uptake. Subjects will then complete three randomly assigned&#xD;
      exercise sessions: a) control (rest), (b) moderate intensity exercise and, (c) high intensity&#xD;
      exercise. Blood sampling and measures of vascular function will occur before, during and&#xD;
      after each study. An ANOVA with repeated measures and logistic regression analyses will&#xD;
      examine the differential impact of exercise intensity on the outcome measures. Data collected&#xD;
      will be used to develop a precision exercise approach to treat obesity and abnormal glucose&#xD;
      metabolism for a NIH grant submission. This project is related to the UVa emphasis in&#xD;
      precision medicine.&#xD;
