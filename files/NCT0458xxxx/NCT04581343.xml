    <textblock>
      This study combines canakinumab (ACZ885), a high-affinity human anti-interleukin-1β (IL-1β)&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (mAb), and spartalizumab (PDR001), a mAb directed against human&#xD;
      Programmed Death-1 (PD-1), with the chemotherapy combination of gemcitabine and&#xD;
      nab-paclitaxel. This study will confirm for this 4-drug combination the tolerable doses, the&#xD;
      acceptable safety profile, and the dose to be used for a Phase II combination treatment&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multi-center phase Ib study to confirm the recommended phase II/III&#xD;
      dose of canakinumab and spartalizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated in the&#xD;
      first line setting. The starting dose level of canakinumab explored will be 250 mg Q4W&#xD;
      (&quot;starting dose level&quot;). In case of unacceptable toxicity of the starting dose devel of&#xD;
      canakinumab, the dose of canakinumab will be de-escalated to the &quot;-1 dose level&quot; administered&#xD;
      as 250 mg Q8W, while other components of the combination stay at the same dose as the&#xD;
      starting dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be observed for DLTs for a minimum duration of 56 days (8 weeks). To achieve&#xD;
      study objectives and to ensure the adequate number of DLT evaluable patients, the study will&#xD;
      recruit approximately ten patients to have at least 6 evaluable patients per dose level of&#xD;
      canakinumab. Additional approximately ten patients (to have at least 6 additional evaluable&#xD;
      patients) may be enrolled at lower dose level in case a dose de-escalation is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose confirmation will be guided by an adaptive Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM)&#xD;
      based on any DLTs observed for two cycles of treatment (i.e. 56 days, or 8 weeks). The&#xD;
      adaptive BLRM will be guided by the Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC) principle to&#xD;
      control the probability of DLT in future patients on the study. BLRM is a well-established&#xD;
      and widely used method to estimate the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) or maximal&#xD;
      tolerable dose (MTD) in clinical trials in patients with cancer with small sample size. The&#xD;
      use of Bayesian response adaptive models for small datasets has been endorsed by academic&#xD;
      publications (Babb et al. 1998, Neuenschwander et al. 2008, Neuenschwander et al. 2010,&#xD;
      Natanegara et al. 2014), by the European Medicines Agency (Guideline on Clinical Trials in&#xD;
      Small Populations, 2007) and it constitutes an important aspect of the FDA's Critical Path&#xD;
      Initiative (Clinical Path White Paper, FDA, 2004). The Bayesian analysis incorporates prior&#xD;
      toxicity data of single agent and drugs combinations together with the currently available&#xD;
      data to predict the probability of DLT and excessive toxicity of a dose level of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Bayesian method is be based on a Meta-Analytical-Combined (MAC) approach (Spiegelhalter&#xD;
      2004, Neuenschwander 2016) to combine all historical and concurrent data. Prior toxicity&#xD;
      information included in the BLRM model was obtained from three studies with canakinumab as a&#xD;
      single agent and combination of canakinumab and spartalizumab (PDR001X2101, ACZ885I2202,&#xD;
      PRD001X2103) and from a phase I/II study of nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine (Von Hoff D, et.al.,&#xD;
      2011). Simulation was used to illustrate the recommendation from BLRM under a set of&#xD;
      hypothetical scenarios with assumed number of evaulable patients and DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decisions on a recommended dose will be made by the Investigators and the Sponsor in a&#xD;
      Safety Review meeting when at least 6 DLT evaluable patients per dose level will be observed&#xD;
      for DLTs for a minimum duration of 56 days (8 weeks). Safety review will be based upon the&#xD;
      review of all relevant data available including treatment tolerability and safety information&#xD;
      together with the BLRM summaries of DLT probability, PK, PD, and preliminary activity&#xD;
      information (if available) at the time of the meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated until disease progression per RECIST 1.1, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      until the patient or treating physician decides to stop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK) and immunogenicity (IG) samples will be collected at specific time&#xD;
      points throughout treatment. Each treatment cycle is 4 weeks. All patients must be followed&#xD;
      for safety up to 150 days after the last dose of spartalizumab or canakinumab, or 30 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of the combination chemotherapy, whichever the later. After the end of&#xD;
      safety follow-up, patients will be followed for disease progression if discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment is due to reason other than progression, and for survival (via telephone call or&#xD;
      onsite visit if a patient happens to be visiting the site) until the end of study The study&#xD;
      completion is defined as when the last patient has completed the study treatment, safety&#xD;
      follow up, and completed survival follow up period up to 1 year from first treatment,&#xD;
      whichever is later or in the event of an early study termination decision, the date of that&#xD;
      decision.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;

             before taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
             reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment.&#xD;

             vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception In case of use of oral contraception&#xD;
             women should have been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Women of non-childbearing potential is defined as women who are physiologically&#xD;
        and/or anatomically incapable of becoming pregnant, as now further described:&#xD;

             hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation at least six weeks prior. In the case of&#xD;
             oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed&#xD;
             by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: Sexually active male patients and their partners who are women of childbearing&#xD;
        potential should follow the contraception recommendations and any other precautionary&#xD;
        measures as required by the local prescribing information for the SOC anti-cancer.&#xD;

             with study requirements, or compromise patient's compliance with the protocol and all&#xD;
             requirements of the study as stated in the Informed Consent Form. Significant medical&#xD;
             conditions include but are not limited to known history or current interstitial lung&#xD;
             disease or non-infectious pneumonitis, medical history or current diagnosis of&#xD;

             disease with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C), serious&#xD;
             non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture, uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism, or&#xD;
