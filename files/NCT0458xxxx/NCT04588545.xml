  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if radiation therapy followed by intrathecal&#xD;
      trastuzumab and pertuzumab is safe and will result in improved survival in HER2 positive&#xD;
      breast cancer which has metastasized to the leptomeninges.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a prospective, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label, phase I/II&#xD;
      trial of radiation therapy (RT) followed by intrathecal (IT) trastuzumab/pertuzumab in the&#xD;
      management of HER2+ breast leptomeningeal disease (LMD). Treatment will be initiated with RT,&#xD;
      whole brain RT (WBRT) and/or focal brain/spine RT followed by IT trastuzumab/pertuzumab.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive radiation therapy (RT), either whole brain radiation therapy or focal brain/spine RT. The goal of RT is to palliate symptoms and improve the flow of Intrathecal (IT) therapy through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). As such, various RT schedules and targets are permitted. It is expected that the majority of patients will receive WBRT with 30 Gy in 10 fractions. However, shorter fractions of 20 Gy in 5 fractions of WBRT are permitted. In those patients who have more localized leptomeningeal disease in the spine, focal RT in up to 10 fractions may be administered with the exact dose left up to the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist.</description>
