    <textblock>
      Chronic postsurgical pain following lung cancer surgery is common with and 20-60 % develop&#xD;
      chronic pain which persists more than six months after surgery. Causes and health impact of&#xD;
      this pain have been comprehensively studied. Current treatment consists of combination of&#xD;
      pain medication, physiotherapy and psychological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A) has shown promising effects in a variety of chronic postsurgical&#xD;
      pain syndromes. The use of BTX-A in lung cancer patients has only been presented in few case&#xD;
      reports. No randomized controlled trials (RCT) have been executed to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine recruitment potential among cured lung cancer patients with chronic postsurgical&#xD;
      pain for an RCT and if the method of BTX-A administration is feasible and acceptable. Further&#xD;
      more, this study will contribute to the stage testing of the hypothesis that chronic pain&#xD;
      following thoracic surgery can be treated with BTX-A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of test subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participiants are recruited among former lung cancer patients with chronic postsurgical pain,&#xD;
      who have undergone radical treatment for lung cancer at the Department of Cardiothoracic&#xD;
      Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital. Potential test subjects are invited by mail / e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized to receive a single series of subcutaneous injections with either&#xD;
      Onabotulinum Toxin A (active agent) or inactive normal saline (Placebo) at the former&#xD;
      operation site. Neither participant nor investigator will know which treatment is given until&#xD;
      the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data is collected by questionnaires delivered and answered by mail or digitally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the possible effects and possible adverse reactions are collected at multiple times&#xD;
      until three months after treatment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic postsurgical pain (CPP) following lung cancer surgery is common with an observed&#xD;
      prevalence of 20-60 %. Causes and health impact have been comprehensively studied. Current&#xD;
      treatment consists of combination of pain medication, physiotherapy and psychological&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum Toxin A (BTX-A) has shown promising effects in a variety of chronic postsurgical&#xD;
      pain syndromes. The use of BTX-A in lung cancer patients has only been presented in few case&#xD;
      reports. No randomized clinical controlled trials (RCT) has been executed to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine recruitment potential among cured lung cancer patients with CPP for an RCT and if&#xD;
      the method of BTX-A administration is feasible and acceptable to the test subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early stage testing of the hypothesis that CPP following thoracic surgery can be treated with&#xD;
      this novel method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of test subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test subjects are recruited among former lung cancer patients with chronic postsurgical pain,&#xD;
      who have undergone radical treatment for lung cancer at the Department of Cardiothoracic&#xD;
      Surgery, Aalborg University Hospital. Potential test subjects are invited by mail / e-mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test subjects are randomized to receive a series of injections with either Onabotulinum Toxin&#xD;
      A (active agent) or inactive normal saline (Placebo). Neither test subject nor investigator&#xD;
      will know which treatment is given until the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator examines the skin area of the test subject at the operation site and&#xD;
      performs a sensory examination with pin prick and sensory brush. The area is located and&#xD;
      marked and divided into quadrants of one square centimeter. An area of maximum 40 square&#xD;
      centimeters is marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At a single treatment session, test subjects receives either active agent or placebo through&#xD;
      a series of subcutaneous injections. One injection is given in each marked quadrant of the&#xD;
      treatment area. The maximal number of injections is 40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the treatment, test subjects report pain symptoms and intensity, use of pain medication&#xD;
      and occurrence of adverse events weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 30 and 90 days after treatment more comprehensive and additional data is collected&#xD;
      concerning neuropathic symptoms, activities of daily life, general health and level of&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Data is collected by questionnaires delivered to test subjects by mail or&#xD;
      digitally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recruitment of 30 test subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Half of the first half of included test subject must complete the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Half of test subjects in total mus complete the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain at rest, coughing and when active Numerical rating score (NRS) for presence of pain&#xD;
           before and after treatment and course of pain symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General Health Short form 36 Health Survey on physical, social and mental level of&#xD;
           function on a score from 0 to 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neuropathic Pain Symptoms Inventory (NPSI) NRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Activities of daily life Impact and intensity of pain categorically in 16 situations of&#xD;
           daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Patient's Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Rating of global change perceived by the&#xD;
           test subject from &quot;More Worse&quot; to &quot;Much better&quot; and a scale from 0 to 10.&#xD;

    <description>Onabotulinum toxin A is reconstructed with 4 ml of normal saline in a vial containing 100 U (Allergen Units).&#xD;
At a single treatment session, test subjects receive a series of subcutaneous injections with 2,5 U Onabotulinum toxin A equivalent to 0,1 ml of solution after reconstruction. One injection is given per 1 square centimeter in the painful area in relation to the scar on the chest wall. The maximum number of subcutaneous injections is 40, equivalent to a maximum dose of 100 U of Onabotulinum toxin in a total volume of 4 ml solution. The subcutaneous injections are administered using 26G 0.45 x 15 mm cannulae and 1 ml syringes.</description>
