      Summary of the HF-HOPE study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and existing knowledge gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As per the Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System, about 1 in 12 Canadian adults aged&#xD;
      ≥20 live with diagnosed heart disease. Every hour, about 12 Canadian adults aged ≥20 die due&#xD;
      to heart failure (HF). It is estimated that HF results in direct costs of more than $2.8&#xD;
      billion per year in Canada alone. As per the Canadian Society of Cardiology, heart failure is&#xD;
      defined as &quot;a complex clinical syndrome in which abnormal heart function results in, or&#xD;
      increases the subsequent risk of, clinical symptoms and signs of reduced cardiac output&#xD;
      and/or pulmonary or systemic congestion at rest or with stress&quot;. Although HF is defined as&#xD;
      &quot;reduced cardiac output state&quot; no objective parameters are set to define the condition.&#xD;
      Invasive monitoring is routinely used in hemodynamic evaluation of critically ill patients&#xD;
      admitted in the hospital, however, there is no reliable tool available to measure hemodynamic&#xD;
      parameters that may predict, immediate or long-term, risk of worst health outcomes in stable&#xD;
      HF patients. We hypothesize that non-invasive bioimpedance-based hemodynamic parameters can&#xD;
      be used as a predictive tool for health outcomes in patients with HF. To ascertain this, we&#xD;
      propose the first of its kind HF-HOPE study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of HF-HOPE study are to 1) characterize hemodynamic measures of resting versus&#xD;
      post-exercise (mounted ergometer) in patients with all-comer stable HF subjects, irrespective&#xD;
      of their HF etiology using Non-Invasive Cardiac System (NICaS); 2) correlate NICaS-derived&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters to identify, early- and long-term risk of worse health outcomes&#xD;
      (unplanned hospital admission due to HF or arrhythmias; listing for heart&#xD;
      transplantation/palliative care; and death); 3) correlate the lean body mass (muscle and&#xD;
      skeleton) with their body mass index (kg/m2) and the risk of worse health outcomes; and 4)&#xD;
      Nested cohort study: identify the outcome-associated biomarkers of chronic HF by employing a&#xD;
      non-targeted metabolomics/lipidomics approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The HF-HOPE is a single center, prospective, double-blind, pragmatic clinical study.&#xD;
      It will be conducted at St. Boniface general hospital, Manitoba's tertiary cardiac center.&#xD;
      Patients aged ≥18 years, irrespective of any sex or gender, with confirmed diagnosis of HF&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study. Hemodynamic measurements (stroke volume, cardiac output,&#xD;
      cardiac index, total peripheral vascular resistance, and cardiac power index) will be&#xD;
      assessed using NICaS at 3-times (at rest in supine, siting position as well as after exercise&#xD;
      on a mounted ergometer) at baseline and 6 months (±1 month) in each enrolled participant.&#xD;
      Patients will be followed to record health outcomes as outlined above, each year. The BodPod,&#xD;
      air displacement plathysmography device will be used to determine body compositions at&#xD;
      baseline and 6-month. Baseline demographic data will be gathered. To optimize the use of&#xD;
      clinical resources, we will collect blood and urine samples for non-selective metabolomics&#xD;
      and lipidomics profiling by adopting -omics approach as a nested cohort study. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: Assuming the 8 to 12% 1-year mortality rate following admission with HF, a&#xD;
      projected sample size of 500 would be suffice. Conservatively 4 covariates will be included&#xD;
      in multivariable statistical models, while testing the independent effect of the relevant&#xD;
      NICaS parameters of interest. We will perform subgroup analysis using age, sex, ethnicity,&#xD;
      concomitant disease conditions, medications, and lean body mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated outcomes and future implications: The HF-HOPE study is the first of its kind&#xD;
      study employing non-invasive hemodynamic parameters to predict worsening health outcomes over&#xD;
      time in HF patients. The successful outcomes will provide a promising cost effective, rapid,&#xD;
      and reliable tool to predict worsening health outcomes before it actually lead to&#xD;
      hospitalization, tissue damage or death. This early warnings will provide adequate time for&#xD;
      appropriate intervention. The HF- HOPE study has been meticulously designed to replicate the&#xD;
      pragmatic conditions while assessing the non-invasive hemodynamic measurements to widen the&#xD;
      knowledge translation of outcomes to change the clinical practice of HF patient management.&#xD;
      Further, this may provide supporting data for future randomized trial to replace the costly,&#xD;
      resource-intense, and complex invasive tool to determine hemodynamic measurements in HF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
