      Introduction There is a strong relationship between eating habits and diseases of the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. It is known that walnut consumption has positive effects on&#xD;
      cardiovascular system diseases. However, its effect on small dense LDL (sdLDL) is discussed.&#xD;
      Therefore in this study, you participated the effects of walnut consumption on the serum&#xD;
      lipids values, especially sdLDL values of healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Volunteers participating in this study were offered 30 grams of walnuts per day for&#xD;
      21 days. Walnuts were consumed on empty stomach or with breakfast every morning for 21 days.&#xD;
      The blood values of subjects were measured at the beginning and the end of the study. The&#xD;
      serum was obtained from the taken blood and blood lipid/hemoglobin parameters were measured&#xD;
      on routine blood work. Food consumption records and surveys were taken from individuals.&#xD;

    <measure>Blood from the participants was collected before and at the end of the study. Later in this study, sdLDL levels of blood taken from participants were measured by the Elisa method.</measure>

    <description>It can be said that walnut consumption reduces the risk of CAD. In 30% of patients taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, cholesterol parameters may drop to the desired levels and severe vascular lesions still may occur. Also, individuals with normal LDL values may have cardiovascular diseases. Findings are suggesting that in these individuals, the prevalence of CAD is higher due to sdLDL positivity. sdLDL passes through the endothelial barrier easier and is exposed to oxidation more than LDL, which is larger and lower in density. Therefore is atherogenic.</description>

    <measure>Blood from the participants was collected before and at the end of the study. Later, the serum lipids of the blood taken from the participants consuming walnuts were measured in the hospital.</measure>
    <time_frame>The first day of the research and the end day (3 weeks later) were analyzed.</time_frame>
    <description>It can be said that walnut consumption reduces the risk of CAD. The fact that walnuts contain fatty acids can be shown as a reason for their beneficial effect on blood lipid levels. We can attribute this to the fact that walnuts contain high levels of unsaturated and low levels of saturated fatty acids. In various studies, the walnut-enriched diet has been reported to reduce TC, LDL, and TG</description>
