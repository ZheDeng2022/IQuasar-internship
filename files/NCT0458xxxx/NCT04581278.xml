      The main objective of the present study (KTD Innov-2) is to validate the feasibility of SDI&#xD;
      within a limited time frame to ensure its clinically relevant use, with a high level of&#xD;
      evidence to consider its labelling as a medical device by health authorities prior to routine&#xD;
      transfer and/or future marketing.&#xD;

300 kidney transplant patients will be included in the KTD Innov-2 study with data collection, blood, urine and graft biopsies for biomarker analysis and conversion to SDI (decisional algorithms) and interactive multi-dimensional presentation on a web interface for use of the tool by transplant physicians and their patients.</description>

      The blood, urine and biopsy samples required for the construction of the SDI will be&#xD;
      completed upon inclusion in the KTD Innov-2 protocol (D0 of the graft, blood, urine) then at&#xD;
      3 months (monitoring biopsy of the renal graft, blood and urine) and 12 months (kidney&#xD;
      transplant monitoring biopsy, blood and urine) in the 300 incident patients from the 3&#xD;
      university hospitals of the study (Nantes, Necker and Paris Saint-Louis). A blood and urine&#xD;
      sample will accompany each graft biopsy which will be indicated in the first year of&#xD;
      transplant.&#xD;

The collection of data on each person suitable for research is carried out through a coded database. This coded database will be extracted from the existing DIVAT database in each participating centre, and the variables specific to the KTD Innov study (patient identification number (centre number/patient number) for the study, inclusion/non-inclusion criteria, date of collection of the non-opposition, additional analyses, ...) will be added on specific tabs.</ipd_description>
