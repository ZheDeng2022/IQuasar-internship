    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to test an intervention designed to identify cancer needs and&#xD;
      connect patients with services that address those needs. Participation in this research will&#xD;
      involve completing 2 online surveys over the course of 1 month; each should take about 15&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;

      Adolescents and young Adults (AYA) Needs Assessment &amp; Service Bridge (AYA NA-SB) includes a&#xD;
      holistic Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM) assessing AYAs' physical, psychosocial and&#xD;
      practical needs and a collection of referral pathways for connecting AYAs to services and&#xD;
      resources based on the needs they report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the implementation of AYA NA-SB, the study team will pilot AYA NA-SB in the North&#xD;
      Carolina Cancer Hospital (NCCH)/ UNC Children's Hospital, with a primary focus on&#xD;
      implementation outcomes (i.e., feasibility, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity). To&#xD;
      establish proof-of-concept for AYA NA-SB, the study team will use pilot data to generate&#xD;
      preliminary evidence on the extent to which AYA NA-SB addresses AYAs' reported needs.&#xD;
