  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a group controlled clinical trial. Parallel study, patients aged 40-70 years,&#xD;
      with Parkinson disease. Twelve sessions, three times a week, for 30 minutes, simultaneously&#xD;
      to the rehabilitation program. Training will consist of Transcranial Direct Current&#xD;
      Stimulation linked dual-task exercises or dual-taks exercises with cognitive training,&#xD;
      applied three times a week during four weeks. The investigators will used instruments:&#xD;
      dual-task gait speed (Auditory Stroop Task ), executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test&#xD;
      , Auditory Stroop Test, Trail Making Test, Verbal Fluency Test and Montreal Cognitive&#xD;
      Assessment), and, the objective is to examine task-dependency in enhancing the effects of&#xD;
      tDCS-linked rehabilitation training on PD and the relationships between baseline outcomes in&#xD;
      responders and non-responders to therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Patients with Parkinson's disease have difficulty performing a dual-task, a&#xD;
      condition present in everyday life. It is possible that strategies such as Transcranial&#xD;
      Direct Current Stimulation can be associated with motor training enriched with dual-task and&#xD;
      cognitive training to improve the performance of two concurrent tasks. It is currently&#xD;
      unclear whether specific tasks and clinical conditions of PD patients have different results&#xD;
      after the intervention. Therefore, the proposed randomized controlled trial will examine&#xD;
      task-dependency in enhancing the effects of tDCS-linked rehabilitation training on PD and the&#xD;
      relationships between baseline outcomes in responders and non-responders to therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention protocol with&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation, dual-task training and cognitive training in&#xD;
      patients with Parkinson's disease. The study will also highlight whether the clinical factors&#xD;
      and variability between individuals that could interfere in the training of a specific task&#xD;
      and influence the therapeutic effect.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in executive functions assessed by Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>[Baseline, after 04 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) is a neuropsychological test of &quot;set-shifting&quot;, i.e. the ability to display flexibility in the face of changing schedules of reinforcement. A number of stimulus cards are presented to the participant. The participant is told to match the cards, but not how to match; however, they are told whether a particular match is right or wrong. The original WCST used paper cards and was carried out with the experimenter on one side of the desk facing the participant on the other. The test takes approximately 12-20 minutes to carry out and generates a number of psychometric scores, including numbers, percentages, and percentiles of: categories achieved, trials, errors, and perseverative errors.</description>

    <description>The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a cognitive screening tool. MoCA is composed of eight cognitive domains, which are scored within a range of 0 to 30 points (higher scores indicate better function): short-term memory; visuospatial skills; executive function; verbal fluency; attention, concentration and working memory; language; sentence repetition; and spatiotemporal orientation.</description>
