  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will use a within-person, randomized cross-over experimental design to test&#xD;
      the effects of exogenous melatonin supplementation on the sleep and daytime functioning of&#xD;
      typically developing adolescents with short or disrupted sleep of behavioral origins (i.e.,&#xD;
      difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or premature waking resulting in short or&#xD;
      disrupted sleep not attributed to an organic sleep condition).&#xD;

    <measure>Change in Objective Sleep Duration During Melatonin Administration</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Objective sleep will be measured via wrist-worn actigraphy worn nightly for 2 &quot;run-in&quot; nights followed by 12 consecutive nights after receiving melatonin (14 nights/2 weeks total). Changes in objective sleep duration would be demonstrated by either an increase or decrease in number of hours asleep compared to baseline</description>

    <description>Objective sleep will be measured via wrist-worn actigraphy worn nightly for 2 &quot;run-in&quot; nights followed by 12 consecutive nights after receiving placebo (14 nights/2 weeks total). No change in objective sleep duration would be demonstrated compared to baseline</description>

    <measure>Change in Emotion Regulation During Melatonin Administration as Evidenced by the Emotion Regulation Index for Children and Adolescents (ERICA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline and two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Emotion Regulation Index for Children and Adolescents (ERICA) is a 16-item adolescent-report measure with scores ranging from 16 to 80 (higher scores indicative of better emotion regulation). This measure will be administered during baseline and after 14 days (2 weeks) including a 2 day &quot;run-in&quot; followed by 12 days of melatonin administration. It is expected that emotion regulation will improve after melatonin administration compared to baseline. Normal emotion regulation varies by individual.</description>
