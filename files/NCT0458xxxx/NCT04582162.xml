    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to clinically and radiographically evaluate and compare the use of&#xD;
      unsplinted and splinted short implants with ball abutments to support mandibular overdentures&#xD;
      in cases with severe mandibular ridge resorption.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twelve patients from the Prosthodontics Department in the Faculty of Dentistry, Alexandria&#xD;
      University participated in the study. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The test group&#xD;
      received 4 short implants with ball abutments for the construction of a mandibular assisted&#xD;
      overdenture, while the control group received 4 short implants splinted using a bar with a&#xD;
      ball attachment for retaining a mandibular overdenture.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Implant stability</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Stability was assessed using resonance frequency analysis measured with the Osstell device instrument. The Osstell unit records a numeric value of 1-100 which is referred to as the implant stability quotient (ISQ). The measurements were performed and 3 mean of three readings were recorded in each evaluation period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Peri-implant probing depth</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Peri-implant probing depth refers to the distance between the gingival margin and the most apically probable portion in millimeters (mm). The peri-implant probing depth was measured using a graduated plastic periodontal probe. The probe was held parallel to the long axis of the implant and introduced to the peri-implant sulcus until slight resistance was felt. Measurements were made at four sites around each implant; buccal, lingual, mesial and distal. Probing depth of 1 mm or less was recorded as &quot;1mm&quot;, and those exceeding 1 mm but less than 2 mm were recorded as &quot;2mm&quot; and so forth. The mean records for each implant were then calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical attachment loss</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>It is the distance from the junction implant/abutment to the most apically probable portion, in millimeters. Assessment of the clinical attachment level was performed simultaneously while measuring the peri-implant probing depth.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Gingival inflammation (Modified gingival index)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The peri-implant mucosal tissues around the implants were assessed using Apse's modification of LÃ¶e and Silness index. The criteria for assessment were:&#xD;
0 =Normal mucosa, 1 =Mild inflammation, slight change in colour and texture, slight oedema and no bleeding on probing, 2 =Mild inflammation, redness, in all portions of gingival margin, 3 =Moderate inflammation, 4 =Severe inflammation. The gingival index was assessed at 4 sites around each implant (buccal, lingual, mesial and distal) the sum gingival index score was calculated from all these surfaces and then divided by 4 to obtain the gingival index for each implant. Indices of the three implants were added to each other, and then divided by 3 to get the mean gingival index for each case. A score from 0.1-1.0 reflects mild inflammation; 1.1-2.0 reflects moderate inflammation from, and 2.1-3.0 signifies severe inflammation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Crestal bone loss</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Mesial and Distal crestal bone loss were evaluated using digital periapical x-rays. In order to standardize the cones' and sensors' position and angulation, a film positioning system was used along with a customized silicone bite.</description>
