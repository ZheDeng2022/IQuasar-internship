      Introduction: To evaluate the maternal blood serum melatonin, soluble urokinase-type&#xD;
      plasminogen activator receptor, and orosomucoid 2 levels in pregnant women complicated by&#xD;
      preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and to compare the results with healthy&#xD;
      pregnancies. In addition, to determine whether maternal/umbilical cord blood concentrations&#xD;
      of melatonin, soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, and orosomucoid 2 are of&#xD;
      value in the diagnosis of histological chorioamnionitis in patients with preterm premature&#xD;
      rupture of membranes (PPROM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This cohort study will be included 44 pregnant women with PPROM and 44 gestational&#xD;
      age-matched healthy subjects in 24-32 weeks of pregnancy. The blood for analysis will be&#xD;
      firstly obtained in maternal blood on the day of diagnosis at the study group. Healthy&#xD;
      subjects who have a normal pregnancy and outcomes without any fetal-neonatal complications&#xD;
      will be accepted into the control group. Forty-four gestational age-matched healthy pregnant&#xD;
      women who will be delivered at term will be included in the study as the control group. In&#xD;
      the control group, the pregnant women will be taken the maternal blood at the admission day.&#xD;
      The women in both groups will be observed until the delivery and perinatal data will be&#xD;
      noted. Then, the blood for analysis will be secondly obtained in maternal blood during&#xD;
      termination of the pregnancy (or spontaneous labor) at the study group. Lastly, the blood for&#xD;
      analysis will be also obtained in umbilical cord blood at the study group. These three&#xD;
      markers levels will be measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent&#xD;
      assay (ELISA) kit. The placenta will be sent to histological examination in the study group.&#xD;
      These three markers levels in women with PPROM will be compared to those of volunteer healthy&#xD;
      pregnant women. In the study group, these three markers levels at maternal serum and cord&#xD;
      serum will be evaluated for histological chorioamnionitis and maternal/neonatal outcomes.&#xD;

      This observational case-control study will be conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynecology, Cengiz Gokcek Public Hospital, Gaziantep, Turkey, between October 2020 and&#xD;
      October 2021. The protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee for Clinical Research of&#xD;
      Gaziantep University (reference no: 2020/276). The study strictly will be adhered to the&#xD;
      principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects will be included in the study gave&#xD;
      oral and written informed consent. Membrane rupture before labor and before 37 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation is referred to as preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM). Every woman in&#xD;
      the study population will be undergone obstetric ultrasound examination and fetal-maternal&#xD;
      assessment will be carried out. The blood for analysis will be firstly obtained in maternal&#xD;
      blood on the day of diagnosis at the study group. Healthy subjects who had a normal pregnancy&#xD;
      and outcomes without any fetal-neonatal complications will be accepted into the control&#xD;
      group. Forty-four gestational age-matched healthy pregnant women who will be delivered at&#xD;
      term will be included in the study as the control group. In the control group, the pregnant&#xD;
      women will be taken the maternal blood at the admission day. The women in both groups will be&#xD;
      observed until the delivery and perinatal data will be noted. All The participants with PPROM&#xD;
      will be also hospitalized. Then, the protocols for pregnant women with PPROM in our hospital&#xD;
      are as follows: All patients with PPROM are hospitalized and expectant protocol is applied.&#xD;
      After hospitalization until the delivery of baby, all pregnant women with PPROM receive&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics for 1 week and betamethasone injection. The non-stress test and&#xD;
      fetal movement determined by the mother are used for the detection of fetal well-being. The&#xD;
      signs for clinical chorioamnionitis such as uterine tenderness, fever, purulent discharges&#xD;
      from the cervical canal and inflammatory markers like white blood cell count (WBC) and&#xD;
      C-reactive protein (CRP) levels are monitored carefully during the hospitalization. After a&#xD;
      latency period, PPROM pregnancy will gone to spontaneous delivery or will be applied&#xD;
      termination procedure. In the study group, the placenta will be stained with&#xD;
      hematoxylin-eosin and will be examined under a light microscope for histological signs of&#xD;
      neutrophil infiltration and chorioamnionitis. Then, this study will be determined maternal&#xD;
      serum melatonin, soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor, and orosomucoid 2&#xD;
      levels in women with PPROM(n=44) compared to those of volunteer healthy pregnant women&#xD;
      (n=44). Then, these three markers levels at maternal serum and cord serum will be evaluated&#xD;
      for histological chorioamnionitis and maternal/neonatal outcomes in the study group.&#xD;
