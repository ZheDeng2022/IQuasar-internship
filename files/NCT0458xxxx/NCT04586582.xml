  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies found that poor ST-segment resolution (STR) in electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
      occurred in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), arrhythmia and heart failure was&#xD;
      significantly higher . In clinical work, in patients have poor ST-segment decline, the&#xD;
      investigators found by CMR-LGE the corresponding myocardium become thinner and other signs of&#xD;
      myocardial scar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to establish whether poor ST-segment resolution in ECG, as well as&#xD;
      CMR-LGE, could detect the presence of myocardial scar in early STEMI patients. In order to&#xD;
      provide convenient, cheap and widely used test method for patients who cannot tolerate&#xD;
      CMR-LGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      42 STEMI patients with single-branch coronary artery stenosis or occlusion were enrolled.&#xD;
      ST-segment elevations were measured on the baseline and 24 hours after PCI. The study&#xD;
      population was divided into two groups by late gadolinium enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (LGE- CMR), with transmural myocardial scar (&gt;75%) or non-transmural myocardial scar (&lt;75%).&#xD;
