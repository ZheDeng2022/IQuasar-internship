      Randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind study for acute migraine attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • ≤60 days to present at clinic for treating up to 2 migraines (at least 48 hours apart).&#xD;

      treatment is open-label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Treatment Follow-up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  24 hours after initiating treatment, for each of up to two migraine treatments, for&#xD;
           conducting post-treatment follow-up assessments of migraine symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30, 60, and 90 days following the first migraine treatment for migraine diary&#xD;
           assessments (and MIDAS assessment at 90 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of migraine diaries at 30, 60, &amp; 90 days post enrollment. Collection of MIDAS data&#xD;
      at 60 and 90 days post treatment.&#xD;
