      • an initial Phase 1a single ascending dose (SAD) phase to identify a safe dose of OPT101.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will be by a factor of 2.6: 0.16, 0.42, 1.1, 2.8 and 7.3mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • a Phase 1b multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase to measure safety and clinical effects of&#xD;
      the highest and next to highest dose of OPT101 that are found to be safe in Phase 1a.&#xD;

Groups of 3 subjects (2 active:1 placebo) each will be treated at each dose level; for a total of 15 subjects. Additional subjects may be added to any cohort if dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed for a maximum of up to 6 subjects per cohort. An additional 6 subjects may also be enrolled in an intermediate dose cohort between the dose level which exceeds the defined MTD and the previous defined dose level.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The starting dose for the Phase 1a study is 0.16 mg/kg, which is 35-fold lower than the dog NOAEL (10mg/kg), on a mg/m2 basis. The dosing frequency for the MAD study was selected based on dosing performed in the supporting animal model studies. For an additional safety factor, the dose and volume infusion rates for the 0.16 mg/kg dose in humans will be 67-fold and 14-fold lower than the dogs dosed at 10mg/kg/min and mL/kg/min basis, respectively. For both Phase 1a and 1b, OPT101 will be administered by a slow IV infusion over 30 minutes.</description>
