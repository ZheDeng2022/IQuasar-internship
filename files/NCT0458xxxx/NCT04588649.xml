  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke can lead to signficiant neurological deficits, and about one-third of stroke patients&#xD;
      will be diagnosed of vascular mild cognitive impairment or post-stroke dementia. Post-stroke&#xD;
      dementia includes all types of dementia that happen after stroke, irrespective of their&#xD;
      cause, and vascular dementia (VaD), degenerative dementia (especially Alzheimer's disease),&#xD;
      or mixed dementia (dementia as a result of the coexistence of vascular lesions of the brain&#xD;
      and neurodegenerative lesions) are the most common causes of post-stroke dementia. However,&#xD;
      it is difficult to determine to what extent cognitive impairment may be attributable to&#xD;
      stroke versus concomitant Alzheimer disease. With the advent of PET imaging technique, we are&#xD;
      able to conduct a multi-modal neuroimaging study to explore the composite influence of&#xD;
      vascular injury, amyloid plaque and Tau protein the the cognitive performance after stroke.&#xD;

    <measure>CDR score of cognition deteriorating group and stable group</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>The CDR is a 5-point scale (0、0.5、1、2、3) used to characterize six domains of cognitive and functional performance applicable to Alzheimer disease and related dementias: Memory, Orientation, Judgment &amp; Problem Solving, Community Affairs, Home &amp; Hobbies, and Personal Care. The necessary information to make each rating is obtained through a semi-structured interview of the patient and a reliable informant or collateral source (e.g., family member).&#xD;
Global score 0 = Normal、0.5 = Very Mild Dementia、1 = Mild Dementia、2 = Moderate Dementia、3 = Severe Dementia. The cognition deteriorating group is defined as CDR score declines from 0 or 0.5 at Month 3 to &gt;=1 at Month 18. The cognition stable group is defined as CDR score remains at 0 or 0.5 at Month 18.</description>

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1.5 year</time_frame>
    <description>PET images are visually assessed by independent raters, who are nuclear medicine doctors and blinded to all clinical and diagnostic information. The raters classify each scan as 0-1 (no significant uptake)、2 (suspicious uptake)、3-4 (significant uptake). The score &gt;= 2 is deemed as positive condition.</description>
