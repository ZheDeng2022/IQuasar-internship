  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Theater is a complex, multi-component performing art. On stage, actors not only need to&#xD;
      memorize the script, but also be able to portray emotion and feeling through movement and&#xD;
      move in whichever manner is deemed appropriate by the script. Acting therefore requires as&#xD;
      much movement as it does vocalization. As training exercises in theater naturally involve&#xD;
      boosting physical, cognitive and affective function, and social relationships, theater&#xD;
      experience can be used to promote health and wellness. Over the last two decades, there has&#xD;
      been an increase in the use of theater to promote health and wellness among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the overall aim of this project is to evaluate the therapeutic benefits of a 10-week&#xD;
      theory-based theater program on physical functioning and emotional stress among older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Older adults residing in subsidized housing who participate in a theory-based&#xD;
      theater program will demonstrate better physical functioning, and reduction in emotional&#xD;
      stress than wait-list controls at the conclusion of a 10-week theater program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: The positive impact of the theater program on the residents' improved physical&#xD;
      functioning and stress level will be maintained at 3-month follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The design of the 10-week theater program is based on the principles of acting as written and practiced by Constantin Stanislavski in his revolutionary text on acting: &quot;An Actor Prepares&quot; [Stanislavsky C, 1989]. The exercises target concentration, voice, physical skills, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis and include 3 components: 1. Preparation for the Actor (which involves relaxation , collaboration, movement, posture, and vocality; 2. Learning the Components of the Repeatable Acting Process (which involves physicality, attention, and concentration); and 3. Synthesizing Components into Characterization (which involves creativity and emotional expression).&#xD;
Each of these components will be addressed during each of 20 sessions through the use of group warm ups, group ensemble exercises, and group recitations. Participants will perform physical, mental, and emotional exercises similar to those given to beginning acting students in traditional theater schools.</description>
