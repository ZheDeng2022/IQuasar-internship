      Subjects are to be enrolled in this clinical study if they are 18 - 55 years old and are&#xD;
      willing to have biopsies taken from a control site and the treatment area. Subjects may be&#xD;
      enrolled if they have been previously scheduled or willing to have an abdominoplasty&#xD;
      procedure after their participation in the study. A maximum of 20 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      at up to 4 study centers. Subjects will attend a screening/pretreatment visit which may be&#xD;
      performed on the same day as the treatment visit. Subjects may receive up to 5 treatments&#xD;
      with the TempSureÂ® Firm on the abdomen or flanks. All subjects will receive a phone call 1&#xD;
      week (1-10 days) post each treatment. Subjects may be asked to return for follow-up visits&#xD;
      after their final treatment for incisional biopsies. A follow up may occur at 10, 20, and/or&#xD;
      30 days post their last treatment.&#xD;
