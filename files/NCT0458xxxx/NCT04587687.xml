    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine work in&#xD;
      treating patients with follicular lymphoma that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond&#xD;
      to treatment (refractory). Brentuximab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, brentuximab, linked&#xD;
      to a toxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive cancer cells in a&#xD;
      targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. Chemotherapy drugs, such as bendamustine,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial is being done to&#xD;
      determine if the combination of brentuximab vedotin plus bendamustine is safe and to&#xD;
      determine the effectiveness of the combination.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Obtain a preliminary estimate of the anti-tumor activity of brentuximab vedotin plus&#xD;
      bendamustine hydrochloride (bendamustine) in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) CD30+&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma as determined by the complete response rate (CR) and best overall&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) as defined per Lugano criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To obtain the duration of response (DOR). To obtain the time to response (TTR). To obtain the&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) among subjects with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive&#xD;
      follicular lymphoma (FL) receiving brentuximab vedotin and bendamustine. To obtain data on&#xD;
      overall survival (OS). To evaluate the safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      bendamustine IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 2 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients&#xD;
      who respond to combination treatment and do not experience excessive toxicity may continue to&#xD;
      receive additional single-agent brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 (once every&#xD;
      21 days) for up to 10 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days, and then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;
