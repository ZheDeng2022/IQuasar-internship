  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine if serial intravitreal aflibercept&#xD;
      injections (IAI) improve the single surgery anatomic success rate following surgical repair&#xD;
      of primary, macula involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) deemed at high risk for&#xD;
      proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Preclinical work has revealed that competitive&#xD;
      inhibition of platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) by vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) potentiates a pathologic, sustained activation of PDGF receptors that is critical to&#xD;
      the progression of experimental PVR. VEGF blockade would mitigate this pathologic activation.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to determine if serial intravitreal aflibercept injections&#xD;
      (IAI) improve single surgery anatomic success rate and reduce development of clinically&#xD;
      apparent proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) following surgical repair of primary, macula&#xD;
      involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized clinical trial, with participant enrollment lasting ~120 days. 150&#xD;
      eyes will be randomized 1:1 to intervention (serial IAI) versus sham control (standard of&#xD;
      care). Adult eyes with macula involving primary RRD deemed at high risk for PVR development&#xD;
      as determined by pre-specified clinical features are eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study, Aflibercept group will receive intravitreal aflibercept injection (2mg/0.05mL) at&#xD;
      the conclusion of RRD repair surgery, at post-operative day 30 (plus/minus 7 days), and at&#xD;
      post-operative day 60 (plus/minus 7 days). Patients enrolled in the control group will&#xD;
      undergo a sham procedure at post-operative day 30 (plus/minus 7 days) and at post-operative&#xD;
      day 60 (plus/minus 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be single surgery anatomic success (retinal re-attachment) rate.&#xD;
      Additional outcomes will include: systemic and ocular safety of IAI in setting of RRD;&#xD;
      epiretinal membrane formation; presence of grade C PVR or worse; post-operative complication&#xD;
      profile; OCT-measured central macular thickness; change from baseline in visual acuity&#xD;
      (Snellen) wearing habitual correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eyes will undergo pars plana vitrectomy with or without scleral buckling and gas&#xD;
      tamponade. Post-operative exams (slit lamp biomicroscopy and indirect ophthalmoscopy) will&#xD;
      include the following time-points: Day 30, Day 60, Day 90, Day 120. All time points will have&#xD;
      a window of plus/minus 7 days, except the Day 120 visit which will be a window of plus/minus&#xD;
      14 days.&#xD;
