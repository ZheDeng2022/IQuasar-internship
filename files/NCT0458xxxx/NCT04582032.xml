      Purpose : The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of cox inhibitors as a rescue&#xD;
      agent against the rocuronium pain Methodology : Sixty patients enrolled for the general&#xD;
      anesthesia enrolled in this study. Patients were allocated into two groups (Group 1:&#xD;
      Dexketoprofen group, Group 2: Control group) .Pain was evaluated by during rocuronium&#xD;
      injection, patients were scored by a scale showed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0;No movement response to injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild movement response to injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hand withdrawal response to injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Arm withdrawal response to injection Investigators also evaluated the pain with 2&#xD;
           questions when the patient was in the recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Question 1.What was the last feeling before participants fall into sleep? question 2. Did&#xD;
      participants feel any pain on participants's hand during medication injection for anesthesia?&#xD;
