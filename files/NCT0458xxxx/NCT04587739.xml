  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth more common cancer in the world, with high&#xD;
      mortality rates, due to the low number of patients who are eligible for therapy with curative&#xD;
      intent, like surgical resection. Moreover, surgical resection is associated with a high risk&#xD;
      of tumor recurrence, because of the tumor seeding through microscopic intrahepatic vessels&#xD;
      that surround the tumor, the so-called &quot;microvascular invasion&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To adequately deal with this phenomenon, the surgeon has to perform either an 'anatomical'&#xD;
      liver resection, which remove not only the tumor but also the whole corresponding vascular&#xD;
      network, or a 'tumorectomy' with resection margins of at least 2 cm. Unfortunately, these&#xD;
      principles cannot always be achieved due to underlying liver cirrhosis that is present in&#xD;
      more than 80% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been proven to efficiently necrotize or&#xD;
      stabilize HCC nodules when surgery is not possible. Our hypothesis is that pre-treatment with&#xD;
      SBRT prior to surgical resection of HCC might improve the results through the destruction of&#xD;
      possible seeding in the peritumoral environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the novelty of this therapeutic strategy, it is necessary to verify its feasibility and&#xD;
      safety, prior to test its efficacy in patients with HCC. The KARCHeR-1 study aims at making&#xD;
      sure that preoperative SBRT would not result in important delays or serious adverse events&#xD;
      such as to cancel the planned surgical resection, in patients who otherwise could have&#xD;
      benefited from it. This issue is commonly called 'drop-out'. Thirty patients are expected to&#xD;
      be included in the KARCHeR-1 study, which would be in favor of continuing to evaluate this&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy if less than 3 drop-outs occur, and would be immediately discontinued if&#xD;
      3 drop-outs occur. Other outcomes will also been studied, like intraoperative issues,&#xD;
      postoperative morbi-mortality, pathological features on the surgical specimen and its&#xD;
      correlation with preoperative imaging, and finally, tumor recurrence and survival.&#xD;
