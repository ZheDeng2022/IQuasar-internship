  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The process of urbanization and the rapid development of information technology have greatly&#xD;
      reduced the space and time available for children's outdoor activities. In this study, we&#xD;
      expect to study the effects of the addition of physical education classes after school on the&#xD;
      academic performance, mental health, physical fitness, and myopia among primary school&#xD;
      children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urbanization has led to a shrinking of the space suitable for residential activities and a&#xD;
      dramatic change in the behavioural patterns, which is particularly evident in children. The&#xD;
      spread and development of information technology has reduced children's time for physical&#xD;
      activity. Previous studies have found that physical activity is essential for the growth and&#xD;
      development of adolescents, preventing and reducing obesity, slowing the development of&#xD;
      myopia, and is closely linked to mental health. However, parents in China are concerned that&#xD;
      increased outdoor activity will reduce the amount of time spent studying and affect academic&#xD;
      performance. Currently, there is a lack of strong evidence on the impact of physical activity&#xD;
      on academic performance. In this study, we propose to provide after-school physical education&#xD;
      classes for students in primary schools in a rapidly urbanizing area, and assess the effects&#xD;
      of the intervention on children's academic performance, physical fitness, myopia, and mental&#xD;
      health to provide evidence for the development of educational programs and arrangements for&#xD;
      after-school activities.&#xD;
