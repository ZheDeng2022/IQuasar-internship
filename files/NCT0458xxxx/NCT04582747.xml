      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery is a risk factor for acute kidney Injury (AKI). Surgery exposes patients to&#xD;
      hypotension, sepsis, the infusion of blood products, ischaemia, oxidative stress and&#xD;
      reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who develop AKI post operatively are susceptible to fluid overload, infections, and&#xD;
      cardiac events. AKI confers an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and mortality.&#xD;
      Studies assessing rates of AKI in general surgical patients place the frequency at 1-14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Established methods of assessing for AKI - products of nitrogen breakdown and urine output -&#xD;
      have limitations. Serum creatinine and urea are affected by sex, nutritional status, blood in&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract, and fluid resuscitation. Rises in serum creatinine become&#xD;
      apparent once glomerular filtration has reduced by half. This potentially delays the use of&#xD;
      reno-protective strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Novel biomarkers have been investigated. These aim to verify the use of renal biomarkers as a&#xD;
      method of identifying AKI more rapidly: It is hoped that reno-protective strategies could be&#xD;
      adopted sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much work has concerned cardiac and transplant surgery. AKI rates have been quoted as high as&#xD;
      30% in this cohort. Results were initially encouraging for various biomarkers. One biomarker&#xD;
      (Insulin like growth factor binding protein number 7 / Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases&#xD;
      2 - IGFBP-7/TIMP-2) has therefore been incorporated into Enhanced Recovery Programmes in such&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While research in cardiac and transplant surgery has been extensive, it has been limited with&#xD;
      regards to abdominal surgery. Although rates of AKI are lower in this cohort, they still bear&#xD;
      a significant burden of disease. At present, no biomarker has been found to be clinically&#xD;
      useful in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The validation of Urinary Biomarkers for use in the prediction of AKI in major abdominal&#xD;
      surgery patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the role different surgical sub-types and peri-operative factors have in causing&#xD;
      AKI in Major Abdominal Surgery patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study that will assess the use of Urinary biomarkers against&#xD;
      conventional methods of assessing for AKI, the Kidney Disease, Improving Global Outcomes&#xD;
      (KDIGO) criteria. The KDIGO criteria is based on increases in serum creatinine and reduction&#xD;
      in urine output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomarkers are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IGFBP-7/TIMP-2 Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin (NGAL) Kidney Injury Molecule 1&#xD;
      (KIM-1) Dickkopf related protein 3 (DKK-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients undergoing major elective general surgery, and major abdominal gynaecological&#xD;
      surgery will be included. All patients will have a urine sample taken 4 hours post&#xD;
      operatively. This sample will be tested using the biomarkers. Written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form has been designed with help of 10 surgical inpatients and 4 surgical nurses&#xD;
      to ensure ease of understanding and a lack of medical jargon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No changes are required to standard patient care. The urine sample obtained will be a&#xD;
      catheter specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of the novel biomarkers against conventional methods will be conducted using the&#xD;
      KDIGO criteria. This entails regular urine output measurement, assessment of blood urea,&#xD;
      electrolytes, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Data regarding patient, operative and&#xD;
      post-operative characteristics will be recorded on a purpose-built secure hospital intranet&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance of the biomarkers will be assessed using multiple logistic regression, and by&#xD;
      conducting 'area under the receiver-operator curve (AUROC)' analysis. A risk prediction model&#xD;
      will be created based on patient factors strongly associated with the primary endpoint. The&#xD;
      performance of the risk prediction model will be assessed as a standalone test and in&#xD;
      conjunction with the novel biomarker tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was calculated on the basis of previously published AUROC values for the&#xD;
      test, the expected prevalence of AKI, and a desire for a 95% confidence interval around the&#xD;
      calculated AUROC estimate for the study. This results in a target sample size of 471.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hoped Aims of Research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers hope that a novel test is found that can identify AKI sooner in an at-risk&#xD;
      cohort of patients. If so, a further trial is intended: post-operative patients who are&#xD;
      positive to the novel test will be randomised to a kidney protective 'bundle', and rates of&#xD;
      AKI compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, the intention is to greatly reduce a significant cause of post-operative&#xD;
      morbidity, surgical complications, and mortality, through the judicious use of a non-invasive&#xD;
      test.&#xD;

    <measure>The diagnostic performance (expressed as the 'Area under the receiver-operator curve') of Urinary Biomarkers for the rapid prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in Major Abdominal Surgery patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>The study aims to assess the diagnostic performance of the biomarkers to predict the development of AKI within 3 days of the surgical procedure. Renal function will be assessed daily within this time frame.</time_frame>
    <description>Conventional renal function measurement - assessing blood creatinine - often does not identify Acute Kidney Injury until 48 hours has passed from the time of insult.&#xD;
It is hypothesised that the studied urinary biomarkers may be able to identify patients who develop AKI 4 hours post-operatively.</description>
