      Transnasal Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy (TFL) is a common procedure in the otolaryngology clinic&#xD;
      for the examination of vocal cord appearance and function, inspection and follow up of benign&#xD;
      and malignant lesions, and investigating foreign body ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many forms for applying preprocedural local nasal anesthesia such as atomizers,&#xD;
      nebulizers, spray, soaked pads, or local anesthetic gel application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Products containing lidocaine are used in everyday practice, sometimes combined with&#xD;
      vasoconstrictors such as oxymetazoline or phenylephrine. Lidocaine does not require special&#xD;
      storage conditions and is a relatively inexpensive product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides its use for local nasal anesthesia, lidocaine is also widely used for local and&#xD;
      regional anesthesia in dentistry, emergency medicine, and surgical or invasive procedures.&#xD;
      The addition of bicarbonate for lowering the acidity level of the solution has been studied&#xD;
      before in these applications. The buffered solution demonstrated decreased patients pain and&#xD;
      increased patient preference[1,2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solutions containing lidocaine with a vasoconstrictor such as epinephrine are widely used for&#xD;
      soft tissue injection. This combination allows the benefits of prolonged anesthetic and&#xD;
      decreased bleeding of the surgical site. However, this combination disadvantage includes&#xD;
      increased acidity of the solutions, which may cause increased pain or burning sensation&#xD;
      during drug administration. Alkalinization of combined lidocaine and epinephrine solutions&#xD;
      has shown decreased local site pain, shorter onset time, and longer duration of&#xD;
      anesthesia[3]. The addition of bicarbonate may be done by mixing into a syringe or other&#xD;
      suitable container in a relatively easy and fast application for clinical use. Alternatively,&#xD;
      a designated device may be used, such as the Onpharma mixing system (Onpharma), commonly used&#xD;
      in dentistry[4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the alkalinization of lidocaine had shown advantages in local injection into soft&#xD;
      tissues, its efficacy for local nasal anesthesia was not previously examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study compares the effect of buffered versus plain lidocaine for local nasal anesthesia.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>trial containing two groups. The first group receives an intranasal solution of lidocaine combined with bicarbonate. The second group receives intranasal plain lidocaine. After a measured time of 5 minutes, all patients will attend a TFL examination. The patients will fill the first questionnaire immediately after the procedure, a second questionnaire by telephone after one hour, and the third questionnaire by telephone after a one-month follow-up.&#xD;
Sample size was calculated using data from a previous publication of local soft tissue injection with buffered lidocaine5. This estimation power analysis showed that for VAS average and standard deviation were 3.5±1.4 for the lidocaine group and 2.5±1.4 for the second group given lidocaine with bicarbonate. In order to achieve a statistical power of 90% and significance of p&lt;0.05 a sample of 40 patients is needed for each group, 80 patients in total. The comparison will be made using Mann-Whitney U-test.</intervention_model_description>
