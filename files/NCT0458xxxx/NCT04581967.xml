      Genetic polymorphisms of metabolic enzymes may influence the metabolism of&#xD;
      Doxorubicin-Cyclophosphamide regimen in breast cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators want to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. evaluate the frequency or incidence of the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 and ALDH3A1&#xD;
           in breast cancer patients, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. analyze the association between the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2C19 and ALDH3A1 and&#xD;
           toxicities in breast cancer patients treated by Doxorubicin-Cyclophosphamide regimen&#xD;
           therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer refers to the erratic growth and proliferation of cells that originate in the&#xD;
      breast tissue, most commonly from the inner lining of milk ducts (ductal cancers) or the&#xD;
      lobules that supply the ducts with milk (lobular cancers). Breast cancer is about 100 times&#xD;
      more common in women than in men, although males tend to have poorer outcomes due to delays&#xD;
      in diagnosis. Alteration in hormonal level and Family history of breast cancer are risk&#xD;
      factors for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The classic symptom for breast cancer is a lump found in the breast or armpit. Doing monthly&#xD;
      breast self-exam (BSE) is a great way to be familiar with the breasts' texture, cyclical&#xD;
      changes, size, and skin condition. Breast cancer is usually diagnosed by biopsy of nodule&#xD;
      detected by mammogram or by palpitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today there are so many approaches, which can be made for the treatment of breast cancer such&#xD;
      as surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and recently nanotechnology and&#xD;
      gene therapy. Chemotherapy is the use of anti-cancer drugs to treat cancerous cells. The&#xD;
      differences in patients' response to the same medication, toxicity included, are one of the&#xD;
      major problems in breast cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy toxicity makes a significant clinical problem due to decreased quality of life,&#xD;
      prolongation of treatment and reinforcement of negative emotions associated with therapy.&#xD;
      Four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) chemotherapy regimen has become a&#xD;
      standard regimen. No chemotherapy regimen administered for four cycles has proven to be&#xD;
      superior to AC. The undeniable advantage of this therapy scheme is low cost of treatment, its&#xD;
      proven efficacy and mostly acceptable toxicity. Hematological (neutropenia and anemia) and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and mucositis) toxicities are common in patients treated&#xD;
      with AC regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doxorubicin is metabolized by the CBR (carbonyl reductase) enzymes to its active component.&#xD;
      Similarly cyclophosphamide, the cell cycle nonspecific prodrug, requires activation by a&#xD;
      number of different cytochrome P450 enzymes, mainly of CYP2C family. The transport systems&#xD;
      are also crucial for the treatment outcome, as both importers and exporters are responsible&#xD;
      for the cellular drugs' concentration. It is expected that any variation that affects&#xD;
      metabolic enzymes and transporter activity would be reflected in not only the response to&#xD;
      treatment, but also in the development of drug-related toxicity. Each of these enzymes and&#xD;
      transporter genes is known to exhibit a degree of genetic variation, characterized by single&#xD;
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In particular, there have been few investigations of the&#xD;
      possible influence of variations in the genes encoding transporters and drug metabolizing&#xD;
      enzymes relevant for the two drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacogenomic analysis offers the promise that personalized regimens may be identified for&#xD;
      individuals who might have more favorable outcomes with certain chemotherapies. Specifically,&#xD;
      because genetic variation in metabolic enzymes is one determinant of drug concentration,&#xD;
      pharmacogenomics has been proposed as an approach to tailor drug choice or dose to optimize&#xD;
      efficacy and reduce toxicity of cancer treatments.&#xD;
