  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of academic detailing (evidence-based provider education)&#xD;
      with or without patient pre-visit preparation (elicitation of values and preferences) on safe&#xD;
      insulin de-prescribing among older patients with type 2 diabetes at risk for hypoglycemia.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients who are well-prepared for their primary care visit will&#xD;
      engage in more informed discussions with their providers regarding re-evaluation of current&#xD;
      treatment regimens. In clinically appropriate cases, these more effective discussions will&#xD;
      result in safe de-prescribing and fewer future episodes of hypoglycemia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this comparative effectiveness clinical trial, primary care physicians (PCPs) will receive&#xD;
      2 academic detailing sessions 6 months apart. Eligible patients (age 75 years or greater,&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes, prescribed insulin or sulfonylureas [SUs], and last measured HbA1c &lt;=8%) of&#xD;
      these PCPs will be randomized to receive either a pre-visit conversation aid/communication&#xD;
      tool that elicits values and preferences regarding safe insulin/SU deprescribing&#xD;
      [Intervention] or a general health education handout (&quot;Embracing Life as You Age&quot;) [Attention&#xD;
      Control]. Patient-reported outcomes (e.g., self-reported hypoglycemia episodes) and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., changes in glycemic regimen) will be compared between study arms. If&#xD;
      successful, this study will provide evidence to support strategies for safer treatment in&#xD;
      older adults with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There are two arms within the comparative effectiveness RCT. All eligible PCPs will receive academic detailing. Eligible and consenting patients of these PCPs will be randomly allocated to intervention vs attention control arms grouped by PCP. (There will be a secondary, parallel comparison group to measure temporal trends in care for similar patients at other facilities in our care system not involved in the clinical trial.)</intervention_model_description>
