  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Failed Back Surgery Syndrome is commonly defined as new, recurrent, or persistent pain in the&#xD;
      back and/or leg(s) of at least 6-month duration following spinal surgery. The literature&#xD;
      estimates that 10-50% of patients undergoing spinal surgery are likely to develop such pain,&#xD;
      representing a substantial financial burden. Among them, 5-10% would suffer from severe pain,&#xD;
      which are intense, neuropathic and generally refractory to conventional therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies considerably affect patients' functional capacity as well as their psychological&#xD;
      and social well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) is a well-established therapy to alleviate severe intractable&#xD;
      neuropathic pain such as FBSS. SCS is a safe and reversible treatment option, which leads to&#xD;
      improvement in pain relief and quality of life for patients with FBSS. Despite encouraging&#xD;
      results in a chronic painful patient population that is refractory to conventional therapies,&#xD;
      the literature estimates that only 58% [53% - 64%] of patients implanted with SCS devices&#xD;
      achieved adequate pain relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FBSS population characterization and stratification and predictive modeling of SCS outcome&#xD;
      are thus crucial to delineate future treatment options and to deliver neuromodulation therapy&#xD;
      to the right patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators designed a clinical prospective project based on SCS outcome optimization&#xD;
      and SCS candidates' stratification: PREDIBACK 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study would be a following part of a continuous project (PREDIBACK) that aims to better&#xD;
      understand and stratify the therapies (drugs, surgery, psychological therapy or SCS) proposed&#xD;
      to FBSS patients. The goal of PREDIBACK 1 was to develop a decision tool that simplifies the&#xD;
      therapeutic decision process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PREDIBACK 2 will focus on the neuromodulation pathway. Easing and helping patient orientation&#xD;
      should improve referral yielding to specialists and accelerate patient flow through care&#xD;
      pathway. Hence, facilitating access to adequate therapies for FBSS patients who usually have&#xD;
      a longstanding history of pain.&#xD;
