  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to improve clinical outcomes for patients with type 2 diabetes by&#xD;
      limiting the burden associated with insulin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get insulin degludec as well as insulin icodec - Insulin icodec is a new&#xD;
      medicine while insulin degludec is commonly used and prescribed by doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will administer subcutaneous injections of insulin degludec once daily for at&#xD;
      least one week (7 injections) but this period may be extended up to 8 weeks. Thereafter, once&#xD;
      weekly subcutaneous injections of insulin icodec will follow, resulting in a total of at&#xD;
      least 8 but not more than 16 subcutaneous injections of icodec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 17-32 weeks Participants will have at least 5 in-house visits&#xD;
      (where participants will stay at the clinic) and 17 outpatient visits with the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women cannot take part if pregnant, breast-feeding or plan to become pregnant during the&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
