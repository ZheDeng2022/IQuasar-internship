  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to test the effectiveness of a successful anti-drug&#xD;
      communications campaign (Be Under your Own Influence) to lower substance use among AI 7th&#xD;
      graders. The campaign uses messages that support youths' personal autonomy and future&#xD;
      aspirations, and these messages are delivered to 7th graders using high school students. Our&#xD;
      goal is to develop a turnkey package for the broader population of AI youth and schools and&#xD;
      to develop components that can incorporate flexibility and creativity in their delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use is a particularly dangerous risk to middle-school youth, and American Indian&#xD;
      (AI) youth are at increased risk. We have found over the course of more than three decades&#xD;
      that substance use among AI youth is consistently higher than that of other ethnic/racial&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools are often the site for adolescent drug prevention efforts, but results from these&#xD;
      efforts are often modest or even disappointing. This intervention adapts an existing campaign&#xD;
      (Be Under Your Own Influence; BUYOI) that has been found to be effective in reducing&#xD;
      substance use and that uses campaign messages that are congruent with AI culture. The&#xD;
      intervention will be adapted using significant contributions from tribal members, including&#xD;
      youth, teachers, parents, elders, and other community members. This proposal includes active&#xD;
      involvement of local advisory boards, hiring of a local AI liaison, focus groups, a youth&#xD;
      photo voice component, and use of AI staff from our Center and from the Native American&#xD;
      Cultural Center at our university.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adapted anti-drug and alcohol use communications campaign will be delivered by selected&#xD;
      high school students to 7th grade students. A distinguishing feature of the BUYOI campaign is&#xD;
      a message that targets outcome expectations related to aspirations, autonomy, and physical&#xD;
      harms. The campaign will use multiple channels of communication including print (e.g.,&#xD;
      posters and fliers), video and audio spots, presentations, and social media to deliver&#xD;
      messages that are designed to alter outcome expectancies, intentions, and ultimately&#xD;
      substance use among targeted youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The campaign will be delivered to two cohorts of 7th graders, with 4 longitudinal measurement&#xD;
      occasions for each cohort. Five middle schools (and their corresponding high schools) have&#xD;
      been recruited for the study, where three of these will be randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention condition and two to the control condition. Multilevel data analysis will test&#xD;
      for effects of campaign exposure on autonomy, aspirations, perceived harm, and intentions to&#xD;
      use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the heavy involvement of the school and community in the development and delivery&#xD;
      of the intervention, we will be able to incorporate sustainability into the design of all&#xD;
      integrated components. Ultimately, our goal is to develop a turnkey package for the broader&#xD;
      population of reservation-based AI youth and schools and to develop components that can&#xD;
      incorporate flexibility and creativity in their delivery. For example, a school or local&#xD;
      group may implement the campaign in its original form or they may modify aspects to make them&#xD;
      more pertinent to their community.&#xD;
