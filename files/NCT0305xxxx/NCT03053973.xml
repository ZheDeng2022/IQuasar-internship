      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application of long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in chronic obstructive pulmonary&#xD;
      disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) has recently been&#xD;
      shown to improve outcomes. However, the mechanism behind these improvements are unknown. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that NIV stabilizes FEV1 via beneficial effects on inflammation and repair&#xD;
      pathways in patients with COPD. In the present study we aim to investigate, in COPD patients&#xD;
      with CHRF,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. change in FEV1 after 3 months nocturnal NIV in stable hypercapnic COPD patients as&#xD;
           compared to standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the relationship between FEV1 change and modification of systemic and airway&#xD;
           inflammation and remodelling, lung hyperinflation, and airway morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. predictors of a favourable response to chronic NIV in COPD patients with CHRF. Study&#xD;
           design: multicentre randomised controlled study investigating the effects of NIV on&#xD;
           airway morphology, airway inflammation and remodelling in hypercapnic COPD patients&#xD;
           including a control group that will postpone the initiation of NIV for 3 months. In&#xD;
           addition we will investigate how patient demographics, patient and disease&#xD;
           characteristics and systemic and airway inflammation predict the response to chronic NIV&#xD;
           in severe stable COPD. To do this, all patients will be followed for 6 months after NIV&#xD;
           initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint is the change FEV1 after 3 months.&#xD;
      Furthermore, as we recognise that FEV1 might not be the most important patient-related&#xD;
      outcome, we will assess which parameters affect health-related quality of life after 3 and 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

      Rationale: Application of long-term non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure (CHRF) has&#xD;
      recently been shown to improve outcomes when applied with sufficiently high inspiratory&#xD;
      pressures and adequate backup breathing frequencies (high-intensity NIV). Interestingly, it&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that nocturnal NIV improves not only clinical but also physiological&#xD;
      parameters like arterial carbon dioxide pressure (PaCO¬2¬) and forced expiratory volume in 1&#xD;
      second (FEV1) in patients with stable COPD. However, the mechanism behind these improvements&#xD;
      are unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether this improvement in lung function influences&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), the utmost goal of chronic NIV in COPD, or that other&#xD;
      baseline patient- and ventilatory characteristics are more important in predicting a&#xD;
      long-term beneficial effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that NIV stabilizes FEV1 via beneficial effects on inflammation and repair&#xD;
      pathways in the airways of patients with COPD. We aim to study this hypothesis and to&#xD;
      investigate the regulation of lung function, markers of inflammation and repair pathways in&#xD;
      airway biopsies, bronchial wash and bronchial and nasal epithelium in response to home&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. The second goal of this study is to define a phenotype of patients&#xD;
      with COPD, based on baseline characteristics and biomarkers, such as markers of inflammation,&#xD;
      who will respond to NIV therapy with improvements in lung function and HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate change in FEV1 after 3 months nocturnal NIV in stable hypercapnic COPd&#xD;
           patients as compared to standard care&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the relationship between FEV1 change and modification of systemic and&#xD;
           airway inflammation and remodelling, lung hyperinflation, and airway morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate predictors of a favourable response to chronic NIV in COPD patients with&#xD;
           CHRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study is multicentre randomised controlled study investigating the effects&#xD;
      of NIV on airway morphology, airway inflammation and remodelling in hypercapnic COPD patients&#xD;
      including a control group that will postpone the initiation of NIV for 3 months. To measure&#xD;
      these parameters a bronchoscopy with a bronchial wash and bronchial biopsies and&#xD;
      high-resolution CT-scanning we be done at baseline and after 3 months. In a addition we will&#xD;
      investigate how patient demographics, patient and disease characteristics and systemic and&#xD;
      airway inflammation predict the response to chronic NIV in severe stable COPD. To do this,&#xD;
      all COPD patients initiated on NIV in our centre will be followed for 6 months after NIV&#xD;
      initiation as part of the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients who have an indication for NIV (COPD Global Initiative of&#xD;
      Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) III or IV and a PaCO2 &gt; 6.0 kilopascal (kPa) in stable&#xD;
      disease) in the Netherlands will be asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For investigating airway inflammation, to ensure safety during the bronchoscopies, patients&#xD;
      with severe gas exchange derangements (i.e. PaCO2 &gt; 8.0 kPa and /or partial arterial oxygen&#xD;
      pressure (PaO2)&lt;6.5 kPa at rest during spontaneous breathing), and instable cardiac&#xD;
      comorbidities will be excluded. These patients will be included to be followed for 6 months&#xD;
      prospectively after NIV initiation, according to the same protocol, however, without&#xD;
      CT-scanning and bronchoscopies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint is the change FEV1 after 3 months. Several&#xD;
      markers of blood and airway inflammation and remodeling will be assessed to analyse&#xD;
      mechanisms of FEV1 improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, as we recognise that FEV1 might not be the most important patient-related&#xD;
      outcome, we will assess which parameters affect health-related quality of life after 3 and 6&#xD;
      months. For this, parameters of the total group of patients will be used.&#xD;
