      This is a Phase 3 within-subject non-inferiority trial of Technegas ventilation imaging&#xD;
      compared to Xenon-133 (Xe-133) ventilation imaging to demonstrate the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      Technegas compared to Xe-133 ventilation studies with respect to subject pulmonary&#xD;
      ventilatory distribution. Subjects will undergo site-specific standard of care (SOC) Xe-133&#xD;
      imaging per medical needs followed by Technegas ventilation imaging per study protocol.&#xD;
      Primary assessments of efficacy will be based on three blinded readers' assessments of the&#xD;
      Technegas and Xe-133 ventilation images in independent reading sessions.&#xD;

    <measure>Blinded Readers Percent Agreement (PA) for Matching Image Views</measure>
    <time_frame>The median duration of Technegas imaging was 22 minutes. Blinded reader assessments of images ranged from &lt;1 month to 16 months following the imaging (median 5 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Three blinded readers independently assessed the Xe-133 and Technegas images in separate reading sessions. Readers were blinded to all clinical information except a subject's screening chest X-ray. Xe-133 images were obtained per site-specific standard of care. Technegas images included a 6-view image set, and the primary endpoint was based on assessment of the subset of views that matched the Xe-133 image views. At the start of each case-read, a reader visually divided each lung into 3 regions of approximately equal size arranged craniocaudally (apical, mid, and basal), 6 regions in total, and then assessed each lung region for ventilation according to a three-point scale: 0=absent ventilation, 1=decreased ventilation, 2=normal ventilation. At the unplanned interim stage, PA between the Xe-133 scores and Technegas scores was tested for non-inferiority at one-sided alpha=0.0141, equivalent to the lower bound of the 97.18% confidence interval exceeding 60%.</description>

    <description>Three blinded readers independently assessed the Xe-133 and Technegas images in separate reading sessions. Readers were blinded to all clinical information except a subject's screening chest X-ray. Xe-133 images were obtained per site-specific standard of care. Technegas images included a 6-view image set. Two sequential reads were conducted of each subject's Technegas images. In the first read, only views that matched the Xe-133 image views were presented and read, and assessments based on the matched views were used in the primary outcome measure. Immediately following the commitment of those assessments, all Technegas image views were presented to the reader, and a second assessment of all the Technegas image views was made using the same ventilation scoring metric as described for the primary outcome measure. The estimation of PA and its analyses were also the same as for the primary outcome measure.</description>

    <description>Percent agreement (PA) measuring inter-observer agreement between pairs of blinded readers for their ventilation scoring assessments within each of the three imaging groups: Xe-133, Technegas matched views, and Technegas all views. For each image set, a reader scored 6 regions of the lungs according to a three-point scale: 0=absent ventilation, 1=decreased ventilation, 2=normal ventilation; agreement between a pair of readers' assessments was based on the agreement of their ventilation scores by subject and lung region.</description>

    <description>By lung-region kappa statistics measuring inter-observer agreement between pairs of blinded readers for their ventilation scoring assessments within each of the three imaging groups: Xe-133, Technegas matched views, and Technegas all views. For each image set, a reader scored 6 regions of the lungs according to a three-point scale: 0=absent ventilation, 1=decreased ventilation, 2=normal ventilation. Kappa statistics for a pair of readers' assessments were derived from the frequencies of the cross-tabulation of the readers' ventilation scores by lung region. Kappa statistics are an index of inter-observer agreement corrected for chance with possible values ranging from -1 to 1, where 1 represents perfect agreement.</description>

        <title>Blinded Readers Percent Agreement (PA) for Matching Image Views</title>
        <description>Three blinded readers independently assessed the Xe-133 and Technegas images in separate reading sessions. Readers were blinded to all clinical information except a subject's screening chest X-ray. Xe-133 images were obtained per site-specific standard of care. Technegas images included a 6-view image set, and the primary endpoint was based on assessment of the subset of views that matched the Xe-133 image views. At the start of each case-read, a reader visually divided each lung into 3 regions of approximately equal size arranged craniocaudally (apical, mid, and basal), 6 regions in total, and then assessed each lung region for ventilation according to a three-point scale: 0=absent ventilation, 1=decreased ventilation, 2=normal ventilation. At the unplanned interim stage, PA between the Xe-133 scores and Technegas scores was tested for non-inferiority at one-sided alpha=0.0141, equivalent to the lower bound of the 97.18% confidence interval exceeding 60%.</description>
        <time_frame>The median duration of Technegas imaging was 22 minutes. Blinded reader assessments of images ranged from &lt;1 month to 16 months following the imaging (median 5 months).</time_frame>
        <population>Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisting of subjects who completed all of the ventilation imaging on the study, and both sets of Xe-133 planar scans and the Technegas planar scans were of interpretable image quality according to site Investigators' assessment.</population>

            <other_analysis_desc>Estimates of inter-observer percent agreement were obtained as follows. For each reader-pair, binary agreement scores by subject and lung region were analyzed using a generalized linear model with SASÂ® PROC GENMOD. The logit function (log odds ratio) was specified as the link function, and subject was specified as a repeated measure to allow for correlations between lung regions within a subject. The estimate of the intercept of the model using generalized estimating equation (GEE) methodology provided an overall estimate of the agreement and corresponding confidence interval in terms of the log odds ratio. Simple algebra was used to obtain the corresponding estimates and confidence intervals in terms of percent agreement.</other_analysis_desc>

        <title>Kappa Statistics Between Pairs of Blinded Readers by Lung Region</title>
        <description>By lung-region kappa statistics measuring inter-observer agreement between pairs of blinded readers for their ventilation scoring assessments within each of the three imaging groups: Xe-133, Technegas matched views, and Technegas all views. For each image set, a reader scored 6 regions of the lungs according to a three-point scale: 0=absent ventilation, 1=decreased ventilation, 2=normal ventilation. Kappa statistics for a pair of readers' assessments were derived from the frequencies of the cross-tabulation of the readers' ventilation scores by lung region. Kappa statistics are an index of inter-observer agreement corrected for chance with possible values ranging from -1 to 1, where 1 represents perfect agreement.</description>
        <time_frame>The median duration of Technegas imaging was 22 minutes. Blinded reader assessments of images ranged from &lt;1 month to 16 months following the imaging (median 5 months).</time_frame>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Unblinded analysis of imaging efficacy data was to be done at completion of study and all blinded readings. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic impact on enrollment, FDA recommended an unplanned interim analysis be performed using blind read data from 200 subjects. Interim analysis was done by independent 3rd party statistician and reviewed by a Data Efficacy Monitoring Committee (DEMC), which recommended termination of the study based on positive results. Sponsor agreed.</limitations_and_caveats>
