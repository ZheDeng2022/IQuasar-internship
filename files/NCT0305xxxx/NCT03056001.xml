  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of doxorubicin&#xD;
      in combination with pembrolizumab in subjects with metastatic or unresectable soft tissue&#xD;
      sarcoma. Based on previous studies, pembrolizumab may be an effective study treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and toxicity profile of&#xD;
      doxorubicin and pembrolizumab in previously treated or untreated subjects with unresectable&#xD;
      or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The secondary objectives are to assess overall survival,&#xD;
      and response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS) with this&#xD;
      regimen using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The exploratory objectives are to assess PFS, overall&#xD;
      response rate, duration of response, and disease control rate using the immune-related RECIST&#xD;
      (irRECIST) criteria, evaluate the correlation between PD-L1 expression levels and antitumor&#xD;
      activity of MK-3475, investigate other biomarkers that may correlate with tumor responses,&#xD;
      and evaluate differences in tumor tissue characteristics in biopsies taken during or&#xD;
      post-treatment with MK-3475 versus baseline.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable or metastatic soft&#xD;
             tissue sarcoma not amenable to curative treatment with surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;
             Patients with Ewings sarcoma, osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, Kaposis sarcoma,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), clear cell sarcoma, alveolar soft part sarcoma&#xD;
             and any other soft tissue or bone sarcoma felt to be chemotherapy resistant in the&#xD;
             opinion of the Sponsor-Investigator will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Must not have received prior treatment with an anthracycline chemotherapy (eg,&#xD;
             doxorubicin) and/or anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. May have had any number of prior systemic cytotoxic therapies for&#xD;
             unresectable/metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Must have at least one radiologically measurable lesion as per RECIST 1.1 defined as a&#xD;
             lesion that is 10mm in longest diameter or lymph node that is 15mm in short axis&#xD;
             imaged by CT scan or MRI. Tumors with previously irradiated field will be designated&#xD;
             as nontarget lesions unless progression is documented or a biopsy is obtained to&#xD;
             confirm persistence of at least 90 days following completion of radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. All subjects with accessible tumor will be asked to provide a fresh tumor biopsy if&#xD;
             they can be safely biopsied in the opinion of the investigator. Recently obtained&#xD;
             archived core or excisional biopsy of a tumor lesion (obtained up to 12 months prior&#xD;
             to Cycle 1 Day 1) may be substituted only if the subject is unwilling or unable (e.g.&#xD;
             inaccessible or subject safety concern) to undergo a fresh tumor biopsy. Subjects who&#xD;
             are unwilling or unable to have a fresh tumor biopsy and do not have recently obtained&#xD;
             archived tissue available may submit an archived specimen (obtained &gt; 12 months prior&#xD;
             to Cycle 1 Day 1) only upon approval from the Sponsor-Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Be at least 12 years of age on day of signing informed consent. Assent will be&#xD;
             obtained in appropriately aged subjects per institutional guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Life expectancy of at least 3 months per the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have adequate organ function as indicated by the laboratory values in Table 1 of&#xD;
             protocol. All screening labs should be performed within 10 days of treatment&#xD;
             initiation. PT/INR and PTT must be performed within 7 days of study treatment&#xD;
             initiation for subjects on anti-coagulants such as coumadin/heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) greater than or equal to 50%&#xD;
             assessed within 21 days prior to study regimen initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects must not be expecting to conceive or father children within the timeframe&#xD;
             referenced below. Subjects of childbearing potential must be willing to adhere to the&#xD;
             contraception requirement as described in Section 3.3.2 from the day of the screening&#xD;
             visit (or 14 days prior to the initiation of study treatment for oral contraception)&#xD;
             throughout the study period up to 120 days after the last dose of pembrolizumab and/or&#xD;
             up to 180 days after the last dose of doxorubicin. If there is any question that a&#xD;
             subject of childbearing potential will not reliably comply with the requirements for&#xD;
             contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test at screening (within 72 hours of first dose of study treatment). If the&#xD;
             urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the subject to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Subject has voluntarily agreed to participate by giving written informed consent for&#xD;
             the trial. The subject may also provide consent for Optional and Future&#xD;
             Studies-Biospecimen Collection. However, the subject may participate in the main trial&#xD;
             without participating in Optional and Future Studies.&#xD;

             less than or equal to Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to previous&#xD;
             mAbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have had prior chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy&#xD;

             (i.e. less than or equal to Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to&#xD;
             previous chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Subjects with less than or equal to Grade 2 neuropathy are an exception to this&#xD;
             criterion and may qualify for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: If subjects have received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately&#xD;
             from the toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy&#xD;

             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin or squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin that has undergone potentially curative therapy or in situ cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis. Subjects with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided&#xD;
             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of study regimen and any neurologic symptoms have returned to&#xD;
             baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to the first dose of the study regimen. This&#xD;
             exception does not include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of&#xD;
             clinical stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;

             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subjects&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subjects to participate, in the opinion of the treating Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial as determined by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Are pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Have received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent.&#xD;

             antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Have known active Hepatitis B (e.g. HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g. HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Have received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy. Note:&#xD;
             Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and&#xD;
