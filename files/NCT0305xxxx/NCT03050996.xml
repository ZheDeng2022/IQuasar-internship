  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary continence recovery remains one of the most bothersome side effect of modern radical&#xD;
      prostate surgery and several technical modifications, especially in Robotic assisted radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy procedures, have been reported in order to improve early urinary continence&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to improve the urinary continence recovery after robotic prostatectomy, we&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the use of a 6-branch retropubic suburethral autologous sling, created&#xD;
      and placed during the procedure, in association with intraoperative evaluation of the&#xD;
      retrograde leak point pressure by means of retrograde perfusion sphincterometry for proper&#xD;
      sling tensioning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Retrograde leak point pressure (RLPP) is intraoperatively evaluated, by means of retrograde&#xD;
      perfusion sphinterometry, in patients scheduled to undergo RALP at our Institution, with no&#xD;
      patient affected by preoperative urinary incontinence or neurological disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrograde Perfusion Sphincterometry (RPS) technique. With the patient under general&#xD;
      anaesthesia, with a nasogastric tube and rectal tube to decompress the bowel, properly&#xD;
      positioned for RALP procedure (30° of trendelemburg), a graduated fluid supporting pole is&#xD;
      positioned in order that the 0 cm position resulted at the level of patient's pubis . At the&#xD;
      beginning of the surgical procedure, the indwelling 16ch Foley catheter is inserted and the&#xD;
      bladder fully emptied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The deflated Foley catheter is then retracted to mid urethra/fossa navicularis and inflated&#xD;
      with 1.5 cc of Saline in order to prevent fluid extravasation from the external meatus. The&#xD;
      catheter is then connected to a 500 cc of Saline perfusate bottle and the bottle is&#xD;
      progressively lowered (along the fluid supporting pole) from an eight of 1 meter above the&#xD;
      pubis till the fluid stops to flow. The value, in cmH2O, at which the fluid stops to flow&#xD;
      into the bladder represents the RLPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six-branch autologous sling surgical technique. Briefly, after bilateral vas deferens&#xD;
      harvesting at the time of bladder mobilization during RALP, the sling is prepared on scrub&#xD;
      nurse table with six absorbable CT2 needle 0-Vicryl sutures (each measuring 16 cm in length),&#xD;
      tight centrally together; the vas deferens are cut in 6 specimens and transfixed with the&#xD;
      suture and collected centrally in order to create the bulky central part of the sling .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before urinary continuity restoration, the sling is introduced into the surgical field and&#xD;
      its extremities are fixed bilaterally to the periosteum of the pubic branches at medial (just&#xD;
      lateral to the symphysis), lateral and posterior level; the denonvilliers fascia is restored&#xD;
      in a double layer fashion in order to separate the urethrovesical anastomosis from the sling.&#xD;
      Upon completion of the urethrovesical anastomosis, the sling is tensioned, tightening&#xD;
      together the two medial branches first, then the two lateral ones. After subjective proper&#xD;
      tension is achieved, the RLPP is evaluated and the tension adjusted accordingly to pre&#xD;
      surgery values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RLPP was respectively evaluated before pneumoperitoneum induction (RLPPb) and after&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum induction (RLPPp). RLPP was then evaluated after urethrovesical anastomosis&#xD;
      (RLPPa) and during proper sling tensioning (RLPPs). The aim of sling tensioning was to obtain&#xD;
      similar pressures as after pneumoperitoneum induction (RLPPs ≅RLPPp).&#xD;
