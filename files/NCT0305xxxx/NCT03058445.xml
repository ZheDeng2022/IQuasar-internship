    <textblock>
      Using an ultrasound echocardiography , we will measure the time to turbulance &quot;T2T&quot; from&#xD;
      injecting saline into the central venous catheter CVC to the appeareance of turbulance on the&#xD;
      screen using an MMode. The T2T will be compared with Chest X Ray &quot;CXR&quot; measured distance from&#xD;
      the tip of the CVC to the carina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are trying to evaluate if there is a significant correlation between the two measurements.&#xD;

      1. Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The central venous catheter (CVC) is a vital tool in the intensive care unit. It is used&#xD;
           to provide medications, fluids nutrition and assess central venous pressure. Common&#xD;
           sites of insertion are internal jugular and subclavian vein. It is obligatory to confirm&#xD;
           correct positioning of the CVC in the superior vena cava (SVC) at or before the junction&#xD;
           with the right atrium before use. The incorrectly positioned catheter can lead to&#xD;
           significant complications including arrhythmias and haemothorax. The most common method&#xD;
           used to confirm correct CVC tip positioning is the chest x-ray (CXR). Frequent use of&#xD;
           CXR in intensive care leads to repeated exposure to radiation and has implications for&#xD;
           use of resources and cost. There have been multiple attempts to develop new methods to&#xD;
           replace the CXR for confirmation of CVC tip position without increasing patient risk of&#xD;
           radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The use of ultrasound (US) has become routine practice to guide CVC insertion. It is&#xD;
           well established that using ultrasound to assist in central venous catheter insertion&#xD;
           reduces the incidence of complications (1). However ultrasound is currently not&#xD;
           routinely used to confirm the correct position of the CVC tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The correct position for the CVC tip is widely accepted to be at or slightly above the&#xD;
           SVC junction with the right atrium. CXR is the gold standard tool for assessing the&#xD;
           correct tip position and is routinely requested after CVC insertion in the upper body&#xD;
           veins. Several research studies have used varied US approaches to detect CVC positioning&#xD;
           after subclavian (SC) and internal jugular (IJ) CVC placement.. Some studies focused on&#xD;
           the direct US identification of the distal CVC tip near to or within the right atrium or&#xD;
           the aberrant placement within an IJ or SC vein (2) (3) (4). Others indirectly identified&#xD;
           venous insertion and distal CVC tip location near the right atrium by the rapid entry of&#xD;
           turbulent flow into the right atrium after agitated saline or rapid saline flush of the&#xD;
           distal CVC port. Delayed and weak turbulence suggests aberrant venous placement whereas&#xD;
           complete lack of turbulence is concerning for arterial CVC placement (1) (5-11).The&#xD;
           previous studies used a 2D substernal view to detect the turbulence in the right atrium.&#xD;
           The time measurement had no set On and Set Off on the machine , which makes it hard to&#xD;
           review or record. A great advantage of M-mode echocardiography is its high temporal&#xD;
           resolution which enables simple and accurate measurement of the time and distance of any&#xD;
           structure movement.(14). We are using M-Mode to measure a temporal change which makes it&#xD;
           a more accurate measurement. The trigger time and the end point , i.e turbulence, can be&#xD;
           recorded , reviewed and audited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In order to minimize the risk of radiation exposure and reduce resource use, we&#xD;
           considered the use of Ultrasound to confirm the CVC tip position. We will assess the use&#xD;
           of M-Mode in a novel way, we called Time to Turbulence (T2T), to determine the proximity&#xD;
           of the CVC tip to the right atrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This novel method has the potential to accurately detect the CVC tip position and may&#xD;
           eliminate the requirement of CXR after CVC insertion if paired with chest ultrasound to&#xD;
           exclude pneumothorax. This has the potential benefit for patients of reduced radiation&#xD;
           exposure, faster confirmation of line position with reduced waiting time to start of&#xD;
           medication, less requirement of patient movement to obtain the CXR and reduced cost and&#xD;
           use of resources in radiology services.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Correlation between T2T and CVC tip distance to right atrium (RA)&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effect of Height and Weight on the validity of T2T value&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effect of inotropic support on the validity of T2T value&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cut-off T2T range value to confirm CVC tip position in study population with&#xD;
                sub-group analysis for cardiovascular parameters and inotropic support&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This is a prospective uncontrolled clinical trial. Patients will be recruited from South&#xD;
           Tyneside District Hospital. The study data will be collected by the research team and&#xD;
           analysed by the principal investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For this study we will recruit 25 patients based on the power of study calculation - as&#xD;
           mentioned in the statistics section. All patients who have an upper body CVC inserted&#xD;
           and CXR completed as part of their routine care will be eligible to be enrolled. All&#xD;
           potential participants will be sent or given a patient information leaflet about the&#xD;
           study. They will be approached by a member of the research team, and given the&#xD;
           opportunity to discuss the study. If they are willing to proceed with the study, they&#xD;
           will complete written consent forms, and baseline data will be collected. Data will be&#xD;
           collated and analysed by the research team. For patients who lack capacity, consent will&#xD;
           be discussed with a personal Consultee (usually their next of kin) and if agreed the&#xD;
           patient will be enrolled into the study. Once the patient regains capacity, consent will&#xD;
           be obtained from the patient. The patient will have the right to retrospectively&#xD;
           withdraw from the study and all collated data will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients, who have CVC in place and CXR done to confirm position, will be scanned using&#xD;
           M-Mode T2T. The Time and the CVC tip distance to carina - assessed by CXR - will be&#xD;
           plotted on a curve to review correlation to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variable 1: Deciding level of CVC tip on CXR:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We used the carina level as marker for distance from CVL tip. (12)(13) Using the PAXIS&#xD;
           screen measurement tool. The CXR that was done after the CVC inserted will be displayed&#xD;
           on the screen. A horizontal line at the level of the carina is drawn. A perpendicular&#xD;
           line from CVC tip to the horizontal line of the level of the Carina is drawn and&#xD;
           measured. This measurement is (CXR measurement). If the CVC tip is above the Carina the&#xD;
           measurement is in positive value, and if the CVC tip is below the carina the measurement&#xD;
           is in negative value. The measurement will be in millimetres.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Variable 2: T2T M-mode method:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using 5 MHz curvilinear probe the subcostal view of right atrium (RA) is obtained.&#xD;
           M-Mode line is aligned in the centre of RA. While in M-Mode, when the scan line flips&#xD;
           from far end of the screen to the beginning of the new screen, a 3ml bolus of saline is&#xD;
           injected in the proximal port of the CVC. The scan is paused once the turbulence appears&#xD;
           on the monitor in the RA area. The time from beginning of screen - the injection - to&#xD;
           the appearance of turbulence is the &quot;Time-To-Turbulence&quot; (T2T). This will be recorded in&#xD;
           seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We decided to use the proximal port - instead of the distal port which may seem more&#xD;
           relevant - because, by this way we can detect the correlation despite the tip position&#xD;
           is before , at , or beyond the right atrium. While if we used the distal tip , the T2T&#xD;
           will be indifferent if the tip is before or after the RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A. Data collected before the study:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Site of the CVC&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  is CXR done to confirm position?&#xD;
&#xD;
           B. Data to collect during the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  (CXR measurement) CVC Tip to carina level&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  inotrope use and dose The data will be collected using a dedicated case report form&#xD;
                (CRF). (See appendix 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adult patients with CVC in the upper body veins:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Internal jugular vein (right /left)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Subclavian vein (right/left)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CXR completed to confirm CVC position&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient or personal Consultee refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CVC not in upper body vein&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inability to obtain subcostal view of RA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Inability to aspirate blood from distal lumen of CVC&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistics and data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistician Mr. Paul Bassett will do our data analysis. We will use Linear Regression to&#xD;
      detect whether the CXR measurement variable is associated with the T2T measurement variable.&#xD;
      If a strong correlation is found we will find an equation that describes the relationship and&#xD;
      can be used to predict the CXR measurement value from T2T measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To detect correlation of 0.6 or above, with a 5% significance level and 90% power, would&#xD;
      require a sample size of 25.&#xD;
