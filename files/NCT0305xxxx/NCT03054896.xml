      This research study is evaluating the combination of a study drug, venetoclax, and a standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimen, R-EPOCH or R-CHOP, as a possible treatment for Richter's Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venetoclax&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R-EPOCH:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Etoposide&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prednisone&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vincristine Sulfate (Oncovin)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Hydroxydaunomycin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R-CHOP:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rituximab&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cyclophosphamide Vincristine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Doxorubicin Hydrochloride (Hydroxydaunomycin)&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor cells from patients with Richter's Syndrome are often resistant to chemotherapy. One&#xD;
      reason for this may be that a protein called BCL-2 can prevent cancer cells from dying after&#xD;
      being exposed to chemotherapy. Venetoclax is an oral drug that specifically targets BCL-2. It&#xD;
      has already been shown to be highly effective at killing tumor cells from CLL patients whose&#xD;
      cells are resistant to chemotherapy, leading to its FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) approval for these patients. A small number of patients with Richter's&#xD;
      Syndrome have been treated with venetoclax as a single drug, and some of these patients had&#xD;
      improvement of their cancer with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are looking to see whether adding venetoclax to a&#xD;
      standard chemotherapy regimen, R-EPOCH or R-CHOP, will help this chemotherapy work better to&#xD;
      more effectively kill tumor cells in patients with Richter's Syndrome. Venetoclax is not&#xD;
      approved for Richter's Syndrome or for use in combination with chemotherapy, which is why its&#xD;
      use in this trial is considered to be investigational.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic&#xD;
             lymphoma as per IW-CLL 2008 criteria (Hallek et al, 2008) with biopsy proven&#xD;
             transformation to diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL), consistent with Richter's&#xD;
             Syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because CLL and Richter's Syndrome are&#xD;
             extremely rare in persons &lt;18 years of age, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (see Appendix A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must meet the following hematologic criteria at screening, unless they have&#xD;
             significant bone marrow involvement of their malignancy confirmed on biopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1000 cells/mm3 (0.5 x 109/L). Growth factor allowed to&#xD;
                  achieve&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count ≥40,000 cells/mm3 (40 x 109/L) independent of transfusion within 7&#xD;
                  days of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have adequate coagulation, renal, and hepatic function, per laboratory&#xD;
             reference range at Screening as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min using 24-hour urine&#xD;
                  collection for creatinine clearance&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 3.0 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with Gilbert's Syndrome or resolving autoimmune hemolytic anemia may&#xD;
                  have a bilirubin up to 3.0 × ULN and are still eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of venetoclax on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception&#xD;
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation. Contraception must continue for an additional 30&#xD;
             days post last dose of venetoclax for women, and an additional 90 days post last dose&#xD;
             in men. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately and venetoclax&#xD;
             must be discontinued immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
                  heterosexual intercourse) or use contraception and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
                  donating eggs, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of&#xD;
                  &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 30 days after the last&#xD;
                  dose of venetoclax and 12 months after the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever&#xD;
                  is later. Women must refrain from donating eggs during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and is not permanently infertile due&#xD;
                  to surgery (i.e., removal of ovaries, fallopian tubes, and/or uterus) or another&#xD;
                  cause as determined by the investigator (e.g., Müllerian agenesis). The&#xD;
                  definition of childbearing potential may be adapted for alignment with local&#xD;
                  guidelines or regulations. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate&#xD;
                  of &lt;1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal&#xD;
                  contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices,&#xD;
                  and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For men: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or&#xD;
                  use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from donating sperm, as&#xD;
                  defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  With a female partner of childbearing potential who is not pregnant, men who are&#xD;
                  not surgically sterile must remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional&#xD;
                  contraceptive method that together result in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year&#xD;
                  during the treatment period and for at least 90 days after the last dose of&#xD;
                  venetoclax or 12 months after completion of chemotherapy, whichever is later. Men&#xD;
                  must refrain from donating sperm during this same period. With a pregnant female&#xD;
                  partner, men must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period&#xD;
                  and for at least 90 days after the last dose of venetoclax or 12 months after the&#xD;
                  last dose of chemotherapy, whichever is later, to avoid exposing the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have undergone prior allogeneic transplantation are eligible provided&#xD;
             they do not have significant active graft versus host disease and that their&#xD;
             transplant day 0 is &gt; 6 months from their first dose of chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;

             treatment with ibrutinib or acalabrutinib may continue this agent until the day prior&#xD;
