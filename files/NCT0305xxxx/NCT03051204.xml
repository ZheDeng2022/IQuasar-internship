      Study Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze stool specimens to test and validate the CalproLab assay against the predicate&#xD;
      PhiCal in order to determine performance characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And to correlate Calpro levels to the gut microbiome composition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal Calprotectin has become one of the most frequently used biomarkers in patients&#xD;
      suffering from Inflammatory Bowel Diseases. Although its use for monitoring disease activity&#xD;
      and therapeutic efficiency has previously been demonstrated, the test performance should&#xD;
      further be optimized to improve clinical accuracy. The PhiCal™ test is a quantitative ELISA&#xD;
      for measuring, in human stool, concentrations of fecal calprotectin, a neutrophilic protein&#xD;
      that is a marker of mucosal inflammation. The PhiCal™ test can be used as an in vitro&#xD;
      diagnostic to aid in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's disease and&#xD;
      Ulcerative Colitis), and to differentiate IBD from irritable bowel syndrome. Recently, the&#xD;
      CalproLab™ in vitro device has become available which provides a greater reporting range than&#xD;
      PhiCal™. The OptiCal study aims to test and validate the CalproLab™ assay against the PhiCal™&#xD;
      assay and determine its performance characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calprotectin is a valuable clinical marker for inflammation. Calprotectin belongs to a group&#xD;
      of calcium- binding neutrophil-derived proteins. Calprotectin makes up 60% of the cytosolic&#xD;
      proteins within the neutrophil. It is very resistant to bacterial degradation in the gut and&#xD;
      is stable in stool for up to one week&#xD;
&#xD;
      at room temperature. Calprotectin is the noninvasive &quot;test of choice&quot; for quantifying the&#xD;
      degree of GI inflammation and differentiating Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) from&#xD;
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is considered to result from interplay between host and&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota. Recently it was shown that the microbiota varied along a gradient of&#xD;
      increasing intestinal inflammation (indicated by calprotectin levels), which was associated&#xD;
      with reduced microbial richness, abundance of butyrate producers, and relative abundance of&#xD;
      Gram-positive bacteria (especially Clostridium clusters IV and XIVa). A significant&#xD;
      association between microbiota composition and inflammation was indicated by a set of&#xD;
      bacterial groups predicting the calprotectin levels. So, intestinal microbiota may represent&#xD;
      a potential biomarker for correlating the level of inflammation and therapeutic responses but&#xD;
      this needs to be further validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study is a prospective case series during which patients with either Crohn's&#xD;
           disease or ulcerative colitis, Celiac Disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome and healthy&#xD;
           controls (N=175) will be invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive a home kit (with a plain white plastic cup for calprotectin&#xD;
           sample collections) for stool sampling, which then will be returned and processed at&#xD;
           Genova Diagnostics. All participants are required to complete a patient survey, which&#xD;
           will be included in the collection kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be recruited through the UCLA Division of Digestive Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will have confirmation of their diagnosis according to published clinical&#xD;
           guidelines and standards of care using gold standard diagnostics (e.g. endoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool specimens will be analyzed for fecal Calprotectin using both the CalproLab™ assay&#xD;
           and the PhiCal™ assay. No blood draws or other testing will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will undergo a gut microbiome assessment utilizing the GI Effects™ 2200&#xD;
           Comprehensive Profile (Genova Diagnostics).&#xD;
