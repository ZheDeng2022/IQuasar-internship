      Clinical trial, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, comparative of three parallel&#xD;
      groups, randomized treatment to assess the efficacy and safety using a fixed dose combination&#xD;
      of metformin hydrochloride with fluoxetine as adjunctive treatment in patient with obesity or&#xD;
      overweight in order to generate new knowledge and give a greater number of therapeutic&#xD;
      options to the clinicians, one group will receive metformin 1700 mg and 40 mg of fluoxetine;&#xD;
      Another group will receive metformin 1000 mg with 40 mg of fluoxetine, and a third group&#xD;
      called control will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above described treatments will be administered according to the &quot;Dosage Schedule&quot; The&#xD;
      three groups will receive tablets of physical characteristics equal to the reference drug to&#xD;
      preserve the blinding.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overweight and obesity are serious health problems that affect population around the world.&#xD;
      According to information of the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2014 more than 1.9 billion&#xD;
      of inhabitants older than 18 years had overweight, of which 600 million were obese, i.e., 39%&#xD;
      of adults at global level present overweight and 13% of adults suffer obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overweight and obesity are considered complex and multifactorial diseases associated with the&#xD;
      development of multiple co-morbidities such as certain types of cancer, cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases (CVD), disability, diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2), disease of gallbladder,&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, high blood pressure (Hypertension), sleep apnea and cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
      (CD), making it the fifth leading cause of death worldwide , and is therefore considered a&#xD;
      pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obesity is defined as the increase of the weight body associated to an imbalance in the&#xD;
      proportions of the different components of the body, in which mainly, the mass fat increases&#xD;
      with abnormal distribution in the body.The Body Mass Index (BMI) is the standard most widely&#xD;
      used for the classification of the somatotype in the people, and therefore the identification&#xD;
      of obesity. BMI is obtained through by dividing the weight in kilograms between heights in&#xD;
      squared meters. The classification of the BMI for White, Hispanic, and African-American adult&#xD;
      people has been approved by the National Institute of Heart, Lung and Blood, the WHO, the&#xD;
      American Association of Heart, the American College of Cardiology and the Obesity Society,&#xD;
      whose classification is the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The weight body is determined by the balance energy, which represents the difference between&#xD;
      the intake of energy through the food and the expenditure of energy coming of physical&#xD;
      activity of an individual. For the maintenance of a stable body weight, the energy intake&#xD;
      must be equal to energy expenditure, that's when weight gain happens, when the intake exceeds&#xD;
      expenditure, which produces a positive energy balance. On the other hand, weight loss occurs&#xD;
      when energy expenditure exceeds the caloric intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the low expenditure of energy represents one of the main factors that produce an&#xD;
      increase in the weight, there are multiple factors that play an important role. These factors&#xD;
      include genetic predisposition of the individual, physical inactivity and sedentary behavior,&#xD;
      socio-economic factors, as well as emotional factors and consumption of certain types of&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the multiple factors that have an influence in the development of overweight and&#xD;
      obesity, the treatment is complex, because there must be some type of treatment by a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team that achieve the control of each one of the factors that condition&#xD;
      obesity of each individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional treatments for loss weight have been given in the education of the individual on&#xD;
      the preference for healthy foods, prescription diets and the implementation of programs of&#xD;
      physical activity. However, various studies have shown that this type of intervention has few&#xD;
      effects in long term, so the incorporation of new strategies as adjuvants in the loss of&#xD;
      weight have been developed, which include surgical techniques and pharmacological therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the guidelines for obesity, the drug treatment therapy should be recommended in&#xD;
      individuals with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2 or with a BMI of ≥27 kg/m2 and the presence of a&#xD;
      comorbidity. 6. The use of pharmacological therapies must always be used as adjuvants to&#xD;
      changes in lifestyle, and must be approved by health authorities of each country. Before&#xD;
      2012, phentermine and orlistat were the unique medications available for the treatment of&#xD;
      obesity in the United States; however in 2015 the Repertoire of pharmacological agents&#xD;
      available to treat the obesity was extended and incorporated 4 new drugs: lorcaserin,&#xD;
      phentermine / topiramate of prolonged release, naltrexone / wellbutrin of prolonged release&#xD;
      and liraglutide. These new drugs share a common strategy to promote weight loss that controls&#xD;
      hunger and satiation at the level of the central nervous system (CNS), besides that most of&#xD;
      them have been previously used for the treatment of a medical condition other than obesity.&#xD;
      The amount of weight lost that is achieved through the use of these agents, usually goes from&#xD;
      3 to 10% of the initial weight and requires a continuous to hold the loss of weight. In&#xD;
      addition, each of these drugs has a unique profile of adverse events that should be&#xD;
      considered deeply prior to be indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the above, the search for new drug therapies for the obesity treatment is one of the&#xD;
      priorities in the research. Some drugs developed for different therapeutic indications have&#xD;
      shown significant effects on weight loss, which include metformin hydrochloride and&#xD;
      fluoxetine&#xD;
