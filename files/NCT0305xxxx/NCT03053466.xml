  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended dose&#xD;
      schedule of APL-501 in individuals with advanced or relapsed or recurrent solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, 3-part study with a Dose-Escalation Segment, Cohort Extension&#xD;
      and Dose and Disease Expansion cohorts of APL-501 injection, a humanized IgG4 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody, targeting the Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes and&#xD;
      other cells of the immune system. Select advanced solid tumor malignancies will receive&#xD;
      escalating doses of APL-501.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will occur in three subject cohorts until a protocol defined dose limited&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) occurs, not due to disease progression or inter-current illness, and a&#xD;
      tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or biologically effective dose (BED) is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort Extension will evaluate APL-501 at 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg on Day 1 and Day 15 every 28&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the tentative MTD, BED or recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), at least two tumor types in the&#xD;
      Dose and Disease Expansion will be assessed at an equivalent non-weight based dose to further&#xD;
      evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy.&#xD;

In the Dose Escalation Segment, each treatment cycle is comprised of 2 doses of study drug administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In the Cohort Extension, the treatment cycle will consist of 2 doses of study drug administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
In Dose and Disease Expansion, the treatment cycle will consist of 2 doses of study drug (non-weight based dosing of 400 mg) administered on Days 1 and 15 of a 28-day cycle.</description>
