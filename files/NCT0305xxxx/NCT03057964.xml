  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two part study to evaluate the efficacy of early combined PDL (pulsed dye laser)&#xD;
      and fractional photothermolysis in the cosmetic improvement of post surgical scars.All&#xD;
      subjects will be offered at the time of the dermatologic procedure, an option to treat the&#xD;
      post surgical scars with early combined PDL and fractional photothermolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A is a non-randomized study design and subjects will have the choice of whether or not&#xD;
      they will receive treatment. In part B, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 treatment vs.&#xD;
      control design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental group will have a total of 6 visits: 1 standard of care suture removal&#xD;
      visit, 3 treatment visits and 2 follow up visits. The control group will have 3 visits: 1&#xD;
      standard of care suture removal visit and 2 follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects currently living in the Chicago metropolitan area and meet inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be considered for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of this procedure.&#xD;
