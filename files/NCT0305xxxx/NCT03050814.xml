      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal cancer is a common cancer in the U.S. It causes the second most cancer-related&#xD;
      deaths. The drug avelumab and vaccine Ad-CEA together help the immune system fight cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test if avelumab and Ad-CEA plus standard therapy treats colorectal cancer that has spread&#xD;
      to other sites better than standard therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with untreated colorectal cancer that has spread in the body&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test to see if their cancer has a certain deficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor sample. This can be from a previous procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A small group of participants will get Ad-CEA and avelumab plus standard therapy. This is&#xD;
      FOLFOX plus bevacizumab for up to 24 weeks then capecitabine plus bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The others will have treatment in 2-week cycles. They will be Arm A or B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: FOLFOX and bevacizumab by IV days 1 and 2 for 12 cycles. After that, capecitabine by&#xD;
      mouth twice a day and bevacizumab by IV on day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: Ad-CEA injection every 2-12 weeks. Avelumab by IV on day 1 of each cycle. FOLFOX and&#xD;
      bevacizumab by IV days 2 and 3 for 12 cycles. Then, capecitabine by mouth twice a day and&#xD;
      bevacizumab through IV on day 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated until their disease gets worse or they have bad side effects.&#xD;
      Arm A participants can join Arm B. They will have a visit 4 5 weeks after they stop therapy.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer diagnosis in the United States&#xD;
           and accounts for the second most cancer-related deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane protein that was first identified&#xD;
           for its role in the maintenance of self-tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity.&#xD;
           Blockade of the interaction between PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on T cells is expected&#xD;
           to reverse T cell suppression within tumors. These agents are dependent on underlying T&#xD;
           cell activation against the tumor cell to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avelumab is a fully human IgG1 anti-PDL1 antibody that selectively binds to PD-L1 and&#xD;
           competitively blocks its interaction with PD-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In ongoing phase 1 trials of avelumab, the agent has been well tolerated and has shown&#xD;
           clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical trials with anti-PD-1/L1 agents in colorectal cancer have resulted in minimal&#xD;
           activity in patients who do not have mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Therapeutic cancer vaccines targeting overexpressed proteins offer a potential method to&#xD;
           activate T cells against tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A novel adenovirus based, CEA-targeting vaccine has demonstrated cytolytic T cell&#xD;
           responses in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care agents in first line metastatic CRC have properties been associated&#xD;
           with improved immune response via immunologic cell death and immunogenic modulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To determine if there is an improvement progression free survival among patients with&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer lacking a mismatch repair deficiency who are treated with&#xD;
      standard of care + anti- PDL1 monoclonal antibody + Ad-CEA therapeutic cancer vaccine&#xD;
      compared with standard of care alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects age 18 and older with previously untreated pathologically confirmed metastatic&#xD;
           or unresectable colorectal cancer; prior adjuvant therapy is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal organ and bone marrow function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment and subjects requiring&#xD;
           system steroids (except for physiologic doses for steroid replacement) are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor sample and whole blood sample must be available for proteomics, genomics and&#xD;
           transcriptomics analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with metastatic or unresectable colorectal cancer with mismatch repair&#xD;
           deficiency (MMR-D or MSI-High) will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a randomized, multicenter phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the&#xD;
           potential improvement in progression free survival (PFS) when Avelumab and Ad-CEA&#xD;
           vaccine are used in combination with standard of care therapy in metastatic or&#xD;
           unresectable colorectal cancer when compared with standard of care alone (FOLFOX-A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A lead in cohort, comprising the first 6 evaluable subjects enrolled, will be treated&#xD;
           with avelumab + Ad- CEA vaccine + standard of care in order to assess the safety of the&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no more than 1 subject in the lead in cohort experiences a dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
           attributable to the IND agents, 70 evaluable subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis&#xD;
           to receive either Avelumab + Ad-CEA vaccine + standard of care (Arm B) or standard of&#xD;
           care alone (Arm A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard of care therapy consists of 6 - 12 two week cycles of bevacizumab + FOLFOX&#xD;
           (5-FU, leucovorin, oxaliplatin) followed by two week cycles of bevacizumab +&#xD;
           capecitabine until disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects assigned to Arm A that have progressive disease will be offered Avelumab +&#xD;
           Ad-CEA vaccine in combination with a standard chemotherapy regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Kaplan-Meier curves and a two-tailed log-rank test will be the primary analysis methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The accrual ceiling for the study is set at 97.&#xD;

             and have no contraindications to treatment with the standard of care regimen as&#xD;
             determined by the investigator. Prior adjuvant therapy for surgically resectable&#xD;
             disease (including oligometastatic disease) is acceptable (including immunotherapy),&#xD;
             but must have been completed at least 6 months prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not be eligible for potentially curative surgical intervention in the&#xD;
             case of oligometastic disease at the time of enrollment or must have actively refused&#xD;

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because safety data is not known with this&#xD;
             agent in patients less than 18 years old, children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;

                  to 1.5 (SqrRoot) the upper limit of normal range (ULN), an aspartate&#xD;
                  aminotransferase (AST), level less than or equal to 2.5 (SqrRoot) ULN, and an&#xD;
                  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level less than or equal to 2.5 (SqrRoot) ULN or,&#xD;
                  for subjects with documented metastatic disease to the liver, AST and ALT levels&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of Ad-CEA vaccine and Avelumab on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients being treated with medications with drug-drug interactions with study agents&#xD;
             will require evaluation by to determine if full doses of all study treatments can be&#xD;
