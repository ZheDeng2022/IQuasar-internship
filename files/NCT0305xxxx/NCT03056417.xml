  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current project will use the Complete Health Improvement Program (CHIP) as an&#xD;
      intervention for patients with chronic pain. CHIP is a nationally recognized program that&#xD;
      encourages a diet of whole plant-based foods, moderate exercise, stress reduction, and social&#xD;
      support. Patients with chronic pain who enroll in CHIP classes will be monitored and compared&#xD;
      to patients with chronic pain who are not enrolled in CHIP classes. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      patients who complete CHIP will have increased telomerase activity and longer relative&#xD;
      telomere length at follow-up when compared to those who do not enroll in the program.&#xD;
      Chromosomes consist of DNA that contains the genetic makeup of an individual; and telomeres&#xD;
      are the caps on these chromosomes that protect them from damage. Telomere shortening occurs&#xD;
      normally with aging and once they are too short to replicate cellular death occurs.&#xD;
      Telomerase is a ribonucleic protein that counterbalances this shortening by extending the&#xD;
      ends of chromosomes. Research has shown that patients with chronic pain may have shorter&#xD;
      telomeres relative to others of the same age. This study will investigate this association&#xD;
      further.&#xD;
