        <title>Intracranial Objective Response Rate (IC-ORR) - Percentage of Participants With Intracranial Objective Response (IC-OR) Based on BICR Assessment</title>
        <description>IC-ORR was the percentage of participant with intracranial objective response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) based on intracranial disease in the subset of participants with at least 1 intracranial lesion per RECIST version 1.1 (modified) recorded from randomization until disease progression or start of new anti-cancer therapy. CR was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). PR was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</description>

          <title>Time to Tumor Response (TTR) Based on BICR Assessment</title>
          <description>TTR based on BICR assessment was defined, for participants with a confirmed objective response, as the time from the date of randomization to the first documentation of objective response (complete response or partial response) which was subsequently confirmed. Complete response was defined as complete disappearance of all target lesions and non-target disease. All nodes, both target and non-target, must decrease to normal (short axis &lt;10 mm). Partial response was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimensions of the target lesions taking as a reference the baseline sum longest dimensions.</description>

        <description>An AE was an untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study treatment without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes: death, life-threatening experience, initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization, persistent or significant disability/incapacity, congenital anomaly/birth defect. Treatment-emergent AEs were those with initial onset or that worsen in severity after the first dose of study medication. All AEs in the table below were treatment-emergent AEs. Grade 3 and 4 AEs in the table below indicated severe AE and life-threatening consequences respectively; Grade 5 indicated death due to AE. Treatment-related AEs were determined by investigators.</description>

        <description>Laboratory test results were graded according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grades 1 and 2 indicate mild and moderate AE, respectively; Grades 3 and 4 indicate severe AE and life-threatening consequences respectively; Grade 5 indicates death due to AE. Participants with laboratory test abnormalities were summarized according to the worst grade for each laboratory test result.

        <description>Laboratory test results were graded according to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) version 4.03. The CTCAE displays Grades 1 through 5 with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each AE based on this general guideline: Grades 1 and 2 indicate mild and moderate AE, respectively; Grades 3 and 4 indicate severe AE and life-threatening consequences respectively; Grade 5 indicates death due to AE. Participants with laboratory test abnormalities were summarized according to the worst grade for each laboratory test result. All participants meeting the postbaseline grade criteria in the table below had baseline maximum grades lower than 3.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Scores of Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II (Mood Assessment) Across Time</title>
        <description>BDI-II (Mood Assessment) is a 21 item self-reported scale, with each item rated by participants on a 4-point scale (ranging from 0-3). The scale includes items capturing mood, (loss of pleasure, sadness, and irritability), suicidal ideation, and cognitive signs (punitive thoughts, self-criticism, self-dislike pessimism, poor concentration) as well as somatic signs (appetite, sleep, fatigue, libido). Scores were obtained by adding up the total points from the series of answers. The total score ranged from 0 to 63, with higher total scores indicating more severe depressive symptoms. The standardized cutoffs are as follows: 0-13: minimal depression; 14-19: mild depression; 20-28: moderate depression; 29-63: severe depression.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Suicidal Ideation and Suicidal Behavior Across Time</title>
        <description>Suicidal ideation and behaviors were assessed by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). The C-SSRS is a unique, simple and short method of assessing both behavior and ideation that tracks all suicidal events and provides a summary of suicidality. It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide.</description>

It assesses the lethality of attempts and other features of ideation (frequency, duration, controllability, reasons for ideation, and deterrents), all of which are significantly predictive of completed suicide.</description>
          <population>&quot;Number of Participants Analyzed&quot; included all participants in the safety analysis population within each treatment group. &quot;Number Analyzed&quot; included all participants with assessment scores at each specified time point.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Global Quality of Life (QOL), Functional Scales and Symptoms Scales as Assessed by the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC-QLQ-C30) During Overall Treatment</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ C30 consists of 30 questions and includes 5 functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social); a global health status/global quality of life scale; 3 symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting); and 6 single items that assess additional symptoms (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation, and diarrhea) and financial impact. All scales and single item measures range in score from 0 to 100. Higher scores on the functional scales represent higher levels of functioning. Higher scores on the global health status/quality of life scale represent higher health status/quality of life. Higher scores on symptom scales/items represent a greater presence of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Lung Cancer Symptoms as Assessed by the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 13 (QLQ- LC13) During Overall Treatment</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ LC13 consists of 13 questions and includes 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items assessing symptoms (dyspnea, cough, haemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use. The scale scores rang from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Status as Assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) - Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Across Time</title>
        <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health status. There are 2 components to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L: a descriptive system in which individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a VAS. The VAS component rates current health state on a scale from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable health state) and higher scores indicate better health state.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Status as Assessed by EuroQol 5 Dimension 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L) - Index Across Time</title>
        <description>The EuroQol EQ-5D-5L is a participant-completed questionnaire designed to assess health status. There are 2 components to the EuroQol EQ-5D-5L: a descriptive system in which individuals rate their level of problems (none, slight, moderate, severe, extreme/unable) in 5 areas (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) and a VAS in which participants rate their overall health status from 0 (worst imaginable) to 100 (best imaginable). EQ-5D summary index is obtained with a formula that weights each level of the 5 dimensions. The index-based score is interpreted along a continuum of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).</description>

        <title>Time to Deterioration (TTD) in Participant Reported Pain in Chest, Dyspnea, or Cough From QLQ-LC13</title>
        <description>The EORTC QLQ LC13 consists of 13 questions and includes 1 multi-item scale and 9 single items assessing symptoms (dyspnea, cough, haemoptysis, and site-specific pain), side effects (sore mouth, dysphagia, peripheral neuropathy, and alopecia), and pain medication use. The scale scores rang from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating higher (&quot;worse&quot;) level of symptoms. TTD in pain in chest, dyspnea, or cough was defined as the time from randomization to the first time the participant's score showed a 10 point or greater increase after baseline in any of the 3 symptoms. TTD in months was calculated as (date of deterioration or censoring - randomization date +1)/30.4375.</description>
