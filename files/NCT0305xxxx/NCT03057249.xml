      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the consequences of 3 selected surgical procedures&#xD;
      on abdominal wall perfusion in order to help to reduce postoperative complication related to&#xD;
      inadequate tissue perfusion. The selected surgical procedures are a) abdominoplasty, b)&#xD;
      breast reconstruction with a free flap from the lower abdomen and c) endovascular stenting of&#xD;
      an abdominal aorta aneurism. These operations are all standard surgical procedures frequently&#xD;
      performed at the University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø. The abdominal wall perfusion&#xD;
      will be evaluated with the use of Dynamic Infrared Thermography (DIRT).&#xD;

      Introduction Wound healing problems after surgery are a stressful experience for patients.&#xD;
      Wound dressing changes are often on a daily basis and can cause considerable discomfort to&#xD;
      the patient as these are often painful. Wound healing problems can lead to complications like&#xD;
      wound infection, hernia formation, wound rupture or even tissue necrosis. These complications&#xD;
      are often associated with prolonged hospital stays and reoperations and cause an economic&#xD;
      burden to the hospital health budget. It is generally accepted that adequate blood perfusion&#xD;
      of the wound edges is required for optimal wound healing. Greater understanding of the impact&#xD;
      of a surgical procedure on skin perfusion may help to reduce postoperative wound healing&#xD;
      problems. Such will have great clinical relevance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim Can postoperative wound complications involving the abdominal wall be explained by&#xD;
      changes in skin blood perfusion?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main results from the literature study In surgery, knowledge on the vascular anatomy is&#xD;
      applied in order to place incisions in such a manner that a good approach is combined with&#xD;
      minimal damage to the vascular anatomy. Knowledge on vascular anatomy does not provide exact&#xD;
      information on how skin perfusion alters after surgery. The invasive method indocyanine green&#xD;
      fluorescence-agiography (ICG-FA) can be used to evaluate intraoperatively the effect of an&#xD;
      abdominoplasty on skin perfusion. However, animal studies in flap surgery have clearly shown&#xD;
      that tissue perfusion is a dynamic process. Using dynamic infrared thermography (DIRT) in a&#xD;
      clinical setting revealed that flap perfusion is a dynamic process that takes place over days&#xD;
      during the postoperative phase. DIRT is a non-invasive technique that relies on measuring&#xD;
      skin surface temperatures. Studies have shown that there is a close correlation between skin&#xD;
      temperature and skin perfusion. DIRT has been shown to be a good alternative to ICF-FA to&#xD;
      visualize skin perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study The purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of a surgical&#xD;
      procedure on skin perfusion of the abdominal wall in order to increase our understanding on&#xD;
      how postoperative wound healing problems can be avoided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population The study population will include patients that are undergoing one of the&#xD;
      following operations; a) abdominoplasty, b) breast reconstruction after breast cancer with a&#xD;
      free flap from the lower abdomen and c) endovascular stenting of the abdominal aorta for&#xD;
      aneurysm. These surgical procedures are frequently performed procedures at the University&#xD;
      Hospital of North Norway (UNN). Based on the vascular anatomy of the abdominal wall, each&#xD;
      procedure will have an impact on the skin perfusion of the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods Approval will be obtained from the regional ethical committee and the&#xD;
      principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study I The inclusion criteria are patients scheduled for abdominoplasty who are non-smokers&#xD;
      or have stopped smoking at least 3 months prior to surgery and have no supraumbilical&#xD;
      abdominal scars from previous surgery Study II The inclusion criteria are patients scheduled&#xD;
      for secondary unilateral free abdominal flap breast reconstructions who are non-smokers or&#xD;
      have stopped smoking at least 3 months prior to surgery and have no abdominal scar from&#xD;
      previous surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study III Patients who are scheduled for endovascular stenting of the abdominal aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DIRT will be performed on the day before surgery, intraoperatively and on the 1st, 3rd and&#xD;
      6th postoperative day with all DIRT examinations performed in the same supine position for&#xD;
      study I and II. For study III, the same protocol will be used, however, no intraoperative&#xD;
      DIRT examination will be performed. For study III, thermal images are taken from both lower&#xD;
      extremities during the abdominal DIRT examination to see if stenting causes a change in&#xD;
      rewarming of the lower extremities following stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An IR camera (FLIR ThermaCAM S65 HS FLIR Systems, FLIR Systems AB, Boston, MA) will be&#xD;
      positioned directly above the exposed anterior thorax and abdomen. This camera can produce&#xD;
      sequences of high-definition digital IR images with an accuracy of 0.1º C. Thermal emissivity&#xD;
      is set to 0.98 and the accuracy of the camera will be regularly checked against a black body&#xD;
      with a traceable temperature source (Model IR-2103/301, Infrared Systems Development Corp.,&#xD;
      Florida, USA). IR images are taken at regular intervals to register the rate and pattern of&#xD;
      skin recovery for 3 minutes after a mild cold challenge. Images are electronically stored and&#xD;
      afterwards processed using image analysis software ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.8 SR-1 (FLIR&#xD;
      Systems AB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre- and postoperative images are taken in a dedicated laboratory (room temperature&#xD;
      21-23°C) before and during recovery following a cold challenge after an acclimatization&#xD;
      period of 10 minutes with the thoracic and abdominal wall exposed. The thermal challenge is&#xD;
      delivered by blowing air at room temperature over the skin surface for 2 minutes with a&#xD;
      desktop fan. The intraoperative examination is performed with the patient in general&#xD;
      anaesthesia just before and at the end of surgery. The thermal cold challenge is performed by&#xD;
      washing the thorax and abdomen evenly for 1 minute with gauze soaked in saline at room&#xD;
      temperature (22-23°C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The abdomen is divided into vascular zones as defined by Huger. The mean skin temperature is&#xD;
      calculated for each zone in the postoperative phase before cooling, at end cooling and at 1,&#xD;
      2 and 3 minutes recovery. A qualitative analysis of the changes of pattern and rate of&#xD;
      recovery of hot spots within each zone is made and compared with the results from the other&#xD;
      zones. A one tailed t test for paired variables is use to see if there is a statistically&#xD;
      significant in the mean temperatures between zones at each time point of rewarming.&#xD;
      Statistical significance is defined as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publications The results from each study will be published in an international peer-reviewed&#xD;
      journal.&#xD;
