  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a highly prevalent musculoskeletal condition in adult females,&#xD;
      which is associated with decreased quality of life and physical activity levels. PFP is&#xD;
      highly persistent, with up to 50% of adolescents reporting persistent pain at both one and&#xD;
      two year follow-ups. Previous research has demonstrated altered pain sensitivity in in older&#xD;
      individuals with chronic pain, however, less is known about this in conditions such as PFP,&#xD;
      which is common in younger populations. Additionally it is unknown if these characteristics&#xD;
      return to similar values as healthy controls, when symptoms resolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to compare pain sensitivity in individuals with PFP, compared&#xD;
      to those with a previous history of PFP who currently are pain-free, and a control group with&#xD;
      no history of knee pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently it has been demonstrated that females with longstanding PFP demonstrate increased&#xD;
      pain sensitivity, or hyperalgesia in the peripheral nervous system and impaired conditioned&#xD;
      pain modulation, which is representative of decreased descending control of pain in the&#xD;
      central nervous system. This is commonly seen in older adults with chronic longstanding pain,&#xD;
      such as knee OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the evolution of pain mechanisms during recovery may yield important insights&#xD;
      into the highly recurrent nature of this condition. Self-reported recovery appears to be&#xD;
      associated with increased pressure pain thresholds, in comparison to those with current PFP.&#xD;
      However, it is unknown whether these characteristics, along with centrally mediated pain&#xD;
      processing, ever return to 'normal', or to the same levels of those with no history of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine this, the investigation will compare the three groups (PFP versus Recovered versus&#xD;
      Control), on measures of pain sensitivity (as defined in the primary and secondary outcomes),&#xD;
      to determine differences between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, regarding age, height and weight will be collected, as well as pain&#xD;
      frequency (almost daily, several times per week, weekly, monthly, rarely, never), pain&#xD;
      intensity (measured on numeric rating scale), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome score,&#xD;
      and spatial distribution of pain (using the Navigate pain application). The group that self&#xD;
      report as recovered, will be asked to report when their symptoms resolved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup analysis will be undertaken in the recovered group, to examine the relationship&#xD;
      between the time since last knee pain was experienced, (duration they self- report being&#xD;
      symptom-free), and pain sensitivity, as assessed by the primary and secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the Adolescent Pain in Aalborg (APA2011) cohort. In 2011,&#xD;
      a cohort of 2200 adolescents aged 15 to 19 years answered an online questionnaire on&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain. Of these, 504 reported knee pain, and 153 of these were clinically&#xD;
      diagnosed with PFP. Five years later, the 504 adolescents, as well as 252 randomly selected&#xD;
      adolescents who did not report knee pain in 2011, completed a follow-up questionnaire&#xD;
      regarding current pain (clinical trials.gov identifier: NCT02873143). From this group, a&#xD;
      sample of participants' who were diagnosed with PFP in 2011, and self report with current&#xD;
      pain, or as 'recovered' will be randomly contacted for inclusion in the current investigation&#xD;
      (PFP and recovered groups respectively). Additionally, of the control participants from the&#xD;
      original APA2011 cohort, who reported no pain in 2011, and no pain in 2016, a random sample&#xD;
      will be drawn and invited to participate as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If this cohort is insufficient to reach the required sample size (n = 36 in each group),&#xD;
      participants will be recruited through other sources such as GP's, and social media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Embedded within this cross-sectional study, is a randomized crossover trial (in the group&#xD;
      with PFP) which has been approved by the local ethical committee under the same approval&#xD;
      number (N-20160058). This can be accessed on clinicaltrials.gov under the title &quot;The acute&#xD;
      effects of hip and knee exercises on pain sensitivity in young adult females with&#xD;
      long-standing patellofemoral pain - a randomized crossover study.&quot; with Dr. Michael Rathleff&#xD;
      as the primary investigator.&#xD;
