  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a worldwide spread disease with high prevalence and incidence, often of poor&#xD;
      prognosis because it is typically diagnosed in an advanced stage. Another reason for this&#xD;
      prognosis is the presence of malnutrition, on the one hand because of a diminished intake&#xD;
      (due to anorexia), and on the other hand because of tumor-induced hypercatabolism. The result&#xD;
      is a pathological state of the body called &quot;cachexia&quot;, generally defined as a weight loss &gt;&#xD;
      5% during the last 6 months before diagnosis. It had already been demonstrated that correct&#xD;
      nutrition in such patients can limit morbidity, while promoting progression-free survival as&#xD;
      well as well-being. The pilot study, previously performed by the investigators, was the first&#xD;
      to suggest that Nutrition Therapy, based on the ESPEN guidelines and resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry, can promote overall survival. The aim of this&#xD;
      project is to validate these preliminary results in a larger RCT (randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blind trial), to promote Nutrition Therapy as a novel modality in its own right in the&#xD;
      treatment of cancer, rather than being merely supportive.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the investigators' pilot trial, 20 patients were randomized, 10 receiving regular&#xD;
      counseling by regular oncodietitians, while the 10 others received nutrition therapy. In the&#xD;
      latter group, an assessment of biophysical parameters was made (including the Bioelectrical&#xD;
      Impedance Analysis or BIA for body composition), and the patients' Energy Expenditure was&#xD;
      assessed using indirect calorimetry. Afterwards, the patients received nutrition therapy&#xD;
      according to the ESPEN (European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition) guidelines.&#xD;
      Supplementary interventions were made to match caloric intake to energy expenditure (the&#xD;
      'Tight Caloric' approach), using enteral and parenteral nutrition if indicated, by an&#xD;
      intensive coaching and follow-up to continue this nutrition strategy (with dieticians even&#xD;
      being &quot;on call&quot; after hours). While the study follow-up lasted 2 years, nutrition therapy was&#xD;
      only performed during the first 3 months. The results were striking: apart from keeping their&#xD;
      body weight in balance, the patients of the nutrition therapy group counted much less&#xD;
      unexpected hospitalisation days and they clearly lived much longer .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project targets the validation of these results on a large scale. For this study,&#xD;
      patients with either colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung carcinoma, oesofageal carcinoma, gastric&#xD;
      carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma and head and neck cancer, due to the high prevalence of&#xD;
      cachexia in these patients will be included. A weight loss can also occur during treatment,&#xD;
      and does not need to be present at the start of the study. Patients will be randomized, and&#xD;
      the study is intended to be be double-blinded, although this will be difficult to maintain in&#xD;
      practice due to the nature of the treatment. The recruitment phase will last 2 years, keeping&#xD;
      refusals and dropouts in mind. Follow-up will last 1 year after inclusion, although the&#xD;
      actual nutrition therapy will again last only during therapy (3 months for chemotherapy, 6&#xD;
      weeks for radiotherapy): the period of active oncological treatment. An intermediate analysis&#xD;
      is already made after 6 months of follow-up. In case survival is already statistically&#xD;
      significant, the trial will be stopped for ethical reasons. In case of a positive result, the&#xD;
      investigators want to implement nutrition therapy as a standard treatment in cachectic cancer&#xD;
      patients in Belgium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of a positive outcome (i.e. mere confirmation of our published results), the major&#xD;
      advantage of nutrition therapy will be its relatively low cost while still affecting&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality significantly. This can be practically achieved by redefining the&#xD;
      dietician's task. The patient's own active participation in the decision making process is an&#xD;
      important surplus in well-being and overall treatment. In combination with decreased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality the benefit of the patient can be found on every level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Amendment dd 12/06/2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to lack of patients with 5% weight loss in 6 months and, by consequence, very low&#xD;
      inclusion rate, it was decided to amend the protocol. To achieve this, a special cooperation&#xD;
      with the department of Radiotherapy was established. The service sees many patients who lose&#xD;
      weight during radiotherapy, partly because of cancer-related cachexia, but mostly due to the&#xD;
      mucositis caused by radiotherapy itself, losing &gt; 10% of their initial body weight (at the&#xD;
      start of their therapy). This is especially seen in cancers of head and neck, oesophagus and&#xD;
      stomach. Radiotherapy is performed on working days and treatments typically last 5-7 weeks&#xD;
      (depending on indication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion of patients with colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer will be changed to:&#xD;
           Inclusion of patients with lung, gastric, oesophageal, head and neck and pancreatic&#xD;
           cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5% weight loss over the past 6 months will be changed to: patients with the&#xD;
           aforementioned cancers where radiotherapy will be part of their treatment (or will be&#xD;
           the entire treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of intervention of 3 months will be changed to: duration of intervention for&#xD;
           the entire period of radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After recalculation of statistical power, only 48 patients will be needed instead of 96.&#xD;
           With correction for dropouts, this will become 60 patients instead of 120. This means 30&#xD;
           controls and 30 patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The amendment will be added to the registration at clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure and flowchart will remain unchanged. Analysis of the data will remain: in&#xD;
      whole, per cancer and per sex (the latter two criteria requiring 60 patients in each group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Amendment dd 19/09/2017&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has seen much more inclusions and is running well thanks to the previous amendment.&#xD;
      Due to a typo, the colorectal cancer group was unfortunately omitted. Also, the absolute&#xD;
      difference of survival in the TiCaCo trial after one year was similar to that after the&#xD;
      second year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancer patients are still to be included. Otherwise, nothing changes&#xD;
           concerning inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The follow-up will be shortened from 2 years to one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The amendment will be added to the registration at clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Amendment dd 05/02/2019&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study needs 48 inclusions that remain in the study until the end. However, the number of&#xD;
      dropouts is too high, severely compromising the study's statistical power. Therefore, an&#xD;
      inclusion surplus of 20 - 25% is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The inclusion period will be expanded to 31/12/2019 or the inclusion of 60 patients&#xD;
           (including dropouts), whichever is sooner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The amendment will be added to the registration at clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
