  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most studies to date that have examined the factors underlying math achievement in children&#xD;
      have focused on basic numerical knowledge. Yet, math skills are clearly not limited to basic&#xD;
      numerical knowledge and recent behavioral studies suggest a relationship between math and&#xD;
      deductive reasoning skills. The goal of this study is to determine the neural mediators of&#xD;
      this relationship using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The investigators will ask&#xD;
      children from 8 to 14 to complete a standardized math achievement test, and measure their&#xD;
      brain activity while they process deductive arguments. The investigators will then correlate&#xD;
      brain activity during reasoning to individual math skills to identify the brain regions in&#xD;
      which activity during reasoning is modulated by math skill.&#xD;
