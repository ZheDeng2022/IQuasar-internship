  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oral Lichen Planus (OLP) is an inflammatory disease of mucosal and skin with unknown&#xD;
      etiology. The prevalence rate in England is reported to be between 1-2.4%. OLP contributed to&#xD;
      around 40% of all visits or 1,200 appointments in 2014 at the Eastman Dental Hospital. Pain,&#xD;
      discomfort, long-standing use of medications, lesion recurrence and adverse side effects of&#xD;
      therapy are commonly associated with OLP, eventually leading to a significant reduction in a&#xD;
      patient quality of life. In addition, there is also increased risk of developing oral cancer&#xD;
      in patients with OLP. The current gold standard treatment for OLP is corticosteroid, which&#xD;
      can result in adverse side effects including increased risk of infections and skin cancer,&#xD;
      reduced systemic immune system, and hepatotoxicity with long-term usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, a probiotic food supplement, VSL#3, has shown evidence of been able to induce&#xD;
      and maintain remission in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), with no adverse effect a part&#xD;
      than bloating, reported. Additionally, a preliminary report shown that probiotics treatment&#xD;
      in Behcet's disease and Recurrent Aphthous Stomatitis (RAS) lesion resulted in reducing the&#xD;
      number of oral ulcerations and subjective relief of oral discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator designed a clinical trial with 30 participants allocated to one of two&#xD;
      interventions, VSL#3 or placebo. Individuals with biopsy-confirmed OLP who experience painful&#xD;
      symptoms will be recruited from a single site research site (Eastman Dental Hospital (EDH)).&#xD;
      Either the active VSL#3 or the placebo, provided by Ferring Pharmaceuticals Limited, will be&#xD;
      consume twice a day over a 30 days period. Questionnaires that will determine pain levels,&#xD;
      disease activity and quality of life will be completed before the study begins, on days 15,&#xD;
      30 and 30 days after the last supplement intake. In addition saliva and blood samples will be&#xD;
      taken before therapy begin, at 30 days of therapy, and 30 days after the last supplement&#xD;
      intake. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the oral microbiota will be investigated&#xD;
      using these samples. A blinded clinician will assess the clinical effects between groups of&#xD;
      active VSL #3 and placebo and the results will analyze by statistician.&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To investigate the effects of 30 days use of supplement therapy of probiotic VSL#3 on&#xD;
      painful symptoms of OLP at the end of the therapy (30-days endpoint) and 30 days after the&#xD;
      last dose (60-days endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the effects of 30 days use of supplement therapy of probiotic VSL#3 on&#xD;
           OLP disease activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the effect of 30 days use of supplement therapy of probiotic VSL#3 on&#xD;
           quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate acceptability of the intervention and potential adverse effects. and for&#xD;
           the mechanistic study, whether :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The use of VSL#3 is associated with metagenomics changes in saliva.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The use of VSL#3 is associated with changes in the serum expression profile of&#xD;
                pro-inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled trial study on individuals with OLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with painful ulcerative biopsy-confirmed OLP attending the Oral Medicine clinics of&#xD;
      the UCLH ( University college of London hospital) Eastman Hospital and meeting the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria of the study will be given information about the trial and invited to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 individuals who consent will be recruited and randomised in two groups: group A (15&#xD;
      participants) will receive the VSL#3 and group B (15 participants) will receive a placebo. A&#xD;
      centralised computer-generated randomization list provided by an independent third party will&#xD;
      be used to conceal allocation of patients to the treatments. The list will be sent to the&#xD;
      drug manufacturer who will label the VSL#3 or placebo with relevant study participant code,&#xD;
      which will come in the same identical plain-packages to ensure blinding (neither the&#xD;
      participants nor the investigator will be aware of the sachets content). The study&#xD;
      statistician will also be blinded to the allocation. Patients will be allowed to use best&#xD;
      standard therapy during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To demonstrate the research hypotheses, Investigators will record oral painful symptoms,&#xD;
      disease activity, and quality of life in participants before, at 15 and 30 days from&#xD;
      treatment start, and 30 days (day 60) after the last VSL#3 supplement intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 days + 15 days 21 months Single-site 30 participants&#xD;
