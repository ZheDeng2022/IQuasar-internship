    <textblock>
      The m-CCRP randomized controlled trial will evaluate the efficacy of a collaborative critical&#xD;
      care recovery program from acute respiratory failure (ARF) survivors in accomplishing the&#xD;
      Institute of Healthcare Improvement's triple aims of better health, better care, at lower&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of m-CCRP in improving the QOL of ARF survivors compared to attention&#xD;
      control at twelve months post hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in improving cognitive, physical, and psychological&#xD;
           function of ARF survivors at twelve months post hospital discharge when compared to&#xD;
           attention control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the efficacy of m-CCRP in reducing health-care utilization, defined as time&#xD;
           from enrollment to emergency department visits and/or hospital re-admission, by ARF&#xD;
           survivors as compared to attention control at twelve months post hospital discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Five million Americans require admission to intensive care units (ICU) annually due to life&#xD;
      threatening illnesses, and this number is expected to rise.4 Two million of these ICU&#xD;
      admissions are secondary to Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) with more than half requiring&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation. Greater than 50% of the patients with ARF who survive their ICU stay&#xD;
      suffer from long-term morbidity in the form of functional disability, cognitive disability,&#xD;
      major or minor depression, and anxiety. These complications negatively impact the quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) of ARF survivors, interfere with their physical and emotional recovery, and lead&#xD;
      to long-term disability with less than half of ARF survivors returning to the work force.&#xD;
      Ongoing care for ARF survivors has been estimated to cost $3.5 million per ARF survivor at 1&#xD;
      year. This constellation of ICU sequelae with attendant morbidity has been designated as the&#xD;
      post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). There are community resources and rehabilitation&#xD;
      services available to ARF survivors, but the current fragmented nature of our healthcare&#xD;
      system is unable to integrate and coordinate care in order to provide the most meaningful&#xD;
      recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Institute of Medicine recommends the development of care coordination programs to deliver&#xD;
      patient-centered and interdisciplinary-based medical care. Indiana University Center for&#xD;
      Aging Research (IUCAR) has over 20 years of experience in delivering interdisciplinary,&#xD;
      collaborative care through pragmatic interventions utilizing care coordinators. Care&#xD;
      coordinator delivery models have improved care of patients with dementia, depression,&#xD;
      functional decline and PICS. Our PICS clinic, the Critical Care Recovery Center (CCRC) was&#xD;
      developed in 2011 to enhance cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery of ICU&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, CCRC has provided care to over 200 survivors with a high burden of PICS (88% had&#xD;
      cognitive impairment; 60% had depression). CCRC showed feasibility and initial efficacy in&#xD;
      managing PICS. However given its traditional outpatient clinic structure, CCRC has limited&#xD;
      physical access to ARF survivors, leading to delayed evaluation and an added travel burden on&#xD;
      ARF survivors. Building from the experience of the CCRC and our other successful care&#xD;
      coordinator based programs; we now propose a mobile model of post-ICU collaborative care with&#xD;
      greater access to enhance the recovery of ARF survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching aim of the proposed program is to improve the QOL of patients who survived an&#xD;
      episode of ARF by maximizing their cognitive, physical, and psychological recovery utilizing&#xD;
      a mobile care coordinator. The care coordinator will bring the intervention to the patient&#xD;
      irrespective of the patient's physical location and will be supported by an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      team of a critical care physician, a health services scientist, an ICU nurse, and a&#xD;
      psychologist, with input from other consultants as needed. In addition, dynamic feedback&#xD;
      through process measurement tools and care coordination support software will inform the&#xD;
      recovery process. We propose to evaluate the efficacy of our collaborative care intervention&#xD;
      termed the &quot;Mobile Critical Care Recovery Program (m-CCRP)&quot; through a randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial among survivors of ARF.&#xD;

    <description>The m-CCRP revolves around the central figure of a care coordinator who will organize and align recovery resources. The care coordinator is a registered nurse whose scope of practice includes health coaching, case managing, community organizing, and nursing care provider. The m-CCRP support team will consist of a critical care physician (Dr. Khan), a geriatrician with expertise in collaborative care (Dr. Boustani), an ICU collaborative care nurse (Dr. Lasiter), and a psychologist (Dr. Unverzagt). This team will meet weekly with the care coordinator. Drs. Khan and Boustani will be accessible to the coordinator through phone or pager at all times.</description>
