      Calcium electroporation. Electroporation is a technique that facilitates the transport of&#xD;
      molecules across the cell membrane by using electric pulses. The electric field applied to&#xD;
      the cell membrane creates a temporary destabilization. As the electric capacity of the&#xD;
      membrane is exceeded, cracks are formed in the membrane and the molecules are free to diffuse&#xD;
      into the cytosol of the cell. The process is reversible and the cell membrane is stabilized&#xD;
      in a matter of minutes. While the cell membrane is permeable there is an increased influx of&#xD;
      Ca2+ into the cell. Calcium influx may be further improved by combining calcium together with&#xD;
      electroporation; this is called calcium electroporation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo studies have shown that when enhancing the extracellular calcium concentration before&#xD;
      applying electroporation, a larger Ca2+ influx occurs. The large Ca2+ influx can lead to a&#xD;
      reduction in ATP (adenosine triphosphate) levels and cell death. A fall in ATP levels is seen&#xD;
      for two reasons: First, an increase in intracellular Ca2+ leads to a higher activity of the&#xD;
      Ca2+-ATPase and Na+/K+-ATPase. Secondly, the high concentration of Ca2+ leads to loss of the&#xD;
      electrochemical gradient in the mitochondrial membrane, which causes mitochondrial collapse.&#xD;
      Upon collapse of the mitochondria, the cell can no longer produce ATP. Overall, the increased&#xD;
      consumption and decreased production of ATP leads to lover ATP levels. Combined with other&#xD;
      cellular processes such as activation of lipases and proteases, the cell will eventually die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trials objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome. Evaluating the safety measures of using calcium electroporation on&#xD;
           mucosal head and neck cancer. This is done by continuously evaluating pain by VAS-score&#xD;
           (visual analogue scale) and side effects by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
           Events (CTCAE) registration into Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE).&#xD;
           The safety of using calcium intratumourally is also evaluated by measurement of Ca2+ in&#xD;
           blood samples after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome. Evaluation of response by imaging: PET-MRI, Clinical photography,&#xD;
           Biopsies from tumour site The subjects subjective evaluation of the treatment and post&#xD;
           treatment period is evaluated through Quality of life questionnaires, EORTC QLQ-C30 and&#xD;
           H&amp;N35: two different questionnaires both validated for head and neck cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tertiary outcome. The response to treatment will be compared to the results from our&#xD;
           current trial, where we use electrochemotherapy on mucosal head and neck tumours. The&#xD;
           comparison will be between imaging response, VAS score and results from questionnaires&#xD;
           (EORTC QLQ-C30 and H&amp;N35).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design. This is a phase I, interventional, clinical trial for the safety of calcium&#xD;
      electroporation on mucosal head and neck tumours. Subjects will have relapsed or primary head&#xD;
      and neck cancer. Treatment is intended as palliative and not curative. All subjects will be&#xD;
      offered standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy before enrolment to the trial, if&#xD;
      possible. There is no scheduled control group, meaning that all eligible patients will be&#xD;
      offered treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electroporation and anaesthesia. The treatment is performed under general anaesthesia because&#xD;
      the localization of head and neck tumours complicates treatment under local anaesthetic.&#xD;
      After the patient is anaesthetized, the tumour area will be injected with calcium. After&#xD;
      administration of calcium electrodes are inserted into the tumour and electrical pulses are&#xD;
      generated and documented using a Cliniporator (IGEA, Capri, Italy). Overall operating&#xD;
      time/anaesthesia time will be 1-2 hours and expected hospital stay of 3 days. Treatment is&#xD;
      intended as a once-only treatment but measurable response on evaluation scans combined with&#xD;
      continued cancer activity in the treated area can result in another treatment session.&#xD;
