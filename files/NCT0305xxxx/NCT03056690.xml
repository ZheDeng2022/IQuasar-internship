    <measure>Change From Baseline to Week 8 in Mean Daily Average Pain Score Assessed by NRS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The change from baseline to Week 8 in mean daily average pain score is assessed by NRS. The NRS is a generic instrument for the assessment of pain, consisting of a single question that asks participants to record their daily average pain on an 11-point scale, where 0 anchors &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 &quot;pain as bad as you can imagine&quot;. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e. a favorable outcome).</description>

    <description>TEAE was defined as any AE which started, or worsened, after the first dose of study drug through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. AE was considered serious if: resulted in death, was life- threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, resulted in congenital anomaly or birth defect, required inpatient hospitalization or led to prolongation of hospitalization, other medically important events.</description>

        <description>The 21-item FIQR contains 3 domains: activities of daily living, overall impact, and symptoms. Participants answer each question on an 11-point NRS, with anchors appropriate to each question. The range of function subscale scores will be 0 to 90, with a lower score indicting better (higher) function. The range of overall impact subscale scores will be 0 to 20, with a lower score indicating better (lower) impact. The range of symptoms subscale scores will be 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating a better (lower) level of symptoms. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e. a favorable outcome).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR) FIQR Function, Symptoms, and Overall Impact Subscales</title>
        <description>The 21-item FIQR contains 3 domains: activities of daily living, overall impact, and symptoms. Participants answer each question on an 11-point NRS, with anchors appropriate to each question. The range of function subscale scores will be 0 to 90, with a lower score indicting better (higher) function. The range of overall impact subscale scores will be 0 to 20, with a lower score indicating better (lower) impact. The range of symptoms subscale scores will be 0 to 100, with a lower score indicating a better (lower) level of symptoms. A negative change indicates a reduction/improvement from baseline (i.e. a favorable outcome).</description>
