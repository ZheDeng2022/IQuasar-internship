  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Meibomian Gland Secretion (MGS) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 pretreatment), Week 1, Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>Meibomian glands on the lower eyelid were assessed by the examiner using a Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE 1000) device while viewing the eyelid margin with a slit lamp microscope. 5 glands in 3 zones (nasal, medial, temporal) were evaluated. Each gland was scored from 0-3, for a resultant overall score of 0-45 for each eye. MGS scoring was as follows: 0 = no secretion (worst), 1 = inspissated, 2 = cloudy, 3 = clear liquid (best). A positive change value indicates an improvement. Eyes were assessed individually.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Tear Break-Up Time (TBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 pretreatment), Week 1, Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The investigator instilled a drop of fluorescein into the lower eyelid and asked the patient to blink several times, then stop. The time between the last blink and the first appearance of a dark spot on the cornea (formation of a dry area) on the otherwise continuously stained tear film was recorded in seconds. 3 consecutive measurements were taken, with TBUT defined as the average of the 3 measurements. A positive change value represents A positive change value represents a more stable tear film (improvement). Eyes were assessed individually.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 pretreatment), Week 1, Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Standard Patient Evaluation of Eye Dryness (SPEED) survey is a validated survey that assesses both the frequency and severity of dry eye symptoms. The patient grades the frequency of symptoms (4 items) on a scale from 0 to 3 (0=never; 3=constant) and the severity of each symptom (4 items) on a scale from 0 to 4 (0=no problems; 4=intolerable). Responses to the 8 items are summed to calculate a total score ranging from 0 to 28, where 0=best and 28=worst. A negative change value indicates a perceived improvement in ocular health. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 0 pretreatment), Month 1</time_frame>
    <description>The OSDI is a validated, 12-item questionnaire used to measure ocular symptoms, visual function, and environmental factors that may affect a patient's vision. The patient grades each item on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 is &quot;None&quot; and 4 is &quot;All of the Time.&quot; Responses to the 12 items are summed, and a formula is used to calculate a total score from 0 to 100, where 0 corresponds to no disability and 100 corresponds to complete disability. A negative change value represents a perceived improvement in ocular health. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Meibomian Gland Secretion (MGS) Total Score</title>
        <description>Meibomian glands on the lower eyelid were assessed by the examiner using a Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE 1000) device while viewing the eyelid margin with a slit lamp microscope. 5 glands in 3 zones (nasal, medial, temporal) were evaluated. Each gland was scored from 0-3, for a resultant overall score of 0-45 for each eye. MGS scoring was as follows: 0 = no secretion (worst), 1 = inspissated, 2 = cloudy, 3 = clear liquid (best).

          <title>Change From Baseline in Meibomian Gland Secretion (MGS) Total Score</title>
          <description>Meibomian glands on the lower eyelid were assessed by the examiner using a Meibomian Gland Evaluator (MGE 1000) device while viewing the eyelid margin with a slit lamp microscope. 5 glands in 3 zones (nasal, medial, temporal) were evaluated. Each gland was scored from 0-3, for a resultant overall score of 0-45 for each eye. MGS scoring was as follows: 0 = no secretion (worst), 1 = inspissated, 2 = cloudy, 3 = clear liquid (best). A positive change value indicates an improvement. Eyes were assessed individually.</description>

The patient grades the frequency of symptoms (4 items) on a scale from 0 to 3 (0=never; 3=constant) and the severity of each symptom (4 items) on a scale from 0 to 4 (0=no problems; 4=intolerable). Responses to the 8 items are summed to calculate a total score ranging from 0 to 28, where 0=best and 28=worst. A negative change value indicates a perceived improvement in ocular health. Both eyes contributed to the mean.</description>
