  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a high protein, high fiber&#xD;
      dietary supplement on weight and fat loss in healthy overweight adults. Half of participants&#xD;
      will receive a high protein, high fiber supplement twice a day for 12 weeks, and half of the&#xD;
      subjects will receive a placebo (that contains the same amount of calories as the supplement)&#xD;
      twice a day for 12 weeks.&#xD;
