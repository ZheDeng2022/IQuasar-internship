    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess whether ondansetron given at triage can reduce the number of&#xD;
      patients requiring emergency department observation in children with acute gastroenteritis.&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess the improvement of patient comfort and total length of&#xD;
      stay&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute gastroenteritis is one the most common cause of emergency room visits. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that ondansetron is effective in reducing vomiting in children with&#xD;
      gastroenteritis and improve outcomes by decreasing intravenous rehydration and hospital&#xD;
      admission of those patients. Giving ondansetron to children with suspected gastroenteritis&#xD;
      immediately at triage could reduce the number of patients requiring observation in the&#xD;
      emergency department after medical consultation and improve patients' outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness of triage-initiated administration of&#xD;
      ondansetron for suspected gastroenteritis in the paediatric emergency department. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to assess whether ondansetron given at triage can reduce the number of&#xD;
      patients requiring observation in children with acute gastroenteritis. The investigators will&#xD;
      also assess the improvement of patient comfort and total length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized controlled trial performed in a tertiary paediatric emergency&#xD;
      department. Participants will include all infants more than 8kg who present to the emergency&#xD;
      department with at least four vomiting in the previous 24 hours and the last vomiting that&#xD;
      occurred in the previous 2h. The intervention will consist of giving ondansetron at triage&#xD;
      versus placebo. The primary outcome will be the number of patients requiring observation&#xD;
      after medical consultation in both groups. Secondary objectives will be the number of&#xD;
      episodes of vomiting after receiving the intervention, length of stay in the emergency&#xD;
      department and the proportion of children who will return to a physician within 48 hours. The&#xD;
      investigators will assess the improvement of patient comfort evaluated by parents according&#xD;
      to a BARF (Baxter Animated Retching Face) Scale within the ondansetron group vs placebo. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will be the comparison of the proportion of observation for the two groups.&#xD;
      Based on a preliminary study of the currents children suffering from gastro-enteritis, it was&#xD;
      estimated that the recruitment of 248 participants will provide a power of 90% to identify a&#xD;
      20% difference in the proportion of observed patients.&#xD;
