    <textblock>
      Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) is a college preparatory program that&#xD;
      provides a unique opportunity to determine whether schools can reduce substance use by&#xD;
      re-grouping at-risk students with high-performing students, while providing additional&#xD;
      academic and emotional support. Operating in 4,837 K-12th grade schools worldwide and across&#xD;
      45 US states, this widely-disseminated program targets students from groups traditionally&#xD;
      underrepresented in higher education who are currently performing in the academic middle&#xD;
      (i.e., a 2.0-3.5 grade point average). AVID removes these students from typical classrooms&#xD;
      and exposes them to a peer network in which academic performance and positive social norms&#xD;
      are valued. In addition, by strengthening the student/teacher relationship, AVID expands&#xD;
      students' networks of supportive adults. For low-income minority students in the academic&#xD;
      middle, relatively small investments in prevention might significantly impact their academic&#xD;
      and health trajectories. AVID capitalizes on a moment when social networks are in flux-the&#xD;
      transition to high school-to shift these students' trajectories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a longitudinal, randomized pilot evaluation of AVID among low-income minority&#xD;
      adolescents entering high school, comparing academic performance and drug use, as well as&#xD;
      other risky behaviors, over 3 years. Although social networks are hypothesized to have a&#xD;
      strong influence on behavior, few studies have tried to re-wire networks to change behaviors.&#xD;
      This study will provide a clearer understanding of whether schools can intentionally shape&#xD;
      networks and whether these changes can reduce substance use. This study will also explore&#xD;
      important mechanistic questions about whether and how AVID changes peer networks and&#xD;
      relationships with teachers, whether those changes lead to improvements in academic and&#xD;
      behavioral outcomes and, if so, what the relative importance of peer versus adult network&#xD;
      changes are.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Substance use is an increasing problem among adolescents. Despite decades of prevention work,&#xD;
      most recent data suggest that, by the end of high school, a quarter of teens regularly use&#xD;
      marijuana and nearly half regularly use alcohol. While adolescent marijuana use has increased&#xD;
      across the country in the last decade, rates in California are higher than the national&#xD;
      average. This may be partially attributable to increased social acceptance and access through&#xD;
      legalized dispensaries. As the movement to legalize marijuana gains traction, similar changes&#xD;
      are likely to occur throughout the country. The high prevalence of alcohol and marijuana use&#xD;
      is particularly disturbing in light of evidence that even intermittent adolescent exposure&#xD;
      may have long-term impacts on brain development, in addition to associations with other risky&#xD;
      health behaviors and future substance abuse disorders. African American and Latino youth are&#xD;
      especially at risk, making adolescent substance use prevention a potentially important&#xD;
      strategy to address health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few effective and sustainable substance use interventions exist for high school students.&#xD;
      Preventing substance use becomes more challenging as adolescents age, with fewer prevention&#xD;
      programs demonstrating success for high school youth than for middle school youth. The&#xD;
      challenge is to identify modifiable predictors of substance use for high-school youth and&#xD;
      harness them for prevention. Furthermore, most interventions are difficult to disseminate and&#xD;
      sustain due to limits on financial and human capital. AVID is already widely implemented in&#xD;
      public schools. Thus, if AVID is effective in reducing substance use while also improving&#xD;
      academic outcomes, the program would serve as a promising model for future interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social networks are likely to powerfully influence adolescent substance use. There is strong&#xD;
      and consistent evidence that adolescent substance use is closely tied to the behaviors and&#xD;
      attitudes of individuals in their social network. Social network structure and composition&#xD;
      are shaped by cultural and environmental factors. In school environments, these factors&#xD;
      include policies like tracking of students based on prior achievement. Social networks then&#xD;
      determine sources of support, transmission of social norms, and access and opportunity to&#xD;
      engage in substance use. Although peers are powerful points of influence during adolescence,&#xD;
      relationships with supportive adults can continue to protect against substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite great interest in social networks as potential determinants of risky behaviors,&#xD;
      causal pathways linking social networks with adolescent health have yet to be fully&#xD;
      categorized. Studies suggest that changes in social networks can impact substance use, but&#xD;
      little is known about how to harness this relationship effectively. Answering this question&#xD;
      may have applications across many social environments and health domains. Interventions that&#xD;
      re-wire social networks might offer a relatively low-cost, self-sustaining, and effective&#xD;
      means to prevent some of the most challenging behaviors that lead to poor health outcomes.&#xD;
      School environments present a critical opportunity to impact adolescent health. Through&#xD;
      near-daily exposure, school environments have the potential to shape adolescents'&#xD;
      relationships, social norms, sense of identity, and educational attainment. These factors are&#xD;
      likely to be mutually reinforcing and are strongly associated with substance use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AVID, a widely used educational intervention, offers an important opportunity to test whether&#xD;
      schools can re-wire social networks to improve adolescent health. AVID removes&#xD;
      middle-performing students from a typical school environment, where social pressure often&#xD;
      reinforces low academic achievement and problem behaviors, and places them alongside&#xD;
      high-performing students in a college-preparatory environment where positive social norms are&#xD;
      valued. AVID capitalizes on a natural transition point, when social networks are in flux, by&#xD;
      targeting students at the beginning of 9th grade. Perhaps not coincidentally, 9th grade is&#xD;
      also an enormously vulnerable period-36% of high school drop-outs do so in 9th grade, and&#xD;
      only 15% of 9th graders who are held back will ever graduate. Finally, the program emphasizes&#xD;
      the student/teacher relationship, training teachers to serve as mentors and student&#xD;
      advocates, providing both academic and emotional support to cultivate a family-like&#xD;
      atmosphere. Through the proposed randomized controlled pilot evaluation of AVID,&#xD;
      investigators can measure whether the program successfully changes social networks, and test&#xD;
      whether changes in social networks motivate changes in substance use. Understanding whether&#xD;
      AVID's return on investment extends to health outcomes is vitally important given the limited&#xD;
      resources available to support multiple competing K-12 education initiatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) implemented AVID to provide academic and&#xD;
      social support to students from groups traditionally under-represented in higher education&#xD;
      (e.g., students of color, first generation to attend college). AVID is an international&#xD;
      non-profit institution originally established in 1980 by a San Diego high school teacher.&#xD;
      AVID's goal is to prepare vulnerable students functioning in the academic middle for success&#xD;
      at a 4-year university. Students in each school must actively apply to the program to&#xD;
      demonstrate both eligibility and interest. AVID's eligibility criteria include having a grade&#xD;
      point average of 2.0-3.5 and returning a contract signed by the student and a parent&#xD;
      indicating that the student chooses to participate in the program, has a desire to go to&#xD;
      college, and agrees to enroll in rigorous academic courses. Identification of eligible&#xD;
      candidates for AVID occurs during the second half of 8th grade, prior to high school entry,&#xD;
      and is led by the AVID coordinator. At nearly every AVID high school, the number of students&#xD;
      who qualify for AVID far outweighs the program's capacity-there are, on average, 40 AVID&#xD;
      slots per school, which results in AVID serving only 12% of the student body. In LAUSD, the&#xD;
      demographics of AVID students match those of the district-low-income, and African American or&#xD;
      Latino. For example, in 2014, 86% of LAUSD's AVID students were Latino, 6% were African&#xD;
      American, and 89% qualified for free or reduced lunch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LAUSD's AVID program has agreed to allow investigators to recruit study participants from the&#xD;
      pool of students who meet the AVID eligibility requirements as well as a group of high&#xD;
      performing (middle school grade point average (GPA) &gt;3.5) students who are not AVID eligible.&#xD;
      Near the end of 8th grade, LAUSD will randomize all AVID eligible applicants through a&#xD;
      lottery into either AVID or a waitlist group. Prior to the random assignments being revealed,&#xD;
      investigators will ask all students randomized into AVID and an equal number of students&#xD;
      randomized into the waitlist group to return a signed parental consent form for study&#xD;
      participation and to complete a survey. Students will be recruited and surveyed prior to&#xD;
      revealing their assignment to avoid any response biases caused by happiness or disappointment&#xD;
      at the lottery result. Decisions to participate in the study will have no impact on the&#xD;
      lottery itself. Investigators will survey all study participants at the end of 8th grade, 9th&#xD;
      grade, 10th grade, and 11th grade.&#xD;
