      In this study the investigators propose to detect early mitochondrial metabolic changes in&#xD;
      the heart in patients with a positive genotype and phenotype for HCM using a novel&#xD;
      hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate MRI methodology. Carbon-13 is a stable isotope (not&#xD;
      radioactive) that makes up approximately 1.1% of all natural carbon. Carbon-13 has a non-zero&#xD;
      spin quantum number that allows the investigation of carbon containing substances using&#xD;
      magnetic resonance. However, compared with other analytical methods, carbon-13 magnetic&#xD;
      resonance has been limited by an intrinsically low sensitivity [2}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent experimental studies suggest that altered energy substrate metabolism may precede&#xD;
      structural changes in myocardial hypertrophy. A better understanding of the myocardial&#xD;
      metabolic changes in HCM is important, as the elucidation of such changes may precede the&#xD;
      clinical development of myocardial fibrosis and malignant arrhythmias. Hyperpolarized&#xD;
      [1-13C]pyruvate and its cellular metabolic flux can be assessed with a more than 10,000-fold&#xD;
      higher sensitivity compared to traditional methods. The aim of this pilot study is to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis that patients with HCM present focal alterations in myocardial hyperpolarized&#xD;
      [1-13C]pyruvate flux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this aim the investigators will assess myocardial metabolic changes in HCM&#xD;
      subjects with a positive HCM genotype and phenotype (n=5) and in healthy control subjects&#xD;
      (n=5) who are matched for age, sex, and Body Mass Index (BMI). Total target enrollment will&#xD;
      be set at 15 subjects to allow for attrition and screen failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac function and structure will be evaluated with MRI (proton imaging) before and after&#xD;
      contrast administration. Then myocardial metabolism will be assessed utilizing MRS (carbon&#xD;
      spectroscopy) before and after intravenous injection with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate. The&#xD;
      study agent, hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate, will be administered under a Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) Investigational New Drug (IND), currently in review process, PI Dr.&#xD;
      Craig Malloy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human preliminary data are essential to secure larger scale funding required for clinical&#xD;
      studies. The identification of mitochondrial metabolic changes preceding replacement fibrosis&#xD;
      and malignant arrhythmias may generate a paradigm shift to early detection and more targeted&#xD;
      treatment of HCM with potentially improved clinical outcomes. Cardiac focused applications at&#xD;
      the Advanced Imaging Research Center, genetic disease diagnosis at the Eugene McDermott&#xD;
      Center for Human Genetics and the development of a dedicated HCM Clinic at the UT&#xD;
      Southwestern Medical Center offer today a unique opportunity to lead globally the&#xD;
      translational scientific efforts in this field.&#xD;
