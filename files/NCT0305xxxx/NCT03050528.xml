  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and Acceptance&#xD;
      and Commitment Therapy (ACT) programme, compared to a standalone supervised exercise&#xD;
      intervention for patients with chronic pain. Chronic pain is a common problem, which can have&#xD;
      a significant impact on quality of life. While there are many treatments available for&#xD;
      chronic pain, research has shown that improvements are often modest and short-term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise therapy is known to be helpful for many chronic conditions and is recommended in&#xD;
      clinical guidelines for the management of chronic pain. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy&#xD;
      (ACT) is a form of psychological therapy, which focuses on improvement of function, rather&#xD;
      than symptom reduction. There is an emphasis on psychological flexibility, values and&#xD;
      mindfulness. This approach may be well suited to chronic pain, where symptoms can be beyond a&#xD;
      person's control, but there is a need for further research, particularly with regards to&#xD;
      combining ACT with a physical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in a Dublin University hospital. Patients will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to a combined exercise and ACT treatment group or a standalone exercise group. Both&#xD;
      groups will have weekly treatment for eight weeks and will be assessed before and after&#xD;
      treatment, and again twelve weeks later. Questionnaires will be used to measure the effects&#xD;
      of the treatment on the degree to which pain interferes with various aspects of daily life.&#xD;
      Activity trackers will be worn to measure daily physical activity levels. A purposeful sample&#xD;
      of participants from both groups will also be invited to participate in a qualitative study&#xD;
      following treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, two-armed, parallel group, single-centre Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will assess the effectiveness of a combined Exercise and ACT programme, in comparison to a&#xD;
      standalone supervised exercise intervention for chronic pain. One hundred and sixty patients&#xD;
      aged 18 years and over, who have been diagnosed with a chronic pain condition by a medical&#xD;
      doctor will be recruited to the trial. Participants will be individually randomised to one of&#xD;
      two group interventions. The combined group will take part in eight, weekly psychology&#xD;
      sessions based on the ACT approach, in addition to supervised exercise classes led by a&#xD;
      physiotherapist. The control group will also attend eight, weekly supervised exercise classes&#xD;
      but will not take part in ACT programme. All participants will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      immediately post intervention and at twelve-week follow-up. The primary outcome will be pain&#xD;
      interference at twelve-week follow-up, measured using the Brief Pain Inventory-Interference&#xD;
      Scale. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported pain severity, pain related&#xD;
      self-efficacy, quality of life, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, pain acceptance,&#xD;
      committed action, patient global impression of change, patient satisfaction with treatment,&#xD;
      depression and anxiety. The number of investigations and pain related visits to healthcare&#xD;
      professionals in the preceding three months will be recorded at baseline and twelve-week&#xD;
      follow-up. Physical activity levels (average daily step count, distance travelled and active&#xD;
      minutes) will be measured for all participants using Fitbit Zip activity trackers for one&#xD;
      week prior to starting treatment and for the duration of the eight week intervention period.&#xD;
      Participants will be invited to wear the activity trackers for one further week at the&#xD;
      twelve-week follow-up time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimates of treatment effects at follow up time-points will be based on an&#xD;
      intention-to-treat framework, implemented using a linear mixed effects model. A purposeful&#xD;
      sample of participants will be invited to attend individual interviews and focus groups,&#xD;
      twelve weeks following completion of the interventions. Semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted, with the aim of exploring the views of participants of both interventions in order&#xD;
      to enhance understanding of how these types of interventions work.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will attend the weekly supervised exercise sessions for a period of eight weeks. The classes will be delivered to groups of up to ten participants and will be led by a physiotherapist. The classes will be one hour and thirty minutes in duration and will feature two components: education/advice and exercise. The education/advice sessions will cover topics such as pacing and goal setting and the physiotherapist will answer any queries from the participants in relation to physical activity over the course of the eight weeks. The exercise component will involve the provision of individualised exercises based on each participant's personal goals and the sessions will feature a combination of aerobic, stretching and strengthening exercise in a pool and a gym setting.</description>

    <description>Participants will attend weekly group psychology sessions for an eight-week period. Each session will be two hours in duration and will delivered by a Senior Psychologist trained in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The sessions will feature an ACT treatment process that is designed to promote psychological flexibility through various methods including acceptance and values awareness. The overall aim is to promote behaviour change, enhancing patient engagement in meaningful activities and reducing pain-avoidant behaviours. There is an emphasis on mindfulness, experiential learning and the use of metaphor which is unique to ACT.</description>
