    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe numerical and functional changes in the white blood&#xD;
      cell efter surgical trauma. Further, observed immune cell changes correlate to heart rate&#xD;
      variability and cognitive function will be assessed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Surgical trauma causes release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and other&#xD;
      alarmines (e.g. HMGB-1) targeting receptors on local cells of the innate immune system, such&#xD;
      as macrophages. This cellular response to trauma is followed by a rapid release of an array&#xD;
      of inflammatory mediators (e.g. TNFα, IL-1B, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10) being dependent on&#xD;
      intracellular activation of nuclear factor NF-kB. Until recently it was believed that the&#xD;
      brain is protected from this cascade of inflammatory mediators primarily due to an intact&#xD;
      blood-brain-barrier (BBB). However, there is now a growing body of evidence that long term&#xD;
      impairment of brain functions is associated with trauma-induced activation of the brain&#xD;
      innate immune system with subsequent impairment of higher cognitive processes and risk for&#xD;
      later permanent dementia. Yet, the link between systemic inflammation and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment is not fully understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies have mapped periphery-to-brain-signaling after surgical trauma and the impact&#xD;
      of major surgical trauma on the human brain by serial PET-imaging. In series of surgical&#xD;
      patients, profound and biphasic changes in brain immune activity after surgery has been&#xD;
      demonstrated after major abdominal surgery with signs of early depression followed by an&#xD;
      increased immune activity at 3 months postoperatively. These biphasic changes in brain&#xD;
      immunity seem to be aligned with simultaneous changes in whole blood immune reactivity to LPS&#xD;
      suggesting a close link between brain and peripheral immune systems in regulation of acute&#xD;
      inflammation and immune responses. Preclinical work in surgical animal models indicates&#xD;
      disruption of the BBB with migration of peripheral macrophages into the brain as a pathway of&#xD;
      potential importance. Evidence from an orthopedic surgery model in mice of trauma-induced&#xD;
      altered hippocampal neuro-immune activity further raises the question whether peripheral&#xD;
      markers of neurodegeneration (S100b, neurofilament light NFL, ptau, beta-amyloid) are&#xD;
      associated with POCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune-regulatory role of the brain via the cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex pathway&#xD;
      (mediated by the vagal nerve) has been identified as potential target for immune-modulatory&#xD;
      treatment strategies in systemic inflammation. We have moreover demonstrated a distinct&#xD;
      release of human carotid body inflammatory mediators at hypoxia and gene expression related&#xD;
      to inflammatory mediators, suggesting a potential role of the human carotid body in&#xD;
      periphery-to-brain immune-signaling. Modulation of a vagal nerve-derived inflammatory reflex&#xD;
      pathway by electrical stimulation has recently been successfully applied in treatment of&#xD;
      chronic inflammation among patients with rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that vagal nerve activity modulates systemic inflammation in patients after&#xD;
      major surgery and that this modulation is associated with cognitive performance in the&#xD;
      postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a more comprehensive understanding of immune-to-brain signaling after surgical trauma&#xD;
      and how this biphasic inflammatory response pattern is regulated by cellular and neuronal&#xD;
      components, the impact of immune modulation on key processes behind surgery-induced brain&#xD;
      dysfunction can be explored, and possible neural and humoral targets for relevant&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory treatments established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In abdominal surgery patients we will map inflammatory periphery-to-brain communication by&#xD;
      description of the temporal association between brain regulation of peripheral immunity&#xD;
      (i.e., temporal changes in vagal nerve activity as measured by serial measurements of heart&#xD;
      rate variability), repeated blood reactivity to LPS by serial ex vivo LPS challenge and&#xD;
      simultaneous plasma/serum-borne CNS inflammatory and brain injury biomarkers to explore the&#xD;
      impact of changes in systemic and brain immune function after surgery on long-term cognitive&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
