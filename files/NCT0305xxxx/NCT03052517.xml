  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was a 2-treatment period, randomized, multicenter parallel-group study. The&#xD;
      overall purpose of this study was to provide long- term safety data for fevipiprant (QAW039)&#xD;
      (Dose 1 and Dose 2), compared with placebo, when added to the Global Initiative for Asthma&#xD;
      (GINA) steps 3, 4, and 5 standard-of-care (SoC) asthma therapy (GINA 2016), in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to- severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to provide long-term safety data for QAW039 150 mg once daily&#xD;
      and 450 mg once daily, compared with placebo, when added to GINA steps 3, 4, and 5&#xD;
      standard-of-care asthma therapy (GINA 2020) in adult and adolescent (≥12 years) patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe asthma. The study included 2 cohorts of patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Rollover patients who had completed any of the four Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies&#xD;
           with QAW039 (QAW039A2307, QAW039A2314, QAW039A2316, or QAW039A2317, hereafter referred&#xD;
           to as Studies A2307, A2314, A2316, and A2317), thus providing data for a longer duration&#xD;
           of exposure, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. New patients who had not previously participated in a study of QAW039, permitting an&#xD;
           increase in the number of patients with long-term exposure to QAW039.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By including these 2 categories of patients, the total number of patients treated with QAW039&#xD;
      as well as the duration of exposure to QAW039 treatment was substantially increased,&#xD;
      supporting evaluation of the safety profile of QAW039.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study comprised 2-treatment period. Treatment Period 1 was a 52-week, double-blind&#xD;
      treatment period in which QAW039 450 mg or 150 mg or placebo was added to standard-of-care&#xD;
      asthma therapy according to GINA guidelines. Treatment Period 2 was an optional 104-week,&#xD;
      single-blind treatment period in which patients received QAW039 450 mg or 150 mg or placebo&#xD;
      added to standard-of-care asthma therapy according to GINA guidelines.&#xD;
