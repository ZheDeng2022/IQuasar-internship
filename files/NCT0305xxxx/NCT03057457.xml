    <textblock>
      The NGAL TestTM is a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay for the quantitative&#xD;
      determination of neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) in human EDTA plasma for&#xD;
      testing on automated clinical chemistry analyzer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The First Indication for Use: An NGAL test result above the assay cutoff as an aid in the&#xD;
      risk assessment for the development of stage II or III acute kidney injury (AKI) within 1 day&#xD;
      of patient assessment in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who are hypotensive&#xD;
      (MAP&lt;70 mmHg) and/or receiving vasopressor support. Second Indication for Use: In patents&#xD;
      with stage II or III AKI, NGAL measurement aids in the risk assessment of the development of&#xD;
      persistent (≥2 days) stage 2 or 3 AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective for this clinical trial is to validate that the NGAL test using a&#xD;
      cutoff of 140 ng/ml shows clinical performance in predicting the development of moderate or&#xD;
      severe acute kidney injury within 1 day. The Secondary Objective is to validate that the NGAL&#xD;
      test shows clinical performance in predicting persistent moderate or severe acute kidney&#xD;
      injury during any contiguous 2 day interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that up to 20 Clinical Sites in US will participate in the trial. The study&#xD;
      sites will recruit consecutive patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria who are&#xD;
      admitted to hospital in an ICU or critical care setting. Patients will receive their clinical&#xD;
      standard of care including standard laboratory and other testing as requested by each&#xD;
      subject's physician.&#xD;

      clinical standard of care including standard laboratory and other testing as requested by&#xD;
      each subject's physician. Enrollment is estimated to take approximately six months and the&#xD;
      trial will be stopped when the Adjudication Panel has diagnosed at least 85 patients with AKI&#xD;
      stage 2 or 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject who is enrolled in the study will only have 4 blood draws as part of NGAL TestTM&#xD;
      Trial with no additional study activities with the exception of data collection. The NGAL&#xD;
      results will not be returned to the treating physician for use in the health management of&#xD;
      the study subjects.&#xD;
