    <textblock>
      This research study is for participants that have End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). ESRD is the&#xD;
      last stage of chronic kidney disease. Anemia is very common in ESRD patients and require&#xD;
      erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) for treatment. Anemia happens when there are not&#xD;
      enough red blood cells in your body. ESAs work by helping the bone marrow to produce red&#xD;
      blood cells. There are two ESAs licensed for the treatment of anemia of Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease (CKD) in the Unites States: epoetin alfa and darbopoetin alfa. ESA therapy is&#xD;
      considered safe. However, major adverse effects should be acknowledged, including an&#xD;
      increased risk of death, thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart attack, aplastic anemia,&#xD;
      tumor progression, and others. To minimize risks of these adverse events, careful monitoring&#xD;
      of hemoglobin levels, along with adjustment of ESA dosing, to maintain the lowest hemoglobin&#xD;
      level clinically needed is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferric Citrate, also called Auryxia, is an iron-based phosphate binder that may decrease ESA&#xD;
      usage while maintaining hemoglobin levels. Phosphate binders are medications used to reduce&#xD;
      the body's absorption of phosphate. In a prior study, it was seen that some laboratory&#xD;
      values, such as iron levels, changed positively in response to Auryxia. In this study we want&#xD;
      to see if using Auryxia will cause a change in laboratory values and lower the use of ESAs in&#xD;
      ESRD patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency anemia is very prevalent in end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Patients&#xD;
      with ESRD require phosphate binders for hyperphosphatemia and erythropoiesis-stimulating&#xD;
      agents (ESAs) and intravenous (IV) iron for anemia. In patients with ESRD, iron deficiency&#xD;
      occurs more frequently, because of increased external losses of iron, decreased availability&#xD;
      of the body's storage of iron, and perhaps a deficit in intestinal iron absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESRD patients tend to lose about 3 grams of iron every year from chronic bleeding, frequent&#xD;
      phlebotomy and blood trapping in the dialysis apparatus. Total body iron stores of about&#xD;
      20-25 mg are mostly maintained by recycling from senescent red blood cell (RBC) count by&#xD;
      macrophages of the reticulo-endothelial system. In addition, to true iron deficiency, many&#xD;
      ESRD patients have functional iron deficiency, characterized by impaired iron release from&#xD;
      body stores that is unable to meet the demand for erythropoiesis (also called&#xD;
      reticuloendothelial cell iron blockade). These patients have low serum transferrin saturation&#xD;
      (TSAT, a measure of circulating iron) and normal or high serum ferritin (a marker of body&#xD;
      iron stores). Dietary iron absorption under usual circumstances accounts for only 1-2 mg/day&#xD;
      and is almost equal to daily iron losses from intestinal and skin cell shedding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For treatment of anemia caused by chronic renal disease, the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) has approved the use of ESA therapy. There are two ESAs licensed for the&#xD;
      treatment of anemia of CKD in the Unites States: epoetin alfa and darbopoetin alfa. Both are&#xD;
      glycoproteins that are manufactured using recombinant DNA technology. They stimulate&#xD;
      erythropoiesis through the same mechanism of action as endogenous erythropoietin. The&#xD;
      starting dose of epoetin is 50 units/kg (3000-4000 units/dose) once or twice a week, and&#xD;
      darbepoetin is started at 0.45 mcg/kg and can be administered every 2-4 weeks. To avoid&#xD;
      impaired erythropoiesis caused by true iron deficiency or functional iron deficiency, iron&#xD;
      stores should be fully replenished before and during ESA therapy. ESA therapy is considered&#xD;
      safe. However, major adverse effects should be acknowledged, including an increased risk of&#xD;
      death, thromboembolic complications, stroke, heart attack, aplastic anemia, tumor&#xD;
      progression, and others. To minimize risks of these adverse events, careful monitoring of&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels, along with adjustment of ESA dosing, to maintain the lowest hemoglobin&#xD;
      level clinically needed is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that ESRD is a pro-inflammatory condition, substantial elevation in serum ferritin is&#xD;
      very common in ESRD patients. The role of iron replacement therapy in ESRD patients with high&#xD;
      serum ferritin but low transferrin saturation is not clear at all. In fact, most anemia&#xD;
      management protocols recommend stopping iron replacement when ferritin levels are greater&#xD;
      than 1,200 ng/ml, even if the TSAT is below 20%. The United States Renal Data System (USRDS)&#xD;
      reports for that 55% of prevalent ESRD patients (2012-2014) have a ferritin &gt;800 ng/ml and&#xD;
      22% had ferritin&gt;1200 ng/ml. In one of our local dialysis centers, close to 45% of patients&#xD;
      seem to have a ferritin greater than 1,200 ng/ml and about 20% have a combination of low TSAT&#xD;
      and high ferritin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferric citrate (Auryxia) is a novel, iron-based phosphate binder that increases iron stores&#xD;
      and decreases IV iron and ESA usage while maintaining hemoglobin levels, and may decrease the&#xD;
      cost of ESRD care. By binding phosphate in the GI tract and decreasing absorption, ferric&#xD;
      citrate lowers the phosphate concentration in the serum. In addition to effects on serum&#xD;
      phosphorus levels, Auryxia has been shown to increase serum iron parameters, including&#xD;
      ferritin, iron and TSAT. In dialysis patients treated with Auryxia in a 52-week study in&#xD;
      which IV iron could also be administered, mean (SD) ferritin levels rose from 593 (293) ng/mL&#xD;
      to 895 (482) ng/mL, mean (SD) TSAT levels rose from 31% (11) to 39% (17) and mean (SD) iron&#xD;
      levels rose from 73 (29) mcg/dL to 88 (42) mcg/dL. In contrast, in patients treated with&#xD;
      active control, these parameters remained relatively constant.&#xD;
