    <textblock>
      Data for this study will be obtained from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center&#xD;
      Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. Participants will be recruited through Simmons Cancer&#xD;
      Center. One hundred female breast cancer patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be enrolled. In order to reach this number, it is estimated that up to 125 eligible&#xD;
      participants will need to be recruited. The study will last approximately two years.&#xD;
      Participants will undergo one cognitive testing session, and each subject's total&#xD;
      participation time will last no more than two hours.&#xD;

      The study visit will be scheduled for three to six months after completing adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. At the study visit, informed consent will be obtained and&#xD;
      neurocognitive attention testing will be performed. The assessments chosen were carefully&#xD;
      selected based on breadth, psychometric properties, standardized broad clinical use, good&#xD;
      external validity and time efficiency. The testing time for the battery of neuropsychological&#xD;
      tests is approximately 45-60 minutes. Participants will also be asked to complete a packet of&#xD;
      several questionnaires including several self-rated measures of mood and quality of life, in&#xD;
      addition to a brief questionnaire to obtain information about exercise, sleep, and education&#xD;
      and employment backgrounds. It is estimated that questionnaire completion will require no&#xD;
      more than 30 minutes. Participants will be seen on only one occasion, and may receive, upon&#xD;
      request, written feedback about the results of the evaluation.&#xD;

             breast cancer treatment, pre-cancer major Axis I psychiatric disorder, diagnosis of&#xD;
             adult Attention Deficit Disorder, or other pre-existing disorder with known cognitive&#xD;
             impairments (e.g. dementia, intellectual disability) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non- English speakers and subjects under the age of 40 or over the age of 70 will not&#xD;
