      Project PI (Principal Investigator): Dr Bassam Mahfouz Ayoub, Ph.D., Lecturer of&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Chemistry, The British University in Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design The proposed study will consider the pharmacokinetic evaluation of empagliflozin&#xD;
      after administration to Egyptian volunteers and the results will be compared with the other&#xD;
      reported ethnic populations. The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining racial&#xD;
      subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies, and to assess&#xD;
      potential subgroup differences. The design of the study is open labeled, randomized, one&#xD;
      treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;

      Study Design The proposed study will consider the pharmacokinetic evaluation of empagliflozin&#xD;
      after administration to Egyptian volunteers and the results will be compared with the other&#xD;
      reported ethnic populations. The FDA recognizes that standard methods of defining racial&#xD;
      subgroups are necessary to compare results across pharmacokinetic studies, and to assess&#xD;
      potential subgroup differences. The design of the study is open labeled, randomized, one&#xD;
      treatment, one period, single dose pharmacokinetic study. The main pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      which are Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, elimination rate constant, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf, will be&#xD;
      estimated. Fasting of all volunteers will eliminate the possible interaction from food or&#xD;
      caffeine consumption. The pharmacokinetic parameters of empagliflozin will be studied in&#xD;
      healthy human subjects according to the ethical regulations of World Medical Association&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki (October 1996) and the International Conference of Harmonisation&#xD;
      Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice. Written informed consent was provided&#xD;
      (attached and signed by the six volunteers) in order to be approved by the ethics committee&#xD;
      of the Faculty of Pharmacy, The British University in Egypt. The good health of the human&#xD;
      subjects was confirmed by a complete medical history and physical examination. Samples from&#xD;
      six, healthy, adult, male, smoking, Egyptian volunteers (age: 22-33 years, Average weight:&#xD;
      77.8 kg, Average BMI: 29.2) will be collected at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 12 h, to be&#xD;
      transferred to heparinized centrifuge tubes in order to be analyzed by LC-MS/MS study&#xD;
      (developed &amp; validated) after single oral dose administration of one Jardiance® tablet&#xD;
      nominally containing 25 mg of empagliflozin. The blood samples (3 mL of each sample) will be&#xD;
      centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 minutes, one mL of the plasma will be separated and spiked with&#xD;
      100 µL (equivalent to 100 ng) of internal standard working solution and then the sample&#xD;
      preparation and LC-MS/MS determination will be applied. The main pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      of the study which are Cmax, Tmax, t1/2, elimination rate constant, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf will&#xD;
      be estimated, using a validated excel software. Blood glucose level will be determined for&#xD;
      all volunteers at different time intervals to monitor any hypoglycemic effect. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted as per FDA guidelines. The development of such correlations between&#xD;
      empagliflozin concentrations and its pharmacologic responses will enable clinicians to apply&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic principles to actual patient situations. The evaluation of safety of the&#xD;
      study will be based on monitoring of blood glucose level, vital signs, pulse rate, monitoring&#xD;
      of adverse events, and physical examination.&#xD;
