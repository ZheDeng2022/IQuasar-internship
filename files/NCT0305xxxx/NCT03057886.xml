      This study compares the use of the &quot;SPOT ON&quot; thermometer with the oral, esophageal in&#xD;
      participants submitted to general and the oral thermometer to spinal anesthesia, from the pre&#xD;
      op, intra and post op stages, evaluating the accuracy of this new monitor against the already&#xD;
      consecrated one by literature. The Investigators will analyze in three different types of&#xD;
      anesthesia (general, spinal and pediatric population).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      After approval by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee, the adults and pediatrics&#xD;
      participants for elective surgeries to be submitted to general and spinal anesthesia lasting&#xD;
      60 minutes or more held at the surgery center at Itapecerica of Serra Hospital. The&#xD;
      participants will receive the necessary explanations on the research and, after obtaining the&#xD;
      responsible consent for participating in the trial, the participants will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion - adults and pediatrics population that will be submitted to general or spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia in the surgery center at Itapecerica of Serra Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The participants that are feverish/present with infectious symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Refusal of the use of the device by the participants There will be select each groups&#xD;
           made up of 70 participants. It will be submitted the adults in two groups, one submitted&#xD;
           to general anesthesia and other group submitted to spinal anesthesia and the pediatric&#xD;
           group to general anesthesia. The made up for the choice of the thermometer to be to&#xD;
           general anesthesia the oral and Spot On thermometers before anesthesia induction, after&#xD;
           anesthesia induction the Spot On, and oral, and esophageal thermometers and after&#xD;
           surgery in PACU the Spot On and oral thermometer. In group submitted to spinal&#xD;
           anesthesia the made up for the choice of the thermometer to be the oral and Spot On&#xD;
           thermometers before anesthesia induction, after anesthesia induction and after surgery&#xD;
           in PACU the Spot On and oral thermometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The thermometer will be used as the moment they will be identified as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult General Group (AGG): the anesthetic procedure will use the spot on thermometer during&#xD;
      the pre, intra and post-operative stages and in association with oral during the pre, intra&#xD;
      and post-operative stages and the esophagus thermometer during the intra-operative stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult Spinal Group (ASG): the anesthetic procedure will use the oral and the spot on&#xD;
      thermometer in the pre, intra and post-operative stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric General Group (ASG): the anesthetic procedure will use the oral in the pre, intra&#xD;
      and post-operative stages and esophageal thermometers in the intra stages and the spot on&#xD;
      thermometer during the pre, intra and post-operative stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anesthetic technique will be standard according to the scheduled surgery. The study will&#xD;
      assess the participants submitted to elective anesthesia throughout the pre, intra and&#xD;
      post-operative stages of all scheduled elective surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants for elective surgeries lasting 60 minutes or more and/or are scheduled&#xD;
      to use any active heating device from the pre, intra and post-anesthetic stages up till the&#xD;
      discharge from the post anesthesia recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables to be assessed in the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age, gender, weight, height, physical condition according to the American Anesthesiology&#xD;
           Association classification;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral, SPOT ON, and esophagus temperature measured at the following points:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mentrance - entering the room and every 10 min until the anesthesia induction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Minduction - immediately before induction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  M10, M20, M30 = 10, 20, 30 min after induction and every 10 min till the end of the&#xD;
                anesthetic procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mpost-0, Mpost-15, Mpost-30, Mdischarge, = 0, 15, 30, and every 15 min till the&#xD;
                discharge from post anesthesia recovery room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Room temperature of operating room and post anesthesia recovery room (from the&#xD;
           participants entrance every 30 minutes to the end of the procedure and discharge to the&#xD;
           hospital bed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The data will be tabulated and noted as mean and standard deviation, whenever&#xD;
      possible, and observed for normal distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (sample size&#xD;
      exceeding 50). Nonparametric data will be presented by Mid and distribution boundaries. The&#xD;
      values of temperatures are compared by estimation model of generalized equations (GEE) with&#xD;
      Bonferroni correction (REF: Guimarães and Hirakata, 2012).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The calculation of the sample consider the participants as his own control (intragroup) and&#xD;
      also the comparison between the equipment used (between groups, all three). Using&#xD;
      multivariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) repeated measures, with test significance level&#xD;
      (alpha) 1% (probability of error type I) and sample size which reduces the probability of&#xD;
      type II error (Beta) in 95%, the sample is situated on 120 participants(Ref: Faul et al&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
