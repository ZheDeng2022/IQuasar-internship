  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single center phase II study of adjuvant pembrolizumab in N2 positive&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with neoadjuvant concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy followed by curative resection. Patients will receive pembrolizumab 200 mg&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of adjuvant pembrolizumab&#xD;
      treatment in terms of disease-free survival (DFS; per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 as assessed by the investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baseline assessment is part of the screening procedures and should be performed within 0&#xD;
      to 14 days before the start of study drug. The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      assessment will be CT of chest or PET-CT if indicated. Follow-up chest CT for all patients&#xD;
      will be assessed every 12 weeks for the first year, every 16 weeks for the second year, every&#xD;
      6 months for the third year, and every year thereafter. In subjects who discontinued study&#xD;
      therapy without documented recurrence, every effort should be made to continue monitoring&#xD;
      their disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt&#xD;
      should be made to perform the subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits. RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      scans will be analyzed by the investigator on site; a central review will not be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion or discontinuation of study drug, patients will enter a follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a patient has had objective relapse recorded and has discontinued study drug, the&#xD;
      patient will be followed for survival status every 3 months until death, withdrawal of&#xD;
      consent or the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be requested to provide tumor samples from diagnostic (obtained before&#xD;
      neoadjuvant CCRT) and surgical specimens for exploratory biomarker study. Sample provision is&#xD;
      not optional, subject to a specific consent.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Note: Abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual lifestyle and preferred contraception&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must be excluded from participating in the trial if the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Is currently participating and receiving study therapy or has participated in a&#xD;
                  study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an&#xD;
                  investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Participation in another clinical study with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors at any time&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Any previous treatment with a PD-1, PD-L1 inhibitor or any anti-cancer therapy&#xD;
                  after complete resection of lung cancer&#xD;

               4. Current or prior use of immunosuppressive medication within 28 days before the&#xD;
                  first dose of pembrolizumab, with the exceptions of intranasal and inhaled&#xD;
                  corticosteroids or systemic corticosteroids at physiological doses, which are not&#xD;
                  to exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone, or an equivalent corticosteroid&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Mean QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) ≥470 ms using Bazett's correction&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Has a known history of active TB (Bacillus Tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Active or prior documented inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or&#xD;
                  ulcerative colitis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               8. History of allogenic organ transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
               9. Hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab or any of its excipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
              10. Prior history of malignancy within 2 years from study entry except for adequately&#xD;
                  treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer or in situ cervical cancer, or&#xD;
                  early gastric cancer. The incidentally detected, non-metastatic well&#xD;
                  differentiated thyroid cancer can be enrolled irrespective of the treatment,&#xD;
                  because the prognosis of this type of cancer is known much better than the study&#xD;
                  disease, even it is untreated. For the debatable double primary cancer, the&#xD;
                  enrolment can be discussed with the principal investigator in a manner of case by&#xD;
                  case, and if it is not expected to affect the study outcome, the subjects can be&#xD;
                  enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
              11. Has active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
                  years (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
                  immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
                  physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary&#xD;
                  insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
              12. Has known history of, or any evidence of active, non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
              13. Evidence of interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
              14. Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
              15. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
                  abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the&#xD;
                  subject's participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best&#xD;
                  interest of the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
                  investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
              16. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
                  cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
              17. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within&#xD;
                  the projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening&#xD;
                  visit through 120 days after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
              18. Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
              19. Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
                  [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
              20. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy.&#xD;
                  Note: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu&#xD;
                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®)&#xD;
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
