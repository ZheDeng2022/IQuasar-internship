  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Pilot study evaluates the use of a new device called Inflammacheck and whether it can&#xD;
      consistently measure hydrogen peroxide levels in exhaled breath condensate. It will also&#xD;
      assess whether exhaled breath condensate hydrogen peroxide levels as measured by&#xD;
      Inflammacheck can differentiate people with asthma and COPD from healthy individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hydrogen Peroxide levels in Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) is a direct biomarker of&#xD;
      oxidative stress from the airway epithelium. Levels have been shown to be raised in asthma&#xD;
      and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) both in stable and exacerbating states.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously it has been difficult to measure this volatile compound away from a laboratory&#xD;
      based setting. However a new device has been developed to measure Hydrogen peroxide levels in&#xD;
      exhaled breath by the patients side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Pilot study will test this new device in a clinical setting. It will assess whether the&#xD;
      device can monitor levels consistently and reliably and whether it can distinguish disease&#xD;
      from healthy individuals.&#xD;

        Three populations of older adolescent and adult patients (all aged ≥16yrs) will be invited&#xD;
        to participate:&#xD;

          1. Asthma patients (n=30)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. COPD patients (n=30)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has received treatment for an exacerbation of their respiratory disease within&#xD;
