      Long-term observational study on the utilisation and outcomes of HyQvia (a product consisting&#xD;
      of recombinant human hyaluronidase and a human normal immunoglobulin 10% solution) under&#xD;
      everyday clinical practice conditions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant hyaluronidase is an established therapeutic principle to facilitate the infusion&#xD;
      of large volumes of fluids subcutaneously (e.g. Ringer solution and antibodies such as IG,&#xD;
      rituximab, trastuzumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HyQvia is a product consisting of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20, Hylenex®), and a&#xD;
      human normal immunoglobulin (IG). The subcutaneous (SC) IG is a 10% solution prepared from&#xD;
      human plasma consisting of at least 98% immunoglobulin G, which contains a broad spectrum of&#xD;
      antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two components are packaged together as a dual vial unit: IG provides the therapeutic&#xD;
      effect and the recombinant human hyaluronidase facilitates the dispersion, which alters the&#xD;
      kinetics of absorption and increases the bioavailability of the IG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HyQvia is marketed in the European Union (EU) since July 2013 and in the USA since September&#xD;
      2014. In the EU, HyQvia is indicated as replacement therapy in patients of all age groups in&#xD;
      primary immunodeficiency syndromes (PID), and in myeloma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia&#xD;
      with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinaemia and recurrent infections (secondary&#xD;
      immunodeficiency syndromes, SID), as well as hypogammaglobulinaemia and pre- and&#xD;
      post-allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HyQvia was investigated in one pivotal study lasting over a year, involving 89 patients with&#xD;
      PID who had already had treatment with human normal IG for at least three months. The number&#xD;
      of acute serious bacterial infections (SBI) as main efficacy outcomes was 0.025 per year.&#xD;
      This was below the FDA predefined number needed to show efficacy (SBI rate &lt;1.0 per subject&#xD;
      per year at the 0.01 level of significance), and was similar to that seen with other licensed&#xD;
      human normal IG products. In the pivotal study and its extension, 188 patient years under&#xD;
      HyQvia treatment have been documented. HyQvia was efficacious, safe, and bioequivalent to&#xD;
      intravenous IG at the same administration intervals, but it caused fewer systemic reactions.&#xD;
      Tolerability was good despite high infusion volumes and rates. There are no preclinical data&#xD;
      that suggest an increased risk of mutagenicity, teratogenicity, fertility or neuronal&#xD;
      development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most current and comprehensive data on real-life utilisation and outcomes of various IgG&#xD;
      preparations is available from the German SIGNS registry. This registry confirmed the&#xD;
      effectiveness of IgG substitution or treatment in terms of reduction of infections (PID and&#xD;
      SID), as well as stabilization or improvement of the clinical condition in neurological and&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. In a cohort of 24 PID and SID patients on HyQvia in the German SIGNS&#xD;
      study, the preparation was well tolerated and treatment satisfaction was high. In other&#xD;
      countries, data on the utilisation and outcomes of HyQvia under clinical practice conditions&#xD;
      are sparse or completely missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to fill these gaps and to provide a detailed and complete description&#xD;
      of the utilisation of under everyday clinical practice conditions.&#xD;
