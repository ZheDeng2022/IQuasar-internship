  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apart from obesity, craniofacial factors are well recognized in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and are likely to play an important role in influencing the&#xD;
      response to weight loss. The prevalence of OSA syndrome is as common among the middle-aged&#xD;
      Hong Kong Chinese populations as the Caucasians, despite our Chinese patients having much&#xD;
      lower body mass index (BMI). From previous work on ethnic comparison, for the same degree of&#xD;
      OSA severity, Caucasians were more overweight, whereas Chinese exhibited more craniofacial&#xD;
      bony restriction. Cephalometric measurements based on lateral radiograph of the upper airway&#xD;
      have shown that a shorter distance between maxillary projection from the cranial base, a&#xD;
      smaller posterior airway space, less mandibular protrusion, a narrower space between the hard&#xD;
      palate and cranial base, and a more caudally placed hyoid bone predispose to a higher&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). A recent study shown that a shorter mandibular length as measured&#xD;
      by lateral cephalometry was associated with a greater fall in AHI after weight loss. Another&#xD;
      study using craniofacial computed tomography (CT) scans to evaluate the maxillomandibular&#xD;
      bony volume found that craniofacial restriction influenced the relationship between weight&#xD;
      loss and OSA improvement. Collectively, these studies suggest that the effect on AHI with&#xD;
      weight loss is likely to be more pronounced in those with a smaller craniofacial skeleton.&#xD;
      However, the effect of the craniofacial restriction on the degree of rebound in OSA following&#xD;
      weight gain after the weight loss intervention is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the change in weight and OSA severity following cessation of a&#xD;
      lifestyle modification program (LMP) and examine the relationship between craniofacial&#xD;
      restriction and the degree of OSA reoccurrence.&#xD;

      All subjects will be advised to stop using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for at&#xD;
      least 7 days as previous study showed that severity of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) did not&#xD;
      increase further after the first week of CPAP withdrawal. Subjects will then be invited to&#xD;
      undergo a limited sleep study using &quot;EMBLETTA&quot; portable diagnostic system (MEDCARE, Iceland).&#xD;
      The EMBLETTA is a pocket-sized digital recording device. It is a multi-channel transducer,&#xD;
      providing an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) based on recording time. It also detects both&#xD;
      respiratory and abdominal efforts through the effort sensor and can differentiate between&#xD;
      obstructive and central events. Built-in position sensors are also available to differentiate&#xD;
      supine from non-supine events. Respiratory events are scored when desaturations of at least&#xD;
      4% occurred in the absence of moving artefacts and irrespective of co-existing changes in&#xD;
      snoring or heart rate. The EMBLETTA operates on battery power, with the internal memory&#xD;
      storage of 16 MB, which allows approximately 12 hours of data collection. The EMBLETTA&#xD;
      default settings for apneas and hypopneas will be used in this study. An apnea is defined as&#xD;
      a decrease in airflow by 80% of baseline for at least 10 seconds. The EMBLETTA default&#xD;
      maximum apnea duration is set at 80 seconds. A hypopnea is defined as a decrease in airflow&#xD;
      by 50% of baseline for at least 10 seconds. The EMBLETTA default maximum hypopnea duration is&#xD;
      set at 100 seconds. The EMBLETTA AHI used for analysis is automatically analysed by the&#xD;
      EMBLETTA software. The EMBLETTA device has been validated against hospital-based&#xD;
      polysomnography in the Hong Kong Chinese population. The EMBLETTA is a highly sensitive and&#xD;
      specific screening device in quantifying AHI and differentiating obstructing and supine&#xD;
      events when compared against polysomnography (PSG) in patients with suspected OSA. Patients&#xD;
      will be instructed how to operate the EMBLETTA device for the sleep recording and estimate&#xD;
      their time of sleep. Those who have failed the EMBLETTA sleep study will be arranged to have&#xD;
      a second home EMBLETTA sleep study. Patients who are symptomatic of OSA with a negative home&#xD;
      EMBLETTA sleep study will be arranged to have a hospital-based PSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) scans of the&#xD;
      head/neck region to evaluate the upper airway and craniofacial structures. Craniofacial&#xD;
      restriction is determined by measuring the size of the maxillomandibular volume based on the&#xD;
      mandibular cephalometric landmarks (left and right condylion, left and right gonion, anterior&#xD;
      nasal spine (ANS) and menton) as per previous published study. The patient is positioned in&#xD;
      the natural head position with a closed lip and bite. All measurements will be made by a&#xD;
      single assessor and the analysis will be performed blind to knowledge of weight loss and AHI&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will go through several measurements. These include assessment of subjective&#xD;
      sleepiness with the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS), anthropometric measurements (body mass&#xD;
      index, neck and waist circumference) and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESS is a questionnaire specific to symptoms of daytime sleepiness and the patients are&#xD;
      asked to score the likelihood of falling asleep in eight different situations with different&#xD;
      levels of stimulation, adding up to a total score of 0 to 24.&#xD;

        Subjects are participants in a previously described dietician-based weight loss study in&#xD;
        obese Chinese with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in which 61 subjects underwent a 12-month&#xD;
        weight loss program consisting of dietician consultation with caloric reduction of 10% to&#xD;
        20% in daily energy intake from the patient's usual diet and then the goal was adjusted&#xD;
        subsequently based on changes in body weight with target BMI toward 23 kg/m2 om the uear pf&#xD;
        2010-2013. Specific study entry criteria included an age range between 30 and 80 years,&#xD;
        body mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2, and moderate to severe OSA (apnea-hypopnea index (AHI)&#xD;
        &gt;15/hr) before the weight loss program performed in the year of 2010-2013. All subjects&#xD;
        from the intervention group will be invited to participate.&#xD;
