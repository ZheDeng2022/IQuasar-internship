  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the impact of an exercise and nutrition (EX+NUTR) , relative to&#xD;
      exercise alone (EX) intervention, on brain structure and function as well as blood biomarkers&#xD;
      in older adults with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and vascular risk factors. The&#xD;
      overall hypotheses are that a combined EX+NUTR, relative to EX, intervention will evoke more&#xD;
      positive changes in brain structure (e.g. hippocampal volume), neural activity (e.g. task&#xD;
      associated functional activations monitored through fMRI), and cognitive performance. These&#xD;
      changes will be associated with an improved metabolic profile, reductions in inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines and oxidative burden, and greater intervention compliance.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants will engage in group supervised exercise sessions once per week as well as&#xD;
      engage in additional exercise sessions at home 4 days/week. The exercise program will be run&#xD;
      out of two sites (Toronto Rehabilitation Institute (TRI) - Rumsey Centre in Toronto, and the&#xD;
      Centre for Community, Clinical Applied Research Excellence (CCCARE) at the University of&#xD;
      Waterloo). The supervised exercise sessions modeled after the standard TRI Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Prevention and Rehabilitation program, including aerobic training, resistance training and&#xD;
      education/counseling. The active group will receive strategy training to simultaneously&#xD;
      improve their diet in conjunction with our newly developed Brain Health Food Guide (EX+BHFG);&#xD;
      the placebo control group (EX+BHEd) will receive brain health education to control for time&#xD;
      and social participation. [NOTE All participants must also be enrolled in the SCD cohort of&#xD;
      the CCNA and undergo the CCNA's COMPASS-ND assessment at the beginning of the trial.] The&#xD;
      study is 6 months in duration and requires participants to attend 2.5 hr weekly sessions (1&#xD;
      hr supervised exercise, 0.5 hr exercise/stress education and 1 hr nutrition or brain health&#xD;
      education) and to exercise on their own an additional 3-4 times per week. Participants are&#xD;
      assessed on measures of cognition, brain health (MRI), functional status at baseline, post&#xD;
      intervention and 6 month follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </detailed_description>
  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Due to COVID-19, recruitment and enrollment was suspended and never resumed. COVID-related&#xD;
    changes have been made to the clinical program which houses our intervention, and we could not&#xD;
    compare new participants with our previous cohort.&#xD;

    <description>On the same day as the exercise class, participants will also receive nutrition support. Participants will alter their overall diet to be consistent with recommendations outlined in our brain health food guide (BHFG) and receive diet counseling and strategy training to promote retention and enable this dietary change. For the first two months, diet group sessions will be held on a weekly basis. For the remaining four months, sessions will be divided between group sessions and individual meetings with study dietitians, on a predefined schedule. Participants will submit weekly logs outlining diet goals, plans, successes and obstacles to help direct identification of sequential goals.</description>

    <description>Supervised group exercise will be performed once per week (60 minutes) and self-directed exercise (4 additional aerobic and 2-3 resistance training sessions per week) will be monitored by an exercise diary. The initial walking prescription will be set at ~1.6 km and an intensity equivalent to the anaerobic threshold and/or 60% VO2-peak. Progressions will be made every 2 weeks, increasing distance to a maximum of 6.4 km and then increasing to a max intensity of 80% of VO2-peak and/or max duration of 60 minutes. Heart rate and perceived exertion will be monitored. The program will last 6 months.</description>
