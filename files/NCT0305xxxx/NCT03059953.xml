  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For patients with moderate plaque psoriasis who are intolerable to, have a contraindication&#xD;
      to or have failed classical systemic treatments, the current commonly employed management&#xD;
      strategy encompasses treatment with biologic agents. The direct and indirect costs of&#xD;
      biologic treatment, accruing, among others, from the high drug acquisition and administration&#xD;
      costs, the required baseline safety screening and subsequent routine monitoring as well as&#xD;
      the potential loss of patients' working hours constitute a significant financial burden on&#xD;
      the public healthcare system. In light of the above evidence, it appears that in routine care&#xD;
      apremilast may fulfill an important gap in the treatment armamentarium of psoriasis by&#xD;
      providing a promising treatment option to be employed prior to biologics, which has&#xD;
      demonstrated efficacy even in hard-to-treat areas such as the scalp, nails, palms and soles,&#xD;
      and has a limited manageable safety profile, while being more convenient and cost-effective&#xD;
      than biologics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the scarcity of real-world evidence regarding the impact of apremilast on the&#xD;
      patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and extent and severity of the disease, and&#xD;
      under the consideration that the moderate psoriasis patient {defined as [10&lt;body surface area&#xD;
      (BSA)&lt;20 or 10&lt;psoriasis area severity index (PASI)&lt;20] and 10&lt;dermatology quality of life&#xD;
      index (DLQI)&lt;20}, naïve to biologic treatment was likely underrepresented in the pivotal&#xD;
      ESTEEM trials since approximately 30% of the enrolled patients had been previously treated&#xD;
      with biologic therapy, 28-30% had a baseline PASI score &gt;20, and 48-52% had a BSA &gt;20%, this&#xD;
      study represents an attempt to examine the impact of apremilast in routine clinical practice&#xD;
      settings in Greece on the patient with moderate plaque psoriasis when this therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy precedes biologics in the treatment algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the present study aims to generate novel real-world evidence on the effect of&#xD;
      apremilast treatment in biologic treatment naïve patients with moderate plaque psoriasis in&#xD;
      terms of the patients' HRQoL, patient-perceived benefits of therapy, treatment response rate,&#xD;
      and impact on nail, scalp and palmoplantar psoriatic involvement and severity of pruritus,&#xD;
      while concurrently assessing apremilast survival rate and cost per PASI-75 responder in the&#xD;
      routine clinical practice of Greece.&#xD;
