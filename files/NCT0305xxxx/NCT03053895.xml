      DECIDE (Bedside versus Operating Room Burr-Hole DrainagE of ChronIc SubDural HEmatoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CSDH is an abnormal collection of blood between the layers of the brain causing brain tissue&#xD;
      compression leading to neurological complications. One of the most common risk factors&#xD;
      contributing to CSDH is head trauma, which is usually in the form of a minor head injury.&#xD;
      Older individuals are at increased risk of CSDH due to brain atrophy that occurs with&#xD;
      advancing age as well as their tendency to fall and sustain minor head traumas. Chronic&#xD;
      alcoholics are also at increased risk as alcoholism also leads to brain atrophy, increased&#xD;
      risk of falls, and liver failure which results in increased bleeding risk. Also many drugs&#xD;
      used today like anticoagulants, antithrombotics, and antiplatelets for certain health&#xD;
      conditions are other common risk factors for CSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this multi-centered trial in the USA and Canada is to assess the surgical&#xD;
      management of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) and to demonstrate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      bedside drainage and its safety as it bypasses the perioperative risk associated with&#xD;
      anesthetic especially among the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult patients with a clear indication for CSDH drainage will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two procedures. One group will receive the twist drill procedure which can be performed at&#xD;
      the bedside. The second group will undergo the burr-hole drainage procedure in the operating&#xD;
      room usually under general anesthetic. Typically, the twist drill procedure can occur sooner&#xD;
      as the operating room and Anesthetist are not required. Reoccurrence of the CSDH will be&#xD;
      assessed over a period of 6 months following drainage. Timing of procedure, risk of&#xD;
      infection, adverse side effects and neurological functioning will also be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over a 3 year study period, 486 eligible patients (243 patients per arm) will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Patients &gt; 18 years with confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic CSDH will be provided one of the&#xD;
      two procedures and will be followed for study outcomes at 1, 3 and 6 months following the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be to compare the surgical procedures, assessing the recurrence rate of&#xD;
      CSDH within 6 months of initial CSDH drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this study is to standardize bedside drainage as the treatment of choice&#xD;
      for CSDH management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is important in the ongoing search for more efficient and safe intervention&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;

      DECIDE (Bedside versus Operating Room Burr-Hole DrainagE of ChronIc SubDural HEmatoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance: Chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) is an abnormal collection of&#xD;
      liquefied blood products between the dura and arachnoid membranes of the brain that may cause&#xD;
      brain tissue compression and subsequent neurological sequelae. One of the most common risk&#xD;
      factors contributing to CSDH is head trauma, which is usually in the form of a minor head&#xD;
      injury. Older individuals are at increased risk of CSDH due to brain atrophy that occurs with&#xD;
      advancing age as well as their tendency to fall and sustain minor head traumas. Chronic&#xD;
      alcoholics are also at increased risk as alcoholism leads to globalized brain atrophy,&#xD;
      increased risk of falls, and hepatogenic coagulopathy. Coagulopathies including the use of&#xD;
      anticoagulants, antithrombotics, and antiplatelets for certain health conditions are other&#xD;
      common risk factors for CSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims: The primary aim of our study is to conduct a high-quality randomized trial to&#xD;
      compare the safety and effectiveness of the bedside and operating room burr-hole drainage of&#xD;
      CSDH. The main objective of this study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of bedside&#xD;
      drainage and its safety as it bypasses the perioperative risk associated with anesthetic&#xD;
      especially among the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this study is to standardize bedside drainage as the treatment of choice&#xD;
      for CSDH management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy of bedside drainage compared to operating room&#xD;
      burr-hole evacuation for CSDH management by examining the hypothesis that bedside is&#xD;
      associated with lower recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To examine if the bedside drainage and the operating room burr-hole&#xD;
      drainage are efficacious in terms of functional outcomes. To evaluate the hypothesis that&#xD;
      bedside drainage is safer compared to the operating room burr-hole drainage by measuring&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design: Multi-centered pragmatic randomized controlled trial across North&#xD;
      America (USA and Canada) comparing bedside drainage with operating room burr-hole drainage of&#xD;
      CSDH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Over a 3 year study period, each patient will be followed for 6 months to measure&#xD;
      the study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study population will include 486 eligible patients &gt;18 years of age&#xD;
      with confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic CSDH (243 patients per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria: Patients aged &gt; 18 years presenting with symptomatic CSDH confirmed on&#xD;
      diagnostic imaging, who are able to provide informed consent or have a legal representatives&#xD;
      available if unable to do so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main intervention and comparator(s): Patients will be randomly assigned between the two arms&#xD;
      of the study, bedside and operating room burr-hole drainage. For patients randomized to&#xD;
      bedside drainage of CSDH, the twist-drill procedure will be conducted at the patient's&#xD;
      bedside using local anesthetic. For patients randomized to burr-hole drainage, the procedure&#xD;
      will be performed in the operating room under local or general anesthesia based on the&#xD;
      surgeon's and anesthesiologist's judgement of the clinical stability of the patient.&#xD;
      Randomization via www.randomize.net website will be stratified by center and by patient age&#xD;
      in variable unspecified block sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Post-Randomization: Patients randomized will be followed for study outcomes on days&#xD;
      1, 2, discharge, and months 1, 3 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome: The efficacy of comparative surgical procedures will be measured by the&#xD;
      recurrence rate of CSDH within 6 months of initial CSDH drainage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Functional Outcomes: Postoperative neurological and functional status of the&#xD;
      patients will be measured using the Markwalder Grading System (MGS), Glasgow Outcome Score&#xD;
      (GOS), and modified Rankin Scale (MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Safety Outcomes: The safety of both procedures will be measured in terms of&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity including surgical site infections, misplacement of postoperative&#xD;
      subdural drain, tension pneumocephalus, new intracranial hemorrhage, and other medical&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Sample size estimation is based on a Chi-squared two-sided test of the null&#xD;
      hypothesis that bedside drainage is not different from burr-hole drainage in reducing the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who experience a hematoma recurrence within 6 months of the drainage&#xD;
      procedure. Including for possible attrition rate of 10% a total of 486 patients (243 per arm)&#xD;
      will be required to detect a difference in recurrence rates of 7% or a risk ratio of 0.36&#xD;
      (11% in the burr-hole group and 4% in the bedside drainage group), with a power of 80% and a&#xD;
      level of significance set at alpha=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Analysis: Primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat and data analyst will be&#xD;
      blinded to participant allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analyses: Interim analyses will be conducted upon recruitment of 25% of the expected&#xD;
      sample size (122 patients) to assess recruitment rates, recurrence rates and safety outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is important in the ongoing search for more efficient and safe intervention&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
