  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy still constitutes the backbone of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) therapy,&#xD;
      particularly in the extensive disease (ED) stage (ED-SCLC). Despite the fact that a&#xD;
      substantial complete response rate could be achieved in SCLC patients receiving etoposide -&#xD;
      cisplatin doublet, cure remains the exception. Overall survival in patients receiving this&#xD;
      combination is 10 months and progression free survival 6.3 months. At time of progression two&#xD;
      options are hitherto accepted: reinduction of carboplatin - etoposide doublet or, for&#xD;
      patients unfit for reinduction, topotecan single-drug regimen. However, in both clinical&#xD;
      cases, median survival hardly achieves 33 weeks. Consistent data using anti - PDL1&#xD;
      (Programmed death-ligand 1) or anti PD1 (programmed cell death 1) antibodies suggest that&#xD;
      they are active as single drug regimens in many malignant diseases. Taking into account the&#xD;
      rich tumor infiltrating lymphocyte in pathological specimens of SCLC, we can hypothesize that&#xD;
      experimental use of ATEZOLIZUMAB (MPDL3280A) in patients is ethical pending that it&#xD;
      demonstrates activity in the second line setting.&#xD;
