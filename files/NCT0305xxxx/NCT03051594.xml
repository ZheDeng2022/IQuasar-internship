      II.1. Study setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study will be held in the Clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department, Faculty&#xD;
      of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. The researcher will bear ultimate&#xD;
      responsibility for all activities associated with the conduct of a research project including&#xD;
      recruitment of patients , explaining and performing the procedures to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.2. Variables of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 20 patients will participate in the study. Each patient will have 3 carious teeth.&#xD;
      Resulting in a total of 60 carious lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3. Trial Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3.a excavation protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three dentinal carious lesions will be chosen in this study and will be in the same patient.&#xD;
      The lesions will be classified using the International Caries Detection and Assessment System&#xD;
      (ICDAS-II). after air-drying the teeth using a triplex syringe ICDAS-II scores of the lesions&#xD;
      will be obtained. The chosen sites will be recorded as: Code 4, non-cavitated Lesion&#xD;
      extending into dentine seen as an undermining shadow; code 5, small cavitated lesion with&#xD;
      visible dentine: less than 50 % of surface; code 6, large cavitated lesion with visible&#xD;
      dentine: more than 50 % of surface. In all cases, dentine lesions were soft and wet&#xD;
      indicating an active lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using local anaesthesia and rubber dam, the operative field will disinfected with 1%&#xD;
      hypochlorite,and the dentine lesions should be exposed with a high-speed diamond bur by&#xD;
      removing covering enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the excavation dentine samples are collected for baseline bacteriological assessment .&#xD;
      Excavation will be carried out using new slow speed round burs and hand excavators. Special&#xD;
      consideration will be given to avoid pulpal exposures and over excavation. In order to avoid&#xD;
      this, hand excavators will be used for the final excavation stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3.b Clinical assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The excavation end point of one cavity will be determined using visual tactile method. The&#xD;
      two other cavities will be inspected with fluorescent camera or caries detector dye (CDD)&#xD;
      methods to determine excavation endpoint respectively. After excavation, dentine samples from&#xD;
      the three cavities will be collected using a sterile excavator for the bacteriological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.3.c Assessment of Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of carious and sound dentine will be collected with sterile excavators after caries&#xD;
      removal in the three groups. The dentine samples will be transferred to sterile box&#xD;
      containing a thioglycollate medium used as a carrier, then this sterile box will be kept in&#xD;
      an ice box and taken to the microbiology laboratory for processing, within an hour, by&#xD;
      another examiner who do not know the type of technique used for the inspection after the&#xD;
      caries excavation. Dentin sample weight will be calculated by measuring the difference&#xD;
      between the weight of the whole set (sterilized bottle, transporting medium, collected&#xD;
      dentine) and the previously determined weight of the set without dentin. The number of&#xD;
      bacteria obtained for a given amount of dentin will be used to estimate the number of&#xD;
      bacteria present in 1 mg dentin (CFU/mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.4. Participant timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be carried out at the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.5. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be conducted to assess the reliability of the fluorescence camera&#xD;
      and caries detection dye versus visual tactile method in caries excavation using&#xD;
      bacteriological assessment method. Based on the previous paper by Stroll et al.,2015 ,area&#xD;
      under the curve for fluorescent camera using bacterial count as reference was 0.75. Using&#xD;
      power 80% and 5% significance level, 20 cavities is needed in each group the sample size was&#xD;
      calculated by PASS 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.6. Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from outpatient clinic of Conservative Dentistry Department in&#xD;
      Faculty of Oral and Dental Medicine, Cairo University; from which eligible patients will be&#xD;
      recruited to fulfil the eligibility criteria according to participant timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.6.a. Recruitment Strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be subjected to full examination and diagnosis using dental charts. Once&#xD;
      the patients that are potentially eligible for this study are identified, they will be&#xD;
      contacted by the researcher who will explain the study and ascertains the patient's interest.&#xD;
      If interested, more detailed evaluations and preparations are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.7. Randomization and assignment of interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.7.a. Allocation sequence generation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allocation sequence will be generated using (www.randomization.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.7.b. Allocation concealment mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each recruited patient will be given a number according to order of recruitment following the&#xD;
      sequence of the randomly generated numbers, then the operator will start the first tooth to&#xD;
      be excavated, then will choose between three opaque sealed envelopes (two envelope for the&#xD;
      intervention and the other is for the control). envelopes will be allocated by a participant&#xD;
      who will not be involved in any of the phases of the clinical trial. The tooth to which&#xD;
      interventions or control is assigned to will be recorded and all records of all patients will&#xD;
      be kept with the main supervisor&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.7.c. Implementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant will generate the random allocation sequence. The researcher will enroll the&#xD;
      patients but an unbiased participant will assign the intervention/Control to respective&#xD;
      teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.8. Data collection methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Baseline data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;

      the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *Outcome data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were converted table to facilitate the description of the results. The&#xD;
      microbiological analysis was performed blindly in relation to the caries removal method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.9.Data management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      the data will be entered and stored on a personal computer. Double data entry will be saved&#xD;
      on an external hard disc to prevent loss of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.10. Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using IBM SPSS advanced statistics (Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences). Numerical data will be described as mean and standard deviation or median and&#xD;
      range. Data will be explored for normality using kolmogorov-smirnov test and Shapiro-Wilk&#xD;
      test. Comparisons between 3 groups for normally distributed numeric variables will be done&#xD;
      using the ANOVA while for non normally distributed numeric variables will be done by Kruskal&#xD;
      Wallis test. A p-value less than or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant. All tests will be two tailed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.11. Monitoring:&#xD;
