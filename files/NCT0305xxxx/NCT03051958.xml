  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD) is highly prevalent and leads to suffering for the individual,&#xD;
      increased risk of depressive symptoms and anxiety, and high societal costs. A few&#xD;
      psychological treatment have been tested for AD, but to our knowledge none of them have been&#xD;
      built on recently developed methods for optimizing exposure treatment. In addition, access to&#xD;
      psychological treatment is limited and there is a need for new methods that could be easily&#xD;
      disseminated. One possible solution to this problem is to deliver psychological treatment via&#xD;
      the Internet, which has been tested in more than 100 randomized trials with good results for&#xD;
      other clinical disorders than AD. The aim of this study was to test the effects of&#xD;
      Internet-delivered mindfulness and exposure treatment (I-MET) for AD in a randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial. We hypothesized that I-MET would lead to larger reductions of AD symptoms&#xD;
      as well as psychological symptoms compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), characterized by chronic itching and inflammation, is highly&#xD;
      prevalent and leads to suffering for the individual, increased risk of depressive symptoms&#xD;
      and anxiety, and high societal costs. Several behavioral factors are likely to play a role in&#xD;
      the exacerbating AD symptoms over time, not least scratching, which may lead to rupture in&#xD;
      the skin barrier and an increased risk of inflammation, which in turns increases AD symptoms.&#xD;
      AD is also associated with avoidance behaviors that may have negative longer-term effects.&#xD;
      With this in mind, psychological treatment based on exposure may be a logical method to&#xD;
      achieve improvements. A few psychological treatments have been tested for AD, but to our&#xD;
      knowledge none of them have been built on recently developed methods for optimizing exposure&#xD;
      treatment. In a recently conducted pilot study we showed that exposure treatment, in&#xD;
      combination with mindfulness training, can be associated with improvements for persons with&#xD;
      AD. One challenge regarding psychological treatment is that accessibility is limited and&#xD;
      there is a need for new methods that could be easily disseminated. One possible solution to&#xD;
      this problem is to deliver psychological treatment via the Internet, which has been tested in&#xD;
      more than 100 randomized trials with good results for other clinical disorders than AD.&#xD;
      Internet-based treatment can be described as a form of online bibliotherapy where the&#xD;
      individual is guided by a therapist who provides feedback on homework assignments. The aim of&#xD;
      this study was to test the effects of Internet-delivered mindfulness and exposure treatment&#xD;
      (I-MET) for AD in a randomized controlled trial. We hypothesized that I-MET would lead to&#xD;
      larger reductions of AD symptoms as well perceived stress, sleep problems, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, general anxiety, and improved self-rated health, compared to treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLARIFICATION REGARDING STUDY START DATE (remark made on March 15, 2021): This trial employed&#xD;
      one informed consent which was completed before the provision of screening data for the&#xD;
      purpose of assessing eligibility. The first date on which a participant provided informed&#xD;
      consent and screening data was Nov 27, 2016. The first date a participant was included in the&#xD;
      study, as based on the assessment of eligibility criteria in accordance with the study&#xD;
      protocol, was March 29, 2017. The latter date is considered to be the study start date, in&#xD;
      accordance with 81 FR 65022.&#xD;
