  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Both Ultrasound guided Adductor Canal Block ( ACB) and Femoral Nerve Block (FNB) has been&#xD;
      used to provide postoperative analgesia for knee surgeries. To the investigators' knowledge,&#xD;
      no comparison has been made between those blocks in relation to postoperative quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle strength, or duration and quality of postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic ACL&#xD;
      reconstruction in pediatrics. If ACB provides postoperative analgesia after arthroscopic knee&#xD;
      surgery comparable to FNB, it has the potential to improve the postoperative outcome as it&#xD;
      will lead to less quadriceps muscle weakness and early mobilization, both of which are very&#xD;
      important in the early postoperative period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Motor preservation with adequate analgesia has become the optimal postoperative goal in&#xD;
      orthopedic surgeries, in particular knee surgeries. This enables earlier physical therapy,&#xD;
      faster recovery and shorter hospital stays. Both Ultrasound guided ACB and FNB has been used&#xD;
      to provide postoperative analgesia for knee surgeries, including anterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
      reconstruction . To the investigators' knowledge, no comparison has been made between both&#xD;
      blocks in relation to postoperative quadriceps muscle strength as well as duration and&#xD;
      quality of postoperative analgesia for arthroscopic ACL reconstruction. ACB predominantly&#xD;
      block the sensory component of the femoral nerve without much effect on the motor component.&#xD;
      Hence, it can lead to less quadriceps muscle weakness, early postoperative mobilization and&#xD;
      decreases the incidence of postoperative fall . With the advent of ultrasonography, the&#xD;
      adductor canal can be easily visualized at the mid-thigh level, allowing performance of ACB&#xD;
      with a high success rate . In recent years, ACB has been successfully used for postoperative&#xD;
      pain control after knee surgery . Anatomical study of adductor canal demonstrated that the&#xD;
      adductor canal may serve as a conduit for more than just the saphenous nerve, possibly&#xD;
      including the vastus medialis nerve, medial femoral cutaneous nerve, articular branches from&#xD;
      the obturator nerve, as well as the medial retinacular nerve . Thus, the sensory change is&#xD;
      not limited to the distribution of the saphenous nerve but includes the medial and anterior&#xD;
      aspects of the knee from the superior pole of the patella to the proximal tibia.To the&#xD;
      investigators Knowledge there has not been a randomized controlled study comparing ACB with&#xD;
      FNB after Arthroscopic Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) reconstruction. This prospective,&#xD;
      double-blinded, randomized, controlled study will test the hypothesis that ACB would be&#xD;
      associated with less quadriceps motor weakness than FNB at 4 hours after block performance .&#xD;
      The investigators also hypothesize that ACB will provide analgesia to the anterior knee that&#xD;
      is not inferior to FNB and not different in opioids usage at 4 and 24 hours after Peripheral&#xD;
      Nerve Block (PNB) performance .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis ACB would be associated with less quadriceps motor weakness than FNB and&#xD;
           provide postoperative analgesia comparable to FNB in quality and duration as determined&#xD;
           by Numeric Scale (NS) pain scores and opioid use a 4 and 24 hours after PNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare FNB and ACB regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quadriceps muscle strength at 4 hours after PNB performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pain scores at anterior knee at 4 hours and 24 hours after PNB as assessed by Numeric&#xD;
           Scale (NS) pain scoring system. Also pain site other than the anterior knee will be&#xD;
           recorded and specified (posterior knee, calf, leg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Total opioid consumption at 4 and 24 hours after PNB.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized, double blinded, single center clinical trial. A total of 52 pediatric patients&#xD;
      (ASA 1or 2), aged between 8 to 18 years, for elective ACL reconstruction at Akron Children's&#xD;
      Hospital ( ACH ) will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two groups, A or B. Group A (26 patients) will have ultrasound guided ACB performed at&#xD;
      mid-thigh level and group B (26 patients) will have ultrasound guided FNB, with nerve&#xD;
      stimulator confirmation with the type of motor response (e.g., quadriceps, patellar) and the&#xD;
      minimum current needed to be recorded. Both blocks will be performed under general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Both group will have ropivacaine 0.2 % ( 0.5 ml/kg, maximum of 30 ml and&#xD;
      methylprednisolone acetate 1 mg/kg , maximum of 40 mg ).Both blocks will be performed using a&#xD;
      22-gauge 2-inch Stimuplex A needle; ; B. Braun Medical Inc., Melsungen, Germany).Both blocks&#xD;
      will be performed using linear ultrasound transducer, General Electric ( GE). Ultrasound&#xD;
      pictures will be obtained to Verify proper local anesthetic placement.Unfortunately, surgeons&#xD;
      are not able to determine the type of procedure needed to correct ACL injury, until after&#xD;
      knee arthroscopy is performed under general anesthesia. ACL reconstruction using a hamstring&#xD;
      graft, which is the surgical procedure used in this study may not always be possible to&#xD;
      perform by the surgeon. The surgical alternative of ACL reconstruction , is ACL repair, which&#xD;
      seldomely is done by our surgeon. Patient undergoing ACL reconstruction can experience pain&#xD;
      in the posterior aspect of the knee, in the distribution of the siatic nerve. This is due to&#xD;
      the hamstring graft. In contrast to the anterior knee pain covered by both ACB and FNB,&#xD;
      posterior knee pain is controlled with IV/oral analgesic. This is why recording the site of&#xD;
      the knee pain is important to determine the PNB success. . Due to the inability to determine&#xD;
      beforehand, the type of procedure to be performed, we decided therefore to continue the study&#xD;
      procedures and data collection on both ACL reconstruction and ACL repair. The statistical&#xD;
      analysis will include only patients that undergo ACL reconstruction. For the other patients&#xD;
      that undergo ACL repair , data will be collected but not included in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis. The data from these patients may be used as a pilot for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps strength of both legs will be assessed by placing the dynamometer on the anterior&#xD;
      of the ankle, between the malleoli. Patients will be instructed to extend their legs three&#xD;
      times each, with a 30 seconds pause between each attempt as described by Maffiuletti . The&#xD;
      assessment will be performed in the pre-operative period and will be repeated postoperatively&#xD;
      at 4 hours after PNB. All patients will be observed in the post-operative period by an&#xD;
      observer unaware of the technique of analgesia used. Pain will be assessed using the NS.&#xD;
      Postoperatively, PCA morphine pumps will be attached to patients. A loading dose of 0.05&#xD;
      mg/kg to a maximum of 5 mg will be administered in the Post Anesthesia Care unit (PACU) as&#xD;
      needed, followed by demand interval dosing of 0.015 mg/kg every 10 minutes.as demanded by the&#xD;
      patient .Four-hours limits for morphine will be set at 0.35 mg/kg. No continuous infusion and&#xD;
      no adjuvant NSAIDs or acetaminophen will be administered. Rescue morphine dosing will be&#xD;
      ordered via PCA pump at 0.05 mg/kg ( repeated once as needed) and will be available every two&#xD;
      hours as needed by pain assessment ( for a NS ≥ 4 ) or patient request. Diazepam 0.03 mg/kg&#xD;
      IV will be available every 4 to6 hours as needed for muscle spasm or anxiety. Patients will&#xD;
      be considered ready for discharge from hospital when all the following criteria are met:&#xD;
      Child is alert, oriented, stable vital signs, and would tolerate clear liquid, with no nausea&#xD;
      or vomiting and good pain control. The evaluation for meeting the discharge criteria will be&#xD;
      done after one hour from arrival in PACU and every 30 minutes thereafter till the patient&#xD;
      meet all the discharge criteria. After discharge, After discharge, parents will be instructed&#xD;
      to give the child oxycodone tablets/elixir 0.1 mg /kg PO q 3 hours as needed for pain. In&#xD;
      addition, acetaminophen 10mg/kg q 4 hours PRN up to a maximum of 3 gm and/or ibuprofen 10&#xD;
      mg/kg q 6 hours PRN up to maximum of 2400 mg/24 hours, may be administered for any residual&#xD;
      pain. The total dose of oxycodone, ibuprofen and tylenol will be recorded per parents for a&#xD;
      total of 24 hours after PNB. Pain scores will be also recorded by parent at rest,24 hours&#xD;
      post -block. The data for total opioids use in the first 24 hours after PNB and pain score at&#xD;
      24 hours will be collected from parent by phone call.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
           1-Quadriceps muscle strength at 4 after PNB 2- Total morphine/morphine equivalent at 4&#xD;
           and 24 hours after PNB. 3-Pain scores at anterior knee at 4 hours and 24 hours after PNB&#xD;
           as assessed by Numeric Scale (NS) pain scoring system. Also pain site other than the&#xD;
           anterior knee will be recorded and specified (posterior knee, calf, leg).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Regimen Random allocation for one of the two&#xD;
           treatments will be achieved using sealed envelope assigned by external third party not&#xD;
           involved in the study to ensure allocation concealment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Monitoring Plan This study will be monitored through a data monitoring committee.&#xD;
           The study will be performed over a period of 18-24 months. This study offers minimal&#xD;
           risk to the patient. The data monitoring committee will include the PI, at least one of&#xD;
           the co-investigators, the principal statistician, and the principal research nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data monitoring committee will meet when approximately 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the&#xD;
      primary outcomes are observed. The priority of the data monitoring committee will be to&#xD;
      ensure the safety of the participants in the trial and to ensure the integrity of the trial.&#xD;
      Also, these meetings will monitor the quality of the collected data to assess for weaknesses&#xD;
      and errors. If any weakness and/or errors are identified, feedback will be provided during&#xD;
      these meetings .The investigator(s) will allocate adequate time for such monitoring&#xD;
      activities. The investigator(s) will also ensure that the monitor or other compliance or&#xD;
      quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the above noted study-related documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Summary Statistics: Will be provided for all variables. Examination of continuous data will&#xD;
      include normality testing as well as assessment of potential outliers. Statistical testing&#xD;
      will be based upon distributional shape, but for purpose of analytical planning and sample&#xD;
      size analysis normality of distributions will be assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine for potential differences in quadriceps motor strength (QMS) between the two&#xD;
      groups (ACB, FNB) quadriceps strength will be assessed at the four hour time point (assuming&#xD;
      no evidence in sample of baseline or pre-operative differences). Non-inferiority of ACB to&#xD;
      FNB in analgesia provided will be assessed by examination of pain scores. Non-inferiority of&#xD;
      ACB compared with FNB is defined as the mean ACB - NRS pain score not higher than the mean&#xD;
      FNB - NRS pain score by an amount of 1.6. (Kim, 2014) Pain scores will be individually&#xD;
      examined at the 4 hour and 24 hour post - operative time points with appropriate Bonferroni&#xD;
      adjusted alpha. In addition, a change in pain score from 4 to 24 hours will be created and&#xD;
      evaluated for potential difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total opioid consumption as measured in morphine equivalents will be assessed at the 24 hour&#xD;
      post-operative time point to determine whether a difference exists. Opioid consumption will&#xD;
      also be examined by creating a change score from 4 to 24 hour consumption and comparing&#xD;
      between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All testing will be completed utilizing SAS 9.4 © software and evaluated at the Type I Error&#xD;
      Rate of alpha = 0.05 level for statistical significance unless otherwise noted.&#xD;

        <title>Quadriceps Muscle Strength in Kilogram-force (Kgf)</title>
        <description>Measuring the quadriceps muscle strength (surgical side) using a dynamometer.Patients were placed supine with a cushion underneath their knee, resulting in a 45-degree angle at the knee. A dynamometer was placed on the anterior of the ankle, between the malleoli. Patients were instructed to extend their legs three times each, with a 30-s pause between each attempt (Lafayette Manual Muscle Test System; Lafayette Instrument Company, Lafayette, IN; and all three dynamometer readings in Kgf unit for each leg were recorded.Kgf is a gravitational metric unit force ,it is equal to the magnitude of the force exerted on one kilogram of mass under standard gravity.</description>
