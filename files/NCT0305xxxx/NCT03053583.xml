    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare straight blades in obtaining best glottic view in&#xD;
      children. The investigators will compare size 1 Classical Miller, size 1 Wis-Hipple, and size&#xD;
      1 C-MAC straight blades in young children.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized, blinded study. The primary objective is to compare&#xD;
      straight blades in obtaining best glottic view in children. The secondary objectives will be&#xD;
      to determine the subjective ease of laryngoscopy and intubation, desaturation and&#xD;
      complications with each blade and to compare the view of the CMAC with a photo of the direct&#xD;
      view with the CMAC blade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will compare three different straight blades used in&#xD;
      pediatric anesthesia: Miller blade size 1, Wis-Hipple blade size 1, and C-MAC straight blade&#xD;
      size 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size was estimated in this equivalence study assuming an alpha two-tailed of 0.05,&#xD;
      beta of 0.2, proportion with a POGO score &gt; 80 with the Miller blade (based on the results of&#xD;
      our previous study) of 0.64 and an estimated proportion of 0.74 with the Wis-Hipple blade in&#xD;
      the present study. The hypothesized difference required to reject equivalence is ≥ 0.2. This&#xD;
      requires 29 children per group. To account for un-interpretable photos, we plan to enroll 10%&#xD;
      more or 32 children in each group giving a total of 96 children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ninety-six children who are eligible to participate will be randomized and allocated to one&#xD;
      of the three study groups after consent is obtained from the parents/ guardian during regular&#xD;
      anesthesia pre-operative evaluation. According to randomization children will be assigned to&#xD;
      one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A- Laryngoscopy by classical Miller blade, size 1 Group B- Laryngoscopy by Wis-Hipple&#xD;
      blade, size 1 Group C- Laryngoscopy by C-MAC Miller blade, size 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist will perform either direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy using the Classical Miller, Wis-Hipple or C-MAC blade or indirect laryngoscopy&#xD;
      using the C-MAC video straight blade. Photography of the best glottic view will be taken&#xD;
      during direct laryngoscopy and the image of best glottic view will be saved by C-MAC. At the&#xD;
      conclusion of the study, the photographs from all 96 patients will be converted such that the&#xD;
      quality of the images standardized using Adobe Photoshop will appear similar to two blinded&#xD;
      anesthesiologists who are also unaware of the study hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Procedure There will not be recruitment in advance. During the pre-anesthesia&#xD;
      assessment of the patients who need to undergo a surgery under general anesthesia they will&#xD;
      be screened for the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. The parents/ guardian&#xD;
      will be informed about the study, its objectives, purpose, risks and benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consenting Procedure The consent to participate in this study will be obtained from parents/&#xD;
      guardian during pre-anesthesia assessment of the child in the holding area. Privacy and&#xD;
      confidentiality will be assured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Procedure After obtaining consent each child will be assigned a random serial&#xD;
      number. Randomization will be prepared using random number table by a person not involved in&#xD;
      the study before the study begins. Accordingly the patient will be allocated to a study group&#xD;
      depending upon the matching number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Induction of General anesthesia ASA standard monitors will be applied prior to induction&#xD;
           of anesthesia. General anesthesia in all children will be induced by face mask using 70%&#xD;
           N20 in O2 and 8% Sevoflurane at fresh gas flow 8 L/min. After loss of eyelash reflex a&#xD;
           peripheral intravenous catheter will be placed. Propofol 2-3 mg/kg and Rocuronium 0.5&#xD;
           mg/kg will be given. After achievement of adequate anesthesia depth and preoxygenation&#xD;
           laryngoscopy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laryngoscopy and Photography The laryngoscopy technique will be chosen according to&#xD;
           randomization. In &quot;group A&quot; anesthesiologist will use size 1 classical Miller blade for&#xD;
           direct laryngoscopy. The blade will be placed under epiglottis and a photo will be taken&#xD;
           by a second anesthesiologist using a high-quality digital camera after obtaining best&#xD;
           glottic view. Then tracheal intubation will be performed. In &quot;group B&quot; size 1 Wis-Hipple&#xD;
           blade will be used for direct laryngoscopy in the same manner. In &quot;group C&quot; a size 1&#xD;
           C-MAC straight blade for indirect videolaryngoscopy will be used. The blade will also be&#xD;
           placed under the epiglottis and a photo of the direct view with the C-MAC will be taken.&#xD;
           In group C the second anesthesiologist will save the images of best glottic view on a SD&#xD;
           card in the C-MAC monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The oxygen saturation, blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded at the beginning&#xD;
           of laryngoscopy and at the completion of intubation. Time of laryngoscopy and intubation&#xD;
           will be recorded using a stopwatch. These data will be recorded by a second&#xD;
           anesthesiologist who will also be taking the photograph of the glottic opening. With&#xD;
           this technique the time to intubation will not be prolonged as a result of participating&#xD;
           in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Even though taking a photo of glottic opening during laryngoscopy is not a routine&#xD;
           practice we expect no significant delays in intubation or laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Computer Editing Adobe Photoshop editing of images will be performed after collecting&#xD;
           all data at conclusion of the study. The images will be cropped to present only the&#xD;
           glottic view without the blade. The image quality and color will be approximated to&#xD;
           ensure the images from the two different cameras (digital camera and C-MAC camera) will&#xD;
           be similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Image grading by POGO and Cormack- Lehane scale Two anesthesiologists who are not&#xD;
           involved in the study will be blinded to the study all together. They will review all&#xD;
           images after they are randomized and de-identified and grade the POGO score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjective evaluation of each blade There will be 4 anesthesiologists performing the&#xD;
           laryngoscopies. Each patient will undergo only one laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation&#xD;
           by one of the anesthesiologist. After the intubation, the anesthesiologist who performed&#xD;
           the laryngoscopy and intubation will rate the difficulty of laryngoscopy and intubation&#xD;
           on visual analogue scale 0-10 (0 representing very easy &amp; 10 very difficult&#xD;
           laryngoscopy/ intubation). This evaluation can be done at any time before the electronic&#xD;
           record is completed and will not interfere with patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Storage The investigator will use a specially designed data collection&#xD;
      sheet. General information, demographic data, vital signs and procedure data will be recorded&#xD;
      on this. The general information will include patient's hospital ID label, subject serial&#xD;
      number, subject randomization group, procedure date and time. The demographic data will&#xD;
      include gender, age, weight, height, ASA class, type of surgery. The procedure data section&#xD;
      will include the time from mask induction to IV medication administration, ease of&#xD;
      laryngoscopy, ease of intubation and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use either a C-MAC monitor or a free standing high definition photo&#xD;
      camera depending on the randomization group. Each photo will be saved on a SD memory card and&#xD;
      after procedure will be transferred to Principal Investigator's computer where it will be&#xD;
      saved under subjects serial number. At the completion of data collection of all 96 subjects&#xD;
      the images will be edited and presented to a blinded anesthesiologist who will score each&#xD;
      image by POGO and Cormack Lehane classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collection sheets will be kept by the principal investigator in a locked file in a&#xD;
      locked anesthesia office. The images will be stored in principal investigator's computer that&#xD;
      is password secured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored for 3 years after completion of the study by the primary investigator&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be treated according to HIPAA practice. All collected data for this study will&#xD;
      be de-identified for privacy protection. It will be stored using the unique study case number&#xD;
      only, with no direct patient identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis For the primary hypothesis of the study, the POGO scores from the Miller,&#xD;
      Wis-Hipple size 1 blades and the C-MAC lifting the epiglottis, will be compared using the&#xD;
      Kruskall Wallis test. For the secondary hypothesis, the POGO scores for the C-MAC 1 Miller&#xD;
      blade lifting the epiglottis will be compared with the photos of the larynx taken at the lips&#xD;
      using the Wilcoxon paired rank sum test. Data whose distribution deviate from normality&#xD;
      (based on the Kolmogorov Smirnov test) will be presented as medians and ranges and analyzed&#xD;
      using the above tests. Data that will be normally distributed will be presented as means and&#xD;
      standard deviations, and analyzed using Student's t test and one-way ANOVA (with the Scheffe&#xD;
      test) as appropriate. P &lt; 0.05 for two tails was accepted. Data will be analyzed on an&#xD;
      intention to treat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan The safety of research participants and integrity of the data&#xD;
      will be carefully monitored at multiple levels. The PI will be highly involved with all&#xD;
      aspects of the protocol and will assume ultimate responsibility for the safety and well-being&#xD;
      of research participants and the integrity of data collected. The PI will meet with each&#xD;
      member of the study staff to ensure that they are aware of all procedures and clarify any&#xD;
      questions they have about the protocol before initiation of the study. A record of the&#xD;
      training sessions will be kept in the study repository. Quality control and participant&#xD;
      safety will also be ensured via monthly supervision of research and clinical staff by PI.&#xD;
      During these meetings the research staff will discuss the status of the research project and&#xD;
      review the protocol, consents, any safety issues that have risen, and any additional issues&#xD;
      to ensure that any reportable information will receive immediate and appropriate action. Each&#xD;
      of these meetings will be documented in a log that is stored in the study repository.&#xD;
