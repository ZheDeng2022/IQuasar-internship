      Rationale and background: Since 2013, IB has been performing passive pharmacovigilance&#xD;
      activities related to TIV. Objetive: To implement an active surveillance study as part of our&#xD;
      pharmacovigilance plan while passive surveillance activities will continue. Pharmacovigilance&#xD;
      data on TIV, via active surveillance, is being implemented in response to WHO requirements&#xD;
      for pre-qualification of TIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective cohort study. Population: Target groups for vaccination&#xD;
      defined by The National Immunization Program of Brazil: children between six months and five&#xD;
      years old; pregnant women; postpartum women (mothers until 45 days after birth); healthcare&#xD;
      workers; and elderly (people over 60 years old). Study Size: A total of 900 individuals (300&#xD;
      health care workers, 300 elderly, 100 pregnant women, 100 post-partum women and 100 children&#xD;
      between six months and five years old), presenting for immunization with IB TIV, and who&#xD;
      agree to participate after providing Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses: Descriptive approaches will be used to meet the defined objectives described&#xD;
      in the protocol, as well as formal statistical tests when appropriate.&#xD;

      Primary objective: to characterize and estimate the incidence of solicited adverse events&#xD;
      following immunization (AEFI) associated with administration of the trivalent influenza&#xD;
      vaccine produced at Butantan Institute (TIV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: 1) to characterize and estimate the incidence of overall (solicited and&#xD;
      unsolicited) AEFI associated with administration of TIV; 2) to characterize and estimate the&#xD;
      incidence of unsolicited AEFI associated with administration of TIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective cohort study aimed at identifying and evaluating adverse&#xD;
      events following immunization among individuals vaccinated with TIV during the national&#xD;
      immunization campaign. The design will include active surveillance by phone contact and&#xD;
      through visits to the study site. Health facilities will be designated and set up as sentinel&#xD;
      sites to enroll individuals being vaccinated with IB TIV for active follow up of solicited&#xD;
      AEFI occurring within the first 14 days post-vaccination, and unsolicited AEFI up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population: The following groups are targeted groups for the national immunization campaign&#xD;
      and will be recruited for participation in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children between six months and five years old;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pregnant women; postpartum women (mothers until 45 days after birth);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  healthcare workers; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elderly (people over 60 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables: Solicited AEFI to be monitored will include local reactions (erythema, pain,&#xD;
      swelling, ecchymosis, pruritus and induration), systemic reactions (headache, fever, malaise,&#xD;
      arthralgia, myalgia, rash, chills, pruritus, fatigue, sweating) and irritability and&#xD;
      persistent crying (for children than 6 years). Unsolicited AEFI reported over the period up&#xD;
      to 6 weeks post-vaccination will be recorded. All adverse events reported in the study will&#xD;
      be MedDRA coded. Other variables of interest in the study are demographic information of&#xD;
      study participants: date of birth, gender, age, ethnicity, as well as vaccination information&#xD;
      including date of immunization, site, and vaccine lot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources: Study information including signs and symptoms following immunization with TIV&#xD;
      will be recorded daily for 14 days post immunization, and will be recorded in the&#xD;
      participant's study file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Size: A total of 900 individuals (300 health care workers, 300 elderly, 100 pregnant&#xD;
      women, 100 post-partum women and 100 children between six months and five years old),&#xD;
      presenting for immunization with IB TIV, and who agree to participate after providing&#xD;
      Informed Consent, will be enrolled in the study by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analyses: Descriptive approaches will be used to meet the defined objectives described&#xD;
      in the protocol, as well as formal statistical tests when appropriate. Incidence rates (IR)&#xD;
      of AEFI with TIV will be calculated as the number of events divided by the total number of&#xD;
      participants exposed to TIV in each of the targeted groups over the period of follow up. IR&#xD;
      will be calculated based on total person time of follow-up, 95% confidence intervals will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
