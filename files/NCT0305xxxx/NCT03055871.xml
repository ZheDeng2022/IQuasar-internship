  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine physical activity habit formation in parents and if&#xD;
      this can increase moderate to vigorous physical activity behavior in their children over six&#xD;
      months.The Primary Research Question is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the habit formation condition result in increased moderate-vigorous intensity physical&#xD;
      activity of the child compared to the control (education) and education + planning conditions&#xD;
      at six months? Hypothesis: Child physical activity will be higher for the habit formation&#xD;
      condition in comparison to the more standard physical activity education and planning&#xD;
      conditions at six months.&#xD;

      Secondary Research Questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Can group differences among behavioural outcomes be explained through a mediation model?&#xD;
           Hypothesis: The covariance of the assigned conditions (habit formation, planning +&#xD;
           education, education control) on child PA will be explained by parental co-activity&#xD;
           habit, and through the use of consistency and cues regulation strategies (i.e.,&#xD;
           manipulation check). The habit formation condition will not affect parental support&#xD;
           intentions or underlying outcome expectations (benefits of PA) for support of child PA&#xD;
           because its effect on behavior is to tie initial intentions to behavioural action or to&#xD;
           work independent of goals and intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do factors such as quality of life, parental competence, and family functioning improve&#xD;
           with increased PA? Hypothesis: Conditions that increase PA will show commensurate&#xD;
           increases in these factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is there an intergenerational, seasonal, or gender difference across primary outcomes by&#xD;
           assigned condition? Hypothesis: Parents in the habit formation condition will show&#xD;
           higher PA via the activities being performed with their children in comparison to the&#xD;
           other conditions. No differences in gender or season are hypothesized based on the&#xD;
           current research at present&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group package will consist of Canada's PA guidelines recommending 180 min per week for young children, transitioning to 60 minutes of activity a day for children at five and a breakdown of ways for the parent to help their child achieve this PA (unstructured, endurance, strength, activities) commensurate with this guide. The guide also contains arguments and information about the benefits of PA.</description>

    <description>The physical activity planning intervention condition will receive the same guidelines as the standard education control group but will also be provided with family physical activity planning material. This material will include workbook on how to plan for family physical activity; brainstorming exercise for children where they list physical activities that they have found fun in the past, as well as activities that they would find enjoyable to do as a family.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Habit formation intervention</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The habit formation intervention condition will receive the same content as the education control condition and the physical activity planning condition but with additional material on creating physical activity support habits. The material includes a brief discussion of what habits are with some very straightforward examples such as preparing for sleep routines, or initiating to drive a car to work. A key component of the habit section will be based on planning for context-dependent repetition, with pointers on how to maintain repetition as habit forms.</description>

    <description>In addition to the control content and the planning content, this intervention will include material provided to the family that assists with creating physical activity support habits. The material contains a discussion of what habits are, straightforward examples, planning and pointers for forming habits.

    <description>This arm will receive the control education content, but will also be provided with family PA planning material. This material will include skill training content (workbook on how to plan for family PA). The material includes a brainstorming exercise for parents where they list physical activities they think their children have found fun in the past, as well as activities that they would find enjoyable to do as a family. We also have Canadian parental survey data on the most preferred co-physical activities for children 3-6. We will provide this material as prompts/suggestions. This list helps create the template for PA planning by contextualizing what the parents would like to do with their kids.</description>
