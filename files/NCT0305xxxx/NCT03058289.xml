  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the intratumoral administration of escalating doses of a novel,&#xD;
      experimental drug, INT230-6. The study is being conducted in patients with several types of&#xD;
      refractory cancers including those at the surface of the skin (breast, squamous cell, head&#xD;
      and neck) and tumors within the body such (pancreatic, colon, liver, lung, etc.). Sponsor&#xD;
      also plans to test INT230-6 in combination with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      INT230-6 is comprised of a 3 agents in a fixed ratio - a cell permeation enhancer and two,&#xD;
      potent anti-cancer payloads (cisplatin and vinblastine sulfate). The penetration enhancer&#xD;
      facilitates dispersion of the two drugs throughout injected tumors and enables increased&#xD;
      diffusion into cancer cells. (Nonclinical safety studies showed no findings following drug&#xD;
      injection into healthy tissues.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically physicians administer the two active drugs comprising INT230-6 by intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) infusion to achieve a systemic blood level at the limit of tolerability. The objective&#xD;
      is destroy both visible tumors and unseen circulating cancer cells (micro-metastases).&#xD;
      Unfortunately, dosing drugs IV delivers only a small amount with a low concentration at the&#xD;
      tumor site. This approach especially for late stage cancers is not highly effective and often&#xD;
      quite toxic to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts at direct intratumoral injection with chemotherapeutic agents have not shown the&#xD;
      ability to treat the injected tumor, non-injected tumors or micro-metastases. This lack of&#xD;
      efficacy for local administration is due possibly to poor dispersion and a lack of cell&#xD;
      uptake of the agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the use of the novel cell penetration enhancing agent INT230-6 treatment demonstrates&#xD;
      strong efficacy in animals having large tumors. The Sponsor's in vivo, non-clinical data&#xD;
      shows that INT230-6 thoroughly saturates and kills injected tumors. In addition, the drug&#xD;
      induces an adaptive (T-cell mediated) immune response that attacks not only the injected&#xD;
      tumor, but non-injected tumors and unseen micro-metastases. Cured animals become permanently&#xD;
      immunized against the type of cancer that INT230-6 eliminates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial IT-01 seeks to determine the safety and potential efficacy of dosing INT230-6&#xD;
      directly into several different types of cancers. In addition animal studies showed a strong&#xD;
      synergy of INT230-6 with immune modulation agents. Thus as part of study IT-01 the Sponsor&#xD;
      seeks to understand the safety and efficacy of INT230-6 when administered in combination with&#xD;
      immuno-therapeutic agents such as antibodies that target Programmed Cell Death (PD-1 or&#xD;
      anti-PD-1) and Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Associated Protein 4 (CTLA-4 or anti-CTLA-4) receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to understand whether tumor regression can be achieved and patient outcomes&#xD;
      improved.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There were 6 cohorts in the escalation portion of the protocol. Five dosed INT230-6 alone and one was combined with pembrolizumab. Cohorts A and B1 treated superficial tumors at a 1:4 ratio of drug to tumor with a low tumor load once per month. Cohort EA was similar to cohort A with INT230-6 every 2 weeks. Cohort EC escalated the total and maximal dose per any one tumor to a ratio of 1:2 &amp; dosed every two weeks. Cohort EC2 explored a drug load ratio of 1:3 and escalated the dose per tumor further. Cohort DEC combined INT230-6 with a fixed amount of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
On-going, non-escalation cohorts include 1) monotherapy INT230-6 cohort (EC3) dosed every two weeks 2) INT230-6 in a combination with pembrolizumab (DEC2) and 3) INT230-6 in combination with ipilimumab (FEC). Other specific regimens or combinations of INT230-6 may be designated by the Study Steering Committee.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to assess the safety and tolerability of single and multiple intratumoral doses of INT230-6 in subjects with advanced or recurrent malignancies. This will be assessed by the rate of ≥ grade 3 AE's attributed to INT230-6 and not the underlying disease.&#xD;
All recorded adverse events will be listed and tabulated by system organ class, preferred term, and dose and coded according to the most current version of MedDRA. The incidence of adverse events will be tabulated and reviewed for potential significance and clinical importance.&#xD;
Adverse Events will be summarized for all reported data and by study period: a) up to and including 28 days post last dose of initial treatment, and b) from first dose of re-initiation of treatment, for subjects who re-initiate study therapy while in follow-up, up to 28 days post-dose of the last re-treatment dose.</description>

             progression has been demonstrated in such lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects must have a minimum of one injectable lesion as determined by the&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Prior systemic radiation therapy (either IV, intrahepatic or oral) completed at least&#xD;
             4 weeks prior to study drug administration; (for ipilimumab combination please see&#xD;

             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. No prior primary or metastatic brain or meningeal tumors unless clinically and&#xD;
             radiographically stable as well as off steroid therapy for at least 2 months.&#xD;
