    <textblock>
      Otologic surgery often involves a mastoidectomy to safely access the inner ear. In this&#xD;
      procedure, a portion of the mastoid part of the temporal bone is removed. The surgery is&#xD;
      lengthy and challenging because many critical structures are embedded in the mastoid and are&#xD;
      difficult to identify and accurately remove with a surgical drill. In previous work, the&#xD;
      investigators developed a compact, bone-attached robot to automate mastoidectomy drilling for&#xD;
      translabyrinthine acoustic neuroma removal (TANR). The robot does not attach directly to the&#xD;
      bone. Instead, a rigid surgical fixture which the investigators call a prepositioning frame&#xD;
      (PPF) is attached to the temporal bone, and the robot attaches to the PPF. Attaching the&#xD;
      robot to the participant eliminates the need for an expensive image guidance system to&#xD;
      compensate for participant motion, but requires a compact robot with a limited range of&#xD;
      motion. The PPF supports the robot on the head such that a planned mastoidectomy volume is&#xD;
      within the robot's range of motion. In this study, the investigators plan to test the PPF by&#xD;
      attaching it to ten participants. By processing an intraoperative CT scan of the attached&#xD;
      PPF, the investigators will measure the percentage of each planned mastoidectomy that would&#xD;
      be reachable if the robot were attached. The investigators will also measure the time&#xD;
      required to attach the PPF. The data the investigators acquire will enable further&#xD;
      improvements to the PPF design, which would be advantageous before proceeding to robotic&#xD;
      drilling experiments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mastoidectomy is a common otologic surgical procedure in which all or part of the mastoid&#xD;
      portion of the temporal bone is removed with a surgical drill. The procedure is performed to&#xD;
      treat diseases and infections such as mastoiditis and cholesteatoma, and is also performed as&#xD;
      one step of other surgeries, such as the facial recess approach for cochlear implantation&#xD;
      (CI) or the translabyrinthine approach for acoustic neuroma removal (TANR). The investigators&#xD;
      are working on a new medical device to assist specifically with the TANR procedure. The focus&#xD;
      of this study is one component of this device, the pre-positioning frame (PPF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TANR surgery is performed to remove benign tumors on the auditory nerve which can cause&#xD;
      severe hearing and balance problems if not removed. The current standard of care is a&#xD;
      mastoidectomy, followed by a labyrinthectomy (excision of the labyrinth of the inner ear) to&#xD;
      gain access to the skull base, specifically the internal auditory canal (IAC), where tumors&#xD;
      are located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several critical anatomical structures are embedded in the mastoid bone, including the facial&#xD;
      nerve, which controls motion of the face, large blood vessels such as the carotid artery and&#xD;
      intracranial continuation of the jugular vein, and the tegmen, which is the boundary between&#xD;
      the mastoid and the brain. Surgeons are specially trained to recognize and avoid these&#xD;
      structures when drilling. Drilling for TANR surgery often takes several hours due to slow&#xD;
      advancement of the drill through hard bone in the labyrinth region. After this drilling is&#xD;
      when the most delicate and critical portion of the surgery begins i.e. removal of the&#xD;
      acoustic neuroma. The investigators hypothesize that a robot, guided by pre-operative images,&#xD;
      can perform the drilling for TANR surgery while preserving safe margins around the critical&#xD;
      structures thus enabling surgeons to focus on the delicate, final stage of TANR surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several robotic systems available for orthopedic drilling procedures such as joint&#xD;
      arthroplasty and resurfacing. These systems include the RIO System (Stryker Mako, Ft.&#xD;
      Lauderdale, FL, USA), the ROBODOC Surgical System (Think Surgical Corp., Fremont, CA, USA)&#xD;
      and the CASPAR (URS Ortho GMBH &amp; Co. KG, Rastatt, Germany). However, these systems have not&#xD;
      been shown accurate enough to perform TANR surgery safely, and rely on expensive image&#xD;
      guidance systems to continuously track the patient's position relative to the robot, in order&#xD;
      to ensure that the robot-guided drill stays within safe margins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators previously designed a small light-weight robot that can be attached to the&#xD;
      bone of a patient's head, and provide the required accuracy for TANR surgery without an&#xD;
      expensive image guidance system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reach an entire mastoidectomy volume for TANR surgery, our robot must be correctly&#xD;
      positioned relative to a patient's temporal bone anatomy. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      a rigid fixture, which the investigators call a pre-positioning frame (PPF), can correctly&#xD;
      position our robot to complete drilling for TANR surgery on the patient population. The goal&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the first step in implementing this system by attaching a PPF&#xD;
      to a patient who is undergoing a standard TANR surgery in order to better understand the time&#xD;
      it takes to do this step and optimize the surgical workflow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PPF, attaches directly to the participants head behind the ear, using bone screws adapted&#xD;
      from cranial reconstruction hardware. These bone screws are typically used in this area of&#xD;
      the skull and placed at a similar penetration depth of 3.5 mm. The safety margin from tip of&#xD;
      the screw to the inside skull surface will be 0.25mm In a future study, the robot would then&#xD;
      attach to fiducial markers on the top surface of the PPF. Our current PPF design incorporates&#xD;
      data from ten robotic drilling experiments. Six trials were performed on excised temporal&#xD;
      bones, and four were performed on full cadaver heads. Using results from these experiments,&#xD;
      the investigators improved the shape of the PPF to optimally reach the range of planned TANR&#xD;
      mastoidectomy volumes, and also improved the legs of the PPF to facilitate rapid and secure&#xD;
      implantation of bone screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgical workflow the investigators plan for a full robotic mastoidectomy will be&#xD;
      described here for context, but to be clear, steps 7, 8, and 10 will not be performed in the&#xD;
      proposed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to surgery, a surgeon manually segments a mastoidectomy volume in a preoperative&#xD;
           CT image using investigational software created for this purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During surgery, the PPF is anchored to the temporal bone with self-drilling bone screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. An intraoperative CT scan is acquired of the participants's head with the PPF attached&#xD;
           using a portable CT scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The intraoperative CT image is registered to the preoperative CT and the pre-operative&#xD;
           segmentations are transformed to the intraoperative CT using the registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Fiducial markers on the PPF are localized in the intraoperative CT image, allowing the&#xD;
           pre-operative segmentation data to be transformed to the intraoperative CT image space.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Robot motion is automatically planned using investigational mastoidectomy planning&#xD;
           software.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. (The robot is fastened to the fiducial markers on the PPF, and is activated to execute&#xD;
           the drill trajectory. The surgeon retains supervisory control over the robot and can&#xD;
           stop or alter its speed if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. (The robot is removed from the PPF following completion of drilling).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The PPF is removed from the participant by loosening the bone screws.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. (The surgeon completes the manual surgical actions that follow mastoidectomy drilling,&#xD;
           such as removal of IAC tumors.) The investigators plan to clinically validate the&#xD;
           improved PPF design by performing the steps above (excluding steps 7, 8, and 10) on ten&#xD;
           participants. Note that the PPF will be removed directly after step 5 when the CT image&#xD;
           has been registered. Using previously developed robotic mastoidectomy planning software&#xD;
           (step 6), the investigators will calculate the percentage of each TANR mastoidectomy&#xD;
           that is reachable for an attached PPF configuration. Step 6 will be done once the images&#xD;
           have been collected and will not impact the clinical procedure.&#xD;
