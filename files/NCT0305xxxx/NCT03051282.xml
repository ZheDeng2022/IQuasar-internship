  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are among the most frequently prescribed&#xD;
      medications worldwide for the treatment of essential hypertension, left ventricular systolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, acute myocardial infarction, and prevention of the progression of diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy. However, the outcome of ACEI treatment varies significantly between individuals&#xD;
      and selected populations. Suboptimal response, therapeutic failure, and significant side&#xD;
      effects are commonly documented in patients receiving ACEI therapy. Approximately 80% of the&#xD;
      ACEIs available for use in the US are synthesized as esterified prodrugs in order to improve&#xD;
      otherwise poor oral bioavailability of the active molecule. The activation of ACEI prodrugs&#xD;
      primarily occurs in the liver via metabolic de-esterification of the parent drug. The&#xD;
      critical activation step is essential in delivering a successful therapeutic outcome since&#xD;
      the active metabolites are approximately 10-1000 times more potent relative to their&#xD;
      respective parent compounds. Carboxylesterase 1 (CES1), the most abundant hydrolase in the&#xD;
      liver, is responsible for the activation of ACEI prodrugs in humans. Marked interindividual&#xD;
      variability in CES1 expression and activity has been documented, which results in varied&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of many drugs serving as substrates of CES1. Genetic&#xD;
      variation of CES1 is considered to be a major factor contributing to variability in CES1&#xD;
      function. The study team proposes to conduct a multiple-dose healthy volunteer study to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of CES1 genetic variation on the activation, pharmacokinetics, and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of enalapril, a model ACEI prodrug activated by CES1. The completion of this&#xD;
      study will represent a major step towards the establishment of an evidence base from which a&#xD;
      more individualized use of ACEI prodrugs can emerge.&#xD;
