  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to look for predisposing mutations in patients and relatives&#xD;
      affected by AML and MDS with familial history of myeloid or, less frequently, lymphoid&#xD;
      malignancies. Taking advantage of a next generation sequencing (NGS) platform, screening for&#xD;
      known and unknown mutations potentially associated with the disease will be done. The&#xD;
      screening will be performed on affected and unaffected family members, in order to outline&#xD;
      new pedigrees that either validate previous findings or constitute novel discoveries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a diagnosis of AML or MDS with at least one relative affected by AL/MDS or,&#xD;
      secondly, lymphoproliferative disorders, will be enrolled into the study, and will be&#xD;
      referred to as the index case. The analysis will be performed both retrospectively and&#xD;
      prospectively. A gene panel deep sequencing (GPDS) of the tumor DNA from peripheral blood of&#xD;
      the index case at diagnosis will be performed in order to identify mutations in a number of&#xD;
      genes known to be associated to myeloid malignancies, mainly: ASXL1, BCOR, NRAS, TP53, RUNX1,&#xD;
      CEBPA, FLT3, EZH2, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, DNMT3A, TET2, CBL, KRAS, ETV6, SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1,&#xD;
      ZRSR2, GATA2, TERT, TERC, SRP72, and ANKRD26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case none of the known mutations is found by the GPDS, whole exome sequencing (WES) will&#xD;
      be performed as second step on the tumor cells of the index case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When one or multiple somatic mutations are found, a Sanger Sequencing (SS) on germline DNA&#xD;
      from epithelial buccal cells of the index cases and affected relatives will be performed for&#xD;
      the screening of the same somatic leukemic mutations on germline DNA. If the index case and&#xD;
      affected relatives share the same mutations on the germline, the same germline mutations will&#xD;
      be checked by SS in the unaffected family members.&#xD;

      Tumor DNA of index case will be extracted from 10 ml of PB collected at diagnosis in EDTA&#xD;
      tubes. Mononuclear cells from PB (PBMC)will be separated and isolated by Ficoll gradient.&#xD;
      Tumor DNA will be extracted possibly soon after the isolation. Tumor DNA of affected&#xD;
      relative/-s will be extracted from PBMC isolated at diagnosis, or during the patients&#xD;
      monitoring, and stored at -80°C. Tumor DNA previously extracted and stored at -20°C may be&#xD;
      used in event of no PB or bone marrow sample available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Germline DNA of index case and relatives will be extracted by buccal epithelial cells&#xD;
