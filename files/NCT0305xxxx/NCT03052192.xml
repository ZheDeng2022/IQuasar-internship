    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will investigate and characterize acute medical patients in&#xD;
      order to optimize patient courses in the acute care departments, especially with regard to&#xD;
      polypharmacy and undernourishment. In addition, the investigators will investigate underlying&#xD;
      immunological mechanisms of chronic inflammation and biological aging in this population to&#xD;
      improve the current knowledge and possibilities for preventing chronic diseases and acute&#xD;
      hospitalization.&#xD;

      Malnutrition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnutrition among elderly is associated with frailty, including loss of weight, muscle mass,&#xD;
      function and quality of life and also with an increased number of hospital admissions. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators aim to describe the development of and the risk factors for&#xD;
      malnutrition from admission to 4 weeks after discharge, in addition the investigators wish to&#xD;
      characterize the inflammatory state of the malnourished patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inappropriate polypharmacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad variation among elderly in health, number of chronic diseases, organ function,&#xD;
      biological age and function makes the prescription of drugs to this population a very complex&#xD;
      task with a high risk of inappropriate medication. 5-30% of all non-elective admissions are&#xD;
      caused by inappropriate medications, and many of these are preventable. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate the feasibility of a pharmacist-geriatrician medication&#xD;
      review in the acute care department and the effect on the Medication Appropriateness Index&#xD;
      score (MAI-score) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation and biological aging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation and biological aging promote the development of age-related chronic&#xD;
      diseases. There is a large variation in the rate of aging between individuals, in particular&#xD;
      among the elderly. This means that the chronological age of a person often does not reflect&#xD;
      its true state of aging, the biological age. This challenges the ability to provide&#xD;
      appropriate care and to predict responses to treatment and interventions in elderly patients.&#xD;
      The underlying causes and mechanisms of biological aging and chronic inflammation are not&#xD;
      well understood. There are currently no validated methods for measuring biological age and no&#xD;
      measures of chronic inflammation which can be used in an acute setting. Here, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to test a novel model for chronic inflammation and investigate the role of&#xD;
      the NLRP3 inflammasome, NFkB (nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells)&#xD;
      and miRNAs in biological aging and chronic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is prospective with 3 groups of study participants: one group is included in the&#xD;
      Acute Medical Department and two healthy control groups (one young and one older). The&#xD;
      follow-up comprises two predefined examinations and any readmissions at our hospital.&#xD;
      Furthermore, participants are followed in the national registries.&#xD;

    <description>≥65 years. Acutely admitted medical patients.&#xD;
Included consecutively at admission to the Acute Medical Department at Amager and Hvidovre Hospital and Rigshospitalet - Glostrup.&#xD;
Follow-up at 4 weeks and 56 weeks after discharge and at any readmissions in the study period.&#xD;
Participants are interviewed on physical, mental and nutritional status, tested for functional and cognitive status, and have anthropometry, biochemistry, blood pressure, and immune activity measured. Participants are followed in national registries for information on diagnoses, hospital admissions, health care services used, and mortality.&#xD;
If a patient uses ≥5 prescribed drugs before hospitalization, a medication review will be performed by a clinical pharmacist and a geriatrician.&#xD;
Sample size calculations were performed for each primary outcome, and the final sample size was based on the calculation for the eating validation scheme which resulted in the largest sample size.</description>
