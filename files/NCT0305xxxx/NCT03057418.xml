    <textblock>
      This is an open-label study of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      Auriхim multiple doses in patients with recurrent/ refractory В-cell, CD20-positive&#xD;
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma of low tumor grade or with follicular lymphoma, as well as in patients&#xD;
      non-treated before for В-cell, CD20-positive non-Hodgkin lymphoma of low tumor grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out in 4-6 Russian and Belarussian sites. The study will be&#xD;
      consisted of screening period, induction (obligatory) phase and supporting (non-obligatory)&#xD;
      phase of the investigational therapy and post-treatment follow-up period.&#xD;
