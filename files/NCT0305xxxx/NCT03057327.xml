  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a pilot and feasibility study designed to develop materials to enhance&#xD;
      early detection of melanomas among women at risk to develop melanoma due to indoor tanning,&#xD;
      having a family history of melanoma or a personal history of melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that women, who are engaged in health promotion by having&#xD;
      mammograms, will be able to assess the personal relevance of skin self-examination (SSE), be&#xD;
      interested in learning about SSE and able to implement SSE while they are partially disrobed&#xD;
      in the privacy of the changing room in the mammogram facility.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After patients complete the mammogram, they return to the changing room and put on their&#xD;
      clothing. After exiting the changing room in the Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center of&#xD;
      Northwestern Medicine/Prentice Women's Hospital and as they are preparing to leave, a&#xD;
      research assistant (RA) will screen potential participants to acquire a randomly selected&#xD;
      convenience sample of eligible participants (n=200). The first 100 eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      asked if they regularly check their moles for concerning features. If the response is yes,&#xD;
      then they will be asked if they have found concerning moles and what they did next. Verbal&#xD;
      assent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the SSE materials will be placed into the changing rooms and the next 100 eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be surveyed. The women, who found the information relevant, will be asked if&#xD;
      they chose to check their skin while in the changing room. The skin location checked and use&#xD;
      of the SSE kit will be ascertained. Women will be asked if they think they have a concerning&#xD;
      mole. If the woman does not find a concerning mole, she will be asked if she intends to check&#xD;
      her skin again. In addition, she will be asked if she intends to check the skin of family&#xD;
      members. Women will be invited to take a brochure to help implement SSE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening questions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During your visit for mammography, did you notice any information about checking your&#xD;
           skin for melanoma?&#xD;
&#xD;
           ___Yes __ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Did you think this applied to you? ___Yes __ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If no, why not? (open ended)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If yes, why? (open ended)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Did you check your skin? (If no, please proceed to question #8)&#xD;
&#xD;
           ___Yes __ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If yes, did you notice any concerning moles?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Yes __ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. If yes, may we contact you by telephone or email in 2 weeks to see if you have made an&#xD;
           appointment to see a dermatologist?&#xD;
&#xD;
           ___Yes __ No If yes, which way do you prefer to be contacted?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phone _________________________(Number) Email _________________________ (Address)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. If no, will you consider checking your skin in the future?&#xD;
&#xD;
           ___Yes __ No&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. If yes, may we contact you by telephone or email in 2 weeks to see if you have checked&#xD;
           your skin for any concerning moles?&#xD;
&#xD;
           ___Yes __ No If yes, which way do you prefer to be contacted?&#xD;
&#xD;
           Phone _________________________(Number) Email _________________________ (Address)&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. If you found any concerning moles, did you make an appointment to see a dermatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Yes __ No&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RA will record the responses. Women who checked their skin ,either today or in about 2&#xD;
      weeks, will be invited to participate in a survey about skin location(s) checked, use of the&#xD;
      SSE kit, and their decision about the spot on the skin.&#xD;
