  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HCV infection is one of the most prevalent etiologies for liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. HCV is highly heterogeneous, with seven confirmed major genotypes. Each genotype&#xD;
      displays a different geographic distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since different HCV genotypes react differently on available antiviral therapies, the correct&#xD;
      identification of HCV genotype serves as a marker of responsiveness and an indicator for&#xD;
      duration of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recombinant HCV genotype 2k/1b was first described in Saint Petersburg in 2002.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sequencing strategy led to the detection of HCV genotype 2k/1b. However, clinical&#xD;
      laboratories often use the VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay for routine HCV genotyping. This&#xD;
      assay may potentially misclassify these HCV strains as genotype 2a/2c. Based on these&#xD;
      findings, the number of patients with 2k/1b may be underestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AbbVie's IFN-free regimen for the treatment of chronic HCV genotype 1b infection includes 3&#xD;
      DAAs with distinct mechanisms of action and non-overlapping resistance pattern to target HCV&#xD;
      proteins essential for viral replication. The high efficacy of the 3D regimen was proven in&#xD;
      registration clinical trials and RW for 1b population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3D regimen has not been evaluated for patients with HCV genotype 2K/1B. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Evaluate the efficacy of ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir and dasabuvir (3D) in an&#xD;
      interferon-free treatment regimen as assessed by SVR in adult patients with HCV 2k/1b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      .The study will include 1 group. Patients with HCV GT 2k1b will be treated according to label&#xD;
      recommendation as for GT1b (with and without cirrhosis) for 12 weeks. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Dasabuvir. Subjects will be assessed for&#xD;
      antiviral response, clinical outcomes, patient reported adverse events and presence and&#xD;
      emergence of resistance associated variants. Subjects will be followed for up to 12 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment and extra 24 weeks of follow up. Scheduled visits will include: physician&#xD;
      assessment and blood tests including HCV resistance mutations.&#xD;

      Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial screening period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV GT2K/1B -infected subjects who will be meeting eligibility criteria, will provide written&#xD;
      informed consent, perform baseline RAS testing and will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 0, all patients will be assessed by a general physical examination, blood and urine&#xD;
      tests including HCV resistance mutations (elaborated in the budget file), Fibroscan or SHEAR&#xD;
      WAVE Elastography and abdominal ultrasound. After the initial assessment all included will be&#xD;
      allocated for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study configuration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 1 group of patients infected GT 2k1b. Patients will be treated&#xD;
      according to label recommendation for GT1b (with and without cirrhosis) for 12 weeks. All&#xD;
      subjects will receive Ombitasvir/Paritaprevir/Ritonavir and Dasabuvir. Scheduled visits will&#xD;
      take place in 0, 4, 12 and 24 weeks for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visits will include: physician assessment and blood tests as elaborated in the Study&#xD;
      Flowchart. Subjects will be assessed for antiviral response, clinical outcomes, patient&#xD;
      reported adverse events and presence and emergence of resistance associated variants.&#xD;
