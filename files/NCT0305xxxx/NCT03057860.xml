  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 60% of all patients with AD are adults. However, the prevalence and incidence is&#xD;
      significantly higher in childhood and adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some children, adolescents and adults with moderate-to-severe AD cannot be sufficiently&#xD;
      controlled with topical treatments alone and require intermittent or continuous treatment&#xD;
      with systemic immunomodulating agents or UV-therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systematic reviews indicate that although several different interventions for&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe AD have been studied in clinical trials, strong recommendations are only&#xD;
      possible for Dupilumab in adults and the short-term use of cyclosporin A (CSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical treatment of patients suffering from AE is diverse and frequently not in line&#xD;
      with the current guidelines (for example S2-guideline in Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large head-to-head trials are missing so that long-term effectiveness of systemic&#xD;
      interventions for moderate-to-severe AD is speculative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this situation, clinical registries can provide valuable information for evidence-based&#xD;
      clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension of TREATgermany to children and adolescents is necessary as&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  moderate-to-severe AD is frequent in this age group, but the effectiveness of existing&#xD;
           topical and systemic agents in the routine care setting on clinical severity,&#xD;
           patient-reported outcomes, and the course of AD and associated atopic and non-atopic&#xD;
           comorbidities over time is still poorly understood&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  it is unclear how many children and adolescents cannot be effectively controlled with&#xD;
           the avoidance of trigger factors, patient education, and topical anti-inflammatory&#xD;
           treatment alone&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  innovative agents will become available for these age groups within the next years and&#xD;
           reference data will be necessary to evaluate their effectiveness and indication criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adequate evidence regarding patient needs in children and adolescents with&#xD;
           moderate-to-severe AD is urgently needed to provide value-based healthcare for this&#xD;
           vulnerable patient group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best-practice models of transition from adolescent to adult care of patients with&#xD;
           moderate-to-severe AD do not exist yet, but constitute a prerequisite for the&#xD;
           establishment of efficient patient care&#xD;

      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study related intervention will be performed. Included patients will be prospectively&#xD;
      followed for at least 24 months. A maximum duration of follow-up is not intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the observation period standardized study visits are performed to prospectively&#xD;
      document patient characteristics, clinical data, patient-reported outcomes, physician's&#xD;
      reasons for treatment decisions, and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study visit is scheduled at patient inclusion (baseline-visit; V1). The second and&#xD;
      third study visits are scheduled 3 and 6 months after baseline, respectively. (V2 after 3&#xD;
      months, V3 after 6 months). Thereafter, study visits are scheduled after 3 months (if a new&#xD;
      systemic treatment was initiated) or after 6 months (in case no new systemic treatment was&#xD;
      prescribed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a subset of patients biosamples for molecular analyses including blood, swabs and stool&#xD;
      will be taken at baseline and at V6, as well as skin biopsies prior to and 3 months after&#xD;
      systemic therapy initiation. This optional module requires separate patient information and&#xD;
      informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective electronic documentation of disease course and severity, medical care and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical treatment of AD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pseudomized data will be stored at the registry center (Center for Evidence-based Healthcare,&#xD;
      Dresden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study assessments include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A short physician report form to document patient history and clinical parameters such&#xD;
           as the objective severity of clinical signs, affected body regions, physician's global&#xD;
           assessment of disease severity, course of disease and medical treatment of AD including&#xD;
           adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A patient report form to assess important subjective parameters, patient reported&#xD;
           outcomes such as symptoms, quality of life, treatment satisfaction, patient's assessment&#xD;
           of global disease severity, totally/partial well-controlled weeks.&#xD;
