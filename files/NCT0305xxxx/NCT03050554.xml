  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether avelumab has an effect on cancer and body in&#xD;
      combination with SBRT, a standard treatment for early stage non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is considered experimental because it is not approved by the United States (U.S.)&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cancer. It is a type of drug called a&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody (a type of protein). Monoclonal antibodies are made to recognize, target&#xD;
      and bind to specific proteins on the cells that make up your tissues. Avelumab is designed to&#xD;
      block the interaction between PD-1, a known immune checkpoint, and PD-L1. By blocking this&#xD;
      interaction, the immune system may be stimulated, allowing it to more effectively recognize&#xD;
      and attack the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) is a type of radiation that uses precise targeting&#xD;
      to deliver a high dose of radiation to the tumor over a short period of time. A positioning&#xD;
      cushion such as Vac-lok will be used during radiation treatment that is custom made. This&#xD;
      custom mold forms to the contours of the subjects body to allow for proper positioning&#xD;
      comfort and stability.&#xD;

      This is a single arm open label Phase I/II study that will consist of two parts. In Phase I,&#xD;
      investigators will assess the safety and tolerability of SBRT combined with Avelumab. In&#xD;
      Phase II, investigators will determine whether SBRT combined with Avelumab improves relapse&#xD;
      free survival. Subjects with Stage I NSCLC who are not undergoing surgical resection will be&#xD;
      candidates for enrollment. Subjects will receive definitive stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      (SBRT) in 4-5 fractions combined with concurrent and adjuvant Avelumab at 10mg/kg for a total&#xD;
      of 6 cycles. Subjects will be evaluated for safety as measured by the occurrence of adverse&#xD;
      events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Three blood draws will be&#xD;
      obtained to analyze anti-tumor immune responses and immune correlates.&#xD;
