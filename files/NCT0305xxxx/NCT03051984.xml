    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement, or arthroplasty, is the final clinical intervention available to&#xD;
      relieve pain and functional limitations related to advanced stage knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;
      Despite its beneficial effects, the early post-surgical period is characterized by the&#xD;
      erosion of lower extremity muscle size and strength that cause further disability and slow&#xD;
      functional recovery. While the detrimental effects of this period on muscle are widely&#xD;
      recognized, the mechanisms underlying these adaptations are poorly understood and there are&#xD;
      currently no widely-accepted clinical interventions to counter them&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is currently the most common elective surgery in the US and&#xD;
      will increase in frequency nearly five-fold by 2030 to 3.5 million surgeries annually. This&#xD;
      surgery is most prevalent among older adults with advanced knee osteoarthritis (OA) and its&#xD;
      increase is explained primarily by growth in this population. Although TKA reliably reduces&#xD;
      joint pain, it fails to correct objectively-measured functional disability due, in part, to&#xD;
      dramatic declines in lower-extremity neuromuscular function during the early, postsurgical&#xD;
      period. These deficits are never fully remediated, remaining for years after surgery and&#xD;
      contributing to persistent disability. Despite these detrimental effects of TKA, the&#xD;
      fundamental skeletal muscle adaptations that occur in the early, post-surgical period are&#xD;
      poorly defined and understudied and there is currently no widely-accepted, evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention to counter these changes. To address this clinical problem, the investigators&#xD;
      goals in this application are to define the skeletal muscle structural and functional&#xD;
      adaptations following TKA at the whole body, tissue, cellular, organellar and molecular&#xD;
      levels in humans in an effort to identify factors contributing to functional disability and&#xD;
      to assess the utility of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to counter post-surgical&#xD;
      muscle adaptations at these same anatomic levels. We hypothesize that TKA fails to remediate&#xD;
      physical disability in patients, in part, because of the profound skeletal muscle myofilament&#xD;
      and mitochondrial loss and dysfunction that develops during the early, post-surgical period.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators posit that NMES will improve functional recovery following TKA by&#xD;
      countering these early skeletal muscle adaptations. To test this model, the investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate participants with knee OA prior to and following TKA for skeletal muscle&#xD;
      structure and function at multiple anatomic levels, with patients randomized to receive NMES&#xD;
      or sham control intervention during the first 5 weeks post-surgery.&#xD;

    <description>NMES will be conducted on the quadriceps of the operative leg using a portable stimulation device, starting within 48-72 hrs of surgery. The operative leg will be immobilized at a neutral angle (~30º), with electrodes affixed to the anterior surface of the thigh. Symmetrical, biphasic pulses (400 µs duration at 50 Hz) will be used, with a duty cycle of 25% (10 s on, 30 s off), with patient-selected stimulation intensity to cause visible contractions below pain threshold. NMES sessions will occur 5 d/week, twice daily for 45 min (5 min warm-up) for 5 wks.</description>
