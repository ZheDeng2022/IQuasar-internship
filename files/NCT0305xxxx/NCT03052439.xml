  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is the most common gastrointestinal disease, affecting 12% of&#xD;
      the US population and up to 20% of the population worldwide. This is a condition that is&#xD;
      diagnosed based on specific symptoms of altered bowel habits and abdominal pain, as well as&#xD;
      the exclusion of select other GI diseases. IBS not only causes constipation, diarrhea,&#xD;
      abdominal cramping, and bloating, it also significantly affects quality of life, overall&#xD;
      functioning, and work productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cause of IBS is likely multifactorial, which makes it a difficult disease to treat.&#xD;
      However, patients often associate their IBS symptoms with eating a meal. Up to 90% of IBS&#xD;
      patients restrict their diet to prevent or improve their symptoms, and patients are&#xD;
      increasingly interested in more holistic approaches to disease management. At present, the&#xD;
      most persuasive evidence that dietary changes can treat IBS supports a diet low in&#xD;
      fermentable carbohydrates (the low FODMAP (fermentable oligo, di, and monosaccharides and&#xD;
      polyols) diet). This diet, which is low in certain carbohydrates, has been shown to improve&#xD;
      IBS symptoms (particularly abdominal pain and bloating), but can be difficult to follow and&#xD;
      quite restrictive. In addition, this diet is not meant to be used as a maintenance diet;&#xD;
      patients undergo an elimination phase followed by a reintroduction phase of specific&#xD;
      carbohydrate groups as they monitor their symptoms. From the results of our proposed study,&#xD;
      the study team hopes to arrive at a modified, less -restrictive version of the low FODMAP&#xD;
      diet that is equally effective, and also create a standard protocol that patients can use&#xD;
      during this reintroduction phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with IBS will be recruited into a 13-week trial that would help determine the&#xD;
      optimal way in which high FODMAP foods should be introduced. After consent, patients would&#xD;
      start on a low FODMAP diet for 14 days, and if their symptoms improve, they would be invited&#xD;
      to continue in the study. For 7 days prior to the reintroduction of individual FODMAPs,&#xD;
      patients will ingest 1daily servings of a low FODMAP nutrition drink to validate the low&#xD;
      FODMAP content of this dietary supplement. If patients do not experience a flare of symptoms&#xD;
      with the supplement, they enter the reintroduction period. During this period, subjects would&#xD;
      introduce different groups of FODMAPs in a blinded fashion while remaining on an otherwise&#xD;
      low FODMAP diet while monitoring their IBS symptoms. At the end of the study period, subjects&#xD;
      would be informed of the FODMAPs to which they were sensitive and would meet with a&#xD;
      dietitian. At the completion of the study, the investigators would compile the data and&#xD;
      determine which FODMAPs were mostly likely to exacerbate IBS symptoms, thus providing the&#xD;
      construct for a modified low FODMAP diet, or &quot;low FODMAP-Light.&quot; It is hoped that this&#xD;
      modified, less restrictive version of the low FODMAP diet would be equally effective for the&#xD;
      majority of IBS patients.&#xD;

      Research Plan Design: Blinded FODMAP reintroduction study Duration of study: 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible IBS patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 (-2 weeks): After providing written informed consent, baseline and descriptive data&#xD;
      will be obtained including age, sex, race, pertinent medical history, prior IBS treatments,&#xD;
      vital signs, weight, use of concurrent medications and supplements, duration of symptoms, and&#xD;
      baseline symptoms. The investigators will also collect blood, stool and urine for a series of&#xD;
      separately funded translational studies assessing immune activation, permeability, and&#xD;
      microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this visit, patients will enter a two-week screening period during which severity of&#xD;
      symptoms will be assessed. Eligible patients will rate their average daily abdominal&#xD;
      pain/discomfort as a 4 or higher on an 11 point numerical rating scale (NRS) (0-no pain,&#xD;
      10-intolerable pain) and IBS subtype of constipation-predominant, diarrhea- predominant, or&#xD;
      mixed bowel habits (by Rome IV criteria19). Patients with an indeterminate subtype will be&#xD;
      excluded. Patients will record symptoms (Table 1) daily using a web-based survey instrument.&#xD;
      Experience from previous diet trials suggests that approximately 50% of participants will not&#xD;
      fulfill these inclusion criteria after the screening period, and will be termed screen&#xD;
      failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (weeks 0-2): IBS patients who fulfill the entry criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the remainder of the trial. Instruction from an experienced research dietitian&#xD;
      pertaining to the low FODMAP diet will be administered to all participants in an open-label&#xD;
      fashion for 2 weeks. Patients are to continue to record symptoms daily. Our previous work has&#xD;
      demonstrated that abdominal pain and bloating are the most responsive symptoms to the low&#xD;
      FODMAP diet. As such, the primary measure for this study will be improvement in abdominal&#xD;
      pain with improvement in bloating as a key secondary endpoint. If a subject experiences a&#xD;
      ≥30% reduction in abdominal pain during the 2-week low FODMAP intervention compared to&#xD;
      baseline, they will be invited to participate in the blinded, FODMAP reintroduction phase&#xD;
      (below). If this ≥30% reduction is not obtained, this period of open-label low FODMAP diet&#xD;
      will be extended an additional 2 weeks to ascertain if their symptoms improve to qualify for&#xD;
      continuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard dietary compliance measures used in the counseling environment are to include&#xD;
      prospectively recorded 3-day food diaries before and after the open label period. Body weight&#xD;
      over the course of the study will also be followed. Food diaries will be analyzed for&#xD;
      compliance via the Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) computer program, measuring&#xD;
      fructose, lactose, sucrose, pectins, sorbitol, and added sugars. Blood, stool and urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected for translational studies (separately funded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 2: If a ≥30% reduction in abdominal pain is obtained from the low FODMAP diet, subjects&#xD;
      will be eligible to continue in the study during which they will remain on a full FODMAP&#xD;
      elimination diet. For 7 days (week 2-3) prior to the reintroduction of individual FODMAPs,&#xD;
      subjects will ingest 1 daily servings of a low FODMAP nutrition drink (Pronourish, 170&#xD;
      calories each, Nestlé S.A., Vevey, Switzerland) to validate the low FODMAP content of this&#xD;
      dietary supplement. Daily symptoms will be measured as above. If a participant does not&#xD;
      experience a flare of symptoms with the supplement, they will continue onto the&#xD;
      reintroduction phase. If the participant does experience a flare in symptoms, they will&#xD;
      discontinue the product for 1 week before continuing in to the next phase (reintroduction&#xD;
      phase) of the study. The supplement will be supplied with an unbranded label. Adverse events&#xD;
      will be monitored during weeks 2-3 and significant adverse events (discontinuation of the&#xD;
      supplement, worsening of GI symptoms back to baseline) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (weeks 3-13): FODMAP reintroduction (lactose, fructose, fructans, polyols, galactans)&#xD;
      will be achieved by providing subjects with similar appearing and similar tasting snacks&#xD;
      which will contain specific types of supplemental FODMAPs prepared by research dieticians at&#xD;
      MCRU. The study team will ask the participants to continue on their low FODMAP diet during&#xD;
      this reintroduction phase, with the addition of 1-2 supplemental low FODMAP drinks per day&#xD;
      for convenience. The re-introduction of FODMAP containing foods will be conducted in a&#xD;
      double-blind fashion where both subjects and investigators will be unaware of the type of&#xD;
      FODMAP being reintroduced. The study dietitians will remain un-blinded to the subjects'&#xD;
      FODMAP treatment since they will be responsible for preparing and providing the FODMAP&#xD;
      containing supplement to the subjects. For the first 7 days of the re-introduction phase,&#xD;
      subjects will receive a FODMAP containing food item; this treatment will be followed by a&#xD;
      7-day wash out period during which subjects will receive a similar food or supplement that&#xD;
      does not contain the targeted FODMAP. The daily dose of fermentable carbohydrate contained in&#xD;
      the study food or supplement will be administered in 2 doses (moderate for the first 3 days&#xD;
      and higher amount for the later 4 days of the 7 day reintroduction period), with the content&#xD;
      similar to that found in the typical American diet (internal data from healthy study&#xD;
      subjects, published data18,20). To determine optimal dosing, the study team will conduct a&#xD;
      careful systematic review and interviews with experienced dieticians and GIs to determine the&#xD;
      optimal dose to each FODMAP with which to challenge. The order in which each specific FODMAP&#xD;
      is tested will be randomized to minimize the chances of an order effect. Throughout the study&#xD;
      period, symptom data will continue to be recorded on a daily basis (Table 1). If a subject is&#xD;
      unable to tolerate any portion of the reintroduction phase, they will discontinue&#xD;
      reintroduction of that specific FODMAP and revert again to a low FODMAP diet for washout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Final study visit (13 weeks). Subjects will be unblinded as to which FODMAP&#xD;
      components exacerbated symptoms, if any. This information will be disseminated to study&#xD;
      participants by our dietitians immediately after their completion of the study period. The&#xD;
      primary investigators remain blinded to this information through analysis of data. A&#xD;
      three-day food diary will be obtained to ensure ongoing compliance with the low FODMAP diet.&#xD;
      Serum samples for immune activation, stool for microbiome analysis, urine for metabolome&#xD;
      analysis will be collected at Visit 2 and 3 and analyzed with funding from alternate sources.&#xD;
      Body weight will again be assessed.&#xD;
