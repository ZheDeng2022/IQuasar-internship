  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The prevalence of Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is on the rise the world over. About&#xD;
      30% of DM patients suffer from Depression. Depression in DM patients is associated with&#xD;
      adverse outcomes including poor medication adherence, poor glycaemic control, and early&#xD;
      death. In resource constrained sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) clinics where patient volumes are&#xD;
      high and staff shortages rife, peer support has been suggested as a means of delivering&#xD;
      psychosocial care for persons with chronic illnesses in order to improve patient's outcomes.&#xD;
      However, little has been done to examine the efficacy of peer support on clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project aims: The main study objective will be developing a peer support model of depression&#xD;
      care for patients with DM and testing its efficacy on clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will employ both qualitative and quantitative measures. First, the&#xD;
      investigators will present the peer support model to health workers within the DM clinic, and&#xD;
      ask them about the feasibility of using such a model for DM patients with depression. The&#xD;
      investigators will then identify 10 DM patients with major depression and initiate them on&#xD;
      antidepressants. Once the patients are in clinical remission, the investigators will&#xD;
      interview them to assess their perceptions about the feasibility of using peer support for DM&#xD;
      patients newly diagnosed with depression. The investigators will also interview health care&#xD;
      workers and hospital administrators to assess their perception about using peer support&#xD;
      within the clinics, and potential barriers that need to be addressed before implementation of&#xD;
      the model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the data from the qualitative interviews, the investigators will refine and adapt&#xD;
      the peer support model, and then train 10 DM patients who have received antidepressants and&#xD;
      are in clinical remission to deliver peer support to newly diagnosed patients with&#xD;
      depression. Newly diagnosed depressed patients will be randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      antidepressants plus peer support (n=65) or antidepressants alone (n=65). Study participants&#xD;
      will be followed for 48 weeks and assessed for, glycaemic control, depression severity,&#xD;
      mental illness stigma, depression treatment uptake and adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Result: the investigators anticipate that the findings about the efficacy of peer support on&#xD;
      DM and depression outcomes will be useful in generating data about effect sizes necessary for&#xD;
      calculating a sample size for a cluster randomized trial (CRT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Methods: This will be a pragmatic randomized control trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio&#xD;
      between cases and controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: This project will be implemented at the DM clinic of Nsambya Hospital in&#xD;
      Kampala City. The clinic, which is staffed by three nurses, a medical officer and a&#xD;
      specialist physician, is open once a week. The nurses provide most of the DM care including&#xD;
      eliciting symptoms, providing medication refills, as well as referring complicated cases to&#xD;
      the medical officer (MO) and specialist physician. The medical officer and specialist&#xD;
      physician manage referrals and complications of DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of depressed patients to participate in a peer support feasibility study: In&#xD;
      the first four weeks of the study, all clinic attendees will be screened for depression by a&#xD;
      trained lay health care worker(TLHW) using the PHQ-2 at triage. Screen positive cases&#xD;
      (PHQ-2≥3) will be sent to the MO who will conduct a depression diagnostic interview using the&#xD;
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) till 10 depressed patients are&#xD;
      identified. All depressed patients will be initiated on either Imipramine 75mg/day or&#xD;
      Fluoxetine 20mg/day, and then reassessed at week 4 and week 6 for side effects and symptom&#xD;
      remission using the Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducting qualitative interviews to assess feasibility of peer support: When the 10 patients&#xD;
      are in remission (˜ 6-8 weeks) the investigators will conduct qualitative interviews with&#xD;
      them, hospital administrators (n=2), and medical personel at the DM clinic (n=5). During the&#xD;
      interview, the investigators will assess the participant's perceptions about the feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of engaging experienced DM patients to provide peer support to patients&#xD;
      newly diagnosed with depression. Informed consent will be sought from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview procedure: Dr Elialilia Okello will conduct the qualitative interviews. The&#xD;
      participants will be asked about whom in the DM clinic would be a suitable candidate to&#xD;
      provide peer support to newly diagnosed depressed patients. The peer support model will be&#xD;
      presented to participants so that they can internalize/appreciate the concept, Interview&#xD;
      guide: The interviews will be based on a guide with detailed standard probes to ensure that&#xD;
      key questions are addressed, and to allow comparisons across individuals and categories of&#xD;
      respondents. Questions will be open-ended to allow not only the exploration of new leads but&#xD;
      also generation of rich narratives. All interviews will be tape recorded, translated in&#xD;
      English (in cases where Luganda, the local language is used) and transcribed verbatim.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative data analysis: Data will be explored to identify key themes and relationships&#xD;
      between themes and analyzed using Atlas.ti. The results from the qualitative interviews will&#xD;
      help the investigators refine the peer support model before using it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the depressed patients are in full clinical remission, the investigators will ask&#xD;
      clinic staff to nominate from among them atleast 5 potential candidates to become peer&#xD;
      support buddies. This number should be adequate for the investigators to pilot test atleast 5&#xD;
      interview groups for the peer support process. Self-nominations will also be encouraged after&#xD;
      the patients on treatment are made aware of the eligibility criteria. The eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be patients who are; (a) at least 18 years of age; (b) speak Luganda; (c)&#xD;
      registered at the clinic for at least 6 months; (d) successful adherer, defined by staff as&#xD;
      one who consistently keeps appointments and self-reports being able to adhere to treatment;&#xD;
      (e) not currently suffering from any physical or co-morbid mental illness, or using&#xD;
      substances of abuse ; (f) socially skilled as defined (albeit subjectively) by staff; (g),&#xD;
      and have received antidepressants for at least 10 weeks (and in clinical remission for at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks). The investigators will screen more clinic attendees to identify potential&#xD;
      buddies if the number identified using the method above is less than 5. Patients who are&#xD;
      depressed and are ineligible to become peer support buddies will be followed up for the&#xD;
      duration of the study as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Buddy training: A 2-day training workshop of the peer support &quot;buddies&quot; will be conducted by&#xD;
      the PI using the buddy training manual developed by Simoni. The workshop will include&#xD;
      didactic content, and role-plays. Buddies will be taught strategies geared to address the&#xD;
      four components of peer support (self-care, adherence, stigma, and social support). Buddies&#xD;
      will meet in a group for supervision with the PI to seek for clarity in areas that were&#xD;
      missed out earlier before they can be assigned newly diagnosed patients. Once trained, the&#xD;
      buddies will be assigned no more than 5 patient peers at any one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Content of peer support training: Buddies will be taught to strive toward the following goals&#xD;
      with their assigned peers: (a) explain the purpose of the contacts as educational and&#xD;
      supportive, aimed at helping the peer to adhere to both antidepressants and hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      medications; (b) learn the peer's regimen and make suggestions on how to follow it, borrowing&#xD;
      from their own experiences; (c) encourage peers to follow treatment regimens by praising them&#xD;
      for adherence and by expressing confidence in their ability to adhere; (d) allow the peer to&#xD;
      express worry, anxiety, and concerns so these can be dealt with, (e) be warm and friendly,&#xD;
      (f) and refer frequently to themselves and their success with their own regimen to present a&#xD;
      guide or model which the peer can follow. The peers and buddies will use the above goals to&#xD;
      set achievable targets for each meeting. Buddies will be specifically instructed not to give&#xD;
      any medical advice to the peers, but rather encourage the peers to discuss with their&#xD;
      clinicians any questions of a medical nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and power calculation for the peer support study objective: The sample size for&#xD;
      the RCT component of the study was calculated to compare the primary outcomes as measured by&#xD;
      HbA1c ≤ 7 and HAM-D ≤7 between the intervention and control arms at 48 weeks after initiation&#xD;
      of antidepressant treatment. To calculate our sample size, the investigators used findings&#xD;
      from an RCT by Safren et al,[61]. Using the standard deviations of the means from this study&#xD;
      [61], the investigators estimated that 65 patients per arm (intervention vs. control) are&#xD;
      required to have 80% chance to detect, as significant at the 5% level, a 1.4 [SD = 2] mean&#xD;
      difference in the HbA1c levels and HAM-D depression scores, taking into account a 20% loss to&#xD;
      follow-up at 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer support process: Participants in the intervention arm will receive peer support every&#xD;
      two weeks for 12 weeks, then monthly 'booster' sessions at weeks 16, 20, 24 and 28 after&#xD;
      commencing treatment. However, the results from our qualitative interviews will guide the&#xD;
      investigators about the feasibility of the number of meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer support will be provided to a group of patients rather than a one-to one session. A&#xD;
      number of barriers (transport availability, distance from the clinic, work schedules) may&#xD;
      make it difficult to pre-determine when the meetings will take place, but the investigators&#xD;
      will ensure that the inclusion criteria for peers into the program includes their willingness&#xD;
      to attend all sessions. Buddies will keep ongoing records of all their contacts with their&#xD;
      peer clients as an assessment of the integrity of the intervention across buddies, across&#xD;
      peers, and over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring fidelity and supervision: In the first 4 weeks of implementation of the peer&#xD;
      support intervention (17 weeks into the study), all sessions will be audio recorded to assess&#xD;
      adherence to manual guidelines. The PI will then listen to the recordings, and then advise&#xD;
      the buddies accordingly. The peers will complete an anonymous evaluation questionnaire&#xD;
      following the first two sessions; information from these questionnaires will be used to&#xD;
      improve the quality of peer support. A buddy log will be designed to capture the following&#xD;
      information; a) which days the meetings occurred, b) duration of the meeting, c) members&#xD;
      present, d) issues discussed, and e) any challenges encountered. The investigators will have&#xD;
      a master's degree clinical psychologist sit in these meetings and also collect this data from&#xD;
      each of the buddies at the end of the meeting, and relay this data to the PI. Over the entire&#xD;
      duration of the intervention, the PI will also attend the sessions on a rotator basis; the PI&#xD;
      will have the chance of attending sessions from each of the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants from both arms will be followed up for 48 weeks after initiation on&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment. The patients in both arms will be reviewed by the MO at weeks 2 and&#xD;
      4 to address any challenges due to side effects, which are critical in preventing early&#xD;
      discontinuation of treatment. At each visit, the research assistant will use the HAM-D to&#xD;
      assess depression symptom severity, and the standardized side effect screening instrument the&#xD;
      antidepressant side effect check-list (ASEC) [63] to assess tolerance to medications and any&#xD;
      side effects. The HbA1c test will be performed at baseline, week 24 and 48. At these visits,&#xD;
      the research assistant will also collect data from the participants. Research data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline, then weeks 12, 24, and 48 after initiation of patients into treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data analysis: A trial profile shall be used to detail recruitment and follow-up&#xD;
      of patients. Analyses will be conducted to compare the groups at baseline, weeks 12, 24, and&#xD;
      48 to assess short- and long-term effects of the peer support intervention. The investigators&#xD;
      shall analyze the data using the intention-to-treat approach. The dependent variables (HbA1c&#xD;
      and HAM-D) will be presented as continuous variables. Predictor outcomes including adherence,&#xD;
      mental illness stigma levels, social support and self-care will be presented as continuous&#xD;
      and categorical variables. Baseline characteristics of the intervention and control arms will&#xD;
      be compared at the 5% level to assess if successful randomization was achieved. Students&#xD;
      t-tests (if continuous and normally distributed), Mann-Whitney U-test (if continuous but&#xD;
      non-normally distributed), and Chi-squared tests (categorical) will be used. Data on&#xD;
      potential confounders and effect modifiers, including variables that fail to achieve&#xD;
      successful randomization (e.g. sociodemographic parameters) shall be used to control for&#xD;
      confounding and effect modification. The investigators shall conduct both within-subjects&#xD;
      (time) and between-subject (group) analyses. Between-subject analysis at 48 weeks will be&#xD;
      used to assess the direct effect of the intervention by determining if there is a significant&#xD;
      difference between the mean HAM-D and HbA1c scores in the intervention and control arms.&#xD;
      Within-subject analysis will be performed among patients in the intervention arm by applying&#xD;
      the Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) method on repeated measures data. To examine the&#xD;
      role of social support and mental health stigma as mediating factors in the relationship&#xD;
      between depression and both treatment adherence and levels of glycaemic control outcomes,&#xD;
      three simple regression analyses each between i) the predictor (social support and mental&#xD;
      illness stigma) and outcome (HbA1c and HAM-D scores), ii) predictor and mediator, and iii)&#xD;
      mediator and outcome, will be conducted followed by a multiple regression analysis.&#xD;
