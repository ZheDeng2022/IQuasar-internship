  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Real-world adherence to inhaled and oral therapies for cystic fibrosis (CF) patients remains&#xD;
      discouragingly low, ranging between 31-53% for inhaled antibiotics and 41-72% for hypertonic&#xD;
      saline. Programs to enhance adherence, including comprehensive behavioral interventions with&#xD;
      adolescents, have met with mixed success. Advances in therapy, treatment delivery systems,&#xD;
      and data capture technology offer the potential for enhancing adherence by providing&#xD;
      immediate and more frequent feedback to the patient regarding his or her fidelity to the&#xD;
      prescribed treatment regimen. The investigators propose to evaluate a systematic yet&#xD;
      technically simple approach to linking treatment and feedback components to enhance adherence&#xD;
      in a real-work CF clinic setting that treats a significant minority patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first trial assessing the impact of a collaborative active intervention program&#xD;
      of a multi disciplinary team in improving adherence to specific chronic medications and&#xD;
      improving clinical outcomes in CF patients. The PI has implemented the texting service&#xD;
      (Caremessage.org) with COPD and diabetes patients. The content will be modified to provide&#xD;
      both English and Spanish language content relevant to these participants and their standard&#xD;
      treatment protocols.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an interactive mobile health information&#xD;
      service in supporting clinic staff (i.e., nurse practitioners, case managers and care&#xD;
      coordinators) at a Cystic Fibrosis Center clinic to connect with patients and create&#xD;
      conversations around behavior-centered goals. The interactive mobile health information&#xD;
      service has been designed to supplement the standard of care by supporting&#xD;
      patient-empowerment strategies through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  educating participants,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  encouraging behavior change, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  promoting adherence with their treatment protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will adapt the iCAN program content as an educational tool to be incorporated in&#xD;
      the educational material. iCAN is an electronic platform aimed to provide an engaging&#xD;
      environment for diabetic outpatients to self-manage, gain control over their health, and&#xD;
      ultimately adhere to their medical appointments and regimen. Similar to diabetes, CF is an&#xD;
      all-encompassing chronic disease that requires coordinated efforts among patients,&#xD;
      caregivers, and health-care providers across treatment adherence, nutrition, lifestyle&#xD;
      choices, and social support systems. Central to the mobile health information service is the&#xD;
      interactive and personalized text-based message system that delivers actionable and tailored&#xD;
      health content to participants: office visit appointment reminders; medication adherence&#xD;
      reminders; and general health education messages. While a number of technically sophisticated&#xD;
      applications exist, our approach will involve a less sophisticated and complex approach. Our&#xD;
      primary objective is to get the information to the patients, some of whom are members of&#xD;
      lower income minority communities. If &quot;simple&quot; interventions prove effective, then the&#xD;
      groundwork will have been laid for considering more tailored albeit complex systems.&#xD;

Processes involving program management and impact on barriers to treatment delivery by clinic staff, treating physicians and parents will also be evaluated.</description>
