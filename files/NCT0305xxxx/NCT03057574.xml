      This study aims to record Efficacy, Safety and tolerability of Gonapure® prescribed for&#xD;
      female subjects with infertility Undergoing IVF/ICSI&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gonapure® is a human follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) preparation of recombinant DNA origin&#xD;
      and contains no luteinizing hormone (LH) activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FSH stimulates ovarian follicular growth in women who do not have primary ovarian failure.&#xD;
      FSH, the active component of Gonapure® is the primary hormone responsible for follicular&#xD;
      recruitment and development. In order to affect final maturation of the follicle and&#xD;
      ovulation in the absence of an endogenous LH surge, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) must&#xD;
      be given following the administration of FSH, when monitoring of the patient indicates that&#xD;
      sufficient follicular development has occurred. There is inter-patient variability in&#xD;
      response to FSH administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage and schedule of treatment for female infertility must be determined according to&#xD;
      the needs of each patient; it is usual to monitor response by studying the patient's serum&#xD;
      oestrogen level and/or by ultrasonic visualization of follicles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment should be started within the first 7 days of the menstrual cycle. Treatment is&#xD;
      usually begun with 75 to 450 International units daily by intramuscular injection for 7 to 10&#xD;
      days; followed by individual adjustments according to the patient's follicular response i.e.&#xD;
      until an adequate, but not excessive, response is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will decide the starting dose according to the standard clinical practice&#xD;
      (and within the approved label).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment is then stopped and followed after 1 or 2 days by a single dose of human chorionic&#xD;
      Gonadotropin 10000 International units to induce oocyte maturation.&#xD;

Mean number of Mature oocytes (MII) retrieved on the day of ovum pick up (OPU) will be calculated. Oocyte retrieval is a technique used in in-vitro fertilization in order to remove oocytes from the ovary of the female, enabling fertilization outside the body.</description>
