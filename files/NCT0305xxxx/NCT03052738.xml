      This study proposes to do a prospective observational cohort study evaluating the quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) of children with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors and their families who choose&#xD;
      to self-medicate with marijuana-derived products while undergoing treatment at Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Colorado (CHCO).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Children's Hospital Colorado (CHCO) Center for Cancer and Blood Disorders (CCBD) is a&#xD;
      national leader in pediatric cancer therapy. The CHCO Neuro-Oncology program treats more that&#xD;
      90% of Coloradan children with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors and a large percentage of&#xD;
      children with CNS tumors from the surrounding five states. Due to advances in therapy,&#xD;
      approximately two-thirds of children with CNS tumors treated at CHCO will be cured. Although&#xD;
      medical marijuana has been legal for more than a decade in Colorado, the publicity around the&#xD;
      more recent legalization for general adult use, increasing literature, and anecdotal reports&#xD;
      of patients with terminal CNS tumors cured with medical marijuana, have prompted a recent&#xD;
      increase in interest of current CHCO patients and their families. There has been an influx of&#xD;
      pediatric cancer patients and their families moving to Colorado to obtain these&#xD;
      marijuana-based products to self-medicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will administer PedsQLTM questionnaires and diaries to gather data&#xD;
      regarding use practices, method of delivery, strain used, dosing and frequency, and family&#xD;
      financial impact on all enrolled patients. The Investigators will also collect peripheral&#xD;
      blood samples to evaluate for evidence of immuno-modulation by cannabinoids in patients who&#xD;
      may already be immunocompromised and to assess blood cannabinoid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide novel exploratory data regarding use patterns, impact on families and&#xD;
      resources, and potential clinical benefits and harms associated with the growing marijuana&#xD;
      use in the pediatric neuro-oncology population. Such information may guide future children&#xD;
      afflicted with CNS tumors and their families to make decisions about whether to pursue&#xD;
      cannabinoid treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Patients must have a diagnosis of central nervous system (brain or spinal) tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be ONE of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Undergoing disease-directed therapy or disease surveillance as prescribed by the&#xD;
                  Pediatric Neuro-Oncology physicians at CHCO&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Planning to transfer medical care to Pediatric Neuro-Oncology physicians at CHCO&#xD;
                  from outside facilities&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Receiving palliative care services that are managed in conjunction with&#xD;
