      Infants have an inborn preference for sweet and umami flavours and dislike sour and bitter,&#xD;
      but there is evidence that sensory experiences beginning early in development can modify&#xD;
      these preferences in favour ultimately of healthier food choices. Babies are first exposed to&#xD;
      flavour in utero and then later through breast/formula milk. This can be manipulated to&#xD;
      influence liking and consumption of individual foods with specific high-intensity flavours&#xD;
      postnatally. There are no prospective studies evaluating the impact of increasing maternal&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable intake during late pregnancy on a child's subsequent acceptance of fruit&#xD;
      and vegetables, particularly those with a sour/bitter taste. The hypothesis is that an&#xD;
      intervention to increase maternal intake of fruit and vegetables in late pregnancy will&#xD;
      enhance fetal flavour exposure and make infants more likely to accept a wide variety of fruit&#xD;
      and vegetables in childhood. Before testing this hypothesis, the investigators need to&#xD;
      evaluate the general acceptance and taste profile of the fruit and vegetable formats that we&#xD;
      intend to offer to pregnant women.&#xD;

      Foods that tend to be rejected by children include those with the greatest importance for&#xD;
      later health such as fruit and vegetables. Eating behaviour and acceptance of new tastes,&#xD;
      textures and flavours in young children is influenced by a plethora of biological and&#xD;
      environmental factors. Infants have an inborn preference for sweet and umami flavours and&#xD;
      dislike sour and bitter, but there is evidence that sensory experiences beginning very early&#xD;
      in development can positively modify these preferences in favour ultimately of healthier food&#xD;
      choices. Babies are first exposed to flavour through swallowing amniotic fluid in utero and&#xD;
      then later through breast or formula milk. There is evidence in a variety of species,&#xD;
      including humans, to show that this can be manipulated particularly during late pregnancy to&#xD;
      influence subsequent liking and consumption of individual foods with specific high intensity&#xD;
      flavours potentially. However, there is a lack of prospective studies evaluating the impact&#xD;
      of increasing maternal fruit and vegetable intake during late pregnancy on a child's&#xD;
      subsequent acceptance of fruit and vegetables, particularly those with a bitter taste. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that an intervention to increase maternal intake of fruit and vegetables in&#xD;
      late pregnancy, in women who normally struggle to achieve their 5-a-day, will enhance fetal&#xD;
      flavour exposure and make infants more likely to accept a wide variety of fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables in childhood. Before testing this hypothesis and designing the main study,&#xD;
      investigators need to ensure that the component parts are feasible: central to this is&#xD;
      evaluating the general acceptance and taste profile of the fruit and vegetable (F&amp;V) formats&#xD;
      that it is intended to offer to the mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A range of innovative presentation formats for a variety of the most pungent fruits and&#xD;
      vegetables are currently being developed. These include soups, sauces, crispbreads, muffins&#xD;
      and smoothies that incorporate vegetables and/or fruits that are generally considered as&#xD;
      bitter or sour tasting. A recent scoping survey of women of childbearing age confirmed prior&#xD;
      observations in both sexes that vegetables with a bitter profile are less preferred / more&#xD;
      likely never to have been tried, compared with sweet varieties. The survey also revealed that&#xD;
      vegetables were largely consumed cooked and as part of ain meals. Accordingly the F&amp;V formats&#xD;
      to be evaluated are predominantly pre-cooked and designed to be warmed through in a microwave&#xD;
      to avoid destruction and or leaching of flavour by over zealous cooking. Although the survey&#xD;
      revealed low consumption of vegetables in smoothie form or as snacks, this may have been due&#xD;
      to lack of easy availability and hence a number of these have been included to potentially&#xD;
      increase diversity of dietary formats and flavour exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This application is primarily a palatability trial to establish taste profile and general&#xD;
      acceptability of the diverse F&amp;V presentation formats in two groups: non-pregnant women of&#xD;
      childbearing age, followed by pregnant women. As the perception of taste (particularly&#xD;
      bitter, sweet and umami) may vary between individuals depending on genetic variation in&#xD;
      certain taste receptor genes, it is proposed to characterise the relevant genotypes in buccal&#xD;
      samples and relate this to their habitual diet and F&amp;V preferences. The utility of a&#xD;
      non-invasive sampling route for measuring expression of genes involved in taste perception&#xD;
      will also be determined using tongue swabs as this is a desirable feature for potentially&#xD;
      scrutinising any impact of the proposed intervention on the taste perception of mothers and&#xD;
      their infants and also requires to be assessed ahead of the designing of the main&#xD;
      intervention study.&#xD;
