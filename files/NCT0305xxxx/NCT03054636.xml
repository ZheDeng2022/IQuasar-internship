      The Short term Perfusion Angiography (SPA) study is designed to collect 2D Perfusion data&#xD;
      from Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) endovascular (interventional) procedures for information on&#xD;
      device performance in a real-world setting.&#xD;

        Approximately 132 patients with critical limb ischemia (Rutherford classification 4, 5 or&#xD;
        6) considered candidates for a diagnostic angiogram and likely endovascular intervention&#xD;
        expected to be enrolled into the SPA Study&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is â‰¥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject or their legally authorized representative understands the research nature of&#xD;
             the study and is willing and capable of providing informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has appropriate femoral arterial access&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject presents with a Rutherford classification of 4 to 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Planned DSA with endovascular intervention below the knee on one or both limbs. This&#xD;
             may include patients who undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Above the knee (ATK) and below the knee (BTK) intervention during the same&#xD;
                  procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Only BTK intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. ATK intervention with staged future BTK intervention within 6 weeks of the&#xD;
                  initial procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects whose ATK intervention is limited to only the common femoral or iliac&#xD;
             arteries&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject is unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol including all follow-up&#xD;
             visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject with active atrial fibrillation at time of procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Critical limb ischemia due to acute arterial occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject with documented ejection fraction &lt; 40% and/or prolonged bradycardia (&lt; 60&#xD;
             beats per minute)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability to collect toe pressure on index limb from subject&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with history of or known reaction or sensitivity to contrast agent that&#xD;
             cannot be pre-medicated or any other condition that precludes an endovascular&#xD;
             intervention and DSA&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subject of childbearing potential who is pregnant (she must have negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test within the 48 hours prior to enrollment), or plans a pregnancy during&#xD;
             study period,&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject life expectancy &lt; 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is participating in a potentially confounding device or drug clinical trial&#xD;
             that interferes with this study&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Investigator considers subject to be a poor candidate for the study or believes that&#xD;
             the patient may compromise the study, e.g., concomitant conditions (reasons will be&#xD;
             documented) )&#xD;
