  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mission of corrections is to provide custody, control and care for incarcerated&#xD;
      individuals. United States prisons are required by constitutional law to provide adequate&#xD;
      care for growing numbers of older inmates who will likely spend their final days in prison.&#xD;
      This Phase II project focuses on the correct users accessing correct learning strategies in&#xD;
      the correct setting (i.e., interdisciplinary prison staff accessing high quality products&#xD;
      designed to educate and lead practice change initiatives within the walls of prisons), by&#xD;
      continuing research and development of a learning system that promotes an integrated systems&#xD;
      approach to enhancing the care of the aged and dying in prisons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. There are over 1,821&#xD;
      state and federal prisons housing over 2.3 million prisoners in the United States. The&#xD;
      demographics of the prison population are shifting. Longer sentences and constrained options&#xD;
      for early release compound this trend. The older adult segment of prison populations has more&#xD;
      than tripled since 1990. The health status of aging inmates does not mirror the free-world&#xD;
      population. In fact, prisoners typically present with health issues common to free citizens&#xD;
      who are 10-15 years their senior. Prisoners are wards of that state, that is, the system is&#xD;
      responsible for providing for not only custody and control of offenders, but also their care.&#xD;
      Collectively, these trends have had a profound impact on prison systems: U.S. prisons are&#xD;
      facing sharply increased demands in caring for aged and dying inmates. In response to this&#xD;
      need, Phase I project Enhancing Care for the Aged and Dying in Prisons (ECAD-P) demonstrated&#xD;
      that (1) there is a need and interest for products such as ECAD-P (i.e., corrections&#xD;
      administrators and staff are interested in end-of-life (EOL) care training); (2) trainings&#xD;
      should be short, intensive, engaging, interactive, and contextually sensitive to the specific&#xD;
      environment; and (3) an interactive, media-rich prototype with high acceptability and&#xD;
      usability could be developed. The specification document and commercialization plan indicate&#xD;
      it is possible to develop a full-scale ECAD-P learning system in Phase II and market&#xD;
      potential exists. The technological innovation proposed for the ECAD-P project is well-suited&#xD;
      to the targeted market. Technical merit, feasibility, and market potential of the ECAD-P&#xD;
      Learning System were demonstrated in the Phase I project. The purpose of this Phase II&#xD;
      application is to continue research and development of the ECAD-P learning system with an&#xD;
      emphasis on developing a scalable unit for commercialization and testing scale-up in a larger&#xD;
      number of more diverse contexts. More specifically, the aims of ECAD-P Phase II are to 1)&#xD;
      Develop a full scale media-rich interactive computer-based learning system consisting of six&#xD;
      modules addressing EOL and geriatric care issues in prisons; 2) Conduct in-person usability&#xD;
      testing of the full scale ECAD-P Learning System in state and federal prisons to evaluate the&#xD;
      user interface, ease of use, and perceived barriers in order to optimize the scalable unit&#xD;
      for broader dissemination; and 3) Test scale-up of the full scale ECAD-P Learning System in&#xD;
      12 federal (n=6) and state (n=6) prisons across the nation to evaluate outcomes, usage&#xD;
      patterns, and commercialization opportunities. Continued research and development will permit&#xD;
      the refinement the scalable unit for commercialization. Expanded testing of the learning&#xD;
      system will establish the effectiveness of the learning system and will provide critical&#xD;
      insights relevant to dissemination of the commercial product.&#xD;
