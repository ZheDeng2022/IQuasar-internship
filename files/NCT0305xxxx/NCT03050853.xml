      This study will evaluate behavioral and psychological appeal, toxicity, and effect of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes on smoking behavior and nicotine addiction in chronic smokers with serious&#xD;
      mental illness (SMI) who have failed to quit smoking. A total of 240 participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomly assigned to either receive a supply of e-cigarettes for 8 weeks plus&#xD;
      assessments (baseline &amp; weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 13, &amp; 26) or assessments only. This single-blinded&#xD;
      study will provide e-cigarettes and instructions on their safe use. Level of appeal will be&#xD;
      inferred from carefully assessed use of e-cigarettes and reduction in combustible tobacco.&#xD;
      Qualitative data will also be collected from participants assigned to e-cigarettes, given&#xD;
      that unanticipated issues will almost certainly arise in connection with e-cigarette use that&#xD;
      can only be captured within a qualitative debriefing at the conclusion of participants' time&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main addictive component in tobacco, nicotine, has very low toxicity in cigarette doses&#xD;
      and is available in a novel product, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). E-cigarettes are&#xD;
      widely available and popular; almost one-third of cigarette smokers in the general population&#xD;
      have tried them. E-cigarette use may be equally common among heavily dependent subgroups of&#xD;
      chronic smokers. For example, two studies suggest that smokers with mental illness have tried&#xD;
      this product at similar or even higher rates compared with the general population. This&#xD;
      proposal targets chronic, highly dependent smokers with serious mental illness (SMI) who have&#xD;
      been unable to quit and are thus maintaining exposure to toxins in combustible tobacco smoke.&#xD;
      Whether smokers with SMI find e-cigarettes appealing is an important question because&#xD;
      substituting e-cigarettes for combustible cigarettes may have profound health effects related&#xD;
      to reduced impact on lung function and cardiovascular inflammation, as well as reduced&#xD;
      exposure to carcinogens and tumor promoters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E-Cigarettes are popular and readily available even though information about toxicity,&#xD;
      addiction liability, effect on health, and impact on current or future smoking behaviors is&#xD;
      limited. Given the ubiquity of e-cigarette use and the lack of definitive data on their&#xD;
      impact, more information about their appeal and impact, especially in vulnerable populations&#xD;
      who are unable to quit smoking, will be key for regulators and treatment providers. The FDA&#xD;
      has published its intention to regulate e-cigarettes, and the National Institute on Drug&#xD;
      Abuse (NIDA) is supporting the development of a standardized, safety-tested e-cigarette for&#xD;
      use in research. The American Heart Association recently issued a policy statement that&#xD;
      e-cigarettes present &quot;an opportunity for harm reduction if smokers adopt this alternative&#xD;
      tobacco product as a substitute for cigarettes,&quot; but further research on behavioral and&#xD;
      psychological appeal, toxicity, and impact of e-cigarettes on smoking heavier and nicotine&#xD;
      dependence are sorely needed. The proposed study would add significantly to this science&#xD;
      base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In partnership with the New Hampshire Department of Medicaid, this research group conducted a&#xD;
      statewide study of incentives for health behavior change. Over 600 smokers with mental&#xD;
      illness were enrolled and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 smoking cessation treatments. Almost&#xD;
      23% of smokers with schizophrenia and 31% of smokers with bipolar disorder had tried an&#xD;
      e-cigarette during the 3 months prior to participating in the study, providing evidence for&#xD;
      the potential appeal of e-cigarettes among people with SMI who are trying to quit smoking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings led to a preliminary prospective study of e-cigarette use among 19 chronic&#xD;
      smokers (9 had bipolar disorder, 10 had schizophrenia) who had tried to quit an average of&#xD;
      3.8 (±8.14) times over the prior year but were no longer seeking cessation treatment.&#xD;
      Participants received a 4-week supply of e-cigarettes and instruction on their safe use, and&#xD;
      were assessed weekly for a month. Participants sustained a steady level of e-cigarette use&#xD;
      over the study period. Overall, participants significantly reduced the number of cigarettes&#xD;
      smoked per week from a mean of 191.9 (±159.3) at baseline to 66.7 (±76.3) at the final study&#xD;
      visit (t=3.26, df=17, p=.005), confirmed by a significant decrease in mean CO level from&#xD;
      27ppm (±16.9) to 15ppm (±9.2) (t=3.246, df=18, p=.004). Participants rated several aspects of&#xD;
      e-cigarette use based on items created for this study, including: 1) enjoyment compared to&#xD;
      tobacco cigarettes, 2) satisfaction from e-cigarettes, and 3) willingness to buy&#xD;
      e-cigarettes. Ratings were consistently high (&gt;4 on a 5-point Likert type scale) across the 4&#xD;
      weeks. This study provides the basis and justification for conducting a large study using a&#xD;
      randomized design to learn more about the behavioral and psychological appeal of e-cigarettes&#xD;
      among chronic smokers with SMI, and to explore important aspects of e-cigarette use,&#xD;
      including impact on toxicity and nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the behavioral and psychological appeal of e-cigarettes among&#xD;
      chronic smokers with SMI, it will evaluate the effect of e-cigarettes on markers of tobacco&#xD;
      toxicity, and it will evaluate the effect of e-cigarettes on measures of nicotine dependence.&#xD;
      A total of 240 people with SMI who are receiving services at 1 of 2 mental health providers&#xD;
      (Vinfen Corporation in Lowell/Lawrence MA and Centerstone Kentucky, formerly Seven Counties&#xD;
      Services, Inc. in Louisville, KY) will be enrolled and randomly assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that at least 50% of smokers assigned to the e-cigarette group will use&#xD;
      e-cigarettes daily during each of the 8 weeks that they are provided; mean satisfaction of&#xD;
      e-cigarettes will be &gt;3 on a 5-point scale; and subjective perception of e-cigarettes will be&#xD;
      positive based on responses to a qualitative interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, it is hypothesized that over 8 weeks, reduction in expired breath CO, combustible&#xD;
      cigarettes consumed/week, and urine levels of 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol&#xD;
      or NNAL (a tobacco-specific carcinogen) will be greater among those assigned to e-cigarettes&#xD;
      compared to those assigned to assessment only. Lastly, it is hypothesized that people&#xD;
      assigned to e-cigarettes will have similar nicotine dependence at the end of the study&#xD;
      period, when compared to people assigned to assessment only.&#xD;
