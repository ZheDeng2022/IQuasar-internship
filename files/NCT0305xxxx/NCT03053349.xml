    <textblock>
      Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) appears to be an effective strategy to expand the lung donor&#xD;
      pool by better evaluation and reconditioning of non standard grafts. Today, EVLP is clinical&#xD;
      practice at the most active transplant centers in North America and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational prospective monocentric study is to prove the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of EVLP performed in the setting of Bergamo lung transplant program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistically estimated sample size would not fit with the small numbers of Italian lung&#xD;
      transplant activity, so the investigators decided to enrol 10 consecutive recipients of&#xD;
      grafts subjected to EVLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non standard grafts from Brain Dead Donors (BDD) and Donors after Cardiac Death (DCD) and&#xD;
      standard grafts that will undergo prolonged cold ischemic time will be selected for EVLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor lung procurement operation will be done in the usual manner. The EVLP procedure&#xD;
      will be performed in the operating theater of Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital. The investigators&#xD;
      decided to adopt Toronto protocol since it involves some lung protective strategies. EVLP&#xD;
      will proceed over a period of at least 4 and not more than 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes from the start of EVLP the following parameters will be&#xD;
      evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ratio of the partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
           (PO2/FiO2, mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR, dine*s/cm5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peak Inspiratory Pressure (PIP, cmH2O) and mean airways Pressure (Pawm, cmH2O)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  dynamic lung Compliance (Cpldyn, ml/ cmH2O)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ΔPO2 = pulmonary vein PO2 - pulmonary artery PO2 (mmHg). Moreover, after 60 and 240&#xD;
           minutes from the start of EVLP a graft X-ray and a bronchoscopy will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lung graft will be accepted for transplantation if, after 240 minutes from the start of&#xD;
      EVLP, the following conditions are fulfilled:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PO2/FiO2 &gt;350 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stability or reduction of PVR compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment&#xD;
           time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stability or reduction of PIP and Pawm compared with the measurement at the baseline&#xD;
           assessment time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stable or better Cpldyn compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment time&#xD;
           point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ΔPO2 &gt;400 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of X-ray imaging compared with that at the baseline assessment time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exclusion of oedema and purulent secretions by bronchoscopy. After transplantation the&#xD;
           recipients will be followed-up for 1 year according to a scheduled timetable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about the EVLP and transplant procedure and about the characteristics of donors and&#xD;
      recipients will be collected in a dedicated electronic Case report form (eCRF) according to&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;

      Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) has been allowing to expand the lung donor pool by better&#xD;
      evaluation and reconditioning of non standard grafts. The results of both completed and still&#xD;
      recruiting prospective clinical trials show similar short- and long-term post-transplant&#xD;
      outcomes with non standard and standard grafts subjected to EVLP and traditionally preserved&#xD;
      standard grafts. Today, EVLP is clinical practice at the most active transplant centers in&#xD;
      North America and Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this observational prospective monocentric study is to prove the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of EVLP performed in the setting of Bergamo lung transplant program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A statistically estimated sample size would not fit with the small numbers of Italian lung&#xD;
      transplant activity, so the investigators decided to enrol 10 consecutive recipients of&#xD;
      grafts subjected to EVLP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non standard grafts from Brain Dead Donors (BDD) and Donors after Cardiac Death (DCD) and&#xD;
      standard grafts that will undergo prolonged cold ischemic time will be selected for EVLP.&#xD;
      Grafts from donors over the age of 65 and/or with a smocking history of more than 10&#xD;
      pack-year and/or with chronic lung disease and/or with gross gastric aspiration and/or with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of established pneumonia will be rejected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The donor lung procurement operation will be done in the usual manner. After excision, the&#xD;
      right and left graft will not be divided and will be packed in ice for transportation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EVLP procedure will be performed in the operating theater of Papa Giovanni XXIII&#xD;
      Hospital. The investigators decided to adopt Toronto protocol since it involves some lung&#xD;
      protective strategies. EVLP will proceed over a period of at least 4 and not more than 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes from the start of EVLP the following parameters will be&#xD;

        -  PO2/FiO2 &gt;350 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stability or reduction of PVR compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment&#xD;
           time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stability or reduction of PIP and Pawm compared with the measurement at the baseline&#xD;
           assessment time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stable or better Cpldyn compared with the measurement at the baseline assessment time&#xD;
           point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ΔPO2 &gt;400 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  improvement of X-ray imaging compared with that at the baseline assessment time point&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exclusion of oedema and purulent secretions by bronchoscopy. If the lung graft is&#xD;
           considered suitable for transplantation, the EVLP procedure will be stopped as described&#xD;
           by Toronto protocol and the right and left graft will be divided and packed for&#xD;
           hypothermic preservation until implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After transplantation the recipients will be followed-up for 1 year according to a scheduled&#xD;
      timetable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data about the EVLP and transplant procedure and about the characteristics of donors and&#xD;
      recipients will be collected in a dedicated electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) according to&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice.&#xD;
