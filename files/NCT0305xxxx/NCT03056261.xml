  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sixty neonates and infants will be enrolled and randomised into two groups of n=30 each . For&#xD;
      their surgical procedures, one group general (GA) anaesthesia the second group will receive a&#xD;
      combined general and epidural anaesthesia (CGEA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the GA group will be induced with intravenous propofol (2-4 mg.kg-1) and fentanyl&#xD;
      (2-4 µg.kg-1) and will receive rocuronium bromide (0.5 mg.kg-1) to facilitate endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Anaesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane (2-3%) in an air/oxygen mixture&#xD;
      as well as intravenous fentanyl as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the (CGEA) 0.5 ml.kg-1 of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected into the epidural catheter,&#xD;
      followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1% bupivacaine at a rate of 0.2 mg.kg-1.hr-1 for up to&#xD;
      48 hours postoperatively. Assessment of anaesthetic efficacy will be measured Intraoperative&#xD;
      care vital signs. And will continuously be monitored with a Datex AS/3 (Engestrom®, Helsinki,&#xD;
      Finland) monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antibiotic prophylaxis will be determined by the degree of bowel contamination&#xD;
      during surgery, with the commonest regimen consisting of penicillin, gentamicin and&#xD;
      metronidazole will be administered. Antibiotics will be continued for 36-48 hours&#xD;
      postoperatively to prevent infection arising from the disturbed bowel flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care, following surgery, will be conducted. The feeding volume will be&#xD;
      increased in steps as long as the volume of regurgitated fluid will be less than 20% of the&#xD;
      administered breast milk or formula volume. Full feeding will define as oral tolerance of at&#xD;
      least 80% of daily maintenance volume. In cases of abdominal distension or vomiting, feeding&#xD;
      will withheld until symptom resolution. The nasogastric tube will be removed on bowel&#xD;
      function restoration The CRIES score will be use to assess the severity and duration of&#xD;
      postoperative pain during the patients' NICU stay. If the CRIES score is ≥4, fentanyl will be&#xD;
      continuously intravenously infused in both study group. Fentanyl will be also administered to&#xD;
      CGEA patients who experienced pain despite a continuous epidural infusion at 1-5 µg.kg-1.h-1.&#xD;
      The amount of fentanyl required for adequate postoperative pain relief will be recorded in&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;

      After approval off the local Ethical Committee of Bnai Zion Hospital, Haifa, Israel and&#xD;
      informed parental consent obtained for each participant. Sixty small infants who undergoing&#xD;
      GI surgery will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria are neonates or infants requiring the following major intestinal&#xD;
      procedures: duodenoduodenostomy or duodenojejunostomy for duodenal atresia, ileocaecal&#xD;
      resection for intestinal volvulus, ileostomy or colostomy closure for congenital anorectal&#xD;
      malformations, and corrective surgery for Hirschsprung's disease. The exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      concurrent coagulopathies, sepsis, vertebral column malformations, neurological disease,&#xD;
      immunocompromise with or without leukopenia, and intestinal necrotising enterocolitis.&#xD;
      Patients will be also excluded if they will require exploratory laparotomy or emergent&#xD;
      intestinal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty premature, ex-premature, and full-term neonates and infants meeting the above criteria&#xD;
      will enrolled in the study, patients will randomised into two groups of n=30 each ( according&#xD;
      to a computer program ) . For their surgical procedures, the first group will receive general&#xD;
      anesthesia (GA group), whereas the second group receive combined general and epidural&#xD;
      anesthesia (CGEA group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique Patients in the GA group will be induced with intravenous propofol (2-4&#xD;
      mg.kg-1) and fentanyl (2-4 µg.kg-1) and receive rocuronium bromide (0.5 mg.kg-1) to&#xD;
      facilitate endotracheal intubation. Anaesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane (2-3%) in&#xD;
      an air/oxygen mixture as well as intravenous fentanyl as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the CGEA group will be induce as above in addition to receiving epidural&#xD;
      anaesthesia as follows: A 20G epidural catheter (B. Braun Medical Ltd., Melsungen, Germany)&#xD;
      through a 19G Crawford epidural needle, so that its tip lays between the desired T5 and T10&#xD;
      spinal segments. Correct catheter placement will be confirmed by portable epidurography after&#xD;
      filling the catheter with 0.5 ml iohexol (Omnipaque® 300, Nycomed, Oslo, Norway). A test dose&#xD;
      of 0.1 ml.kg-1 of 1% lidocaine with 1:200 000 adrenaline will be administered, and the result&#xD;
      and effects on heart rate (HR) and the ST segment will be noted. If the HR increases by at&#xD;
      least 20% above baseline and/or ST segment changes will be observed, the catheter will be&#xD;
      withdrawl and re positioned. 0.5 ml.kg-1 of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected into the&#xD;
      epidural catheter, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.1% bupivacaine at a rate of 0.2&#xD;
      mg.kg-1.hr-1 for up to 48 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of anesthetic efficacy in both groups will be confirmed by the absence of surges&#xD;
      in blood pressure (BP) and HR beyond 20% above baseline. Success of epidural anesthesia will&#xD;
      be defined by the correct placement of the epidural catheter between the T5 and T10 spinal&#xD;
      segments within two attempts, as well as the obviation for additional systemic analgesia. In&#xD;
      cases of epidural technique failure, anesthesia will be maintained by GA and the patient will&#xD;
      be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative care Intraoperative systolic, diastolic and mean arterial pressures (SBP, DBP,&#xD;
      and MAP), HR, arterial oxygen saturation(SaO2), and temperature will be continuously&#xD;
      monitored with a Datex AS/3 (Engestrom®, Helsinki, Finland) monitor. All patients in the GA&#xD;
      group will mechanically be ventilated, with maintenance of peak inspiratory pressure between&#xD;
      18 and 30 cmH20, and end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) between 30 and 50 mmHg. Additionally, urine output&#xD;
      will be measured at 30-minute intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two peripheral intravenous cannulae will be inserted preoperatively for each patient, and&#xD;
      fluid will be maintained with Ringer's lactate and 5% glucose solutions at 4 ml.kg-1.h-1.&#xD;
      Additional Ringer's lactate will be infused for fluid replacement of third-space and/or blood&#xD;
      losses. Packed red blood cells will be transfused in cases of blood loss ≥10% of blood&#xD;
      volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antibiotic prophylaxis will be determined by the degree of bowel contamination&#xD;
      during surgery, with the commonest regimen consisting of penicillin, gentamicin and&#xD;
      metronidazole will be administered. Antibiotics will continue for 36-48 hours postoperatively&#xD;
      to prevent infection arising from the disturbed bowel flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care following surgery, all patients will be transferred to the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU) where physiological monitoring and mechanical ventilation will&#xD;
      continue as appropriate. Blood samples will be collected postoperatively for full blood&#xD;
      count, glucose, electrolyte, and blood gas measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feeding volume will be increased in 5 ml steps as long as the volume of regurgitated&#xD;
      fluid is less than 20% of the administered breast milk or formula volume. Full feeding will&#xD;
      be defined as oral tolerance of at least 80% of daily maintenance volume. In cases of&#xD;
      abdominal distension or vomiting, feeding will withheld until symptom resolution. The&#xD;
      nasogastric tube will be removed on bowel function restoration (i.e. defaecation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRIES neonatal postoperative pain score (C=Crying; R=Requires oxygen; I=Increased vital&#xD;
      signs; E=Expression; S=Sleepless) [18] will be used to assess the severity and duration of&#xD;
      postoperative pain during the patients' NICU stay. Scoring will carried out by the attending&#xD;
      nurses every two hours. If the CRIES score is ≥4, fentanyl will be continuously intravenously&#xD;
      infused in both study group. Fentanyl will be also administered to CGEA patients who&#xD;
      experienced pain despite a continuous epidural infusion at 1-5 µg.kg-1.h-1. The amount of&#xD;
      fentanyl required for adequate postoperative pain relief will recorded in both groups.&#xD;
