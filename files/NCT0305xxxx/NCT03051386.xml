      This protocol is replacing NCT00582504.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of USAMRIID and qualified extramural participants who are&#xD;
      at risk of exposure to VEE virus. This study will be performed at the USAMRIID SIP Clinic.&#xD;
      This open-label study represents a continuation of previous research conducted at USAMRIID.&#xD;
      Subjects will be vaccinated with 0.5 mL of VEE vaccine, Live, Attenuated TC-83, NDBR 102, Lot&#xD;
      4, Run 3 subcutaneously in the upper outer aspect of the triceps region. Subjects will&#xD;
      contacted the following day and weekly for 4 weeks to assess for adverse events.&#xD;

          2. Have VEE virus PRNT80 &lt; 1:10.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If female of childbearing potential, must agree to have a serum pregnancy test on the&#xD;
             same day before vaccine administration. (Exception: documented hysterectomy or ≥ 3&#xD;
             years of menopause.) The results must be negative. Females must agree not to become&#xD;
             pregnant for 3 months after receipt of the vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Be considered at risk for exposure to VEE virus and who have submitted a Request for&#xD;
             IND Vaccines for the VEE vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Sign and date the approved informed consent document and HIPAA Authorization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have in their charts:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  medical history (including concomitant medications) within 60 days of planned&#xD;
                  first administration of vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  physical examination and laboratory tests within 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  previous chest radiograph results and electrocardiogram&#xD;

          8. Be willing to return for all follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Agree to report any AEs that may or may not be associated with administration of the&#xD;
             vaccine for at least 28 days after administration and agree to report all SAEs (for&#xD;
             example, resulting in hospitalization) for the duration of the subject's participation&#xD;
             in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Agree to defer blood donation for 1 year after receipt of the vaccine.&#xD;

             is only of late onset in an elderly parent.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have clinically significant abnormal laboratory results (including evidence of&#xD;
             hepatitis C, hepatitis B carrier state) or elevated liver function tests (two times&#xD;
             the normal range or at the discretion of the PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have a personal history of an immunodeficiency or received treatment with an&#xD;
             immunosuppressive medication, such as systemically administered glucocorticoids (eg&#xD;
             prednisone) within 1 month before planned administration of the vaccine or with other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapies within 6 months of planned administration of the vaccine.&#xD;
             Other immunosuppressive therapies include all cancer chemotherapeutic agents, drugs to&#xD;
             prevent transplant rejection, interferons, monoclonal antibodies, protein kinase&#xD;
             inhibitors, methotrexate, TNF (tumor necrosis factor) inhibitors, and any other drug&#xD;
             determined to be immunosuppressive by the PI. Current administration of topical,&#xD;
             inhalational, or intranasal glucocorticoids is not excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have confirmed HIV infection (antibody positivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have a positive pregnancy test or a breastfeeding female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have any known allergies to components of the vaccine:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Guinea pig heart cells&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Streptomycin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Human serum albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of serious allergic reaction to guinea pigs or guinea pig products. (Subjects&#xD;
             who have known allergies to guinea pigs will be evaluated. The vast majority of&#xD;
             individuals who are allergic to guinea pigs are allergic to the dander from the&#xD;
             animals. An individual with a past serious allergic reaction to guinea pigs will be&#xD;
             excluded.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Have administration of another vaccine or investigational product within 28 days of&#xD;
             VEE vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Have any unresolved AE resulting from a previous immunization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Have a medical condition that, in the judgment of the PI, would impact subject safety.&#xD;
