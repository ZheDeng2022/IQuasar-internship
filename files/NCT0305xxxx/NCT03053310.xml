      Background Approximately half of head and neck cancer patients are 65 years or older at&#xD;
      diagnosis. Treatment decisions in this older HNCA population are challenging, because of the&#xD;
      lack of evidence-based guidelines. Surgery is often the treatment of choice in a HNCA setting&#xD;
      where curative treatment is intended. Though chronological age per se has not been reported&#xD;
      as a contraindication for surgery, data are limited and often the result of retrospective&#xD;
      studies. Measurement of functional age, through a comprehensive geriatric assessment, has&#xD;
      been suggested by several international cancer organizations to be a better prognostic&#xD;
      indicator. At the divisions of maxillofacial surgery and otorhinolaryngology, a geriatric&#xD;
      assessment is part of routine preoperative staging for patients of 70 years old or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives The investigators aim to determine the value of G8 to predict 30-day postoperative&#xD;
      comorbidity in an older HNCA population undergoing elective curative surgery. Moreover, they&#xD;
      aim to examine the vulnerability profile of patients undergoing elective head and neck&#xD;
      surgery for an oncology diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design All patients of 70 years and older, presenting at the divisions of maxillofacial&#xD;
      surgery and otorhinolaryngology for curative surgery of a solid head and neck tumour undergo&#xD;
      a geriatric consult as part of routine preoperative staging. The presence of postoperative&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality within the first 30 days after surgery will be collected as a primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 30±10 days postoperative, all patients will be re-evaluated with the G8 and the CGA.&#xD;
      Patient' quality of life will also be re-examined within 30 days postoperative and again at 6&#xD;
      and 12 months postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion There is still no consensus whether older HNCA patients should receive a different&#xD;
      treatment compared to younger patients. Data related to the vulnerability profile of older&#xD;
      patients requiring HN surgery, and the predictive value of geriatric screening for&#xD;
      postoperative morbidity could enable better patient selection in the future.&#xD;
