    <textblock>
      The purpose of the BIOLUX P-III BENELUX Registry is to further investigate the safety and&#xD;
      clinical performance of the Passeo-18 Lux Drug Coated Ballon when used in daily clinical&#xD;
      practice for the treatment of isolated atherosclerotic lesion (vessel narrowing) in popliteal&#xD;
      arteries&#xD;

        The BIOLUX P-III BENELUX registry will include subjects from an all-comers patient&#xD;
        population with all subjects requiring popliteal artery revascularization with the&#xD;
        Passeo-18 Lux DCB&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years or minimum age as required by local regulations&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must be willing to sign a Patient Data Release Form (PDRF) or Patient Informed&#xD;
             Consent (PIC) where applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion(s) in the popliteal arteries suitable for endovascular treatment, treated with&#xD;
             or scheduled to be treated with the Passeo-18 Lux drug coated balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Isolated popliteal artery lesion: at least 2 cm of healthy segment between lesion(s)&#xD;
             in the popliteal artery and lesion(s) in distal superficial femoral artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inflow free from flow-limiting lesion. Patients with flow-limiting inflow lesions (&gt;&#xD;
             50% stenosis) can be included if lesion(s) have been treated successfully before or&#xD;
             during the index procedure, with a maximum residual stenosis of 30% per visual&#xD;
             assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one native artery with direct outflow artery to the foot&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rutherford classification 2-5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with bypass surgery in the same limb can be enrolled if there is at least 2 cm&#xD;
             healthy segment between popliteal artery and anastomosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy ≤ 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Rutherford classification 6&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesion involving the superficial femoral artery (arterial intersection with the femur&#xD;
             in an anteroposterior view) or extending in infra-popliteal arteries (origin of the&#xD;
             anterior tibial artery or tibioperoneal trunk)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysm at the level of the popliteal artery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to successfully cross the target lesion with a guide wire (successful crossing&#xD;
             means tip of the guide wire distal to the target lesion in the absence of flow&#xD;
             limiting dissections or perforations)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraprocedural decision not to proceed with the Passeo18 Lux DCB for any reason not&#xD;
             related to the device (for instance blood flow limiting dissection after&#xD;
             predilatation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is currently participating in another investigational drug or device study&#xD;
             that has not reached its primary endpoint yet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the course of the study&#xD;
