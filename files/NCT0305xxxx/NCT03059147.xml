    <textblock>
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum recommended dose of SF1126 in&#xD;
           combination with nivolumab in adult patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic)&#xD;
           HCC and Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh B7 cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the recommended phase II dose of SF1126 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
           patients with advanced (unresectable or metastatic) HCC and Child-Pugh A or Child-Pugh&#xD;
           B7 cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the safety and tolerability of SF1126 in adult patients with underlying&#xD;
           liver disease by ongoing evaluation of adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine pharmacokinetics in HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effect of SF1126 in combination with nivolumab on progression-free&#xD;
           survival and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the rate of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) at within 56 days of&#xD;
      starting treatment, and the maximum tolerated dose or maximum recommended dose of SF1126 in&#xD;
      combination with nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adverse events related to SF1126 (description, timing, grade [CTCAE v4.03], severity,&#xD;
           seriousness, and relatedness).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pharmacokinetics in HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The proportion of patients remaining progression-free by radiographic criteria as&#xD;
           assessed by RESIST v1.1 at 4 months, and, as available, median progression-free survival&#xD;
           and overall survival estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SF1126 is a dual inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (pan-isoform specific) and&#xD;
      bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) which simultaneously disrupts two key MYC-mediating&#xD;
      factors that promote cancer cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab is a humanized, IgG4 isotype monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks&#xD;
      binding of PD-1 to its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. Nivolumab monotherapy is approved in the US&#xD;
      for HCC previously treated with sorafenib.&#xD;
