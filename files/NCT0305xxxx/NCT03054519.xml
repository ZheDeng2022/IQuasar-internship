  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All participants will have PAD. PAD will be defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  First, an ankle brachial index (ABI) &lt;=0.90 at the baseline study visit is an&#xD;
             inclusion criterion for PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Second, potential participants who have an ABI &gt; 0.90 but â‰¤ 1.00 and experience a 20%&#xD;
             or higher drop in ABI after heel-rise exercise will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Third, potential participants with an ABI &gt; 0.90 who have vascular lab evidence of PAD&#xD;
             or angiographic evidence of PAD who have ischemic symptoms during the six-minute walk&#xD;
             and/or treadmill exercise stress test will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fourth, potential participants with a history of lower extremity revascularization who&#xD;
             do not meet the criterion above and have an ABI &gt; 0.90 with a 20% or higher drop in&#xD;
             ABI after heel-rise exercise will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Above- or below-knee amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Critical limb ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wheelchair-bound or requiring a walker to ambulate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Walking is limited by a symptom other than PAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current foot ulcer on bottom of foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetes mellitus defined as one or more of a) patient report of physician diagnosed&#xD;
             diabetes mellitus, b) use of one or more diabetes medications, c) two baseline&#xD;
             hemoglobinA1C values of &gt;6.5, d) two fasting glucose values &gt;126 mg/dl. [NOTE: the&#xD;
             second fasting glucose value and hemoglobin A1C values will be at the discretion of&#xD;
             the principal investigator. For example, if the first glucose value is &gt;300 or the&#xD;
             first A1C value is &gt;6.9, then investigators may decide not to repeat the value.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic kidney disease defined as GFR &lt;=45. [NOTE: if GFR is 40-44, investigator&#xD;
             discretion will be used to determine if a repeat test may be performed. If the second&#xD;
             GFR value is &gt;45, the participant may be included.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic liver disease defined as two or more hepatic function tests &gt;=2.0 times the&#xD;
             upper limit of normal. [NOTE: participants who meet this criterion may undergo a&#xD;
             re-test of hepatic function tests to determine whether initially elevated hepatic&#xD;
             enzymes represented a transient or spurious phenomenon.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to successfully complete the 2-week study run-in, defined as unable to&#xD;
             tolerate metformin and/or failing to take the medication daily for 10 or more days in&#xD;
             the two-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, or other major surgery&#xD;
             during the next six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lower extremity revascularization, orthopedic surgery, cardiovascular event, coronary&#xD;
             revascularization, or other major surgery in the previous three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major medical illness including renal disease requiring dialysis, lung disease&#xD;
             requiring oxygen, Parkinson's disease, a life-threatening illness with life expectancy&#xD;
             less than six months, or cancer requiring treatment in the previous two years. [NOTE:&#xD;
             potential participants may still qualify if they have had treatment for an early stage&#xD;
             cancer in the past two years and the prognosis is excellent. Participants who only use&#xD;
             oxygen at night may still qualify.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score &lt;23 or dementia. However, investigator&#xD;
             discretion may be used to allow some people below this threshold to participate, if&#xD;
             the investigator determines there is another reason for their lower score, including&#xD;
             lack of familiarity with the English language or lack of sufficient education to&#xD;
             achieve a score of 23 or higher. Note that the MMSE include some spelling and English&#xD;
             writing proficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in or completion of a clinical trial in the previous three months.&#xD;
             [NOTE: after completing a stem cell or gene therapy intervention, participants will&#xD;
             become eligible after the final study follow-up visit of the stem cell or gene therapy&#xD;
             study so long as at least six months have passed since the final intervention&#xD;
             administration. After completing a supplement or drug therapy (other than stem cell or&#xD;
             gene therapy), participants will be eligible after the final study follow-up visit as&#xD;
             long as at least three months have passed since the final intervention of the trial.]&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking metformin or has taken metformin in past six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Increase in angina or angina at rest&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-English speaking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual impairment that limits walking ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to the above criteria, investigator discretion will be used to determine&#xD;
             if the trial is unsafe or not a good fit for the potential participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Vulnerable populations (fetuses, pregnant women, children, prisoners, and institutionalized&#xD;
        persons) and adults unable to consent will not be included in the study.&#xD;
