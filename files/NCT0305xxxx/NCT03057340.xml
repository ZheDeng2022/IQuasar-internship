      Malignant tumor has become the leading cause of death in humans, and the number one killer in&#xD;
      malignant tumor is the lung cancer. Intensifying environmental pollution comes with rising of&#xD;
      the incidence of lung cancer and the high mortality,what's the worst that the 5-year survival&#xD;
      rate is only about 15%, accounting for first place in the malignant tumors, Exploiting for&#xD;
      novel antitumor technology and products comes to arrest growing attention of the governments&#xD;
      and businesses because of the uneffectively curbing of tumor threat to people's life and&#xD;
      health on conventional three treatments (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Biological&#xD;
      and immunotherapy was voted to one of the ten big breakthrough in 2013 by Science magazine,&#xD;
      and considered as a new development direction for cancer treatment in the 21st century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing immune treatment mainly includes: adoptive immune therapy, tumor vaccine&#xD;
      therapy, immune checkpoint-antibody therapy and other auxiliary therapy, and the adoptive&#xD;
      immunotherapy was researched and developeded former in addition the most mature treatment&#xD;
      among these therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Dr Hu Hong - Ming's team put forward an innovative cancer treatment strategy: using&#xD;
      of autophagy role to capture tumor antigen for preparation of tumor vaccine. In this&#xD;
      strategy, the blocking proteasome activity of in vitro cultured tumor cells dealed with&#xD;
      Bortezomib (proteasome inhibitors) causes enrichment of short-lived protein (SLiPs) and&#xD;
      misfolded proteins (DRiPs) in autophagosome,called DRibbles corpuscle. Tumor vaccine maded&#xD;
      from collecting these DRibbles corpuscle preparation as, also known as the DRibble vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, clinical research has been carried out about Dribble liver cancer vaccine unit&#xD;
      with DC - CIK therapy in liver cancer in the second hospital of Nanjing nearly four years,and&#xD;
      more than 300 cases has been completed. Clinical research results show that Dribble vaccine&#xD;
      has good security, producing stronger immune response compared with the DC-CIK therapy alone.&#xD;
      But it is still no cognization for the efficacy and safety of DC-CIK joint DRibble lung&#xD;
      cancer vaccine in China, whether it is better than the current DC - CIK immune therapy,&#xD;
      needed for further clinical research and expected to provide a better immune treatment for&#xD;
      NSCLC patients.&#xD;

      Malignant tumor has become the leading cause of death in humans, and the number one killer in&#xD;
      malignant tumor is the lung cancer. Intensifying environmental pollution comes with rising of&#xD;
      the incidence of lung cancer and the high mortality,what's the worst that the 5-year survival&#xD;
      rate is only about 15%, accounting for first place in the malignant tumors, Exploiting for&#xD;
      novel antitumor technology and products comes to arrest growing attention of the governments&#xD;
      and businesses because of the uneffectively curbing of tumor threat to people's life and&#xD;
      health on conventional three treatments (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy). Biological&#xD;
      and immunotherapy was voted to one of the ten big breakthrough in 2013 by Science magazine,&#xD;
      and considered as a new development direction for cancer treatment in the 21st century.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing immune treatment mainly includes: adoptive immune therapy, tumor vaccine&#xD;
      therapy, immune checkpoint-antibody therapy and other auxiliary therapy, and the adoptive&#xD;
      immunotherapy was researched and developeded former in addition the most mature treatment&#xD;
      among these therapies. The adoptive immunotherapy has been carried out in many units&#xD;
      primarily is the autologous DC - CIK immunotherapy,which called the Dendritic cells&#xD;
      (Dendritic cells, DC) and Cytokine Induced Killer cells (Cytokine Induced Killer, CIK)&#xD;
      immunotherapy. The principle of this technology is: separating of monocytes and lymphocytes&#xD;
      of human peripheral blood, then ugmentated and activated by a variety of cytokines in vitro&#xD;
      (e.g., IFN - gamma, IL - 1, IL - 2, anti - CD3 mAb) to a mixed lymphocyte with antigen&#xD;
      presenting and broad-spectrum function of killing tumor cells. The amplifying activated&#xD;
      DC-CIK intravenous back to patients, releasing of active substances such as CIK cells&#xD;
      perforin,and grain enzyme B to tumor cells after combining with the tumor cells in the body,&#xD;
      which dissolves the tumor cells.Meanwhile the secreting of a variety of cytokines, such as IL&#xD;
      - 2, IFN - gamma and TNF alpha, improves the body's immune function, and gives the role of&#xD;
      anti-tumor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing literature report and our previous study in biological treatment center showed that&#xD;
      good safety, small side effects and good tolerance for the vast majority of patients. In&#xD;
      curative effect, the current report reveals DC-CIK technology has a good curative effect&#xD;
      maidly on leukemia, lymphoma, ovarian cancer, stomach cancer, etc., except for lung cancer.It&#xD;
      could because of the complex lung cancer tumor antigen,or weak tumor specific T cell&#xD;
      response. How to improve the effectiveness of the presented lung cancer antigen and stimulate&#xD;
      stronger tumor specific T cell response needs to be addressed in improving the curative&#xD;
      effect of the lung cancer immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years checkpoint point antibody therapy has a breakthrough in tumor immunotherapy,&#xD;
      including CTLA-4, PD - 1 and PD - L1. a number of clinical studies revealed the therapy of PD&#xD;
      - 1 and PD - L1 antibody for advanced NSCLC, especially in lung squamous carcinoma has good&#xD;
      treatment effect, and the disease objective response rate achieve 10-23%. Autologous DC/CIK&#xD;
      therapy has been widely carried out in domestic,and has a good security proved by many&#xD;
      clinical practice.As the lack of effective tumor antigen, there are no large randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind study confirm its function in extending patient survival and preventing tumor&#xD;
      progression so far. Some hospitals adopted the tumor cell lysis solution or single molecule&#xD;
      protein peptide/DC united CIK technology, which means to load tumor cell lysis or single&#xD;
      molecule protein peptide as a tumor antigen to DC unite with in vitro induced CIK at the same&#xD;
      time.When compared to CIK therapy alone, the unit therapy can not only non-specificly damage&#xD;
      tumor,but also induce the body to produce tumor-specific immune response.However most of the&#xD;
      tumor antigens contained in tumor cell lysis are longevity protein that cannot be effectively&#xD;
      intaken by DC,leading to limited effective antigen presented by DC to T lymphocyte. In&#xD;
      addition, the tumor antigen longevity protein can exist for a long time in the natural growth&#xD;
      of tumor cells, and can be recognized by the patients for its own organization,therefore&#xD;
      immune tolerance inhibites the immune response affecting the effect of killing tumor. Single&#xD;
      molecule protein polypeptide only induce specific immune response to a single or a few tumor&#xD;
      antigen, not the mutatd tumor antigen,resulting in escape of tumor. We need to develop new&#xD;
      cell treatments because of autologous DC/CIK therapy can not produce effective immune&#xD;
      response ,for providing a new aiternative candidate to unite checkpoint antibody therapy in&#xD;
      the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Dr Hu Hong - Ming's team put forward an innovative cancer treatment strategy: using&#xD;
      of autophagy role to capture tumor antigen for preparation of tumor vaccine. In this&#xD;
      strategy, the blocking proteasome activity of in vitro cultured tumor cells dealed with&#xD;
      Bortezomib (proteasome inhibitors) causes enrichment of short-lived protein (SLiPs) and&#xD;
      misfolded proteins (DRiPs) in autophagosome,called DRibbles corpuscle. Tumor vaccine maded&#xD;
      from collecting these DRibbles corpuscle preparation as, also known as the DRibble&#xD;
      vaccine.Our early studies have suggested that the DRibble tumor vaccines are more powerful&#xD;
      than the tumor cell vaccine, because the whole tumor cell vaccine does not contain easily&#xD;
      degradated short-lived proteins which cannot be cross presented to DC efficiently. These&#xD;
      short-lived protein avoid being degradated by the proteasome in the DRibble vaccine, and&#xD;
      packaged into autophagosome vesicles with double membrane structure. These vesicles contain&#xD;
      endogenous risk signaling molecules (such as HSP90, HMGB1, etc.), can effectively trigger the&#xD;
      congenital immune response. Therefore, when co-culture with once DRibble vaccine,DC can&#xD;
      effectively intake DRibble vaccine and presenting tumor related antigen to the DC surface,&#xD;
      combining with MHC molecules to activate T cells, resulting in the immune response. Compared&#xD;
      with whole lung cancer vaccine, DRibble lung cancer vaccines can provide a wider range of&#xD;
      tumor associated antigen, make the body no longer keep the tolerance for lack of cross&#xD;
      presented, which can cause strong immune response. Dr Hu Hong Ming's team have also found&#xD;
      that allogeneic Dribble can induce equally effective immune response compare with autologous&#xD;
      tumor cells DRibble vaccine and tumor regression, the result has been confirmed in multiple&#xD;
      tumor models. Due to the lack of classic MHC molecules,DRibble vaccine proteins can be&#xD;
      rapidly degradated by DC, and allogeneic DRibble vaccine would not induce adverse effects due&#xD;
      to the induction of allograft immune response, remaindering it's safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DRibble surface have a large number of target molecular ligands of DC,directely combine with&#xD;
      xDC cells with high expression CLEC9A on surface. xDC cells can efficiently cross presente&#xD;
      antigen to DC, thus can improve the efficiency of presenting DRibble antigen. Besides, immune&#xD;
      response induce by DRibble have immune memory and identify a wide variety of tumor specific&#xD;
      antigen, it will amplificate palying against tumor cells regeneration and prevent tumor&#xD;
      escape when stimulated again.By Providence cancer centers in the United States for nearly 10&#xD;
      years of research, the safety of the DRibble has been fully validated by Ⅰ/Ⅱ clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above research foundation, our project intends to carry out the following&#xD;
      research: 1. The curative effect and the influence of the overall survival of late-stage&#xD;
      NSCLC patients after receivie new DRibble vaccine, and compared with the existing DC/CIK&#xD;
      therapy efficacy, 2. Further study the mechanism of Dribble vaccine therapy effects on human&#xD;
      lung cancer cells, system analysis and evaluate the clinical curative effect and promotion&#xD;
