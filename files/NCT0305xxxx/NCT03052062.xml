    <textblock>
      The objectives of this clinical study are to determine the tolerance of dietary supplement&#xD;
      Lipidrive through the evaluation of several parameters :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Various blood biological parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic indicators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric variables&#xD;

      Primary objectives of this study :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effects of two doses of the product on:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Various blood biological parameters for tolerance (preprandial): blood glucose, insulin,&#xD;
           HOMA-IR, glycated hemoglobin, fructosamine, total cholesterol, triglycerides,&#xD;
           HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, oxidized LDL, us-CRP, creatinine, ASAT, ALAT, gGT,&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, urea.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urinary parameters: urea, creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemodynamic indicators: heart rate and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac function: ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric variables: weight, waist, hips, waist/hip ratio, body composition using&#xD;
           bioelectric impendence analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the effects of the highest dose on:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Adiponectin, leptin, TNF-α, and the evolution kinetics of blood glucose and blood insulin&#xD;
      levels following a standard breakfast, with or without the acute administration of the&#xD;
      Lipidrive dietary supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two questionnaires (one on eating habits over 3 days and another on physical and sports&#xD;
      activities) will be completed at various times (cf. below). A &quot;satisfaction&quot; questionnaire&#xD;
      will also be completed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum bank will be created (ghrelin, resistin, GIP, GLP-1, IL-6, IL-1 beta, CCK), and&#xD;
      stools will be collected at V2 and V5 for subsequent microbiota analysis (aliquoting&#xD;
      performed by the AME2P laboratory, which will send the samples to BIOFORTIS Nantes at the end&#xD;
      of the trial).&#xD;
