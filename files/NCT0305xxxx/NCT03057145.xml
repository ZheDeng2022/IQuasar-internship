      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for Advanced Solid Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LY2606368&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Olaparib&#xD;
    </textblock>

      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved LY2606368 as a treatment for&#xD;
      any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib for ovarian cancer but&#xD;
      it has not been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LY2606368 is a checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) inhibitor that is being developed as a treatment&#xD;
      for patients with advanced cancer. CHK1 inhibitors work by preventing the cancer cells from&#xD;
      being able to repair damaged DNA (one of the building blocks of a cell) which then leads to&#xD;
      cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib is a poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor. PARP is a protein in the body&#xD;
      that repairs damage to DNA. In cells that are rapidly growing such as cancer cells, blocking&#xD;
      repair of DNA may be of benefit, since it will cause the cell to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are combining LY2606368 with Olaparib in the hopes&#xD;
      that it will be a safe combination and that the LY2606368 will enhance how the cancer will&#xD;
      respond to Olaparib. In previous laboratory studies performed by treating cancer cells with a&#xD;
      CHK1 inhibitor and a PARP inhibitor, it was found that the CHK1 inhibitor was successful in&#xD;
      increasing efficacy.&#xD;

             calipers by clinical exam. See Section 11 for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no limits on prior lines of therapy; however, patients must have recovered&#xD;
             to eligibility levels from prior toxicity or adverse events as a result of previous&#xD;
             treatment prior to entering the study (except alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥18 years, as no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use&#xD;
             of prexasertib in combination with olaparib in patients &lt; 18 years of age, children&#xD;
             are excluded from this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of prexasertib and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, women of childbearing potential and male patients with partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception&#xD;
             (see Section 5.5.2) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
             for 3 months after completion of study. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must&#xD;
             also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, and for 3 months after completion of prexasertib and olaparib&#xD;
             administration. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential enrolling on study must have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Childbearing potential is defined as women who are not postmenopausal (defined as&#xD;
             amenorrheic for ≥ 12 months following cessation of any exogenous hormonal treatments;&#xD;

             oophorectomy with last menses &gt; 12 months prior; or chemotherapy-induced menopause&#xD;
             with last menses &gt; 12 months prior) or surgically sterile (bilateral oophorectomy or&#xD;
             hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Patients must be willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the&#xD;
             study including undergoing treatment and scheduled visits and examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to tolerate oral medications and not have gastrointestinal&#xD;
             processes that would preclude absorption of olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study. Patients who have received&#xD;
             prior PARP inhibitor will not be excluded. Patients who have received prior CHK1&#xD;
             inhibitor will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have undergone major surgery within 14 days of starting the study&#xD;
             treatment, or participants who have not recovered to baseline status from the effects&#xD;
             of surgery received more than 14 days prior.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis are excluded from&#xD;
             this clinical trial, with the exception of patients with brain metastatic disease that&#xD;
             has previously been treated and remained stable on MRI ≥ 2 months prior to enrollment,&#xD;
             without steroids or anti-epileptic medications. These patients may be enrolled at the&#xD;
             discretion of the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to prexasertib or olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, uncontrolled seizures, myocardial infarction within the past 3 months,&#xD;
             superior vena cava syndrome, unstable spinal cord compression (untreated and unstable&#xD;
             for at least 28 days prior to study entry), or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements. Additionally, patients with other&#xD;
             co-morbid disease or metabolic dysfunction that would render the subject at high risk&#xD;
             for treatment complications may be excluded at the discretion of the Principal&#xD;
             Investigator in the interest of patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of prexasertib and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason, pregnant women are excluded from this study. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with prexasertib and olaparib, breastfeeding women are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible&#xD;
             because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with prexasertib and&#xD;
             olaparib. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known active Hepatitis B or C.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received a previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consistent QTc &gt; 470 msec on more than one screening ECGs. Patients with a history of&#xD;
             long QTc syndrome or personal or family history of ventricular arrhythmias will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with involvement in the planning and/or conduct of the study (applies to&#xD;
             both AstraZeneca staff and/or staff at the study site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants receiving any medications or substances that are strong or moderate&#xD;
             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 are ineligible. Please see Section 5.5.1 for further&#xD;
             detail and required washout periods. Because the lists of these agents are constantly&#xD;
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently updated list such as&#xD;
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/table.aspx; medical reference texts such as&#xD;
             the Physicians' Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with evidence of pneumonitis on scans at screening will be excluded due&#xD;
             to pulmonary toxicities associated with olaparib&#xD;
