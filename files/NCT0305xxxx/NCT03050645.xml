  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with previous Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) are characterized by several&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities i.e. insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction and increased risk of&#xD;
      later Diabetes Mellitus (DM). These latent disorders of glucose metabolism are demasked by&#xD;
      the metabolic stress of pregnancy and as a routine, clinical assessment and measurement of&#xD;
      HbA1c in addition to an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is offered 3 months post partum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, women with previous GDM and a control group matched on age, time of birth and&#xD;
      BMI around 8 years after pregnancy will be investigated. Information from pregnancy and post&#xD;
      partum examination (GDM only) will be used to identify risk factors for later development of&#xD;
      DM. Further, life-style factors and mental health according to diabetes status will be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well established that women with previous GDM are characterized by several metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities i.e. insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction and increased risk of later&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus (DM). Furthermore, GDM is a heterogeneous condition covering both women&#xD;
      with a strong genetic disposition to type 2 DM, women in the early stages of autoimmune DM&#xD;
      and rare cases of monogenetic DM. These latent disorders of glucose metabolism are damasked&#xD;
      by the metabolic stress of pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study predictors of DM and pre-DM after GDM: a) At the time of pregnancy: age, blood&#xD;
           pressure, pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index (BMI), b) 3 months post partum: indices of&#xD;
           insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function, lipid profile, GAD-autoantibodies, HbA1c&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study lifestyle factors 7-8 years after GDM pregnancy in relation to current diabetes&#xD;
           status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 2011-2017 women with previous GDM and a control group are invited to a long-term&#xD;
      follow-up. Data collection is performed 7-8 years after pregnancy. GDM subjects (n~150),&#xD;
      controls (n~50):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Anthropometrics: weight, height, waist circumference, blood pressure and length&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Analyses: p-glucose, s-insulin at 0, 30 and 120 minutes during a 2-h 75 g OGTT. Fasting:&#xD;
           total cholesterol, HDL, LDL triglycerides, GAD- autoantibodies, Hba1C, Urine&#xD;
           albumin/creatinine ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Questionnaires: Information on lifestyle and health status&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data available around pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy data from hospital journals (GDM subjects and controls):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examinations 3 months post-partum (GDM subjects only):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination, 2-h 75 g OGTT with measurements of p-glucose and s- insulin at 0, 30&#xD;
      and 120 minutes, fasting total cholesterol, HDL, LDL and triglycerides, HbA1c and GAD-&#xD;
      autoantibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our current population is unique as clinical, metabolic and autoimmune markers were&#xD;
      determined prospectively a few months after GDM pregnancy and at follow-up. Hopefully, the&#xD;
      results will enable us to target preventive actions in women with previous GDM and improve&#xD;
      our understanding of pathophysiologic mechanisms in pre-diabetic conditions.&#xD;
