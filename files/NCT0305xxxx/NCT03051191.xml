    <textblock>
      Subjects with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have higher incidence of cancers compared to&#xD;
      general population. The investigators hypothesized that shared molecular mechanism play a&#xD;
      pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CVD including heart failure (HF) and cancers. To address&#xD;
      this hypothesis, the investigators are going to explore the expression pattern of micro RNA&#xD;
      (miRNA) and cell free DNA (cfDNA) derived from host, gut microbiota and gut microbiota&#xD;
      composition extensively in patients with or without CVD, non-ischemic HF (NIHF), and cancers.&#xD;
      The participants will be recruited from the outpatient clinic in Sakakibara Heart Institute&#xD;
      or Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research. By comparing the expression pattern of miRNA,&#xD;
      cfDNA, or gut microbiota composition, the investigators are seeking to find the pathogenic&#xD;
      mechanisms shared by those diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that subjects with cardiovascular diseases (CVD) have higher incidence&#xD;
      of cancers compared with general population. Because of the genetic and traditional&#xD;
      commonalities between the underlying causes of CVD and cancers, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that shared molecular mechanism play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of CVD&#xD;
      including heart failure (HF) and cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, single-stranded non-coding RNA sequences of about 18-22&#xD;
      nucleotides that interact with specific target messenger RNAs. They are known to be involved&#xD;
      in the various processes including development, homeostasis, cell differentiation,&#xD;
      proliferation, apoptosis and various diseases by modulating post-transcriptional and&#xD;
      translational processes. Some of miRNAs have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis&#xD;
      of cancers. Cell free DNAs (cfDNA) is extracellular nucleic acids found in cell-free plasma&#xD;
      in humans. Elevated level of cfDNA was reported in patients with cancer and CVD. 16S&#xD;
      ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes are distinct in microbiota, which can be utilized to quantify the&#xD;
      bacterial DNA in the systemic circulation. 16S rRNA genes are also shown to be elevated in&#xD;
      patients with CVD. These findings imply the possibility that translocated microbiota might&#xD;
      play pivotal roles in the pathogenesis of CVD and cancers. The quantity and composition of&#xD;
      gut microbiota have been shown to be altered in various diseases including obesity, diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus, hypertension and CVD. The previous findings from fecal transplantation experiments,&#xD;
      which showed the disease phenotype was transferred from one to another subject (animal or&#xD;
      human), strongly suggest the possibility that microbiota play some pathogenic roles in those&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address this hypothesis, the investigators are going to cross-sectionally explore the&#xD;
      expression pattern of miRNA and cfDNA and the composition of gut microbiota extensively in&#xD;
      patients with or without atherosclerotic CVD (ACVD), non-ischemic HF (NIHF), and cancers. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit the participants from the patients who regularly visit the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic in Sakakibara Heart Institute or The Cancer Institute Hospital of Japanese&#xD;
      Foundation of Cancer Research. The investigators will recruit the patients without ACVD or&#xD;
      NIHF and with/without cancers (Group 1/2), those with ACVD and with/without cancers (Group&#xD;
      3/4), and those with NIHF and with/without cancers (Group 5/6). Their peripheral blood will&#xD;
      be drawn and stools will be collected. miRNA in exosome will be extracted from plasma and&#xD;
      explored by miRNA microarray. cfDNA pattern will be extensively explored by microarray. By&#xD;
      comparing the expression pattern of miRNA and cfDNA, and the composition of gut microbiota by&#xD;
      16s rRNA gene shotgun analysis, the investigators will be seeking to find the molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms shared by those diseases.&#xD;
