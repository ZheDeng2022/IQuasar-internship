  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oxycodone is an oral opioid analgesic that is most commonly prescribed for the management of&#xD;
      pain in post-operative patients at Boston Children's Hospital. Oxycodone has been widely used&#xD;
      in adults and children to relieve post-operative pain. However, its pharmacokinetics (what it&#xD;
      does in the body) and pharmacodynamics (how it works) have not been well established in&#xD;
      children. Some children, because of their specific genetic make-up, may metabolize the drug&#xD;
      more quickly and therefore may be at risk for more side effects in the commonly prescribed&#xD;
      dose. The investigators would like to find out more about how general anesthesia (GA) effects&#xD;
      how this drug is absorbed, metabolized and excreted in children. In order to study these&#xD;
      aspects, the investigators would like to give oxycodone to surgical patients (group one will&#xD;
      receive oxycodone at the beginning of GA and group two will receive oxycodone at the end of&#xD;
      GA) at Boston Children's Hospital then measure its metabolic activity and also perform a&#xD;
      specific genetic analysis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research will involve two treatment groups: (children 2-5 years old) and (children 6-8&#xD;
      years old). The first group will include 20 children 2-5 years old. In this group the&#xD;
      children will be randomized to either receive 0.1mg/kg of liquid oxycodone via an orogastric&#xD;
      (OG) tube after induction but before the procedure at the beginning of general anesthesia, or&#xD;
      0.1mg/kg of liquid oxycodone via an OG tube after the procedure at the end of general&#xD;
      anesthesia. Every patient will receive inhalational or intravenous induction of anesthesia as&#xD;
      decided by the anesthesia team on the day of surgery, as is routine clinical care. An&#xD;
      intravenous cannula (IV) will be inserted in every patient as part of their routine clinical&#xD;
      care. No additional intravenous line will be required for this study. An arterial line will&#xD;
      only be used if indicated by surgical procedure. As part of the study protocol, a blood&#xD;
      sample (5 mL) will be taken from the IV and sent for genetic analysis. The genetic testing is&#xD;
      specifically to analyze the following genotypes only: cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and 3A4,&#xD;
      which represent the differences in cytochrome P450 metabolism of oxycodone. An orogastric&#xD;
      tube will be placed in the stomach (placement verified by routine accepted clinical&#xD;
      guidelines) under anesthesia as is part of standard routine clinical care to remove gastric&#xD;
      contents. The same orogastric tube will be used for intragastric liquid oxycodone&#xD;
      administration in a dose of 0.1 mg/kg either before the procedure (beginning of general&#xD;
      anesthesia) or after the procedure (end of general anesthesia). This weight-adjusted dose of&#xD;
      0.1 mg/kg is administered as per standard clinical dosing guidelines at Boston Children's&#xD;
      Hospital..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will include 20 patients (children 6-8 years old). In this group the&#xD;
      children will be randomize to either receive 0.1 mg/kg of liquid oxycodone per oral (PO)&#xD;
      before the surgery in pre-op holding, or 0.1 mg/kg of liquid oxycodone PO after surgery in&#xD;
      the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of routine clinical care, the anesthesiologist may give any of the following&#xD;
      narcotics for additional pain management based on their clinical judgment: Fentanyl,&#xD;
      sufentanil, and remifentanyl. For the purposes of this study, the following narcotics will&#xD;
      not be administered: morphine and hydromorphone. Additionally, oxycodone will not be&#xD;
      administered after the initial study dose in the operating room. These medications produce&#xD;
      metabolites that would interfere with the pharmacokinetics being studied. Furthermore,&#xD;
      morphine, hydromorphone and oxycodone will be withheld during the entire study period (up to&#xD;
      24 hours). This is not standard clinical care, but withholding&#xD;
      morphine/hydromorphone/oxycodone will not result in any additional risk for the patient,&#xD;
      since there are equally effective pain management options available which are standard of&#xD;
      care. If the clinician deems that morphine, hydromorphone, or oxycodone is necessary for&#xD;
      clinical care, it will not be withheld, and the patient will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 11 blood samples will be drawn for the study. The first sample will be sent for&#xD;
      genetic testing. The other 10 samples will be drawn at the following time points: sample 1:&#xD;
      within 2 hours of post dose oxycodone, sample 2-7: within 30 to 90 min after last sample&#xD;
      drawn and within 12 hours post dose oxycodone, sample 8-10: anytime between 12 to 24 hours&#xD;
      post dose oxycodone (assigned as clinically indicated based on duration of surgery to&#xD;
      minimize patient disturbance). Therefore, blood samples (1 mL each) will be drawn at 10&#xD;
      different time points in each patient. Blood for the study purposes will be drawn from the&#xD;
      existing intravenous line or arterial line at the specific time points indicated when the&#xD;
      child is under anesthesia. Postoperatively, regarding the timing of the blood draws, it is&#xD;
      not necessary to be exact but rather to accurately record the time that the sample is taken.&#xD;
      Thus, this will be coordinated with the drawing of routine laboratory tests if possible, in&#xD;
      order to minimize patient discomfort.&#xD;
