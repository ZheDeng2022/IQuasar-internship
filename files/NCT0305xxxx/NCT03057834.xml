      Investigators plan a prospective cohort study with an adaptive design based on physical&#xD;
      function status. The design will involve tracking the number of women recruited with physical&#xD;
      function impairment and those without any functional impairment. Investigators aim to recruit&#xD;
      similar numbers of women in each group. If investigators find unequal numbers, they will&#xD;
      adapt recruit strategies based on a woman's functional status.&#xD;

      Investigators plan a prospective cohort study with an adaptive design based on physical&#xD;
      function status. The design will involve tracking the number of women recruited with physical&#xD;
      function impairment and those without any functional impairment. Investigators aim to recruit&#xD;
      similar numbers of women in each group. If they find unequal numbers, they will adapt recruit&#xD;
      strategies based on a woman's functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will compare changes in outcome measures within and between groups after 6 and&#xD;
      12 weeks of pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFME). The change in pelvic floor&#xD;
      strength/efficiency will be assessed by repeating the pelvic floor PERFECT assessment and&#xD;
      will be compared between groups. Changes in UI symptoms, symptom severity, and impact of UI&#xD;
      symptoms on quality of life will be determined using standardized measures described above.&#xD;
      Data analysis will define associations between changes in PERFECT measures and the change in&#xD;
      UI episodes (based on 3-day voiding diary), severity, and type (based on QUID-7), and impact&#xD;
      on quality of life (PFIQ-7) within and between groups. Objective measurement of&#xD;
      lower-extremity strength will inform the relationship between lower-extremity strength,&#xD;
      pelvic floor strength, and UI symptoms at baseline and the 6-week visit.&#xD;
