  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the advantages already demonstrated by FLACS, these surgeries still require&#xD;
      ultrasonic devices for fragmentation of the lens. The ultrasonic energy used during&#xD;
      phacoemulsification may induce complications such as reduction of endothelial cells and&#xD;
      corneal edema. In this sense, it would be beneficial to develop surgical techniques that&#xD;
      eliminate the need for ultrasound. The group of surgeons of Alfredo Tranjan Ophthalmic&#xD;
      Center, recently developed a surgical technique of cataract that optimizes the use of the&#xD;
      laser, eliminating the need for ultrasound during the surgical procedure. Thus, the&#xD;
      crystalline fragmentation process does not involve ultrasound being performed by the laser&#xD;
      itself. It is expected that this procedure will reduce the complexity of cataract surgery,&#xD;
      and be safer in terms of potential corneal lesions. The present study intends to evaluate the&#xD;
      benefit and safety of FLACS without use of ultrasound (USFREE), compared to traditional&#xD;
      phacoemulsification surgery using ultrasound in patients with senile cataract. In this sense,&#xD;
      it is intended to primarily compare the volume of balanced saline solution (BSS) between&#xD;
      surgeries.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cataract surgery, the FLACS USFREE technique is not inferior to the traditional&#xD;
      phacoemulsification technique using ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare non-use ultrasound FLACS (USFREE) versus traditional phacoemulsification surgery&#xD;
      using ultrasound in eyes undergoing cataract surgery relative to the volume of BSS measured&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective (s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare cumulative dissipated energy (CDE) used between eyes submitted to FLACS&#xD;
           USFREE versus traditional phacoemulsification with ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare eyes submitted to FLACS USFREE versus traditional phacoemulsification surgery&#xD;
           using ultrasound, relative to phacoemulsification time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparing eyes subjected to FLACS USFREE versus traditional phacoemulsification surgery&#xD;
           using ultrasound 1, 7 and 30 days after surgery, for the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Endothelial cell count.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visual acuity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Corneal topography.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The corneal pachymetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intraocular pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the safety profile of FLACS USFREE versus phacoemulsification surgery with&#xD;
           ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional, randomized, open and controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be divided into 2 groups (FLACS without ultrasound and traditional&#xD;
      phacoemulsification with ultrasound) and the following visits will be conducted:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit -1 (pre-operative visit - day -30 to day -1 of surgery). Assessment in both eyes.&#xD;
           If the two eyes of the research participant are eligible for the study, the eye with the&#xD;
           least visual acuity that is designated by O1 will be selected and operated first. The&#xD;
           second operated eye will be designated O2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 0 (O1 surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1 (day 1 [+ 2 days] after O1 surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2 (day 7 [± 2 days] after O1 surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 3 (day 30 [± 2 days] after O1 surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research participants with the second eligible eye (O2) will further perform the following&#xD;
      assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 4 (O2 surgery, which will occur on the same day of Visit 3 [+ 45 days]).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 5 (day 1 [± 2 days] after O2 surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6 (day 7 [± 2 days] after O2 surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 7 (day 30 [± 2 days] after O2 surgery). Randomization process The included study&#xD;
           participants will be allocated to one of the 2 treatment groups through&#xD;
           computer-generated randomization (1: 1 randomization). In research participants with&#xD;
           both eyes eligible, the surgical procedure will always be the same for both eyes.&#xD;

    <description>Simulated keratometry (Yes K) will be measured in each eye at V-1, V1, V2 and V3 (and V5, V6 and V7 for O2) using the Pentacam® system (OCULUS, WA, USA).

A Sim K will be obtained by averaging the power of the anterior surface of the cornea along a 3 mm center ring, measured in diopters (D). In order to minimize bias, measurements will always be made on the same device, with the same operator or their back-up, both with the same training.</description>
