  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I study designed to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pyrimethamine&#xD;
      and provide the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the treatment of intermediate/high-risk&#xD;
      MDS that is refractory to or relapsed after treatment with azanucleosides.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the safety, dose tolerance, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of pyrimethamine in intermediate / high-risk / relapsed or&#xD;
      azanucleoside-refractory MDS within the confines of a phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pyrimethamine self-administered by participants orally once per day in morning with food.&#xD;
      Phase 1 study will start at dose of 50 mg once per day. (NOTE: For participants at dose level&#xD;
      of 50mg, the dose reduction, if needed is 25 mg.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intra-patient dose escalation is permitted (not beyond the highest dose allowed) if Complete&#xD;
      Remission/Response (CR) is not reached in week 1 of Cycle 3 and there is no significant&#xD;
      toxicity. (NOTE: In this study, the term &quot;intra-patient&quot; indicates within each participant&#xD;
      and not between different participants; i.e., dose escalation will be done within each&#xD;
      individual participant.) The decision to escalate intra-patient doses will be based on safety&#xD;
      and dose tolerance assessments made at the end of one treatment cycle (28 days of continuous&#xD;
      drug administration) for all 6 participants. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the&#xD;
      occurrence of two consecutive grade 2 or 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) not recovered within&#xD;
      24 hours at a given dose. MTD will be defined as the dose where no DLT is observed among&#xD;
      three consecutive participants, or no more than one DLT among six participants. Participants&#xD;
      will be treated initially for one 28-day cycle followed by a toxicity evaluation - Toxicity&#xD;
      and adverse effect assessments will be made on Day 1 and Day 28 of every cycle of therapy.&#xD;
