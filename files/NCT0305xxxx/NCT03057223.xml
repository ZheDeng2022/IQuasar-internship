  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical titanium plates are routinely used in fixing mobilized bone segments in jaw&#xD;
      surgeries. Generally these plates are commercialized with standard construction&#xD;
      specifications. Thus they should be repeatedly bended and arched to match the contour of&#xD;
      anchored jaw bones before located in place and fastened by screws. To prevent stress fatigue&#xD;
      induced by plate bending and improve structural design, we utilized the three-dimensional&#xD;
      printing technique and developed a new production procedure in fabricating customized&#xD;
      titanium plates according to each patient's specific skeletal contours and dimensions derived&#xD;
      from medical imaging data. In general, the three-dimensional printing of customized implants&#xD;
      are expected to facilitate surgical operation, reduce application duration and improve&#xD;
      precise restoration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up until now, the application of three-dimensional printing of titanium fixation plates in&#xD;
      jaw surgery has been available only at two centers globally. The published preliminary work&#xD;
      have proved the prospect of customized titanium plates in promoting mandibular reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery and upper maxilla orthognathic surgery though their printed titanium plates looked&#xD;
      rather bulky and the sample sizes were small and there is still lack of qualified randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials between the printed and the conventional titanium plates. To better benefit&#xD;
      from the burgeoning use of three-dimensional printing in health care, it is imperative to&#xD;
      conduct a feasibility study in exploring the application of three-dimensional printing of&#xD;
      titanium fixation plates in jaw surgery based on our patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to conduct a case series study focusing on the feasibility and safety&#xD;
      of applying three-dimensional printed titanium plates in jaw reconstruction surgery and&#xD;
      orthognathic surgery. The outcome measures include the success rate, potential adverse events&#xD;
      and accuracy. A sample size of 48 subjects will be recruited prospectively. Considering the&#xD;
      facts that titanium plates are widely used in jaw surgery and our unit is the largest oral&#xD;
      and maxillofacial surgery center in Hong Kong, the well-designed customized titanium plate is&#xD;
      therefore with great potential benefit for the patients in our population. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      well-developed three-dimensional manufacturing protocol could also be applied in other&#xD;
      relevant medical areas and push forward the personalized medicine era in the future.&#xD;

      Plate osteosynthesis is the basic philosophy in maintaining skeletal stabilization in jaw&#xD;
      surgery. Numerous branded osteosynthesis systems are available and most of them are made from&#xD;
      pure titanium or titanium alloys with standard construction specifications. Usually these&#xD;
      titanium plates should be bended and arched to better match the three-dimensional contour of&#xD;
      anchored jaw bones. However the optimal bending of the titanium plate sometimes is difficult&#xD;
      and time-consuming especially for the inexperienced surgeons and in complicated cases.&#xD;
      Excessive bending could also initiate residual stress and potentially worsen the mechanical&#xD;
      properties of titanium plates(1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three-dimensional (3D) printing, or additive manufacturing, has been well developed in&#xD;
      fabricating customized materials from the computer-generated digital files. In recent years,&#xD;
      3D printing of patient-specific medical implants has been evolving with the newly-emerged&#xD;
      technology of powder bed fusion, which enabled the melting of metals and further shaping of&#xD;
      devices(2). In September 2015, China's innovative 3D printed hip joint prosthesis was&#xD;
      commercially certified by China's State Food and Drug Administration. In February 2016, the&#xD;
      world's first 3D printed patient-specific titanium cranial/craniofacial plate implant got the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval. Beyond that, a number of other printed implants&#xD;
      have showed excellent performance in clinical research. These printed medical implants are&#xD;
      majorly from pure titanium or Ti6Al4V alloy, which exhibit good resistance to fatigue and&#xD;
      corrosion and are considered the most biocompatible metal(3). Relying on individualized&#xD;
      imaging data, the printed implants are patient-specific and adapt to the anatomical&#xD;
      structures precisely. Since the additive manufacturing is ultimately different from the&#xD;
      conventional multi-step production operations, it could reduce costs and lead times,&#xD;
      especially in printing complex devices for individualized cases. While in clinical&#xD;
      applications, 3D printing of customized implants are expected to facilitate surgical&#xD;
      operation, reduce application duration and improve precise restoration(4). It is predicted&#xD;
      the application of 3D printing technique in medical area may bring forward another major&#xD;
      advance toward personalized medicine(5). Many more customized medical implants will be&#xD;
      approved in the future across the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of metal additive manufacturing, the 3D-printed patient-specific titanium&#xD;
      plates have been successfully fabricated. In 2012, Per Derand et al. reported the first&#xD;
      application of 3D-printed titanium plates with the established workflow from imaging, via&#xD;
      virtual design, to manufacturing of cutting guide and customized titanium reconstruction&#xD;
      plates, and its utility in the fibula-based mandibular reconstruction surgery. The&#xD;
      pre-printed plates did facilitate the operation and reduced the operation duration about half&#xD;
      an hour though the postoperative accuracy of the grafted bone was modest compared with the&#xD;
      virtual planning(6). Simultaneously, Leonardo Ciocca et al. reported the computer-aided&#xD;
      designing and manufacturing in guiding secondary mandibular reconstruction of a discontinuity&#xD;
      defect involving the employment of the surgical guide and printed titanium reconstruction&#xD;
      plate in surgical transferring of virtual planning(7). In 2013, Simona Mazzoni and Leonardo&#xD;
      Ciocca et al. applied the same surgical protocol in a study group of seven mandibular&#xD;
      reconstruction patients and compared its advantages with the standard pre-plating technique&#xD;
      on stereolithographic models in a control group. The results revealed the computer-aided&#xD;
      surgical protocol was viable in reproducing the patients' anatomical contour, giving the&#xD;
      surgeon better procedural control and reducing procedure time(8). In 2015, Simona Mazzoni et&#xD;
      al. further developed the computer-aided designing and manufacturing technique in fabricating&#xD;
      surgical cutting guides and titanium fixation plates in upper maxilla repositioning surgery&#xD;
      without an occlusal wafer. The study result confirmed the high accuracy in transferring the&#xD;
      virtual planning by using the surgical guides and fixation plates(9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In reviewing the literature, the application of 3D printing of titanium fixation plates in&#xD;
      jaw surgery are available only at two centers currently: the Maxillofacial Surgery Department&#xD;
      of S Orsola Malpighi Hospital in Italy and the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Department of&#xD;
      Lund University in Sweden(6,7). The published preliminary work have proved the prospect of&#xD;
      3D-printed titanium plates in promoting mandibular reconstruction surgery and upper maxilla&#xD;
      orthognathic surgery though their printed titanium plates looked rather bulky and the sample&#xD;
      sizes were small and there is still lack of qualified randomized controlled trials between&#xD;
      the printed and the conventional titanium plates. To better benefit from the burgeoning use&#xD;
      of 3D printing in health care, we will develop a new designing and manufacturing protocol in&#xD;
      printing customized fixation plates, which will be designed in specific loading circumstances&#xD;
      and will perfectly adapt to the anatomical structures of the jaw. It is imperative to conduct&#xD;
      a feasibility study in exploring the application of 3D printing of titanium fixation plates&#xD;
      in jaw surgery based on our patients.&#xD;
