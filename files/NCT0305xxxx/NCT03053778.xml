      This study aims to investigate the effect of an intervention consisting of early,&#xD;
      individualised outpatient follow-up after heart valve surgery on unplanned readmissions and&#xD;
      death within 180-days after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Health economics and health-related quality of life will be investigated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The incidence of valvular heart disease is estimated to exceed 42 million people worldwide.&#xD;
      In Denmark 1700 patients undergo heart valve surgery every year and the number is increasing&#xD;
      due to an ageing population. The most common heart valve diseases is aortic stenosis,&#xD;
      followed by mitral regurgitation and aortic regurgitation, whereas only few patients are&#xD;
      treated in Denmark for mitral stenosis and primary tricuspid valve and pulmonic valve&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart valve surgery can be a lifesaving procedure for patients with severe symptomatic heart&#xD;
      valve disease, but complications after heart valve surgery are common and readmissions&#xD;
      frequent with rates exceeding 40% in Denmark. Most frequent causes for readmission, includes&#xD;
      new onset atrial fibrillation, pleural and pericardial effusions, infections and acute heart&#xD;
      failure. These causes can potentially be detected by careful outpatient follow-up in order to&#xD;
      avoid unplanned readmission, and improve mental, physical and social health outcomes. A&#xD;
      recent Danish study demonstrated that 56% of surgical heart valve patients were readmitted&#xD;
      within a year and readmission was associated with low psychical and mental PROs. PROs'&#xD;
      include validated patient health status surveys that allow quantification of critical&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes. Further previous studies have suggested an association between&#xD;
      PROs and prolonged hospital stay, morbidity and mortality in cardiac patients. Knowledge&#xD;
      about PROs can potentially be used to identify patients that especially may benefit from&#xD;
      intensified follow-up after heart valve surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing guidelines recommend that patients following valve surgery are reviewed on a regular&#xD;
      basis by a cardiologist with special knowledge about heart valve diseases. A recent European&#xD;
      study demonstrate though, a gap between the existing guidelines and clinical practice. A&#xD;
      plausible way to improving the postoperative care could be to introduce a multidisciplinary&#xD;
      heart valve clinic (HVC), where specialized nurses educates the patients while intervening&#xD;
      and supporting the patients after surgery in collaboration with cardiologist and surgeons.&#xD;
      This has proven efficient in improving outcomes such as, mortality, readmission and quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with heart failure.3 A multidisciplinary teamwork can provide a timely&#xD;
      access to a clinical review of the patient and simultaneously look for signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      valve dysfunction.18 Although, previous studies have described the HVCs. Although, previous&#xD;
      studies have described the HVCs, the effect gained from HVC compared to usual care on&#xD;
      readmission, mortality, cost-utility and patient-reported outcomes have not yet&#xD;
      systematically been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim for this study is firstly to describe PROs after heart valve surgery, incorporate the&#xD;
      knowledge into a structured intervention, and secondly to evaluate a HVC and its association&#xD;
      to PRO's, readmission, mortality and cost-utility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consist of two parts,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matched cohort study comparing HVC to a historical control group to evaluate the effect&#xD;
           of the HVC on readmission, mortality and HRQoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A health economic analysis of effect of the HVC compared to a historical control Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention and collection of clinical data: Introducing a HVC to gain knowledge of its&#xD;
      effect on readmission, mortality and health economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative: Clinical data regarding the patient will be gathered at admission including&#xD;
      calculated Euroscore II, pulmonary function measured with spirometry, status on nutrition,&#xD;
      smoking and alcohol consumption, BMI, electrocardiography (ECG), and most recent&#xD;
      echocardiography. Furthermore, the patients' frailty status will be assessed with a gait&#xD;
      speed test the day before surgery and will be used in the risk model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative: Before discharge a trained cardiac nurse will perform a screening for pleural&#xD;
      and pericardial effusion, volume overload, risk for atrial fibrillation and repeat frailty&#xD;
      assessment. Before discharge the patients' medication will be evaluated and adapted according&#xD;
      to their clinical status, and the patients will be educated in warning signs after surgery.&#xD;
      The surgical status will be evaluated before discharge. Based on these data and the PROs the&#xD;
      patients' follow-up will be individualized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up: The specific follow-up will be planed according to the patients' status where&#xD;
      patients considered at high risk of being readmitted based on the clinical evaluation at&#xD;
      discharge (e.g. atrial fibrillation) will have a more intensive follow-up. The focus of the&#xD;
      follow-up will be a status on the patients' physical condition regarding; weight, pain and&#xD;
      shortness of breath in combination with the areas of the PROs from study I. Consideration on&#xD;
      further follow-up will be made depending on the condition of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1 month all patients will be seen in the HVC where ECG and echocardiography will be&#xD;
      performed. At each visit the patient will be educated and informed regarding the disease and&#xD;
      illnesses, which should lead to a better understanding and self-management of care in the&#xD;
      post-operative period. The aim of the education is to give the patient the insight to&#xD;
      promptly identify and report the symptoms and signs for progression of their valve disease or&#xD;
      dysfunction of their prosthetic or repaired valve. The patient education thereby also aims to&#xD;
      improve the patients' wellbeing and psychological condition by an increase of the feeling of&#xD;
      security and by preventing poor physical outcomes.&#xD;
