    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well nivolumab and brentuximab vedotin work after stem cell&#xD;
      transplant in treating patients with high-risk classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has come back&#xD;
      (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab and brentuximab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the efficacy of nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin consolidation after autologous&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in participants with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
      (HL), as assessed by 18-month progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the overall survival (OS), the cumulative incidence of relapse/progression, the&#xD;
      cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality (TRM) in participants with relapsed/ refractory&#xD;
      HL who receive nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin consolidation after ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the overall response rate to nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin therapy in&#xD;
      participants with measurable disease after ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Establish the safety and tolerability of nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin when used as&#xD;
      consolidation after ASCT in participants with relapsed/ refractory HL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate the Lymphoma Response to Immunomodulatory therapy Criteria (LYRIC) definition of&#xD;
      indeterminate response to guide the management of patients regarding treatment past&#xD;
      progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Explore the impact of nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin therapy on immune reconstitution&#xD;
      after ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Explore the prognostic impact of and temporal dynamics of minimal residual disease (MRD)&#xD;
      in the peripheral blood as assessed by the next-generation sequencing-based ClonoSEQ&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Explore the prognostic impact of 9p24.1 abnormalities in tumor tissue assessed by&#xD;
      fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on outcomes after ASCT and nivolumab plus&#xD;
      brentuximab vedotin post-ASCT consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Explore the relationship between immune cells and Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) in&#xD;
      tumor samples by 6-color quantitative spatial image analysis using the Vectra system, and&#xD;
      correlate with outcome after ASCT and nivolumab plus brentuximab vedotin post-ASCT&#xD;
      consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Explore whether genetic alterations (e.g. gene expression profiles or genetic mutations)&#xD;
      in HL tumor samples are associated with outcome after ASCT and nivolumab plus brentuximab&#xD;
      vedotin post-ASCT consolidation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 30-60 days post-ASCT, patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30 minutes and nivolumab IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up&#xD;
      to 8 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days, at 3, 6,&#xD;
      12, and 18 months from start of treatment, and then biannually thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression-free survival</measure>
    <time_frame>From the first dose of study treatment to the first observation of disease relapse/progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first, assessed at 18 months</time_frame>
    <description>Progression-free survival will be estimated using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier along with the Greenwood estimator of standard error. When there is no censoring in progression-free survival prior to 18 months after the first dose of study treatment, the observed 18-month progression-free survival will be compared to the baseline of 65% by one-sided exact test of binomial proportion. In case of censoring in progression-free survival prior to 18 months after the first dose of study treatment, the Kaplan-Meier estimate for 18-month progression-free survival along with the Greenwood standard error estimator will be used for the testing of null hypothesis at 65%.</description>
