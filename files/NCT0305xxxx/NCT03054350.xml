    <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding) that occurred in the protocol-specified AE reporting period. An AE included medical conditions, signs, and symptoms not previously observed in the participant that emerged during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with pre-existing underlying conditions that were not present prior to the AE reporting period. An AE that met one or more of the following criteria or outcomes was classified as serious: death; life-threatening; in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect; was considered a medically important event not meeting the above criteria, but which could jeopardize a participant, or could require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the criteria listed in this definition.</description>

        <description>An adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence (including a clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding) that occurred in the protocol-specified AE reporting period. An AE included medical conditions, signs, and symptoms not previously observed in the participant that emerged during the protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with pre-existing underlying conditions that were not present prior to the AE reporting period. An AE that met one or more of the following criteria or outcomes was classified as serious: death; life-threatening; in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly/birth defect; was considered a medically important event not meeting the above criteria, but which could jeopardize a participant, or could require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the criteria listed in this definition.</description>
