    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 2, open-label, single-arm study is to determine the safety and the&#xD;
      maximal tolerated dose (MTD) of VAL-083 in combination with a standard of care radiation&#xD;
      regimen when used to treat newly diagnosed GBM in patients with unmethylated promoter of the&#xD;
      methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (uMGMT) gene. Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties will be&#xD;
      explored and tumor responses to treatment will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are the most common primary central nervous system tumors found in adults,&#xD;
      with WHO Grade IV malignant glioma (GBM) representing the most aggressive and prevalent&#xD;
      sub-type of these tumors having one of the worst 5-year survival rates among all human&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy for patients with malignant gliomas has traditionally involved maximal&#xD;
      surgical resection/debulking of the primary tumor (if feasible), followed by adjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy over 6-8 weeks, with or without chemotherapy. The oral alkylating agent&#xD;
      temozolomide was found to increase median survival when used in combination with&#xD;
      radiotherapy, compared to radiotherapy alone, in patients with newly diagnosed GBM. However,&#xD;
      expression of O6-methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) in GBM has been linked to poor&#xD;
      patient outcome in patients treated with temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, dianhydrogalactitol (VAL 083) is a bi-functional N7 DNA alkylating agent&#xD;
      which has demonstrated cytotoxic activity that is independent of chemo-resistance due to&#xD;
      expression of MGMT. This makes VAL-083 an ideal candidate to treat patients who are unlikely&#xD;
      to respond to temozolomide due to MGMT expression in their GBM. Furthermore, VAL-083 acted as&#xD;
      a radio-sensitizer at low (1 - 2.5μM) concentrations in all GBM cultures tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAL-083 has been studied extensively in the United States by the National Cancer Institute.&#xD;
      The NCI studies suggested that VAL-083 appeared to have activity in some types of cancer&#xD;
      (lung and brain), including GBM; however, further VAL-083 research was not pursued in the US&#xD;
      due to an increased focus on targeted biologic therapies during that era. VAL-083 has also&#xD;
      been studied in the People's Republic of China, where it is currently approved and marketed&#xD;
      for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and lung cancer. At present, VAL-083 is being&#xD;
      studied in clinical trials in the United States as a third-line treatment option for patients&#xD;
      with recurrent GBM following failure of surgery, radiation therapy, temozolomide and&#xD;
      bevacizumab. Interim results support safety of VAL-083 in this population; to date, a regimen&#xD;
      of 40mg/m2/d x 3 days IV in a 21 day cycle has been confirmed to be safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase 2, open-label, single arm study will be conducted in a dose-escalation cohort&#xD;
      scheme to confirm the optimal dose of VAL-083, when administered concurrently with radiation&#xD;
      therapy. Dose escalation will proceed in three sequential cohorts, consisting of patients&#xD;
      receiving VAL-083 at 20, 30 and 40 mg/m2/d x 3 every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will be conducted in 2 parts. Part 1 will consist of 1) a 42-day induction period,&#xD;
      during which patients will receive VAL-083 while undergoing radiation treatment at a dose of&#xD;
      2 Gy per fraction given once daily five days per week (Monday through Friday) over a period&#xD;
      of six weeks (for a total dose of 60 Gy), followed by 2) adjuvant maintenance therapy with&#xD;
      VAL-083 alone, administered daily x 3 IV every 3 weeks at the same assigned dose, for a&#xD;
      maximum of 8 maintenance cycles. Part 2 will comprise an expansion phase, in which VAL-083&#xD;
      will be studied in up to 20 additional subjects. The dose of VAL-083 that will be studied in&#xD;
      Part 2 will be determined from Part 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo safety assessments including physical examinations, vital signs,&#xD;
      hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, a pharmacokinetic study may be conducted at treatment Cycle 1 Day&#xD;
      1, in consenting patients. For patients consenting to CSF collection by lumbar puncture, a&#xD;
      CSF sample will be obtained after completion of the Cycle 1, Day 3 VAL-083 infusion. These&#xD;
      patients will also have a blood sample taken for VAL-083 plasma level after completion of&#xD;
      drug infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response parameters will be evaluated according to the Response Assessment in NeuroOncology&#xD;
      (RANO).&#xD;
