    <textblock>
      This phase 1 first-in-human (FIH) dose escalation study will determine the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of KO-947 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed&#xD;
      and/or refractory, non-hematological malignancies. If an MTD cannot be identified, a&#xD;
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. In addition, two tumor specific extension&#xD;
      cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity.&#xD;

      cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Three dosing schedules will be executed&#xD;
      (Schedule 1, 2, or 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening evaluations will be completed following signing of informed consent and within&#xD;
      either 21 days or 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Evaluations performed as part of the standard of&#xD;
      care within 21/28 days of dosing but prior to consent do not need to be repeated. By signing&#xD;
      the consent form, study subjects agree to the collection of standard of care health&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of three parts: dose escalation, MTD expansion and tumor specific&#xD;
      extension.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>

    Due to a strategic business decision Kura has stopped development of KO-947. Neither safety nor&#xD;
    efficacy reasons were the cause of study termination.&#xD;
