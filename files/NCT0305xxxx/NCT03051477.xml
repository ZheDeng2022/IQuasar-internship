  <brief_summary>

      This study will seek to determine the safety and toxicity profile as well as the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose of Helixor® M in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I study that consists of two phases: a dose escalation phase and an&#xD;
      expansion phase. The dose escalation phase will be used to evaluate the safety and toxicity&#xD;
      of Helixor® M (mistletoe extract). An accelerated titration design (ATD) will be utilized to&#xD;
      determine the MTD. The expansion phase will be used to obtain preliminary efficacy data about&#xD;
      Helixor® M.&#xD;

             treatments for metastatic disease. Patients must either have progressed, are&#xD;
             refractory, have stable disease and/or removed from therapy due to toxicities.&#xD;
             Patients beyond first line therapy that do not meet criteria may be considered on a&#xD;
             case by case basis and allowed at discretion of PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with the presence of at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1&#xD;
             criteria for response assessment. Prostate cancer patients with bone disease only are&#xD;

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN (patients with diagnosed Gilbert's Syndrome will not&#xD;
                  be excluded if their direct bilirubin is within normal institutional limits)&#xD;

             If the urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test will be required. The serum pregnancy test must be negative for the patient to be&#xD;
             eligible.&#xD;
