      The study will examine which differences there are in comorbidity and complications collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from medical records compared with data collected prospectively in two groups&#xD;
      of patients undergoing either radical cystectomy or radical nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis is that he prevalence of registered comorbidity and minor complications in&#xD;
      patients who have undergone radical cystectomy or nephrectomy, will increase if the data&#xD;
      collection is focused and prospective, compared with retrospectively collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Patients included&#xD;
      in the study will be randomized to either control or intervention in the ratio 1:1. There are&#xD;
      two groups of patients: Patients admitted to radical cystectomy and patients admitted to&#xD;
      radical nephrectomy, due to cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today there are many different systems to classify co morbidity and complication of radical&#xD;
      cystectomy and nephrectomy. Regarding complication, there is Clavien Dindo classifications&#xD;
      System and The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) while Charlson&#xD;
      Comorbidity Index (CCI) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance scale&#xD;
      classifies comorbidity. At the present time, there is not a system that takes both parameters&#xD;
      into account, although it is of high clinical relevance to be able to figure out the&#xD;
      significant and important patient parameters that can influence the outcome of a treatment&#xD;
      modality. Such a system is in development, from cystectomy patients, in this study's project&#xD;
      group. This is currently to be validated in two large patient cohorts from respectively&#xD;
      Herlev Hospital and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA. Virtually all&#xD;
      previous publications on comorbidity or complications after cancer surgery, including the&#xD;
      aforementioned, is based on data retrospectively collected from medical records. Even&#xD;
      prospectively maintained database are based predominantly on data from records written in the&#xD;
      journal prospective, but then transferred retrospectively to the database. The problem is&#xD;
      that data on comorbidities and complications are not collected with this registration method&#xD;
      in mind. Especially in the definition of the individual complications this contains a&#xD;
      significant source of error. In addition, most minor complications that do not require&#xD;
      re-intervention or re-operation, are probably underreported. Involvement of lesser&#xD;
      complications after discharge is rarely reported, unless they lead to readmission. This is&#xD;
      probably one of the causes of an uneven distribution in the reporting of serious&#xD;
      complications requiring re-operation when comparing surgical case series, while the number of&#xD;
      minor complications (Clavien 1-2) are highly variable. Even a minor complication which does&#xD;
      not cause a readmission, can have a major impact on a patient's quality of life and&#xD;
      experience of the disease. In addition, the small complications are often preventable, if you&#xD;
      have a knowledge of their cause and context with the intervention. Patients who are to&#xD;
      undergo cystectomy, are predominantly elderly patients with a large tobacco consumption and&#xD;
      high comorbidity. At the same time cystectomy is associated with the highest risk of&#xD;
      complications (75%) in cancer surgery, followed by nephrectomy patients (20%). Kidney cancer,&#xD;
      and especially bladder cancer has a high- 1- and 5-year survivalrate. The patients will&#xD;
      likely live for many years with their complications and the potential impact on quality of&#xD;
      life as a result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since current knowledge and previous publications on comorbidity and/or complications after&#xD;
      cancer surgery often is build on retrospective collected data, it will be highly relevant to&#xD;
      examine the extent to which the retrospectively collected data is accurate by comparing with&#xD;
      prospectively collected data. By conducting this study, it can be assessed which kind of&#xD;
      gathering gives the correct information on the complications of radical cancer surgery and if&#xD;
      previous publications should be revalidated?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The study will examine which differences there are in comorbidity and&#xD;
      complications collected retrospectively from medical records compared with data collected&#xD;
      prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The prevalence of registered comorbidity and minor complications in patients who&#xD;
      have undergone radical cystectomy or nephrectomy, will increase if the data collection is&#xD;
      focused and prospective, compared with retrospectively collected data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design The study will be conducted as a single-blind randomized controlled trial, as this&#xD;
      form of study eliminates unknown confounders and have a high validity. Patients included in&#xD;
      the study will be randomized to either control or intervention in the ratio 1:1. There are&#xD;
      two groups of patients: Patients admitted to radical cystectomy and patients admitted to&#xD;
      radical nephrectomy, due to cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure In the control groups data on comorbidity and complications are collected&#xD;
      retrospectively from medical records 90 days after the end of treatment, based on clearly&#xD;
      defined criteria for comorbidity and complications, and severity of these (Clavien&#xD;
      gradation). In the intervention group the investigator must collect information on&#xD;
      comorbidity, preoperative, in a systematic review with a questionnaire in cooperation with&#xD;
      the patient. Details about complications is collected daily at bedside, at rounds, by the&#xD;
      investigator. Additionally, the patient receives a questionnaire at discharge. This must be&#xD;
      answered at home. The investigator and the patient will go through the questionnaire at the&#xD;
      first visit to the ambulatory. A second and identical questionnaire, in a stamped envelope,&#xD;
      is handed out to the patient. In the last two questionnaires the patient must record contact&#xD;
      with the family doctor, emergency physician, nurse and other hospital departments.&#xD;
      Furthermore, any kind of medicine, pain or disability must be described. In the intervention&#xD;
      group the same defined criteria are used as in the control group. Physicians involved in the&#xD;
      management of the patient, is blinded to the group to which the patient is randomly assigned&#xD;
      to, and is thus unaware of whether the patient is in the intervention group or the control&#xD;
      group. Subsequently for the intervention group a retrospective collection of data from&#xD;
      medical records is made and compared with the control group. This ensures that the&#xD;
      randomization has been sufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of procedure related complications (Clavien score)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During hospitalization postoperative before discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Within the first week after discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Within the second week after discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevalence of preoperative comorbidity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient comorbidity: Acute myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, arrhythmias, previous&#xD;
           cardiac surgery, venous diseases, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, abdominal aortic&#xD;
           aneurysm, claudicatio, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peptic ulcer, alcohol&#xD;
           abuse, liver disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus type I and II, connective tissue&#xD;
           disease, osteoporosis, kidney transplant, kidney failure, leukemia/lymphoma, previous&#xD;
           malignant disease with &amp; without metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient complication: antiemetics, antipyretics, antibiotics, diuretics, VAS (Visual&#xD;
           Analog Pain Scale) score, newly started or increased help from home care, newly started&#xD;
           or more visits from the home nurse, newly started physical therapy, blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a significant variation in comorbidity collected from questionnaires and&#xD;
           medical records, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics and sample size The number of patients in the study is based on the following&#xD;
      assumptions: For the cystectomy- and nephrectomy patients with complications retrospectively&#xD;
      calculated, it is assumed that complications that needs intervention is detected respectively&#xD;
      about 50% and 20%. This is in accordance with the highest indication in major international&#xD;
      surveys with retrospective registering. Based on previous experiences, the real number is&#xD;
      estimated to be respectively minimum 85% and 35%. With an alpha value at 0,05 and a beta&#xD;
      value at 0,20, this gives a required number of patients at 66 for cystectomy patients and 90&#xD;
      nephrectomy patients, to be able to demonstrate a significant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed with primarily non-parametric test using MedCalc for&#xD;
      Windows, version 15.8 or later (MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management Patients will be enrolled after signing informed consent. Patient data will&#xD;
      be entered directly into the electronic CRF (Clinical Registration Form) on a secure server&#xD;
      using REDCap, which is a secure server based system with a security that exceeds the demands&#xD;
      and guidelines of &quot;Persondataloven&quot; and is recommended by Aarhus University. Data are stored&#xD;
      according to regulations by the Danish Data Protections Agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectivation If the study concludes that the project groups classification system is based&#xD;
      on valid data and find out what kind of data collection that provides the most accurate&#xD;
      picture of the patients relationship between co-morbidities and complications, we will in&#xD;
      future be able to give patients more individualized treatment. This is desirable both for the&#xD;
      patient and the therapist. In this way the study classification system will be able to avoid&#xD;
      the patient living a life with post operative complications and a complicated treatment. This&#xD;
      will also be able to reduce the use of health care resources, that can then be uses&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations The study will be conducted in accordance with the protocol,&#xD;
      applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      as adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly in Helsinki, Finland in 1064 and subsequent&#xD;
      versions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients that by informed consent is included in the study, are exposed neither to&#xD;
      different surgery or other treatment than they would have been without participation in the&#xD;
      study. The extra interviews and daily rounds will attempt established in connection with the&#xD;
      patient's usual attendance and stay at the hospital, to avoid extra visits. There must be&#xD;
      calculated some extra time spent in connection with participation in the trial. Studies show&#xD;
      that patients in scientific studies, feel that they receive a better treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is approved in the Data Inspectorate and assessment is ongoing in the Research&#xD;
      Ethics Committee, where approval is mandatory before starting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project feasibility The study is performed in an internationally acknowledged research&#xD;
      environment at department of urology, Aarhus University Hospital, Skejby. Baseline data are&#xD;
      collected until approximately May 2017 and follow-up data August 2017. This means that data&#xD;
      will be available in time to complete the thesis and a paper for publication. The research&#xD;
      year student will be affiliated to the department. All necessary analysis methods are&#xD;
      established in the department, and hardware and software will be provided.&#xD;
