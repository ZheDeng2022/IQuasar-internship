      This clinical trial compared the therapeutic effects and adverse events (AEs) in overactive&#xD;
      bladder (OAB) patients receiving different combination of mirabegron and antimuscarinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a prospective randomized study. OAB patients received mirabegron 25 mg (M25)&#xD;
      daily for one month (1M) and then were randomized as group 1: to continue M25, group 2: to&#xD;
      mirabegron 50 mg, group 3: to shift to solifenacin 5 mg (S5) and group 4: to combine M25 and&#xD;
      S5 for further 2 months (totally 3 months, 3M). Efficacy and AEs were evaluated. At the end&#xD;
      of 3M, the preferred option for future treatment was investigated.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is defined as the symptom syndrome with frequency, and&#xD;
      urgency with or without urgency incontinence. OAB affects more than 400 million people&#xD;
      worldwide and has been estimated to affect around 16% of the adult population across Europe&#xD;
      and the USA. In Asian countries, the prevalence of OAB has been reported to be 6% of men and&#xD;
      women aged ≥18 years in China; 12.2% of men and women in Korea;12.4% of men and women aged&#xD;
      ≥40 years in Japan; and 21 to 25% of women and 16.9% of community dwelling adults in Taiwan.&#xD;
      Another study reported that the prevalence of OAB among adult men across 11 Asian countries&#xD;
      (India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, China,&#xD;
      Hong Kong and Thailand) was 29.9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antimuscarinics are first line pharmacotherapy for OAB. However, some patients have a&#xD;
      suboptimal response to antimuscarinics and some may experience adverse effects, such as dry&#xD;
      mouth or constipation. Therefore, a high proportion of patients discontinue antimuscarinic&#xD;
      therapy, with fewer than 25% remaining on treatment at 1 year. There is an unmet need to&#xD;
      develop new drugs for OAB without the bothersome adverse effects of antimuscarinic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      β3-adrenergic receptors are known to promote urine storage in the bladder by inducing&#xD;
      detrusor relaxation in animal and human bladders. In humans, the β3-adrenoceptor is the&#xD;
      predominant β-receptor subtype in the urinary bladder. β3-adrenoceptor agonists relax the&#xD;
      detrusor smooth muscle during the bladder storage phase and increase bladder capacity without&#xD;
      accompanying changes in micturition pressure, residual volume or voiding contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirabegron is the first β3-adrenoceptor agonist to have been approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      OAB. Pooled safety data indicates that dry mouth, the chief cause of treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation with antimuscarinic agents, occurs with low incidence with mirabegronc.&#xD;
      Hence, mirabegron may be a valuable treatment option for patients with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent phase III trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of mirabegron in the treatment&#xD;
      of OAB in Europeans, Australians, North Americans, Japanese and Asians. Whether mirabegron&#xD;
      should be used as the first line treatment for OAB has not been determined yet. There is also&#xD;
      no study showing that mirabegron is superior to solifenacin in terms of therapeutic efficacy&#xD;
      and safety profile. The dose effectiveness relationship between 25mg and 50mg mirabegron has&#xD;
      also not been investigated yet. Hence, we have conducted this post marketing study in order&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of mirabegron in Taiwanese people with symptoms of OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized trial will be conducted in Tzu Chi General Hospital, Hualien,&#xD;
      Taiwan. The study population consisted of male and female outpatients meeting the legal&#xD;
      minimum age requirement of the region with symptoms of OAB for more than 3 months. Patient&#xD;
      demographics data will be recorded as detailed as possible, including previous urodynamic&#xD;
      study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of four arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mirabegron 25mg once-daily for 4 weeks, and continue the same dose of mirabegron for&#xD;
           another 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mirabegron 25mg once-daily for 4 weeks, and increase the dose to 50mg for another 8&#xD;
           weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Mirabegron 25mg once-daily for 4 weeks, and shift to solifenacin 5mg for another 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mirabegron 25mg once-daily for 4 weeks, and add-on solifenacin 5mg for another 8 weeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was accomplished using a computer-generated randomization scheme (Cenduit GmbH,&#xD;
      Allshwil, Switzerland) with stratification by site; allocation to treatment groups at each&#xD;
      site was accomplished via an interactive response system with a study coordinator. Study&#xD;
      visits took place at Week 0 (Visit 1; confirmation of eligibility criteria); Weeks 4, 8 and&#xD;
      12 (Visits 2, 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the institutional review board of each study site and conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki,&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice, International Conference on Harmonisation guidelines, and all&#xD;
      applicable laws and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study was based on results from a 12-week dose-finding Phase II&#xD;
      study (178-CL-045; NCT00527033) conducted in Japan. In that study, the mean decrease of&#xD;
      urgency episodes per 24 hours for the mirabegron 50mg group was 2.24. The primary efficacy&#xD;
      end-point in this study is the percentage of patients with a change from baseline to the&#xD;
      final visit in the urgency episodes per 24 hours by 2 or greater. The number of patients per&#xD;
      group necessary to demonstrate superiority to the first group (mirabegron 25mg for 12 weeks)&#xD;
      would be 263 with an effect size of 0.2, at a two-sided significance level of 5% and power of&#xD;
      90%. Assuming a dropout rate of 15% during the treatment period, 302 subjects per group are&#xD;
      to be enrolled for randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide evidence for the sup[eriority of which medicatyion and&#xD;
      combination of pharmacotherapy in treatment of patients with overactive bladder syndrome. We&#xD;
      also expected to search for the predictive factors for responders to mirabegron 25mg alone,&#xD;
      mirabegron 50mg, solifenacin alone, and combined mirabegron 25mg an slifenacin 5mg, based on&#xD;
      the baseline demographics and urodynamic study findings&#xD;
