  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lacerations are one of most common trauma in children presenting to the emergency department&#xD;
      (ED). Currently, there are wide variations regarding sedation and analgesia practices when&#xD;
      suture are required. Even though topical anesthesia is very useful to reduce pain, it does&#xD;
      not obviate the use of pharmacologic agents to decrease stress in anxious children undergoing&#xD;
      laceration repairs in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing interest in the intranasal (IN) route of administration in the pediatric&#xD;
      population. It bypasses the first hepatic passage and thus provides medications direct access&#xD;
      to the systemic circulation leading to higher and faster serum concentrations than would the&#xD;
      oral route. Also, intravenous (IV) cannulation can be avoided reducing the pain associated&#xD;
      with it and the need for nursing time and procedure delay. IN fentanyl and midazolam are two&#xD;
      agents that can be combined for this procedure, but respiratory depression is a feared&#xD;
      adverse effects. Ketamine is the most commonly used IV agent for procedural sedation, and can&#xD;
      offer potent analgesia and sedation while maintaining respiratory drive and protective airway&#xD;
      reflexes. Few studies have evaluated IN ketamine for procedural sedation. There is a wide&#xD;
      range of dosing reported from 3 to 9 mg/kg. This raises the question as what is the lowest&#xD;
      possible dosage that can be used to successfully repairs laceration in children with minimal&#xD;
      restrain and no adverse events, as described by the Pediatric Emergency Research Canada&#xD;
      (PERC)/ Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network (PECARN) consensus.&#xD;
