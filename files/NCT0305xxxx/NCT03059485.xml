  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a cancer vaccine called Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine&#xD;
      (DC/AML vaccine) as a possible treatment for Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Dendritic Cell/AML Fusion vaccine (DC/AML vaccine)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the DC/AML vaccine as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved durvalumab as a treatment&#xD;
      for AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are determining if the DC/AML vaccine can be used&#xD;
      safely in subjects with acute leukemia after finishing chemotherapy, and whether the DC/AML&#xD;
      vaccine is capable of producing immune responses against leukemia alone. Cancer cells are&#xD;
      foreign to the body and have unique markers that distinguish them from normal cells. These&#xD;
      markers can potentially serve as targets for the immune system. An immune response is any&#xD;
      reaction by the immune system; a complex system that is responsible for distinguishing us&#xD;
      from everything foreign to us, and for protecting us against infections and foreign&#xD;
      substances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Dendritic Cell Fusion Vaccine is an investigational agent that tries to help the immune&#xD;
      system to recognize and fight against cancer cells. Unlike a standard vaccine that is used to&#xD;
      prevent infections, cancer vaccines are being studied to see if they can fight cancers that&#xD;
      are already in the body. Laboratory studies have shown that when dendritic cells and tumor&#xD;
      cells are brought together, the dendritic cells can stimulate immune responses against the&#xD;
      tumor and, in some cases, cause the tumor to shrink.&#xD;
