    <textblock>
      This research study is exploring chemotherapy in combination with immunotherapy (a therapy&#xD;
      that uses the body's own immune system to control cancer) as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      metastatic hormone receptor positive breast cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works&#xD;
      in treating a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, The investigators are evaluating the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      Eribulin mesylate with or without Pembrolizumab in metastatic hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and Eribulin mesylate for Breast Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved Pembrolizumab for this specific type of breast cancer but it has&#xD;
      been approved in the United States for other diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has approved Eribulin mesylate as a treatment option for this type of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab is a medicine that may treat cancer by working with the immune system. The&#xD;
      immune system is the body's natural defense against disease. The immune system sends types of&#xD;
      cells called &quot;T cells&quot; throughout the body to detect and fight infections and diseases,&#xD;
      including cancer. For some types of cancer, the T cells do not work as they should and are&#xD;
      prevented from attacking the tumors. Pembrolizumab is thought to work by blocking a protein&#xD;
      in the T cells called PD-1 (&quot;programmed death 1&quot;), which then may allow these cells and other&#xD;
      parts of the immune system to attack tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eribulin mesylate is developed from a natural substance found in a sea sponge. Eribulin&#xD;
      mesylate works by preventing cancer cells from multiplying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of Pembrolizumab and Eribulin mesylate is investigational. The study drugs,&#xD;
      when given separately, work in different ways to stop the cancer cells from growing and&#xD;
      spreading. However, it is not known if giving the two study drugs at the same time will have&#xD;
      a better anti-cancer effect than giving each treatment on its own.&#xD;

             mesylate. For these reasons women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for&#xD;
             the duration of study participation and 4 months after the last dose of eribulin&#xD;
             mesylate and/or pembrolizumab. Note: abstinence is acceptable if this is the usual&#xD;
             lifestyle and preferred contraception for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
                  partner is participating in this study, the treating physician and principal&#xD;
                  investigator should be informed immediately.&#xD;

             negative urine or a negative serum pregnancy test within seven (7) days of first dose&#xD;
             of pembrolizumab. If a urine test is positive or cannot be confirmed as negative, a&#xD;
             serum pregnancy test will be required.&#xD;
&#xD;

             stable and absence of new neurologic symptoms for the last 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry, and have recovered from the effects of radiotherapy or surgery. Any&#xD;
             corticosteroid use for brain metastases must have been discontinued without the&#xD;
             subsequent appearance of symptoms for ≥2 weeks before the first study drug. Treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Medcial condition that requires chronic systemic steroid therapy or on any other form&#xD;
             of immunosuppressive medication. For example, participants with autoimmune disease&#xD;
             that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppression agents should be excluded.&#xD;
             Replacement therapy (eg., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;

             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with Pembrolizumab and/or eribulin&#xD;
             mesylate. In addition, these participants are at increased risk of lethal infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a second malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;

             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years: cervical cancer&#xD;
             in situ, and non-melanoma cancer of the skin. Patients with other cancers diagnosed&#xD;
             within the past 5 years and felt to be at low risk of recurrence should be discussed&#xD;
