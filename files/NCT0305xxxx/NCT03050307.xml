      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the non-inferior efficacy of TAK-438 versus&#xD;
      lansoprazole in the treatment of participants with gastric ulcer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. TAK-438 is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have stomach ulcers and also may or may not have Helicobacter pylori (HP)&#xD;
      infection. This study will look at stomach ulcer healing and also the elimination of HP in&#xD;
      people who take TAK-438 versus lansoprazole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 830 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two&#xD;
      treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the participants and study doctor during&#xD;
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TAK-438 20 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lansoprazole 30 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will depend upon the Helicobacter pylori infection status of the participant,&#xD;
      and include bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for the first 2 weeks in H pylori infected&#xD;
      (HP+) participants. HP+ participants will be asked to take a TAK- 438 tablet or a&#xD;
      lansoprazole capsule twice daily in conjunction with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy for&#xD;
      2 weeks, followed up by a TAK-438 tablet or a lansoprazole capsule once daily for up to 6&#xD;
      weeks. HP- participants will be asked to take a TAK-438 tablet or a lansoprazole capsule once&#xD;
      daily for up to 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in China, Korea, Taiwan, and Philippines. The&#xD;
      overall time to participate in this study is up to 12 weeks. Participants will make multiple&#xD;
      visits plus final visit at 2 weeks or 4 weeks after last dose of study drug for a follow-up&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;

    <description>HP infection status was determined by 13C-UBT. The urea breath test is used to detect infection with HP, a bacteria associated with stomach ulcers, by testing individual breath samples in a central laboratory. The data is provided only for HP+ participants. The participant could take 4 or 8 weeks of treatment for GU healing, then additional 4 weeks later, to have the urea breath test (UBT) test to detect HP.</description>

    <description>The gastrointestinal symptoms included epigastric pain [postprandial, fasting, nocturnal], abdominal bloating, nausea/vomiting, heartburn, lack of appetite. The severity of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with GU were recorded as: none = 0, mild = 1, moderate = 2 or severe = 3. The data is reported in categories for percentage of participants with resolution of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with GU.</description>
