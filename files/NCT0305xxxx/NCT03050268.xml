      NOTE: This is a research study and is not meant to be a substitute for clinical genetic&#xD;
      testing. Families may never receive results from the study or may receive results many years&#xD;
      from the time they enroll. If you are interested in clinical testing please consider seeing a&#xD;
      local genetic counselor or other genetics professional. If you have already had clinical&#xD;
      genetic testing and meet eligibility criteria for this study as shown in the Eligibility&#xD;
      Section, you may enroll regardless of the results of your clinical genetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While it is well recognized that hereditary factors contribute to the development of a subset&#xD;
      of human cancers, the cause for many cancers remains unknown. The application of next&#xD;
      generation sequencing (NGS) technologies has expanded knowledge in the field of hereditary&#xD;
      cancer predisposition. Currently, more than 100 cancer predisposing genes have been&#xD;
      identified, and it is now estimated that approximately 10% of all cancer patients have an&#xD;
      underlying genetic predisposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to identify novel cancer predisposing genes and/or genetic&#xD;
      variants. For this study, the investigators will establish a Data Registry linked to a&#xD;
      Repository of biological samples. Health information, blood samples and occasionally leftover&#xD;
      tumor samples will be collected from individuals with familial cancer. The investigators will&#xD;
      use NGS approaches to find changes in genes that may be important in the development of&#xD;
      familial cancer. The information gained from this study may provide new and better ways to&#xD;
      diagnose and care for people with hereditary cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Establish a registry of families with clustering of cancer in which clinical data are&#xD;
           linked to a repository of cryopreserved blood cells, germline DNA, and tumor tissues&#xD;
           from the proband and other family members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify novel cancer predisposing genes and/or genetic variants in families with&#xD;
           clustering of cancer for which the underlying genetic basis is unknown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the study, blood samples or other healthy tissue will be obtained from participants,&#xD;
      as well as medical and family histories. When possible, leftover tumor samples will also be&#xD;
      collected. If participants agree to be re-contacted in the future, they will be asked about&#xD;
      once each year to update their health information and family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will be drawn at St. Jude or at a convenient place of the participant's&#xD;
      choice. Saliva collection will be obtained if a blood draw is not possible. For participants&#xD;
      who are present at St. Jude, saliva collection will generally be performed only once using a&#xD;
      saliva collection kit. However, if the first collection is not sufficient for protocol&#xD;
      required studies, then additional saliva samples may need to be collected, for up to a total&#xD;
      of 5 occurrences. For non St. Jude participants, or participants who do not wish or cannot&#xD;
      come to St. Jude, saliva will be collected locally and shipped back to the St. Jude. A skin&#xD;
      sample will be performed as a source of germline DNA from participants who have undergone an&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplant and do not have a source of pre-transplant DNA available. A&#xD;
      skin sample will only be obtained one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological samples will be stored in the St. Jude Biorepository. The DNA of the samples&#xD;
      will be studied to determine if there are changes in specific genes that might explain the&#xD;
      cancers in the participant or their family members. When available, and if consent is given&#xD;
      by the participant, previously collected and stored leftover tumor samples, bone marrow&#xD;
      samples or stored DNA may be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic variants of interest include: 1) mutations in known genes that may have escaped&#xD;
      detection through prior clinical genetic testing; 2) coding mutations predicted to disrupt&#xD;
      protein function, particularly in genes and pathways known to be associated with cancer; 3)&#xD;
      potential mutations in regulatory regions of the genome, as predicted by epigenetic studies.&#xD;
      In some cases, individuals with known predisposing mutations exhibit milder, more severe or&#xD;
      atypical phenotypes. Family members who harbor a predisposing mutation but are discordant for&#xD;
      a cancer phenotype will be selected for cellular and genetic studies. These will include DNA&#xD;
      sequencing and possibly also creation and analysis of induce pluripotent stem cells (iPSC),&#xD;
      transcriptome or epigenetic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be identified by a code after removal of all personal identifiable&#xD;
      information. Samples will remain in the repository for current and future study.&#xD;
