  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apple polyphenols are mostly acknowledged for their hypoglycaemic properties, but represent&#xD;
      an apple active fraction with many pharmacological functions. The study aim was to examine&#xD;
      their effect on uricemia and endothelial function in a sample of overweight subjects. This&#xD;
      was a two-phases study. The in vitro experiment aimed to evaluate the apple polyphenols'&#xD;
      ability to lower uric acid in comparison with allopurinol. The in vivo study consisted in a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, parallel placebo-controlled clinical trial involving 62 overweight&#xD;
      volunteers with suboptimal values of fasting plasma glucose (100 mg/dL≤FPG≤125 mg/dL),&#xD;
      randomized to be treated with 300 mg apple polyphenols or placebo for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      The study included a 2-week run-in period of diet standardization and an 8-week treatment&#xD;
      period. At enrolment, patients were given standard behavioural and qualitative dietary&#xD;
      suggestions to correct their unhealthy habits. In particular, subjects were strongly&#xD;
      recommended to follow the general indications of a Mediterranean diet, avoiding an excessive&#xD;
      intake of diary and red meat derived products and reducing the dietary excesses, in order to&#xD;
      maintain an overall balanced diet for the entire duration of the study. Individuals were also&#xD;
      encouraged to increase their physical activity by walking briskly or cycling from 3 to 5&#xD;
      times for week, at least 20 minutes every time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study fully complied with the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. The&#xD;
      study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University of Bologna. All&#xD;
      patients signed a written informed consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks of diet standardization, the enrolled subjects were allocated to the treatment&#xD;
      with an indistinguishable pill of placebo or an active product, containing 300 mg of apple&#xD;
      extract (Malus Domestica) with glycosilated polyphenols (≥90%) including glycosilated&#xD;
      phloritzin (15-30%), chlorogenic acid (10-25%) and quercetin (15-25%) (kindly provided by&#xD;
      Amitalia Srl, Solara, MI, Italy). Patients were asked to take the pills regularly, every day&#xD;
      early in the morning. The amount of glycosilated polyphenols was assessed&#xD;
      spectophotometrically at 280 nm, using synthetic catechin as standard. Glycosilated&#xD;
      phloritzin, chlorogenic acid and quercetin were measured by HPCL-MS [high performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography-mass spectrometry].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization was performed 1:1 ratio and the blocks were stratified by sex and age. An&#xD;
      alphabetical code was assigned to each lot code (corresponding to treatment or placebo)&#xD;
      impressed on the dose box. The study staffs and the investigators, as well as all of the&#xD;
      volunteers, were blinded to the group assignment. Codes were kept in a sealed envelope, which&#xD;
      was not opened until the end of the trial. Dose boxes were mixed and a blinded dose box was&#xD;
      assigned to each enrolled patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were evaluated anamnestically and by the execution of a physical examination and&#xD;
      laboratory analyses at the baseline, in the middle and at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hemodynamic variables recorded (endothelial function, arterial stiffness and related&#xD;
      parameters) were investigated before and after the intervention period. All the instrumental&#xD;
      measurements were carried out following standardized protocols by specially trained staff.&#xD;
