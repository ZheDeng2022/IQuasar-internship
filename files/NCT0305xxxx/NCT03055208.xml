    <textblock>
      Gamma GBM is a single-arm phase II trial that prospectively measures the progression-free&#xD;
      survival time after addition of an early gamma knife boost to areas of residual tumor to&#xD;
      standard-of-care (surgery, chemo-radiotherapy, chemotherapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glioblastomas are highly malignant brain tumors that recur about 6 months after treatment.&#xD;
      Most recurrences develop at the edge of the surgical margin and a common reason for an early&#xD;
      recurrence of a glioblastoma is when tumors are not completely resected. This may be the case&#xD;
      when intraoperative neuro-monitoring indicates that further resection would impair certain&#xD;
      motor functions. Physicians can identify residual tumor in early (24-72h after surgery)&#xD;
      postoperative MRI scans and could treat these regions. However, this treatment would not be a&#xD;
      part of the recommended standard of care and thus, any further treatment of this areas will&#xD;
      need a clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate if the use of another modality to deplete these areas of&#xD;
      residual tumor identified in early postoperative MRI scans will provide a relevant benefit in&#xD;
      terms of progression-free survival (which means a prolongation of the time that patients do&#xD;
      not experience a re-growth of the tumor). The modality is termed &quot;radiosurgery&quot;, which is a&#xD;
      non-invasive technique to delete cells without using a blade but a highly focused beam of&#xD;
      gamma rays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The machine that focusses these rays (like a magnifying glass that can focus light), is&#xD;
      called 'gamma knife'. Gamma knife radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for a&#xD;
      plethora of malignant and benign brain tumors and the technique is used since the 1950s and&#xD;
      there has been a continuous improvement of precision and patient comfort up to now.&#xD;
