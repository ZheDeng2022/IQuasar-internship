  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. This will be a randomized prospective and open-label study with no placebo control or&#xD;
           blinding of the participants and the research team members. The study is to compare the&#xD;
           effectiveness of vaginal progesterone versus combination of vaginal progesterone and&#xD;
           Arabin cervical pessary in the prevention of preterm delivery among patients with&#xD;
           incidental shortened cervical length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As part of standard clinical care, all pregnant patients usually have cervical length&#xD;
           measurements at the mid-trimester during the anatomy scan from 18 to 24 weeks with the&#xD;
           GE ultrasound Volusion 8 using the vaginal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with short cervix will be counseled and offered the opportunity to&#xD;
                participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All participants will be taught how to use the vaginal progesterone once daily&#xD;
                prior to bedtime. In addition, those in the combination group will have the&#xD;
                cervical pessary placed in the clinic right away or within a week if they request&#xD;
                for more time to brood over their diagnosis and weigh on the option of inserting&#xD;
                Arabin pessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All participants will be followed up in the high-risk obstetric clinic as per&#xD;
                standard prenatal care. Frequency of follow up visits will be individualized&#xD;
                depending on patient's need and comorbidities. , Participants will be requested to&#xD;
                bring the remnant of the vaginal progesterone to the clinic to assess compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Participants in the study will continue their prenatal care with UIC high-risk&#xD;
                obstetric clinic until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The study recruitment will occur for a period of 2 years starting from November&#xD;
                2016 to October 2018 or until all the anticipated numbers of study subjects have&#xD;
                been attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. There will be 10 % over-sampling to cater for those who will drop out from the&#xD;
                study or loss to follow up after randomization, and those who delivered in another&#xD;
                hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Participants will have access to one of the investigators or the high- risk clinic&#xD;
                nurse for any complaints related to their conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Participants can opt out at any stage of the study if they do not want to continue&#xD;
                further or if there are any adverse effects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and disability in survivors in the&#xD;
      United States. Short cervical length measured by transvaginal ultrasound has been strongly&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. Vaginal progesterone has been proposed as&#xD;
      a management option to reduce the risk of preterm birth in asymptomatic women with singleton&#xD;
      gestations without prior preterm birth with a very short cervical length. Short cervix in&#xD;
      this population is defined as less than or equal to 20 mm, when measured between 18 and 24&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) and the Society of Maternal Fetal&#xD;
      Medicine (SMFM) have proposed the use of vaginal progesterone either micronized progesterone&#xD;
      capsule, 200mg daily, or vaginal progesterone gel, 90 mg daily, in asymptomatic women&#xD;
      carrying a singleton pregnancy and an incidental finding of short cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical length is usually measured at time of routine anatomical survey fetal between 18 and&#xD;
      24 weeks of gestation for the prevention of preterm birth at less than 37 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, cervical pessary has been used in the prevention of preterm birth for many&#xD;
      decades in a few studies with promising results. More recently, the Arabin pessary has been&#xD;
      designed with the sole purpose of prevention of preterm birth in pregnant patients with short&#xD;
      cervix. It is relatively noninvasive, not operator-dependent and can be easily placed and&#xD;
      removed in the outpatient setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that adding the use of the Arabin pessary&#xD;
      for women identified with short cervix and undergoing the standard of care treatment with&#xD;
      vaginal progesterone, further decreases the risk of preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a prospective randomized trial using vaginal progesterone alone compared with&#xD;
      the combination of vaginal progesterone and Arabin pessary in the prevention of preterm&#xD;
      delivery among women who are incidentally found to have short cervical length. Patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with short cervical length with no prior history of preterm deliveries during&#xD;
      routine mid-trimester screening will be enrolled in this study and will be randomized into&#xD;
      two groups. One group will be given vaginal progesterone only, which is the current standard&#xD;
      of care in the United States. The second group will receive Arabin cervical pessary, to be&#xD;
      inserted in the clinic at the time of diagnosis, in addition to daily vaginal progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal progesterone will be 200 mg or 90 mg of Crinone inserted once daily at bedtime in&#xD;
      both groups, depending on patients' insurance coverage. The participants of the study will be&#xD;
      followed up in the high risk obstetric clinic as per standard clinic surveillance. They will&#xD;
      receive the standard prenatal care and treatment when warranted according to their clinic&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of Arabin pessary in conjunction with the standard treatment of vaginal progesterone&#xD;
      is more effective in reducing preterm deliveries at less than 37 weeks in women identified&#xD;
      with short cervix in mid trimester without other risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To compare the effectiveness of the combination of vaginal progesterone and Arabin pessary&#xD;
      in the prevention of preterm delivery prior to 37 weeks compared to vaginal progesterone&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the rate of preterm delivery prior to 28, 32, 34 weeks in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the need for adjunctive interventions such as cervical cerclage, tocolysis,&#xD;
           antibiotics and Betamethasone in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate adverse maternal or fetal outcomes in each study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Evaluate neonatal intensive care unit admission and composite neonatal morbidity in each&#xD;
           study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the investigators' clinical practice if they are&#xD;
      diagnosed with short cervical length equal or less than 20 mm at routine ultrasound screening&#xD;
      for cervical length during mid-trimester anatomy scan from 18-24 weeks at the UIC ultrasound&#xD;
      units. Those with cervical length less than or equal to 20 mm will be randomized (1:1) into&#xD;
      two arms: the vaginal progesterone only group and the combined vaginal progesterone and&#xD;
      Arabin cervical pessary group. Those with cervical lengths between 20 mm to 25 mm will be&#xD;
      followed up in 1 week with repeat transvaginal sonogram, according to the unit protocol but&#xD;
      they will be randomized to either group only if they are diagnosed with shorter cervical&#xD;
      lengths of 20 mm or less prior to 24 weeks of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Inclusion Criteria&#xD;

      under the age of 18 will not be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 Subject Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All pregnant women 18 years old and above who are diagnosed with short cervix during the&#xD;
           mid-trimester routine screening for cervical length will be counseled about the&#xD;
           treatment options and recruited for the study if they give their consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They will be recruited at the point of diagnosis of short cervical length at the UIC&#xD;
           ultrasound unit or high-risk obstetric clinic in Women Health Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. They will be told that their participation in the study will be voluntary and those&#xD;
           already in the study can opt out at any stage if they so desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Both the participants and those who decline to participate in the study will be treated&#xD;
           equally according to their clinical demands. Refusal to participate in the study will&#xD;
           not alter in any way the access to other standard of care as the needs arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All participants will be followed up throughout their pregnancy until delivery. The&#xD;
           study enrollment will be from 18 - 24 weeks when they are diagnosed with short cervical&#xD;
           length. Final data for each participant will be gathered after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Those with cervical pessary will have the device removed at 37 completed weeks or if&#xD;
           they are in labor and any other condition that warrants interruption of the pregnancy.&#xD;
           Vaginal progesterone will continue up to 36 completed weeks, as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Study Design and Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      To review, standard prenatal clinical care at UIC includes a cervical length ultrasound&#xD;
      evaluation at the time of the routine anatomical fetal survey between 18-24 weeks. When an&#xD;
      incidental finding of shortened cervical length is made, patients are typically prescribed&#xD;
      vaginal progesterone. They are then followed at the high-risk OB clinic every 2 weeks until&#xD;
      delivery. This randomized prospective study compares standard clinical care (vaginal&#xD;
      progesterone alone) to standard care plus the Arabin pessary (vaginal progesterone + Arabin&#xD;
      cervical pessary) in the prevention of preterm delivery in pregnant women incidentally found&#xD;
      to have a significantly shortened cervix between 18 and 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. This will be a randomized prospective and open-label study with no placebo control or&#xD;
           blinding of the participants and the research team members. The study is to compare the&#xD;
           effectiveness of vaginal progesterone versus combination of vaginal progesterone and&#xD;
           Arabin cervical pessary in the prevention of preterm delivery among patients with&#xD;
           incidental shortened cervical length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As part of standard clinical care, all pregnant patients usually have cervical length&#xD;
           measurements at the mid-trimester during the anatomy scan from 18 to 24 weeks with the&#xD;
           GE ultrasound Volusion 8 using the vaginal probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Those with short cervix will be counseled and offered the opportunity to&#xD;
                participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. All participants will be taught how to use the vaginal progesterone once daily&#xD;
                prior to bedtime. In addition, those in the combination group will have the&#xD;
                cervical pessary placed in the clinic right away or within a week if they request&#xD;
                for more time to brood over their diagnosis and weigh on the option of inserting&#xD;
                Arabin pessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All participants will be followed up in the high-risk obstetric clinic as per&#xD;
                standard prenatal care. Frequency of follow up visits will be individualized&#xD;
                depending on patient's need and comorbidities. Participants will be requested to&#xD;
                bring the remnant of the vaginal progesterone to the clinic to assess compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Participants in the study will continue their prenatal care with UIC high-risk&#xD;
                obstetric clinic until delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The study recruitment will occur for a period of 2 years starting from November&#xD;
                2016 to October 2018 or until all the anticipated numbers of study subjects have&#xD;
                been attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. There will be 10 % over-sampling to cater for those who will drop out from the&#xD;
                study or loss to follow up after randomization, and those who delivered in another&#xD;
                hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Participants will have access to one of the investigators or the high- risk clinic&#xD;
                nurse for any complaints related to their conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Participants can opt out at any stage from the study if they do not want to&#xD;
                continue further or if there are any adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies involving use of product&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study uses the Arabin cervical pessary and vaginal progesterone (Endometrin 200 mg or&#xD;
      Crinone 90 mg gel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arabin cervical pessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a tissue tolerant non-allergic silicone ring plastic device with a cup-like shape&#xD;
      used for cervical insufficiency. It comes in various sizes and it is classified according to&#xD;
      its size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower larger diameter (65 or 70 mm) The height (17, 21, 25 or 30 mm) The upper small&#xD;
      diameter (32 or 35 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Arabin cervical pessary can easily be folded and inserted in the upper vaginal around the&#xD;
      cervix without pain. The majority of the patients receive a device size of 32 mm of the upper&#xD;
      diameter, 21 mm for height and 65 mm for lower diameter. However, participants with&#xD;
      significantly funneling of the cervical canal will receive a device of 35 mm of the upper&#xD;
      diameter while those with previous vaginal deliveries will receive a device with lower&#xD;
      diameter of 70 mm. The length of the vaginal component of the cervix will determine the&#xD;
      height of the Arabin pessary to be inserted. Before the applications, participants will be&#xD;
      screened and treated for any cervical or vaginal infections. All participants will be&#xD;
      screened for bacterial vaginosis, candida infection and Trichomonas, and positive tests will&#xD;
      receive appropriate treatments, as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed Arabin cervical pessary will be: Vaginal pessary, CE 0482 MED CERT, EN ISO&#xD;
      13485. Center for Research and Development. Alfred-Herrhausen Str. 44 D 58455 Witten,&#xD;
      Germany. Phone: +49 2 302 / 189214. The device will be given to every participant randomized&#xD;
      to the pessary group free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaginal pessaries have been used for many years in gynecology for non-surgical treatment of&#xD;
      utero-vaginal prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Different types of pessary based on&#xD;
      the indication and the pelvic anatomical defect have been used. Some of the pessaries that&#xD;
      have been used in gynecology include: ring, ring with support, Gehrung, Gellhorn, Shaatz,&#xD;
      Donut, Cube and inflatable. Vaginal pessaries like Donut and ring with support have been used&#xD;
      in pregnancy for the management of cervical insufficiency. However, the pitfall in the use of&#xD;
      these pessaries is that they are easily expelled due to the anatomical changes of the vagina&#xD;
      in pregnancy that make it difficult for them to fit well in the vagina. With the introduction&#xD;
      of Arabin cervical pessary which is designed to allow it wrap around the cervix instead of&#xD;
      just placing it in the vagina negate this pitfall. Arabin cervical pessary have been used for&#xD;
      many years in Europe for the prevention of preterm delivery in women with cervical&#xD;
      incompetence. A Cochrane review by Abdel -Aleem in 2013 showed that Arabin cervical pessary&#xD;
      has beneficial effects in reducing preterm birth in women with short cervix, (Abdel-Aleem et&#xD;
      al 2013, Liem S et al 2013 and Ting YH et al 2012). This is a non-invasive, and not&#xD;
      operator-dependent silicone plastic that is inserted in the vagina to wrap around the cervix&#xD;
      thereby preventing it from shortening and dilating. It can easily be placed or removed in an&#xD;
      outpatient clinic and it does not require anesthesia. It does not need to be removed for&#xD;
      examinations. Premature cervical shortening and dilatation is one of the most important&#xD;
      causes of preterm birth. This device does not have systemic adverse effects and the only&#xD;
      complaints reported by some of the users is slightly increase vaginal discharge. In another&#xD;
      study of systematic review of the efficacy of Arabin cervical pessary, it showed that&#xD;
      majority of the patients; &gt; 90 % expressed great satisfaction with the device and they will&#xD;
      recommend it to other patients (Sophie M et al 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrin or Crinone vaginal progesterone (Ferring Reproductive Health):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endometrin (progesterone vaginal insert) is a vaginal insert containing 100 mg of micronized&#xD;
      progesterone. Crinone is a vaginal gel (8%) with 90 mg of micronized progesterone.&#xD;
      Progesterone is a natural hormone that is often used in pregnancy for various indications.&#xD;
      One of the indications is for prevention of preterm deliveries in women with short cervical&#xD;
      length. It is usually well tolerated except for some minor side effects such as allergic&#xD;
      reactions to some of its components, itching, headache or flushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected risks include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If randomized to the pessary group, vaginal erosion of the pessary is possible, but this&#xD;
           is extremely rare since the device is soft and with little pressure on the vaginal wall.&#xD;
           This has never been an observed side-effect in any patients in investigators clinic that&#xD;
           have been using this device for over a year. Moreover, all participants will have access&#xD;
           to one of the investigators 24 hours a day and 7 days a week to express any complaints&#xD;
           or concerns. In the event that participants feel discomfort with the pessary and they&#xD;
           desire to discontinue, the participant will be required to come to the clinic for&#xD;
           evaluation and possible removal of the pessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Allergic reaction to components of vaginal progesterone is also an extremely rare&#xD;
           adverse event. The most common sign of allergic reaction is itching. If this occurs,&#xD;
           participants will come to the OB ER for immediate evaluation or come to the high risk OB&#xD;
           clinic where they will be evaluated and treated accordingly. As vaginal progesterone is&#xD;
           prescribed to most women with an incidental finding of shortened cervical length, this&#xD;
           risk is no greater than standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There is the possibility of increased vaginal discharge from both the daily use of&#xD;
           vaginal progesterone and also from the Arabin pessary. While there is also the&#xD;
           possibility of infection, this is extremely rare. Participants will be counseled prior&#xD;
           to commencement about the possibility of slightly increased vaginal discharge while they&#xD;
           are on either or both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. There has been report of unsuccessful placement of Arabin pessary. A study done in&#xD;
           Belgium in 2013 reported successful placement of Arabin pessary of 82.2 % at first&#xD;
           attempt and 90.4 % at second attempt (Cannie MM et al, Ultrasound Obstet Gynecol 2013;&#xD;
           42: 426 - 433). However, the investigators experience with the use of this device at UIC&#xD;
           as part of the investigators clinical care has been very encouraging. The investigators&#xD;
           have never encountered any unsuccessful attempt at placing the Arabin pessary. This may&#xD;
           be largely due to the introduction of a newer version of the device in 2015 which is&#xD;
           softer, and more flexible. There are also three different sizes of this device. If any&#xD;
           of the investigators encounter difficulty in placing this device in investigator first&#xD;
           attempt, it will be withdrawn and the investigator may place the next smaller size of&#xD;
           the device. If this is still not successful, the investigator will place the device&#xD;
           under direct visualization of the cervix using a vaginal speculum or allow another&#xD;
           investigator to attempt placing the device.&#xD;
