      This study evaluates the effect of increase in testosterone levels in older males and the&#xD;
      effects of decrease in testosterone levels in young males on muscle protein synthesis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal muscle represents the largest organ in the body, comprising &gt;50% of total body mass.&#xD;
      The function of skeletal muscle is best understood for its role in locomotion and providing&#xD;
      mechanical support to the skeleton to facilitate movement. However, skeletal muscles are also&#xD;
      important for maintaining whole-body metabolic health. For example, muscles also act as a&#xD;
      site for glucose disposal thereby acting to maintain whole-body glycaemic control. In&#xD;
      addition, skeletal muscles represent a vast protein store, the amino acids from which can be&#xD;
      used in times of fasting, infection and disease to provide energy to maintain other critical&#xD;
      organs. Exercise (resistance type exercise (RE-T) in particular) still remains the most&#xD;
      effective means by which to maintain and increase muscle mass through stimulation of muscle&#xD;
      protein synthesis (MPS), despite this, how exercise regulates these changes in muscle mass is&#xD;
      still unknown. A number of pathways have been inferred as key, however it is clear from a&#xD;
      number of studies that systemic hormone levels, testosterone in particular, may provide a&#xD;
      significant contribution. It is well known that chronic androgenic hormone deficiency can&#xD;
      lead to a loss of lean body mass and strength, which can in turn contribute to impaired&#xD;
      physical function. Furthermore, when testosterone levels are pharmacologically reduced (using&#xD;
      a gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue) in healthy young males, resistance exercise&#xD;
      training induced increases in muscle mass and strength are absent. Whilst systemic hormone&#xD;
      levels are carefully maintained in youth (unless illness or deficiency is present), levels of&#xD;
      these hormones decrease with age, particularly in those that are not regularly physically&#xD;
      active, indeed approximately 25-30% of older men have levels of testosterone which are below&#xD;
      the threshold used to define hypogonadism. Therefore, there is significant need to understand&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms behind hormonally induced muscle mass regulation. Furthermore, in&#xD;
      older age there is a resistance to traditional anabolic stimuli such as nutrition or&#xD;
      resistance exercise, with older adults showing a blunted-anabolic hormonal profile in&#xD;
      response to resistance training compared to young. These impairments to hormonal regulation&#xD;
      with ageing may in part be responsible for the slow decline in muscle mass with age known as&#xD;
      sarcopenia. Whilst all muscle-wasting conditions are of considerable concern, it is the loss&#xD;
      of muscle in older age that poses the greatest socio-economic burden. Therefore there is a&#xD;
      significant clinical need to identify contributing factors to this muscle loss so that they&#xD;
      can be specifically targeted for intervention (i.e., pharmacological hormonal therapies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this project are two fold: 1) Firstly we aim to investigate the impact of&#xD;
      systemic hormone levels on control of muscle mass in healthy young adults undertaking a&#xD;
      resistance exercise training program, we hypothesize that reduction of hormone levels in&#xD;
      systemically normal young adults will impair MPS and muscle mass gains in response to&#xD;
      resistance exercise training. 2) Secondly we aim to investigate the impact of enhancing&#xD;
      testosterone levels in older adults on responsiveness to resistance exercise training and the&#xD;
      contribution of systemic testosterone levels to muscle mass regulation in ageing, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that increasing testosterone levels in older males will improve responsiveness to&#xD;
      anabolic stimuli (RE-T).&#xD;
