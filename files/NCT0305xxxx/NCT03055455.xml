  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In critically ill children with severe sepsis, neurophysiologic derangements often proceed&#xD;
      undetected and can lead to irreversible brain injury causing neurocognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      deficits. The etiology of these impairments is unclear, however, it is likely that some of&#xD;
      this neural injury is preventable. The overarching goal for this study is to show that acute&#xD;
      acquired structural and microstructural brain injury occurs in critically ill children with&#xD;
      severe sepsis, and that this injury is related to neuropsychological deficits and impaired&#xD;
      cerebral autoregulation (CAR). Subjects will complete Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging within&#xD;
      2-10 days of recognition of their severe sepsis. Subjects will undergo serial interrogation&#xD;
      of CAR for up to 10 days. CAR will be determined by the correlation of arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure with middle cerebral artery flow velocity measured by transcranial doppler&#xD;
      ultrasonography and cerebral oximetry derived from near-infrared spectroscopy. Subjects will&#xD;
      also participate in a neuropsychological evaluation 6 months after enrollment to evaluate&#xD;
      multiple domains of behavior and cognition.&#xD;
