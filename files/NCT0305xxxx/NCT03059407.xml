  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Young children with known or suspected heart disease frequently have difficulty cooperating&#xD;
      with a clinically ordered echocardiogram. Current distraction techniques vary in efficacy.&#xD;
      There have been no studies examining the use of animal assisted therapy to improve&#xD;
      echocardiogram quality and completeness, as well as the patient/parent experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The presence and interaction of therapy dogs with young children undergoing&#xD;
           echocardiography in a clinical setting will result in more complete and higher quality&#xD;
           echocardiograms compared to standard distraction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Parents will report higher visit satisfaction scores and greater exam comfort for their&#xD;
           children for echocardiograms performed with the aid of canine assisted therapy compared&#xD;
           to use of standard distraction techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Activities and Population Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot Phase: Introduction of trained therapy dogs (approved by the Pets at Duke Therapy&#xD;
      Program) for 10 echocardiograms to observe canine-patient interactions and determine best&#xD;
      practices for inclusion of dog/handler team into the echocardiogram protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Phase: 150 subjects ages will be selected from all children ages 1 to 5 years&#xD;
      presenting for clinically ordered echocardiograms during the study time period. Subjects will&#xD;
      be assigned into one of three groups: 1) Canine assisted therapy only; 2) Canine assisted&#xD;
      therapy plus standard distraction techniques; and 3) Standard distraction techniques only.&#xD;
      Echocardiography reviewers will be blinded to subject study group and will assign quality and&#xD;
      completeness score based on validated criteria. Parental satisfaction will be assessed using&#xD;
      validated survey tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis and risk/safety issues:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be assigned a random subject ID, with the only link to PHI stored in a Duke&#xD;
      Redcap database. Statistical testing will be performed with the assistance of Tracy Spears&#xD;
      (biostatistician in DCRI) who has assisted with development of testing tools. There are no&#xD;
      physical risks associated with the echocardiogram portion of the study, and very minimal&#xD;
      risks with the therapy dog portion of the study. Please see &quot;Pets at Duke&quot; policy included in&#xD;
      study documents. There is a potential loss of confidentiality, although the only link between&#xD;
      subject ID and PHI will be stored in a Duke Recap database.&#xD;

      Design and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      160 study subjects will be selected from all children 1 to 5 years of age presenting to the&#xD;
      Duke University Pediatric Echocardiography Laboratory for a clinically ordered echocardiogram&#xD;
      during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duke University Hospital has an established program for pet therapy that includes bedside&#xD;
      visits from trained and certified therapy dogs. At present, these dog-handler teams are&#xD;
      certified as therapy dogs, and then fulfill additional certification requirements in order to&#xD;
      be allowed into patient rooms. As this program and certification requirements are already&#xD;
      established, this project would be able to liaison with the Pets at Duke program to provide&#xD;
      suitable dog-handler teams for the study. Therapy dog certification requires passage of the&#xD;
      AKC Good Citizen Test as well as instruction and certification through a recognized therapy&#xD;
      dog program (including North Carolina Pet Partners, and Carolina Canines for Service).&#xD;
      Currently, dogs (of any breed) that are certified as therapy dogs undergo evaluation by a&#xD;
      team at Duke University and, if appropriate, are able to perform lobby visits (Level 2 dogs)&#xD;
      or bed/patient room visits (Level 3 dogs). Only Level 3 dogs would be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject demographics (age, ethnicity, gender, birth order, home ZIP code, city/rural&#xD;
           designation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence and type of heart disease and interventions, if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of a dog (breed to be specified) or other pet at home, exposure to other&#xD;
           animals&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of any traumatic canine experience (fears, bites)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence of parental anxiety with dogs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completeness of echocardiogram based on existing protocol QA document&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of echocardiogram (poor, average, good, excellent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time required to perform echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of echocardiogram complexity (low, medium, high)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient and parental/guardian comfort and satisfaction with echocardiogram experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handler assessment of dog comfort throughout echocardiogram&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Handler assessment of quality of dog-subject interaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography Data Echocardiography completeness, quality, time and complexity will be&#xD;
      assessed by either co-PI, who will be blinded to the subject group or presence of a dog&#xD;
      during the echocardiogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echo completeness will be assessed using a numerical version of the existing protocol&#xD;
           document used for QA&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of the echocardiogram will be assessed using a qualitative scale derived from&#xD;
           published pediatric echocardiography studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time required to perform echocardiogram will be measured from time stamp on first image&#xD;
           to time stamp on last image, automatically displayed for each echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video Recording of Therapy Dog Interaction with Subject A video recording of the therapy dog&#xD;
      interaction with the subject will be performed. This video review is part of a separate Duke&#xD;
      University study investigating how therapy dogs behave around young children (Duke IACUC&#xD;
      Protocol A112-14-05) and will not be analyzed as part of this study. It is likely that an&#xD;
      image of the subject will be captured on the video, but none of the subject's protected&#xD;
      health information or subject ID number will be included with the video. No video recordings&#xD;
      will be released beyond the therapy dog analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be broken into 4 distinct phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial Phase (3 months): Medical team training and inclusion of study metrics into&#xD;
           daily routine of the Duke University Hospital Pediatric Echocardiography Laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pilot phase (3 months):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 10 non-randomized subjects will be recruited and matched with dog-handler teams&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Through observation of dog-handler-child behavior and suggested interventions, a&#xD;
                list of techniques will be developed for use in the main study. This will be an&#xD;
                extension of knowledge gained from patient visits performed by therapy dogs in&#xD;
                other settings within Duke Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Suggested interventions may include, but are not limited to: having the dog lie next&#xD;
           to the child on the bed, having the child practice resting their hand on the dog,&#xD;
           demonstrating probe placement on the dog prior to placement on the child c. The&#xD;
           behaviors rated as most helpful by sonographers and dog handlers will be selected as a&#xD;
           list of techniques from which to select for consistent use during the main study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study phase (12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Subjects will be approached for participation and randomized into study group as&#xD;
                outlined above&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Study data will be collected as outlined above&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data analysis and manuscript submission (12 months)&#xD;
