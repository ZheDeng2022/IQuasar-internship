      Brief Summary: The QT Ultrasound system is an automated scanner which transmits pulsed&#xD;
      ultrasound plane waves through the breast, as well as collects reflected ultrasound output.&#xD;
      As the patient lays prone on a table, the breast is submerged in a warm water bath. The&#xD;
      transmitter and receiver assembly moves around the suspended breast to record data for&#xD;
      successive sub-volumes of targeted tissue. More than 2000 elements in the curvilinear&#xD;
      transducer's array encircle the breast to gather data from the tissue structures of the&#xD;
      breast, from nipple to chest wall. Information gathered from this automated QT scan&#xD;
      encompasses the entire breast which is currently not commercially available using any other&#xD;
      ultrasound technology.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, multicenter, multi-arm case collection study, with IRB approval. The&#xD;
      study will follow an adaptive design with an initially planned total enrollment of&#xD;
      approximately 600 cases to include both benign and malignant cases, representative of all&#xD;
      tissue densities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images and clinical data accrued in this prospective case collection will be used for&#xD;
      creation of a database to facilitate future reader's studies, publications, building teaching&#xD;
      files, and future marketing for QT Ultrasound.&#xD;
