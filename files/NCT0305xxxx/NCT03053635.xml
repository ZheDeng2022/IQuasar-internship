      This is a phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, single-center study conducted in Canada. Subjects&#xD;
      with NMIBC (Ta, T1, and/or Tis) who are not candidates for or have refused radical cystectomy&#xD;
      will be eligible for participation in the study. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intolerance&#xD;
      or refractory disease are defined as inability to tolerate or failure to achieve a&#xD;
      tumour-free state after at least one induction (a minimum of 5 instillations) followed by&#xD;
      either a second induction (a minimum of 5 instillations) or at least 2 maintenance&#xD;
      instillations. Subjects experiencing disease relapse within 12 months or less after finishing&#xD;
      the second course of BCG therapy are also considered refractory. The study will consist of 2&#xD;
      phases. In the first phase, 3 subjects will receive PDT (TLC-3200 System) employing 0.35&#xD;
      mg/cm^2 (maximum recommended starting dose) TLD1433. If treatment with the maximum&#xD;
      recommended starting dose does not raise significant safety concerns as determined by the&#xD;
      safety monitoring committee, an additional 6 subjects will receive PDT with 0.70 mg/cm^2&#xD;
      (therapeutic dose) TLD1433.&#xD;

      10.1 Overall Study Design and Plan: Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase Ib, open-label, single-arm, single-center study conducted in Canada. Subjects&#xD;
      with NMIBC (Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer, Ta, T1, and/or Tis) who are not candidates&#xD;
      for or have refused radical cystectomy will be eligible for participation in this study. BCG&#xD;
      intolerance or refractory disease are defined as inability to tolerate or failure to achieve&#xD;
      a tumour-free state after at least one induction (a minimum of 5 instillations) followed by&#xD;
      either a second induction (a minimum of 5 instillations) or at least 2 maintenance&#xD;
      instillations. Subjects experiencing disease relapse within 12 months or less after finishing&#xD;
      the second course of BCG therapy are also considered refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 phases. In the first phase, 3 subjects will receive PDT employing&#xD;
      0.35 mg/cm^2 (maximum recommended starting dose) TLD1433 and 90 J/cm^2 of green light&#xD;
      delivered by TLC-3200. If treatment with the maximum recommended starting dose does not raise&#xD;
      significant safety concerns as determined by the safety monitoring committee, an additional 6&#xD;
      subjects will receive PDT with 0.70 mg/cm^2 (therapeutic dose) TLD1433 and 90 J/cm^2 of green&#xD;
      light delivered by TLC-3200.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Screening Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be qualified for study entry by review of inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      during the Screening Period, which will last up to 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 Maximum Recommended Starting Dose Treatment Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three subjects will receive a single instillation of 0.35 mg/cm^2 TLD1433 followed by PDT&#xD;
      (TLC-3200 System). If treatment with the maximum recommended starting dose doesn't raise&#xD;
      safety concerns after 1 month of patient follow-up based on the judgment of the safety&#xD;
      monitoring committee, the study will enroll an additional 3 subjects who will receive PDT at&#xD;
      the maximum recommended starting dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4 Follow-Up Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects enrolled, regardless of TLD1433 dose received, will be followed until the End of&#xD;
      Study defined as completion of all required assessments after 6 months of follow-up or&#xD;
      earlier due to early discontinuation or withdrawal of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Follow-Up Phase, information on safety and efficacy will be collected. Assessments&#xD;
      will be conducted at Day 7, Day 30 and monthly thereafter through Month 3, and every 3 months&#xD;
      until End of Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.6 Study Drug and PDT Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLD1433 for intravesical administration is supplied as a lyophilisate for suspension in&#xD;
      Sterile Water for Injection into the bladder and is packaged in the dark in amber&#xD;
      borosilicate glass vials which can be stored at room temperature. Just before administration,&#xD;
      it is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection to obtain the final clinical dilution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TLD1433 will be supplied by Theralase Inc. Instillations cannot be done immediately following&#xD;
      biopsy taken by TURBT. Investigators must wait a minimum of 7 days before dosing subjects&#xD;
      after a TURBT/biopsy and/or until any bladder wall integrity issues have resolved.&#xD;
      Dose/volume reductions are not allowed during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon determination of the bladder volume (during the screening period) through a voiding&#xD;
      diary or measuring instilled water volume, TLD1433 will be diluted to the proper&#xD;
      concentration. On day 0 (treatment day), subjects will be asked to restrict fluid intake 12&#xD;
      hours before study drug instillation. Study drug must be instilled into the subject's empty&#xD;
      bladder. Before instillation, a regular transurethral catheter should be inserted and the&#xD;
      bladder drained. A single instillation of TLD1433 will be infused intravesically for 60 min&#xD;
      (further TLD1433 will be instilled in case of leakage), followed by 3 washes with sterile&#xD;
      water. Bladder will be distended using a fourth instillation of sterile water to prevent&#xD;
      folds that prevent uniform light illumination. The laser technician worksheet must be&#xD;
      completed during the procedure and data must be promptly transferred to the corresponding&#xD;
      eCRF page. The optical fiber (with spherical diffuser) will be positioned in the center of&#xD;
      the bladder with the aid of TLC-3200 and will be locked in place using an endoscope holder&#xD;
      for continuous irradiation for the total exposure time. Exposure time will be calculated&#xD;
      based on power (measured at the end of the optic fiber before inserting though a liquid-tight&#xD;
      lock via catheter into the urethra) and bladder surface area to match the desired light dose&#xD;
      at the bladder wall. Green laser light (wavelength = 532 nm, energy = 90 J/cm^2) will be&#xD;
      irradiated using the spherical cavity diffuser.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.6.1 Dosing Schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single whole bladder intravesical PDT with TLD1433 and the TLC-3200 System is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.6.2 PDT Disruption&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only those patients in whom no papillary tumours remain after TURBT will be treated on this&#xD;
      protocol. If one or more papillary tumours are seen at the time of cystoscopy for laser light&#xD;
      application (maximum 6 weeks after TURBT), a patient must not be treated with the TLC-3200&#xD;
      System as scheduled, even though previously instilled with TLD1433. Procedures will be&#xD;
      followed as though the tumour were first detected at the 90-day follow-up evaluation. The&#xD;
      patient may then be treated in whatever manner the physician deems appropriate. However, such&#xD;
      patients must be followed for collection of safety information for at least 30 days after&#xD;
      TLD1433 instillation, even though alternate therapy may have been initiated during this time.&#xD;
      Adverse experiences, weekly assessment of urinary symptoms, and the results of laboratory&#xD;
      tests of blood and urine will be recorded. Full disclosure of the details of any alternate&#xD;
      therapy or other medications given during the 30-day observation period (e.g., drug, dose,&#xD;
      route, frequency and dates of administration) must be provided. After this 30-day period, an&#xD;
      interim medical history will be taken and the patient will undergo a physical examination&#xD;
      (including ECG), clinical laboratory tests, a Karnofsky Performance Status rating, and an&#xD;
      assessment of urinary symptoms and adverse experiences. The patient will then be considered&#xD;
      off study.&#xD;
