    <textblock>
      A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to evaluate oral microbiology&#xD;
      and safety of multiple C16G2 Strip applications in male and female dental subjects 12-75&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will compare multiple study drug administrations of 9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, and 36.8 mg&#xD;
      C16G2 Strip or Placebo in Study Arms 1 through 3, respectively. Enrollment of subjects in&#xD;
      Study Arms 1 through 3 will occur sequentially in an ascending dose-escalation manner. Before&#xD;
      dosing of study drug, eligible subjects will receive professional dental prophylaxis between&#xD;
      Days -7 and -2. Subjects will receive 11 doses administered over approximately two weeks.&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a single dose on Day 0, followed by 5 days of AM and PM dosing&#xD;
      starting on Day 7. To evaluate the durability of S. mutans suppression, study subjects will&#xD;
      be followed for microbiology for up to 1 month after the last study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -30 to -1), Visit 2 (Prophylaxis/Day -7 to -2),&#xD;
      Eligibility Confirmation &amp; Baseline Visit 3, Follow-up Visits 4-7 (Safety and Microbiology),&#xD;
      Visits 8-17 (Study Drug Administration), Follow-up Visits 18-20 (Safety and Microbiology) and&#xD;
      Follow-up Visits 21-22 (Microbiology only).&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Advanced periodontal disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active caries lesion(s) within 30 days prior to study drug administration (confirmed&#xD;

             study dentifrice and oral care products, or interfere with the ability to comply with&#xD;
             study requirements, or jeopardize the safety of the subject or the validity of the&#xD;
