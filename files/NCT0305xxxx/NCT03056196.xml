      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Undiagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can lead to significant morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      including death from DVT-associated massive pulmonary embolism (PE). While several validated&#xD;
      clinical prediction rules, blood test and imaging modalities exist to investigate a potential&#xD;
      DVT, there is currently a lack of rapid, accessible and reliable methods to exclude the&#xD;
      possibility of DVT without resorting to formal venous duplex scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the use in the ED of a validated clinical prediction rule combined with&#xD;
      high-sensitivity D-dimer test has a poor predictive value, as 75-90% of patients suspected of&#xD;
      DVT have a negative formal venous duplex scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compression bedside ultrasound has however recently been shown to be a safe, rapid and&#xD;
      accurate method for the diagnosis of proximal DVT in the emergency department with a high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity (combined sensitivity and specificity of 96.1% and 96.8%,&#xD;
      respectively1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators will primarily assess whether two-site compression&#xD;
      POCUS combined with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test can accurately rule out DVT in ED&#xD;
      patients regardless of the Wells criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, observational study carried out over one year in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department of the Jewish General Hospital in Montreal, Quebec. The investigators&#xD;
      aim to enroll a convenience sample of 475 patients aged 18 years and older presenting to the&#xD;
      ED with symptoms suggestive of a DVT. All enrolled patients will receive the standard of care&#xD;
      required for a lower leg DVT presentation. After calculating Patients DVT risk using modified&#xD;
      wells criteria, all patients will undergo POCUS for DVT followed by a D-dimer test. Based on&#xD;
      their results, patients will either undergo formal duplex scanning, or will be discharged&#xD;
      without further testing and receive a three-month phone follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A true negative lower leg DVT will be defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Negative follow-up phone questionnaire for patients who were sent home with no formal&#xD;
           duplex venous scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Negative formal duplex venous scanning for patients who were deemed likely to have lower&#xD;
           leg DVT using the Wells score, with a negative D-dimer and POCUS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age-adjusted DVT was added to account for below knee DVT and avoid the need for patients to&#xD;
      return for fellow up duplex study in 1 week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate our technique's sensitivity with a 4% margin of error with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals, 92 confirmed DVT patients are needed. The investigators expect to recruit a total&#xD;
      475 patients within one-year period at the JGH (95 DVT-positive patients and 380 DVT-negative&#xD;
      patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of compression bedside ultrasound with a negative age-adjusted D-dimer test to rule&#xD;
      out DVT in the ED may accelerate the decision regarding patient disposition and significantly&#xD;
      decrease the length of patient stay in the ED. In addition, it may help avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      medical interventions and diagnostic tests, thus representing potential quality of care and&#xD;
      cost-saving improvements as well.&#xD;
