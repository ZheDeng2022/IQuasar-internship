  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the sensitivity of the THINC-it tool, in measuring&#xD;
      change in cognitive deficits in individuals with MDD after receiving vortioxetine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vortioxetine is used in this study as an antidepressant to improve mood, cognition and&#xD;
      quality of life. &quot;Cognition&quot; refers to intellectual functions such as thinking,&#xD;
      understanding, learning and remembering. Vortioxetine is approved by Health Canada for the&#xD;
      treatment of MDD. In addition, vortioxetine has been reported to have a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      cognitive areas such as executive function, attention/speed of processing, and memory, that&#xD;
      are commonly affected negatively by MDD. Vortioxetine is recognized by Health Authorities in&#xD;
      the EU and many other countries as having a benefit on cognitive dysfunction (loss of&#xD;
      intellectual functions) in patients with MDD.Cognitive dysfunction is a highly persistent,&#xD;
      pervasive and progressive abnormality in young adults (i.e., 18-65 years) with MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has also been shown that among adults with MDD who are gainfully employed, measures of&#xD;
      cognition are a greater determinant of overall workplace performance than is total depression&#xD;
      symptom severity. Several lines of evidence indicate that cognitive deficits that persist&#xD;
      between episodes of depression are critical determinants of functional recovery in the&#xD;
      workplace. The functional implications associated with cognitive impairment provide the&#xD;
      impetus for systematic evaluation, measurement and assessment of the domains of cognition&#xD;
      expected to be impaired in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, no measurement tool has been sufficiently validated and/or determined to be&#xD;
      sensitive to the cognitive deficits in younger adults with MDD. Major limitations of&#xD;
      available comprehensive psychometric tools include relative lack of availability, cost, lack&#xD;
      of access to most healthcare providers, and above all else, the lengthy time to administer.&#xD;
      Moreover, the need for a psychometrist to interpret the results adds to the complexity and&#xD;
      the costliness of such an endeavor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative that any tool recommended for clinical utility be aligned with the busy&#xD;
      nature of a high-volume clinical practice. The ideal gold standard tool for assessing the&#xD;
      presence of cognitive dysfunction in MDD in the clinical environment should include, but not&#xD;
      be limited to, features such as good conceptual coverage of cognitive domains affected in&#xD;
      MDD, good sensitivity and reliability, and it should be relatively uninfluenced by culture&#xD;
      effects and practice effects. The tool would also need to be brief, easy to administer and&#xD;
      interpret, and complement busy clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the THINC-it tool will be free of charge and downloadable from the&#xD;
      THINC-it website for use in the primary care and specialty setting. The THINC-it tool will be&#xD;
      accessible via computers/tablets, will take 20 minutes to self-administer in a clinical&#xD;
      setting, and the performance results will be immediately available.&#xD;

    <measure>Early changes in cognition using Endicott Work Productivity Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Endicott Work Productivity Scale (EWPS) is a a brief (25-item) selfreport questionnaire designed to assess the degree to which a medical condition, such as a depressive disorder, affects the work functioning of a subject. The individual items of the scale have face validity as measures of different ways that work activities may be altered so that productivity and efficiency are reduced. The total score is a sensitive measure that will (1) discriminate among subjects who have varying degrees of difficulty in accomplishing their work due to an illness (rather than lack of training, skills, or aptitude) and (2) reflect even small changes in behavior related to work productivity. The items are rated on a 5-point scale of how often the behavior or feeling, or attitude has been manifested during the past week. he total score ranges from 0 (best possible score) to 100 (for the worst possible score).</description>

    <measure>Early changes in cognition using the 5-Item World Health Organization Wellbeing Index</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The WHO-5 is a short questionnaire consisting of 5 simple and non-invasive questions, which tap into the subjective well-being of the respondents. The WHO-5 only contains positively phrased items. The respondent is asked to rate how well each of the 5 statements applies to him or her when considering the last 14 days. Each of the 5 items is scored from 5 (all of the time) to 0 (none of the time). The raw score therefore theoretically ranges from 0 (absence of well-being) to 25 (maximal well-being).</description>
