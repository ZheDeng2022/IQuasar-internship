  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pupillometry will be performed before administration of tramadol, at T0 and then 1 to twice&#xD;
      per hour in children having received tramadol as a pain killer as part of his/her routine&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pupillometry measurement will be correlate to CYP2D6 phenotype and CYP2D6 genetic score&#xD;

      The proposed study is a single-center, observational and prospective study which will be&#xD;
      conducted at the Pediatric Emergency Department, Geneva Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will begin in January 2016 and will last one year. 53 patients are planned to be&#xD;
      enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children receiving oral tramadol as a pain killer at the emergency department, as part of&#xD;
      their routine care, will be informed of the current study. Patients willing to participate&#xD;
      will be included in the study after signing the inform consent (or respectively his/her&#xD;
      parents or legal guardians). A unique oral dose of dextromethorphan (0.15 mg/kg) will be&#xD;
      given to the participant for CYP2D6 phenotyping (T0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two hours later, capillary whole blood will be sampled to 1) measure the metabolic ratio&#xD;
      dextrorphan/dextromethorphan (MRDOR/DEM) in order to determine CYP2D6 phenotype (validated&#xD;
      metrics for CYP2D6 phenotyping), 2) measure tramadol and its active metabolite&#xD;
      O-desmethyltramadol (M1), and 3) to genotype for CYP2D6. Saliva sample will also be performed&#xD;
      to genotype for CYP2D6. Pupillometry will be performed before administration of tramadol, at&#xD;
      T0 and then 1 to twice per hour, throughout the patient's stay at the emergency department.&#xD;
