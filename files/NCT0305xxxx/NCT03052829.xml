  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of regular physical activity are well-established. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators have previously shown that in a population of patients with implanted&#xD;
      pacemakers, those who exercise more than 2 hours daily have improved survival compared with&#xD;
      those who exercise less than 2 hours daily. In this study, the aim f the investigators is to&#xD;
      determine whether the offering subjects with pacemakers who have low levels of physical&#xD;
      activity at baseline counseling to increase physical activity levels is effective as measured&#xD;
      by their implanted device as well as by an external pacemaker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators seek to enroll about 30 patients into a 6-month 1:1 randomized&#xD;
      interventional trial comparing the levels of physical activity in 2 groups, those who receive&#xD;
      physical activity counseling versus usual care. The activity levels will be measured with&#xD;
      external pedometers and with accelerometers embedded within the pacemaker device.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The benefits of habitual physical activity (PA, activities of at least moderate intensity&#xD;
      defined as ≥ 3 metabolic equivalents (METs)) are well-recognized. Emerging information from&#xD;
      large data sets strongly suggest high levels of sedentary behavior, defined as activities&#xD;
      &lt;1.5 METs (equivalent to the amount of energy expended during seated activities such as&#xD;
      computer work) increases the risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and death, independent&#xD;
      of the amount and intensity PA. The increased risk of sedentary behavior appears to be&#xD;
      mediated at least in part by reduced insulin sensitivity, impaired lipid metabolism,&#xD;
      increased vascular inflammation, and increased thrombotic tendencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The internal accelerometer embedded in Medtronic pacemakers registers, stores, and reports&#xD;
      total number of &quot;active time&quot; based on a threshold activity intensity level of approximately&#xD;
      70 steps/min (estimated to be &gt; 1.5 METs). This implanted accelerometer, combined with the&#xD;
      regular follow-up required for appropriate care make individuals who have undergone Medtronic&#xD;
      pacemaker implantation an ideal population in which to evaluate the impact of altering&#xD;
      sedentary behavior on mortality and cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a 12 week intervention to increase moderate intensity physical activity delivered at the&#xD;
           point of care in patients with pacemakers will result in parallel increases in active&#xD;
           time as measured by the pacemaker and step count as measured by pedometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the increase in activity measured by both the metrics in hypothesis 1 will be greater&#xD;
           than with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects who are interested in the study will have a screening visit to determine&#xD;
      whether they meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those who qualify and agree to&#xD;
      participate will be randomized into either the Physical Activity Counseling arm (intervention&#xD;
      arm) or the Patient Usual Care arm (control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the interventional arm will be given a pedometer and physical activity counseling&#xD;
      on a regular basis for 3 months. Physical activity data from their external pedometer will be&#xD;
      collected every 2 weeks via phone calls. Accelerometry data from the implanted pacemaker will&#xD;
      be collected from the subject's medical record as pacemaker interrogations are performed&#xD;
      every 3 months as part of routine clinical care. After the initial 3 month interventional&#xD;
      phase is complete, these subjects will be followed for another 3 months with collection of&#xD;
      pedometer as well as accelerometer data as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the control arm will be given pedometers for the week prior to pacemaker&#xD;
      interrogation. These subjects will be called to report the number of steps they walked each&#xD;
      day prior to the interrogation. Their accelerometry data will be captured through routine&#xD;
      clinical pacemaker interrogations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the physical activity level in each group as measured by the&#xD;
      accelerometer at time 0, 3 months and 6 months. The secondary outcome is the step count in&#xD;
      each group as measured by the pedometer at the same time points.&#xD;
