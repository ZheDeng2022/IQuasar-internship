  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational studies clearly show that people with diabetes and end-stage kidney failure&#xD;
      have an increased risk of foot ulceration and leg amputation. However, there is very little&#xD;
      evidence on addressing this problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes foot care teams have been shown to reduce hospital admissions, length of stay and&#xD;
      leg amputation in people with diabetes. Since their introduction at The James Cook University&#xD;
      Hospital (JCUH) major diabetes-related leg amputation rates have fallen by 86 percent (1995&#xD;
      to 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with diabetes and end-stage kidney failure require haemodialysis (blood cleaning) 3&#xD;
      times per week for several hours each time. This time commitment makes it difficult to attend&#xD;
      other clinical appointments. An audit at JCUH shows that this population fails to attend the&#xD;
      normal diabetes foot services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to reduce the incidence of foot disease in people with diabetes and&#xD;
      end-stage kidney failure on dialysis. The investigators will set up a podiatry-led&#xD;
      intervention within the dialysis unit to prevent and promptly treat foot disease in this&#xD;
      population. This will involve foot risk assessment, risk reduction and treatment during&#xD;
      dialysis. The intervention will involve diabetes consultants, podiatrists, vascular and&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeons . In this way the investigators hope to reduce leg amputation, hospital&#xD;
      admission, procedures to unblock arteries and death in this high risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will run in the dialysis unit at JCUH. Patients will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
      those attending for dialysis on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday will form the treatment group&#xD;
      and those attending on a Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday will continue to be managed as at&#xD;
      present. The investigators will collect data from patient health care records looking in&#xD;
      particular at leg amputations, hospital admissions due to foot problems, foot surgery and&#xD;
      operations to unblock arteries.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diabetes is the largest cause of leg amputation and kidney failure; 15-20% of people with&#xD;
      diabetes will have a foot ulcer in their lifetime, with 5-10% having an ulcer at any one&#xD;
      time. The history of a foot ulcer in a person with diabetes increases the risk of leg&#xD;
      amputation 2-3 fold. A person with diabetes is 23 times more likely to have a leg amputation&#xD;
      than a person without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of having a foot ulcer is increased by another four times and the risk of leg&#xD;
      amputation by a further eight times in people with diabetes and kidney failure on dialysis&#xD;
      compared to those with diabetes and normal kidney function. Kidney failure in people with&#xD;
      diabetes increased by 56% between 2006 and 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty per cent of people who have diabetes and a leg amputation will be dead within 5 years.&#xD;
      Those with end stage kidney failure and a foot ulcer have an even bleaker outcome: only 50%&#xD;
      will be alive in 2 years. This reduces to 26% following leg amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An audit in 2014 of the patients attending the dialysis unit at the hospital showed that half&#xD;
      had diabetes. Of these, half had had a foot ulcer at some point. Half of these had an ulcer&#xD;
      at the time of the audit. Less than one quarter of those with a foot ulcer had been reviewed&#xD;
      by the Diabetes Foot Team. National guidance states that all people with diabetes and a foot&#xD;
      ulcer should be seen by a diabetes foot team within one working day of the ulcer being&#xD;
      detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators looked for evidence to show how to reduce the risk of foot problems in&#xD;
      people with diabetes and end-stage kidney failure on dialysis but were unable to find any&#xD;
      evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regional kidney and diabetes specialist groups have confirmed that there is no such work to&#xD;
      address this problem anywhere in the North East and neither were aware of such an&#xD;
      intervention anywhere in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the leading Consultants in the UK working in the field of diabetes-foot disease are&#xD;
      aware of the existence of a project like this but were in agreement about the need for one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing literature shows the severity of the problem but not the solution. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to provide evidence to show an effective and cost-saving solution to&#xD;
      reduce the burden of diabetic foot disease in people with diabetes and end-stage kidney&#xD;
      failure People who require dialysis attend the dialysis unit 3 times a week on fixed days and&#xD;
      in a fixed session which doesn't tend to change. People with diabetes and kidney failure on&#xD;
      dialysis will be divided into 2 groups: a treatment group and a comparator group. The&#xD;
      treatment group will be those that have dialysis on a Monday, Wednesday and Friday. The&#xD;
      comparator group will be those who have dialysis on a Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator group will continue to receive diabetes foot care using the standard model&#xD;
      that is in existence at present (i.e. screening at GP practice, podiatry review close to home&#xD;
      and referral to a hospital diabetes foot team when necessary)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment group will be reviewed by a podiatrist while they are having dialysis. The&#xD;
      Podiatrist will examine their feet at the first meeting and look for diabetic foot problems,&#xD;
      if not present, make a standard assessment of the risk of diabetic foot problems developing.&#xD;
      Further management will be guided by this assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will fall into two groups :those without active foot problems but at high risk&#xD;
      of developing foot problems; and those with active foot disease (e.g. foot ulcer). High risk&#xD;
      patients without current foot problems will receive a package of treatments aimed at&#xD;
      preventing foot ulcers (including education, removal of hard skin, foot and nail care,&#xD;
      changes to shoes and the provision of bespoke insoles, creams and further podiatric review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those with active foot problems will have investigations and treatment according to&#xD;
      individual need, which might include x-rays, tests for bacterial infection, blood tests,&#xD;
      removal of hard skin, wound dressings and offloading. Treatments to improve blood supply to&#xD;
      the feet and surgical removal of infected tissue might be needed. This will be lead by the&#xD;
      podiatrist. However, other members of the diabetes foot care team (MDT) will be involved as&#xD;
      required, using the existing weekly diabetes foot MDT meetings as a forum for discussion of&#xD;
      the patients. Other MDT members will then also see the patients on the dialysis unit, thus&#xD;
      providing patient-centred care.&#xD;
