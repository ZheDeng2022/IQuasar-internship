  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common procedure in the&#xD;
      US, with about 250,000 cases performed annually. Currently, there is no consensus,&#xD;
      evidence-based post-operative pain regimen; with the majority of practitioners opting for a&#xD;
      combination of acetaminophen and narcotics for pain control. Most rhinologists avoid NSAIDs&#xD;
      due to decreased platelet aggregation and the theoretical risk of increased post-operative&#xD;
      bleeding. No studies to date have evaluated the use of ibuprofen in CRS patients following&#xD;
      ESS. Additionally, there is a lack of information regarding the average narcotic requirement&#xD;
      following ESS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this pilot prospective cohort study is to evaluate the use of narcotics in&#xD;
      sinus surgery and the effect of ibuprofen in the non-packed nose following ESS. This&#xD;
      investigation will help to gain understanding of current opioid use in post-op sinus patients&#xD;
      and assess the safety and effectiveness of post-operative ibuprofen administration on pain.&#xD;
      The investigators aim to quantify the average narcotic use following ESS, as well as evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of the addition of ibuprofen to the standard analgesic regimen on pain scores and&#xD;
      post-operative epistaxis. The investigators hypothesize that the use of ibuprofen will&#xD;
      decrease pain scores on a 10-cm visual analogue scale when compared with individuals who do&#xD;
      not use ibuprofen post-operatively, this will lead to decreased opioid use in the&#xD;
      post-operative period. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize no increase in&#xD;
      post-operative bleeding rates, again based on a 10-cm visual analogue scale and bleeding&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this will be the first study to the investigators knowledge to examine the effect&#xD;
      of post-operative ibuprofen use and its effects on opioid use, as well as pain and epistaxis&#xD;
      outcomes, in ESS. By performing this pilot prospective cohort study, the investigators will&#xD;
      be equipped to design and perform the optimal prospective, randomized study evaluating the&#xD;
      effect of NSAID in ESS during the post-operative period. The overarching goal of this&#xD;
      investigation is to decrease opioid use in post-operative pain control following ESS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Opioid use and abuse is a major public health issue. US Surgeon General, Dr. Vikta Murthy,&#xD;
      has recently called for investigation into evidence-based prescribing of opioids. Endoscopic&#xD;
      sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common procedure in the US, with&#xD;
      about 250,000 cases performed annually.1 Currently, there is no consensus for appropriate&#xD;
      post-operative analgesic control after ESS. Many practitioners use a combination of&#xD;
      acetaminophen and narcotics for pain control. Importantly, most rhinologists avoid the use of&#xD;
      NSAIDs due to a theoretical concern for decreased platelet aggregation and the potential risk&#xD;
      of increased post-operative hemorrhage. However, no studies to date have evaluated the use of&#xD;
      ibuprofen in CRS patients following ESS. Conceivably, if the investigators can improve&#xD;
      post-operative pain control after ESS with using ibuprofen, then that may decrease standard&#xD;
      prescriptions for narcotic analgesics. Given that 60% of narcotic overdose deaths are due to&#xD;
      prescribed medications, this would help deliver improved pain control with less narcotic&#xD;
      prescriptions. Therefore, the objective is to perform a pilot prospective cohort study to&#xD;
      evaluate the use of narcotics in sinus surgery and the effect of ibuprofen following ESS.&#xD;
      This pilot study will provide critical baseline data for narcotic use, ibuprofen safety and&#xD;
      ibuprofen analgesic impact to optimize the design of a future prospective, randomized study.&#xD;
      Thus, specific aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Patients with CRS will document their narcotic use in the first 7 days&#xD;
      following sinus surgery. This will allow us to reform prescribing practices. Hypothesis:&#xD;
      There will be a wide range of narcotic usage among post-op patients with the mean usage being&#xD;
      less than the amount typically prescribed post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: During enrollment the investigators will ask patients to self-select the&#xD;
      study arm they would like to join (ibuprofen versus no ibuprofen) thus documenting&#xD;
      willingness to participate, which is important in designing the future randomized study.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Most patients approached will be wiling to participate and will indicate&#xD;
      willingness to be part of a similar randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3a: Determine impact of ibuprofen on post-operative sinus surgery patients' pain&#xD;
      level. The investigators will analyze patients with CRS that are set to undergo FESS in two&#xD;
      cohorts (standard pain regimen and standard pain regimen plus ibuprofen) and assess&#xD;
      postoperative pain at days 1, 3, and 7 by 10-cm visual analogue scale, amount of&#xD;
      post-operative narcotic pain medication used, and number of days post-operatively taking&#xD;
      narcotic medications, Hypothesis: Addition of ibuprofen will decrease post-operative pain and&#xD;
      will decrease number of opioid pills used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3b: Determine impact of ibuprofens impact on post-operative epistaxis. Using the&#xD;
      same patient cohorts, degree of epistaxis will be assessed utilizing standardized recording&#xD;
      documents and a 10-cm visual analogue scale, as well as a previously used epistaxis grading&#xD;
      system.2 The investigators will assess these outcomes on post-operative day 1, 3, and 7.&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Addition of ibuprofen will demonstrate no increase in post-operative epistaxis&#xD;
      compared to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the study institution, approximately 250 endoscopic sinus cases are performed per year&#xD;
      performed by two rhinologists. This will yield ample potential research subjects to complete&#xD;
      the study. To the investigators knowledge, there is one previous study looking at the effect&#xD;
      of peri-operative NSAIDs during ESS. This study found no increased risk in intraoperative or&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding after administration of ketorolac. This will be the first study to&#xD;
      examine the effect of post-operative oral ibuprofen use and its effects on opioid use, as&#xD;
      well as pain and epistaxis outcomes.&#xD;
