  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A key question in efforts to reduce symptoms and improve quality of life for multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) patients is whether a therapeutic lifestyle (diet, stress reduction and&#xD;
      exercise) is inferior to disease-modifying drug treatments in terms of reducing multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis related symptoms, improving function and quality of life, and reducing the number&#xD;
      of acute inflammatory lesions and loss of brain volume. This study will prospectively assess&#xD;
      the changes in quality of life and clinical outcomes in two cohorts of patients who are&#xD;
      recently diagnosed with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) or relapsing-remitting multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (RRMS) to begin answering that question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to compare a diet and therapeutic lifestyle only treatment usual&#xD;
      care in the setting of newly diagnosed individuals with RRMS or CIS, which is the precursor&#xD;
      to the development of MS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to compare a diet and therapeutic lifestyle only treatment usual&#xD;
      care in the setting of newly diagnosed individuals with RRMS or CIS, which is the precursor&#xD;
      to the development of MS. The current standard of care typically includes disease-modifying&#xD;
      drug treatment at the initial diagnosis of RRMS or CIS. Many patients are interested in&#xD;
      adopting a therapeutic lifestyle as their initial approach to either RRMS or CIS. Some&#xD;
      patients decline drug therapy due to high costs and or concerns about potential medication&#xD;
      adverse events. There are no known scientific studies that have prospectively assessed&#xD;
      outcomes for newly-diagnosed patients who decline disease-modifying drug treatment and&#xD;
      instead utilized only a therapeutic diet and lifestyle to manage their MS-related symptoms.&#xD;
      This study will prospectively investigate the effect of a therapeutic diet and lifestyle on&#xD;
      quality of life, motor, cognitive and visual function, and brain structure in patients who&#xD;
      have been trained and supported by the study team to utilize therapeutic diet and lifestyle&#xD;
      to optimize neuronal health and those who are receiving usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our initial pilot study in the setting of progressive MS included diet and targeted&#xD;
      supplements, stress reduction, exercise, and electrical stimulation of muscles and&#xD;
      demonstrated significant reduction in fatigue, improvement in quality of life and improved&#xD;
      mood and cognition. Subsequent pilot studies which utilized a diet-only intervention in the&#xD;
      setting of RRMS demonstrated improved quality of life and improved walking and hand function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will again utilize a multimodal approach, a low-lectin modified Paleolithic diet,&#xD;
      stress reduction (breathing meditation exercise) and an exercise (daily walking and three&#xD;
      times a week body weight strengthening) program in the absence of drug disease modifying&#xD;
      treatment and targeted supplements in the intervention arm. The control arm will receive&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplements (intervention arm only) Participants will be asked to continue taking any dietary&#xD;
      supplements they report at beginning of study with the exception of supplements that are&#xD;
      similar to those they will be taking as part of the study which they will be asked to&#xD;
      discontinue and replace with study-approved brands (2 grams of fish oil, 1000 mcg methylB12 ,&#xD;
      400 mcg methyl folate, pyridoxine 1.5 mg and N acetylcysteine 500 mg per day, and 2000 IU&#xD;
      vitamin D3 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use videos from a three day seminar that teaches the public how to utilize a&#xD;
      therapeutic diet and lifestyle to improve cellular physiology which may favorably impact&#xD;
      disease progression to educate study participants. A registered dietitian with training in&#xD;
      motivational interviewing and health coaching will call participants to provide coaching and&#xD;
      support to participants as they adopt the study diet, breathing meditation and exercise&#xD;
      program and begin the study supplements. The study coordinator and or registered dietitian&#xD;
      will moderate monthly support group video conference meetings for participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm. The control arm will receive a monthly text/ email providing a summary to a&#xD;
      recently published clinical trial related to multiple sclerosis / clinically isolated&#xD;
      syndrome patients that is not related to diet quality or use of a therapeutic diet or&#xD;
      lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS Aim 1: To assess the magnitude of change in perceived quality of life over 12 months in&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed, disease modifying drug treatment naïve RRMS or CIS patients within and&#xD;
      between two groups. Group one will receive standard of care. Group two will receive a&#xD;
      therapeutic diet and lifestyle intervention that is taught and supported virtually.&#xD;
