  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participants will have an overnight polysomnography (recording apnea-hypopnea index), MRI&#xD;
      (brain structure), and a sleep symptoms questionnaire for baseline data. Participants will&#xD;
      then undergo 6 weeks of whole body vibration (using the whole body vibration device), 3 times&#xD;
      a week for 30 minutes sessions. After 6 weeks, participants will have complete another&#xD;
      polysomnography, MRI and sleep questionnaire.&#xD;

      OSA subjects will be recruited from the UCLA Sleep Disorders Center via recruitment flyers.&#xD;
      When prospective subjects contact the study coordinator, the study will be explained in&#xD;
      greater detail, and inclusion and exclusion criteria reviewed. If the person agrees to&#xD;
      participate, appointments for data collection will be made and copies of the informed consent&#xD;
      will be mailed for their review for at least 3 days before the study. Then the Project&#xD;
      Coordinator or one of the PI's will contact the prospective subject, answer any questions&#xD;
      about the study, and obtain signed, informed consent. Baseline measures (PSQI, BDI-II,&#xD;
      height, weight, vital signs [temperature, heart rate, blood pressure]) will be obtained. At 6&#xD;
      weeks, baseline measures will be repeated and an overnight polysomnography study will be&#xD;
      performed at the subject's home. All subjects will be given the WBV device at the end of the&#xD;
      study. Delivery of the WBV device to each subject's home will be arranged and the WBV device&#xD;
      and pedometer set up by the research team. Training in the use of the WBV device will be&#xD;
      provided inperson and via written instructions. Phone and e-mail support for the WBV device&#xD;
      or any study questions will be available for all study participants. Subjects will use the&#xD;
      device at least 3 times/week, for 30 minutes per session, for 6 weeks. In addition to the&#xD;
      pedometer, a wall calendar will be provided on which subjects will mark the days that they&#xD;
      use the WBV device. Project Coordinator will visit subjects weekly, and as needed, to record&#xD;
      pedometer readings, check wall calendar for WBV device use, and to answer any subjects'&#xD;
      questions or concerns. Brain MRI scans will be performed at baseline and after 6 weeks. An&#xD;
      MRI-compatible pulse oximeter, and an air-filled pressure transducer will be connected to the&#xD;
      subject to monitor heart rate, O2 saturation, and thoracic wall movement, and then the&#xD;
      subject will be positioned in the scanner for data collection.&#xD;

    <description>symptoms associated with sleep disturbances within the previous month, as recorded by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index Questionnaire (measures sleep symptoms, such as fatigue, sleep quality, sleep duration, etc.The PSQI is a 19-item self-report questionnaire which queries the subject regarding sleep symptoms for the month before the instrument's administration. Each question is rated on a 0-3-point scale, with a total score range of 0-21. Higher scores indicate worse sleep symptoms. A global sum of &gt; 5 indicates a &quot;poor&quot; sleeper. The PSQI has good validity when compared with overnight polysomnography measures and acceptable reliability (Cronbach's alpha &gt; 0.7; test-retest reliability 0.72-0.86)</description>
