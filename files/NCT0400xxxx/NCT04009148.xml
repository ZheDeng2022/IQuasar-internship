  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identification of BRCA mutations in ovarian cancer patients may help guide cancer therapies,&#xD;
      prognosis, post-operative screening, and other preventative treatments beyond the initial&#xD;
      diagnosis. Likewise, genetic testing of ovarian cancer patients for these germline mutations&#xD;
      provides invaluable information for families regarding cancer risk, genetic testing, and&#xD;
      subsequently indication for risk-reducing surgery. Cascade testing provides a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to identify carriers of a deleterious BRCA mutation which can allow for surgical&#xD;
      and chemoprevention of prevention of ovarian cancer. There is currently no literature on the&#xD;
      rates of referral for the family members.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to perform a pilot study, offering referral to a genetic&#xD;
      counseling and genetic testing for family members of a probands known to have a mutation in&#xD;
      BRCA1 or BRCA2. In addition to BRCA1 and BRCA2, the NCCN suggests consideration of&#xD;
      risk-reducing surgery for mutations in BRIP1, MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, RAD51C, RAD51D,&#xD;
      investigators will include these subjects as well in the study.&#xD;
