  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older adults with chronic low back pain (LBP) are at a greater risk for disability, loss of&#xD;
      independence, and lower quality of life. Experts agree that LBP is not a homogeneous&#xD;
      condition, and treatments should differ based upon clinical presentation. One particular&#xD;
      subgroup of older adults with chronic LBP are those that also have hip pain and muscle&#xD;
      weakness; in addition, many of these individuals have limited and painful movement of the&#xD;
      lumbar spine. Our past work indicates that all of these hip and lumbar spine impairments may&#xD;
      contribute to worse physical function and greater disability, but the relative importance of&#xD;
      each impairment is unclear. Thus, clinicians have limited evidence to draw on for treatment&#xD;
      decisions, for this patient population. This randomized clinical trial is designed to explore&#xD;
      two different interventions: one that addresses these hip issues (hip-focused) and one that&#xD;
      focuses more directly on the lumbar spine (spine-focused). We aim to recruit a sample of 180&#xD;
      older adults who have chronic LBP, as well as hip impairments (i.e. pain and muscle&#xD;
      weakness). To ensure our findings are generalizable, the study will be conducted across three&#xD;
      sites in different geographical regions: University of Delaware, University of Pittsburgh,&#xD;
      and Duke University.&#xD;

    <description>A 29-item short form questionnaire developed by the National Institutes of Health that assesses the following domains of health-related quality of life: physical function, anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep disturbance, ability to participate in social roles and activities, pain interference, and pain intensity. Higher scores indicate better greater presence of each outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hip Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8-weeks (i.e. post-intervention), and 6-months</time_frame>
    <description>A series of strength testing measurements will be conducted using a hand-held dynamometer. All participant and examiner body positions are standardized using study protocols, and measurement locations are standardized using anatomical landmarks (e.g. greater trochanter). Because strength is impacted by lever arm length, all strength measures are normalized to landmark distance. Strength measurements are taken for the following hip motions: abduction, adduction, extension, external rotation, internal rotation, and flexion.</description>
