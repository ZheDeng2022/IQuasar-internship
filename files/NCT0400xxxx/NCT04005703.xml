      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of extent of disease (staging) and response to therapy (restaging) is&#xD;
      performed with computed tomography (CT) scan, 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (FDG-PET scan) or integrated FDG-PET/CT. Whole-body MRI with diffusion weighted&#xD;
      imaging (WB-MRI with DWIBS) is a radiation-free method which allows imaging of the body with&#xD;
      excellent soft tissue contrast in a single examination and could be an attractive alternative&#xD;
      to FDG-PET and CT for the staging and restaging of malignant lymphomas in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to compare the diagnostic performance of whole-body MRI (including&#xD;
      DWIBS) to FDG-PET/CT and/or CT for the initial staging, early response assessment and&#xD;
      restaging after completion of therapy in children with Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for enrollment in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic cohort study&#xD;
      are children aged 8-18 years, with histologically confirmed Hodgkin's lymphoma, who are&#xD;
      treated according to the EuroNet-PHL-C1 protocol (or trial with similar imaging strategy) in&#xD;
      one of the participating centers. Patients will undergo WB-MRI in addition to the protocolar&#xD;
      imaging routinely done (FDG-PET(/CT) and CT scan) at 3 time-points: at initial staging, after&#xD;
      2 chemotherapy cycles and at end of treatment. The investigators expect to enrol 75 patients&#xD;
      in a 3 year study period. Staging and restaging results of WB-MRI (according to the Ann Arbor&#xD;
      and Cheson classification, respectively) will be compared to those of FDG-PET(/CT) and CT.&#xD;
      Clinical and radiological follow-up after 6 months will be used to solve any disagreements&#xD;
      between FDG-PET, CT and WB-MRI. Additionally, the investigators will collect 3 year follow-up&#xD;
      clinical data and data on follow-up imaging from the hospital charts of the patients, to&#xD;
      better assess the prognostic value of FDG-PET and WB-MRI.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The malignant lymphomas, Hodgkin´s lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin´s lymphoma (NHL), comprise&#xD;
      approximately 10% of childhood cancers. The assessment of extent of disease (staging) and&#xD;
      response to therapy (restaging) is performed with computed tomography (CT) scan,&#xD;
      18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET scan) or integrated FDG-PET/CT.&#xD;
      Staging and restaging are important for choice of treatment and for determining prognosis.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, FDG-PET and CT are accompanied by a significant amount of radiation exposure&#xD;
      which may induce second cancers. New magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques offer an&#xD;
      alternative way for staging and follow-up of cancers. Whole-body MRI with diffusion weighted&#xD;
      imaging (WB-MRI with DWIBS) is a radiation-free method which allows imaging of the body with&#xD;
      excellent soft tissue contrast in a single examination and could be an attractive alternative&#xD;
      to FDG-PET and CT for the staging and restaging of malignant lymphomas in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to compare the diagnostic performance of whole-body MRI (including&#xD;
      DWIBS) to FDG-PET/CT and/or CT for the initial staging, early response assessment and&#xD;
      restaging after completion of therapy in children with Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients eligible for enrollment in this multicenter, prospective, diagnostic cohort study&#xD;
      are children aged 8-18 years, with histologically confirmed Hodgkin's lymphoma, who are&#xD;
      treated according to the SKION / EuroNet-PHL-C1 protocol (or trial with similar imaging&#xD;
      strategy) in one of the participating centers. Patients will undergo WB-MRI in addition to&#xD;
      the protocolar imaging routinely done (FDG-PET(/CT) and CT scan) at 3 time-points: at initial&#xD;
      staging, after 2 chemotherapy cycles and at end of treatment. We expect to enrol 75 patients&#xD;
      in a 3 year study period. Staging and restaging results of WB-MRI (according to the Ann Arbor&#xD;
      and Cheson classification, respectively) will be compared to those of FDG-PET(/CT) and CT.&#xD;
      All imaging modalities will be assessed by a radiologist and nuclear medicine physician in a&#xD;
      blinded fashion, using standardized score forms. Findings of FDG-PET and CT together will&#xD;
      serve as the reference standard. Clinical and radiological follow-up after 6 months will be&#xD;
      used to solve any disagreements between FDG-PET, CT and WB-MRI. Additionally, at least 3 year&#xD;
      follow-up clinical data and data on follow-up imaging will be collected from the hospital&#xD;
      charts of the patients, to better assess the prognostic value of FDG-PET and WB-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical/scientific relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the accuracy of WB-MRI compared to FDG-PET(/CT) and CT in staging&#xD;
      and response assessment of Hodgkin lymphoma. The results of this study can contribute to the&#xD;
      development of evidence based 'radiation reduced' imaging protocols in Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
