    <textblock>
      The main objective is to study the variability and evolution of single-fiber jitter and fiber&#xD;
      density (FD) electrophysiological parameters in a spastic muscle during botulinum toxin type&#xD;
      A (BTA) treatment in hemiplegic patients after stroke, according to primary or multi-injected&#xD;
      status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To establish a correlation between single-fibre electrophysiological parameters and the&#xD;
      therapeutic response to BTA, clinically estimated by the MAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Creation of a database on single fibre parameters to determine a Jitter numerical&#xD;
      threshold beyond which the effect of BTA appears to be decreasing according to the clinical&#xD;
      evaluation by the MAS (Modified Ashworth Scale).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stroke is a frequent, serious and disabling condition. Spasticity interferes with the classic&#xD;
      motor pattern and reflects reflex motor activities normally inhibited by the central nervous&#xD;
      system. This term most frequently refers to a disorder that causes a speed increase dependent&#xD;
      on the tonic stretching reflex associated with an increase of tendon reflexes. About 30% of&#xD;
      patients are affected and this can occur in the short, medium and long term after stroke. It&#xD;
      would seem that, the more serious the initial motor and sensory impairments, the more likely&#xD;
      it is to develop a pattern of spasticity. The most classic upper limb (UL) pattern is that of&#xD;
      an internal adductum rotation of the shoulder coupled to a flessum of the elbow, wrist and&#xD;
      fingers. Approximately 79% of spastic patients on UL have an elbow flessum, involving at&#xD;
      different degrees the elbow flexor muscles (anterior brachialis, biceps brachialis).&#xD;
      Spasticity and its neuro-orthopedic impact, together with muscle atrophy, joint contracture,&#xD;
      pain resulting from the shortening of muscle fibres and ligaments, significantly impede the&#xD;
      progression of rehabilitation, social reintegration, the pursuit of daily living activities&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommended management of spasticity after stroke involves multidisciplinary rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs associated with botulinum toxin A (BTA) treatment. Despite this, the dose injected&#xD;
      into this muscle is ultimately more dependent on the experience, feelings and habits of the&#xD;
      referring physician. Some studies provide a safe framework for increasing doses, but&#xD;
      treatment failure by shortness of breath in initially responding patients is still possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BTA by blocking the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a source of denervation in muscle fiber&#xD;
      (MF), which causes the activation of a serine protease, urokinase. This degrades the&#xD;
      components of the basal muscle blade, causing the nerve endings to bud. The term sprouting&#xD;
      refers to the phenomenon of collateral reinnervation by adjacent fibres from nodal (Ranvier&#xD;
      nodes), terminal and ultra-terminal sites, making it possible to temporarily ensure the&#xD;
      function of parental synapses paralysed by BTA. Thus, initially, between 3 and 7 days, nodal&#xD;
      regrowth is responsible for the development of so-called &quot;immature&quot; NMJs. Then, secondarily,&#xD;
      between 4 to 8 weeks, the original synapse begins its recovery through the development of&#xD;
      terminal reinnervations, parallel to the regression of nodal regrowth. This explains&#xD;
      clinically the increase in remote spasticity of treatment and structural changes in motor&#xD;
      units (MU), usually observed after about 12 weeks. Compared to healthy (or naive) muscles in&#xD;
      this treatment, BTA-induced muscles develop amyelin-like nerve fibers with more collateral&#xD;
      and are characterized by the appearance of non-collateral or nodal reinnervations. Any motor&#xD;
      unit (MU) is normally made up of MF of the same type. The addition of adjacent denervated MFs&#xD;
      leads to a restructuring of the UM, which led to its functional modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is widely accepted that the effect of BTA is temporary and reversible and that&#xD;
      functional muscle recovery is thus allowed through the restoration of NMJ, remodelling, and&#xD;
      induced myogenesis; some studies show that its effects persist at a distance from the&#xD;
      injection. Indeed, whether directly after injection, several months or even a year later,&#xD;
      there are changes in the conformation of synaptic gutters (length, width, depths and areas),&#xD;
      with an increase in the number of nicotine receptors for Ach (ACHR) and finally a development&#xD;
      of continuous nodal reinnervations over time. At present, histological studies are the only&#xD;
      ones that have shown this. All the changes observed are not associated with an effective&#xD;
      neuromuscular transmission (NMT), which is only guaranteed by the restoration of the&#xD;
      original, much more progressive synapse. In most cases, it's estimated that NMJ is still&#xD;
      under impregnation with BTA and therefore incompletely restored at a time when it is usual to&#xD;
      repeat this treatment. This explains why, in clinical practice, the chemo-denervation process&#xD;
      does not always seem entirely anatomically reversible. At present it is not clear which&#xD;
      mechanisms are involved: insufficient contact between reinnervations and denervated MF,&#xD;
      failure of the stimulation system or failure of Schwann's peri-synaptic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects of BTA are still incompletely understood. Histological, molecular, biochemical&#xD;
      and genetic analyses explain the phenomena linking denervation to muscle remodelling, with a&#xD;
      description of muscle atrophy, a change in sarcomer structure, an increase in intramuscular&#xD;
      lipid cells, inflammatory cells, or collagen content, responsible for a reduction in&#xD;
      contractile tissue and therefore in the number of motor end plate (MEP). Unfortunately, these&#xD;
      histological data cannot be extrapolated to humans or used repeatedly for follow-up.&#xD;
      Currently, it is not known whether healthy muscles in animal models behave in the same way as&#xD;
      human spastic muscles, nor how to study the latter in clinical routine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore not exceptional that after repeated injections into the same muscle, there is&#xD;
      an escape of the initial therapeutic effects, forcing the doses to be increased a few times&#xD;
      without obtaining any results either on spasticity or on the duration of the treatment. The&#xD;
      effect of BTA may fade over time and complex neuro-orthopaedic changes in the clinical&#xD;
      picture, justifying the use of new strategies such as increasing doses, which may not always&#xD;
      be negligible. There is no specific recommendation on how to proceed, as the situations are&#xD;
      diverse and complex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature, our experience and the testimonies of patients followed in our department for&#xD;
      many years have contributed to these questions: how to explain the lack of response to BTA&#xD;
      treatment, after initial efficacy and after sometimes doubling / tripling the doses? Would&#xD;
      the investigator have a parameter capable of approaching the BTA mechanism as closely as&#xD;
      possible in order to study its variations and correlate them with the clinical response&#xD;
      established by our conventional scales? By going further, can we even consider that there may&#xD;
      be a tool that can predict the effectiveness of this treatment and thus establish&#xD;
      decision-making charts that can support physicians in their practice? In practice, the&#xD;
      assessment of spasticity and its evolution during this treatment is not always easy in view&#xD;
      of the often complex clinical pictures and readily uses clinical scales such as MAS, Tardieu.&#xD;
      These are based on restricted ordinal values, the mean of which is frequently used as a&#xD;
      reference in patient follow-up. It is lawful to question the relevance and objectivity of&#xD;
      these scales. MAS is easy and fast to use with satisfactory intra-evaluator reliability;&#xD;
      however, its reproducibility between judges remains questionable In the literature, some&#xD;
      tools for quantifying muscle tone alterations in spasticity and their modification following&#xD;
      pharmacological management by BTA are proposed and appear to be independent of the evaluator.&#xD;
      They are interested in the following properties: electrophysiological in EMG with the study&#xD;
      of neurography and H and F reflex viscoelastic in elastography and with myoton, mechanical in&#xD;
      mechanography structural in ultrasonography (61-63) and MRI. However, there are no&#xD;
      recommendations regarding these tools at this time. It seems crucial to propose within our&#xD;
      practice as physical medecine and rehabilitation physicians a quantitative, reproducible&#xD;
      evaluation, capable of abstracting itself from the evaluator's subjectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study of the single fiber EMG (SFEMG), a technique introduced in 1963 by Stålberg and&#xD;
      Ekstedt, has made it possible to understand the pathological process of affecting NMT and MF&#xD;
      rearrangement within the MU. It has been recognized as the most sensitive diagnostic test in&#xD;
      myasthenia gravis, more specifically in ocular myasthenia gravis or in atypical forms for&#xD;
      which conventional repetitive stimulation tests are rarely proven This technique has also&#xD;
      been used in anterior horn defects. It has made it possible to support the principle of&#xD;
      chronic partial denervation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to monitor its&#xD;
      evolution.The two main parameters of the SFEMG are jitter and fibre density (FD), for which&#xD;
      some reminders about NMT should be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of acetylcholine contained in a vesicle corresponds to the base unit or quantum;&#xD;
      normally released at the NMJ in an amount sufficient for a motor plate potential to generate&#xD;
      an action potential (AP) and thus a muscle contraction: this is called the safety factor.&#xD;
      However, there are normal variations in the amplitude of the motor plate potential and&#xD;
      variability in the time it takes to reach the threshold generating the AP: these different&#xD;
      variations in the inter-potential interval of NMT thus constitute the jitter. This variation&#xD;
      is usually very short in the normal subject, about 4 microseconds. This parameter thus&#xD;
      reflects the membrane state and the release of acetylcholine within the motor plate. If the&#xD;
      NMT is very altered there may be transmission blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second diagnostic interest is the study of FD, the increase in which is observed during&#xD;
      reinnervation processes (after nerve section for example) but also during muscular&#xD;
      dystrophies. It provides information on the type of muscle fibers within the MU equivalent to&#xD;
      &quot;grouping&quot; determined by muscle biopsy. The normal FD is about 1.5 fibers per recording but&#xD;
      varies with age and muscle studied. In the event of nerve damage, the denervated fibres, then&#xD;
      reinnered as well as those in the process of being destroyed, separate from their motor&#xD;
      plate, resulting in a temporary elongation of the jitter, which tends to normalize (sometimes&#xD;
      with a duration of more than one year). Secondly, the investigator are witnessing an increase&#xD;
      in the FD that can be maintained at a high level over the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Jitter, is the witness of the blockage of the NMT, then it seems to us to be a&#xD;
      relevant tool for the reflection of the BTA origin action. Many scientific articles have&#xD;
      focused on asserting or disproving subclinical manifestations of the systemic spread of BTA&#xD;
      using jitter elongation in muscles far from the initial injection site. Few have been&#xD;
      interested in the evolution of the parameters of the single fibre within the muscle itself&#xD;
      treated, except for work on the orbicular muscle of the eye in patients with blepharospasm or&#xD;
      hemifacial spasm treated with BTA. At the peak of therapeutic efficacy, jitter was&#xD;
      significantly the highest and the recurrence of involuntary movements and therefore the&#xD;
      decrease in efficacy was correlated with its normalization. Moreover, except in the fields of&#xD;
      aesthetics, of interest and relevance too far removed from the problem of our work, there is&#xD;
      no publication correlating the cumulative dose effect within the muscle itself treated with&#xD;
      electrophysiological parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our clinical observations of the ineffectiveness of certain injections in patients who are&#xD;
      usually responders and electrophysiological based on jitter and FD parameters remaining high&#xD;
      at a distance from the injection (suggesting the persistence of MNT blockage) led us to doubt&#xD;
      the scientific relevance of an on-site reoperation. The place of a paraclinical tool,&#xD;
      witnessing the reaching of this threshold, thus seems interesting to avoid the increase of&#xD;
      excessive and ineffective doses on a sufficiently denervated muscle and to be able to&#xD;
      distribute as well as possible this maximum authorized dose within involved muscles by&#xD;
      avoiding potential adverse effects and a significant additional cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preliminary study aims to study the kinetics of the electrophysiological parameters&#xD;
      &quot;jitter and FD&quot; in SFEMG during BTA treatment in hemiplegic patients after stroke, spastic on&#xD;
      one elbow flexor muscle (such as anterior brachialis, biceps brachial muscles), depending on&#xD;
      the primary or multi-injected status, in order to highlight the residual effect of this&#xD;
      treatment on NMT. It is an objective, standardized means, capable of accurately quantifying&#xD;
      the blockage of NMT by decreasing the release of acetylcholine within the synapse of muscle&#xD;
      treated with BTA. If this tool proved to be effective, it would allow in a future work the&#xD;
      realization of abacuses potentially predictive of the therapeutic effect of BTA and thus&#xD;
      justify new actions to be taken at a given time in the life of a spastic muscle (therapeutic&#xD;
      window, revision of injection patterns). SFEMG analysis coupled with ultrasound tracking is&#xD;
      part of the dynamics of our discipline on the development and implementation of technologies&#xD;
      for patients and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our assumptions are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BTA causes jitter elongation and FD increase in elbow flexor muscle after a single&#xD;
           injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Jitter is significantly longer in &quot;multi-injected&quot; subjects (cumulative dose &gt; 400 IU in&#xD;
           one elbow flexor muscle (biceps brachialis, anterior brachialisl) compared to&#xD;
           primary-injected subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is Jitter elongation maximum at peak treatment efficacy (evaluation at 4-6 weeks) and&#xD;
           will it tend to normalize at a distance from the injection (3 months-6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is a correlation between the Jitter-FD values and the therapeutic efficacy of BTA&#xD;
           estimated by the MAS scale in the elbow flexor muscle chosen.&#xD;
