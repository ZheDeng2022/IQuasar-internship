  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neurons are specialized types of cells that are responsible for carrying out the functions of&#xD;
      the brain. Neurons communicate with electrical signals. In diseases such as major depression&#xD;
      this electrical communication can go awry. One way to change brain function is using&#xD;
      electrical stimulation to help alter the communication between groups of neurons in the&#xD;
      brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test a personalized approach to brain stimulation as an&#xD;
      intervention for depression. The study researchers will use a surgically implanted device to&#xD;
      measure each individual's brain activity related to his/her depression. The researchers will&#xD;
      then use small electrical impulses to alter that brain activity and measure whether these&#xD;
      changes help reduce depression symptoms. This study is intended for patients with major&#xD;
      depression whose symptoms have not been adequately treated with currently available&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device used in this study is called the NeuroPace Responsive Neurostimulation (RNS)&#xD;
      System. It is currently FDA approved to treat patients with epilepsy. The study will test&#xD;
      whether personalized responsive neurostimulation can safely and effectively treat depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center 3-stage feasibility study of personalized closed-loop stimulation for&#xD;
      treatment resistant Major Depressive Disorder. Depending on participant's results at each&#xD;
      stage, he/she might not be eligible to proceed to all 3 stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 of the study will involve surgically implanting small, thin electrodes in brain&#xD;
      regions that regulate depression in order to identify personalized treatment sites. The&#xD;
      researchers will test stimulation in the different brain regions and their effect on&#xD;
      depression symptoms. The electrodes will be surgically removed at the end of Stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 will involve a second brain surgery to implant the NeuroPace RNS® System. Researchers&#xD;
      will use information from Stage 1 to decide where to implant the electrodes of the RNS&#xD;
      System. Over the next ~4-12 months, participants will have regular study visits in the clinic&#xD;
      where the researchers will determine a personalized brain activity pattern that correlates&#xD;
      with depression symptoms and can be paired with stimulation to improve depression symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 will be 12 months long and will involve turning ON and OFF the intervention to test&#xD;
      its effectiveness. Over the course of a year, the participant will have two 6-week periods&#xD;
      with no stimulation and will receive the intervention for the remainder of the time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this stage the participant can choose to continue with long-term follow-up or&#xD;
      have the RNS System surgically removed.&#xD;
