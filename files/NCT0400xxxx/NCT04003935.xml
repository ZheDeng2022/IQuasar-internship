  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low- grade inflammation is a pathological feature of a wide range of chronic conditions,&#xD;
      including the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and the accelerated reduction&#xD;
      in bone density. Previous research shows that diets rich in fruits and vegetables can reduce&#xD;
      chronic inflammation. To date there is no data on multiyear clinical interventions assessing&#xD;
      the effect of plant-based dietary supplements on low-grade inflammation, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease prevention and indicators of biological aging, including individuals' cognitive&#xD;
      function. In this study, the investigators are thus exploring whether separate ingestions of&#xD;
      two plant-based nutritional products over 2 years, are able to modulate low-grade&#xD;
      inflammation, parameters of CVD prevention, circulating micronutrients, upper respiratory&#xD;
      tract- and gastro-intestinal symptoms, quality of life, indicators of biological aging, and&#xD;
      cognitive function in overweight seniors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation is a central component of innate (non-specific) immunity. The termination of&#xD;
      inflammation is an active process involving cytokines and anti-inflammatory mediators like&#xD;
      lipids and micronutrients. Inflammation acts as both, 'friend and foe'; it is an essential&#xD;
      component of immunosurveillance and host defense, but a chronic low-grade inflammatory state&#xD;
      is a pathological feature of a wide range of chronic conditions, such as the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome or cardiovascular diseases (CVD). In addition, low-grade inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress are often associated with increased body fat mass, obesity but also accelerated&#xD;
      reduction in bone density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a substantial amount of evidence to suggest that many foods, nutrients and&#xD;
      non-nutrient food components modulate inflammation both acutely and chronically. Nutritional&#xD;
      regimens with adequate intake of micronutrients, vegetables, and fruits, low in sugar and&#xD;
      saturated fats, like the Mediterranean diet or a vegetarian dietary regimen, can reduce&#xD;
      chronic inflammation and oxidative stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date there is no data on multiyear clinical interventions assessing the effect of&#xD;
      plant-based dietary supplements on low-grade inflammation, cardiovascular disease prevention&#xD;
      and indicators of biological aging, including individuals' cognitive function. In this study,&#xD;
      the investigators are thus exploring whether separate ingestions of two plant-based&#xD;
      nutritional products over 2 years, are able to modulate biomarkers of low-grade inflammation&#xD;
      and CVD prevention, plasma concentrations of micronutrients, upper respiratory tract- and&#xD;
      gastro-intestinal symptoms, quality of life, indicators of biological aging, and cognitive&#xD;
      function in an overweight/obese cohort of middle-aged, elderly people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers expressing interest to take part in the study, will need to attend a screening&#xD;
      visit where their eligibility will be assessed. For participants with confirmed eligibility,&#xD;
      they will need to attend a baseline visit and consecutive study visits at 6, 12, 18 and 24&#xD;
      months. Markers of low-grade inflammation and CVD, micronutrients status, respiratory tract&#xD;
      symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12,&#xD;
      18 and 24 months. Bone quality and telomere length will be assessed at baseline, 12 and 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propensity score approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since this is a long-term trial and in order to maximize adherence to the ingestion of the&#xD;
      products, volunteers will be allowed to choose their preferred nutritional product. Instead&#xD;
      of using randomization, the investigators have chosen a propensity score (PS) approach which&#xD;
      helps to reduce bias with regards to random significances. More specifically, for each&#xD;
      participant an individual score based on certain parameters, likely to affect the primary&#xD;
      outcomes, will be calculated and will be matched with another participant with the same PS&#xD;
      across the three groups. PS matching will be implemented without replacement and setting the&#xD;
      caliper equal to 0.025. Furthermore, to ensure an adequate number of matching PSs between&#xD;
      groups, about a 3-fold number of subjects needed to enter the study, will be pre-screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a sample size of 20 subjects per group (total sample size = 60), the disjunctive power&#xD;
      for testing each primary endpoint (i.e., the probability of establishing a significant effect&#xD;
      in supplementation-control or between-supplementation comparisons) is 78%, 51%, 97% for&#xD;
      TNF-α, homocysteine and vitamin C (1st ranked parameter for each co-primary outcome),&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it is estimated to have a maximum drop-out rate of 30% over 2 years. In order to&#xD;
      ensure balanced distribution of subjects across the three different groups, the investigators&#xD;
      will also stratify for gender and age. Based on this sample size calculation and in order to&#xD;
      meet the stratification standards, 30 subjects will be recruited to be allocated to each&#xD;
      group, corresponding to a total N of 90 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by using SPSS for Windows software, version 22.0.&#xD;
      Metric data will be presented as mean ± SD. Statistical significance is set at P &lt; 0.05. The&#xD;
      Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to determine normal distribution. To check homogeneity of&#xD;
      variances the Levene test will be used. Comparisons of mean values of metric baseline data&#xD;
      between the 3 groups will be done by analysis of variance, ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If data are normally distributed and variance homogeneity is fulfilled, all metric analytes&#xD;
      from blood (low-grade inflammation markers, CVD-prevention markers, micronutrients, telomer&#xD;
      length, clinical chemistry etc) will be analyzed by one- and two-factorial (either 'time' or&#xD;
      'time x treatment') repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and co-variance (ANCOVA,&#xD;
      e.g. diet/dietary inflammatory index (DII), exercise), within each group and between groups.&#xD;
      Student's t-test for paired samples will be used for within group analysis as soon as 6-month&#xD;
      data are available. For post-hoc analyses the Bonferroni(-Holm) correction and/or Tukey´s&#xD;
      post-hoc test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is not possible to use metrical data, non-parametric tests will be used like the&#xD;
      Friedman Test (within group) and the Kruskal Wallis test (between groups). If differences&#xD;
      between groups reach significance the Tukey's post hoc test, the Bonferroni correction or the&#xD;
      Bonferroni-Holm-method (for non-parametric data) will be used to determine the localization&#xD;
      of the differences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive correlation analyses to compute relations within each outcome-category and&#xD;
      between the different outcome-categories will be conducted, also the PS-categories will be&#xD;
      included into these correlation analyses.&#xD;
