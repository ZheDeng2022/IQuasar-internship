    <textblock>
      simple combination of functional investigation, in form of laryngostroboscopy, together with&#xD;
      conventional histopathological examination, provides a highly sensitive method in&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of undiagnosed vocal folds irregularites&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vocal folds irregular mucosal changes often manifest as mucosal surface changes of&#xD;
      leukoplakia, erythroplakia and keratosis associated with tissue irregularities. Lesions that&#xD;
      go beyond the outermost layer of the vocal fold and invade the intermediate and deep layers.&#xD;
      These gross mucosal changes may represent benign, premalignant, or malignant entities as they&#xD;
      correspond to large spectrum of lesions ranging from simple totally benign keratosis with or&#xD;
      without atypia up to invasive carcinoma, it is commonly encountered in phoniatrics clinic and&#xD;
      presents diagnostic and therapeutic challenge as there is no unified surgical indication or&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laryngostroboscopy is very important and primary tool for assessment of morphological&#xD;
      features and vibratory functions of the vocal folds. Stroboscopic evaluation allows early&#xD;
      detection of infiltrative processes of the vocal folds. However, the laryngoscope examination&#xD;
      may not always be sufficient to assess premalignant lesions and their exact delineation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gugatschka et al., 2008 reported that videostroboscopic evaluation allows early detection of&#xD;
      infiltrative processes of the vocal folds, as they achieved a sensitivity of more than 97 %,&#xD;
      when used a combination of cytology and videostroboscopy, in contrast to 74 % as found by&#xD;
      cytology alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zhang et al., 2018 proposed to classify VF leukoplakia into three types according to the&#xD;
      morphological appearance. The evaluated features included texture, color, and thickness. They&#xD;
      proved that type III-bulge and rough-with irregular, nonhomogeneous leukoplakia higher than&#xD;
      mucosa surface was more often associated with cancerization or severe dysplasia in 29.3% and&#xD;
      21.5% cases, respectively, comparing to the respective percentages of 4.0% and 3.7% for type&#xD;
      I-flat and smooth leukoplakia. Anna Rzepakowska et al submitted a protocol for evaluation of&#xD;
      the morphological characteristics of leukoplakia which involved the following features of the&#xD;
      lesion: color, texture, size, thickness, symmetry and vibratory function. Each character was&#xD;
      assigned with the score of zero or one (score zero was considered to be a clinical indicator&#xD;
      of benign lesions, while, score one was a clinical indicator of malignancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in basic research have improved understanding of underlying mechanisms of&#xD;
      molecular processes in early stages of laryngeal cancer development. The SOX2 gene located at&#xD;
      3q26 is frequently amplified and overexpressed in multiple cancers, including head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). The tumor-promoting activity and involvement of SOX2 in&#xD;
      tumor progression has been extensively demonstrated, thereby emerging as a promising&#xD;
      therapeutic target. However, the role of SOX2 in early stages of tumorigenesis and its&#xD;
      possible contribution to malignant transformation remain unexplored. Granda-Diaz etal., 2019&#xD;
      investigated for the first time SOX2 gene in precancerous lesion using real-time PCR and&#xD;
      demonstrated that SOX2 protein expression and gene amplification are frequent events in early&#xD;
      stages of laryngeal tumorigenesis&#xD;
