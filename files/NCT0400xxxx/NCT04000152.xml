  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chromosomal aneuploidies are linked with spontaneous miscarriages and abnormal offspring in&#xD;
      human pregnancies. In addition, some types of aneuploidy are reported to prevent&#xD;
      implantation. Thus, there is a need to identify the embryos with highest implantation&#xD;
      potential on in vitro fertilization (IVF) programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since embryo morphology and kinetics have a weak association with embryo ploidy,&#xD;
      trophectoderm biopsy plus Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is becoming a very popular&#xD;
      approach to determine the embryo chromosomal status. This technique is called Preimplantation&#xD;
      Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A). Although shown to be efficient, it is invasive for&#xD;
      the embryo, requires specific technical skills and it remains expensive. Therefore, the&#xD;
      development of a non-invasive, rapid and cheaper method for assessing embryo ploidy status&#xD;
      would represent a progress in the field of IVF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-invasive approach has been explored by some groups that analyzed the Spent Blastocyst&#xD;
      Medium (SBM) where the embryo was incubated up to the time of transfer or freezing. In daily&#xD;
      routine, this media is discarded after finishing the culture of the embryo. Importantly,&#xD;
      though, this media reportedly contains traces of embryonic cell-free DNA (cfDNA) that can&#xD;
      represent the genetic load of the embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of that, the hypothesis of this study is that embryo prioritization according to&#xD;
      the analysis of the embryonic cfDNA in the SBM could improve ongoing pregnancy rate in 10&#xD;
      percentual points compared to standard blastocyst transfer based on morphology.&#xD;

      Current Preimplantation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) techniques analyze the full&#xD;
      chromosome content of a single or few cells with high sensitivity and specificity using&#xD;
      Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). Although shown to be efficient, the technique suffers from&#xD;
      some limitations. It requires an embryo biopsy, specific technical skills and it still&#xD;
      remains expensive. Therefore, non-invasive techniques for assessing embryo ploidy status are&#xD;
      sought as an alternative. Such non-invasive approaches would have various advantages over&#xD;
      current strategies, including the elimination of a costly micromanipulation biopsy procedure&#xD;
      and the avoidance of risks associated with cell removal. Furthermore, it would be more&#xD;
      advantageous, especially for those patients who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF)&#xD;
      treatment but do not have PGT-A indication or they are not willing to have their embryos&#xD;
      tested with invasive techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the recent advances in the field is the identification of embryonic cell-free DNA&#xD;
      (cfDNA) during embryo culture in the lab. It is released to the culture drop (SBM) and&#xD;
      represents the chromosome content of the embryo. In a recent pilot study, we analyzed the&#xD;
      concordance rates between trophectoderm (TE) biopsy and SBM. In SBM collected on day 6/7 of&#xD;
      development, the results were concordant with TE biopsies in 84% of samples, with a&#xD;
      false-positive rate of 8.6% and a false-negative rate of 2.5%. These findings are encouraging&#xD;
      and were the base for the design of the current RCT study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the potential clinical benefits of a new&#xD;
      non-invasive method for PGT-A, based on the analysis of the embryonic cfDNA released into&#xD;
      SBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering a dropout rate of around 30% (treatment or monitoring failures and no day 6/7&#xD;
      blastocysts to transfer), a total of 872 participants will be randomized before the ovum&#xD;
      pick-up. They will be allocated on a balanced way (1:1 ratio) in one of the two arms: 1)&#xD;
      Single Embryo Transfer (SET) on day 6/7 with deferred blastocyst transfer based on the&#xD;
      chromosomal status according to the analysis of the SBM; 2) SET on day 6/7 with deferred&#xD;
      blastocyst transfer based on embryo morphology. Reproductive outcomes (defined following The&#xD;
      International Glossary on Infertility and Fertility Care, 2017) will be compared between the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data exported from the clinical histories and source documents will be duly codified to&#xD;
      protect the clinical and personal information of patients in accordance with the current&#xD;
      legislation. This information will be exported to an electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). An&#xD;
      interim analysis of this data is planned once 30% of the recruitment has been reached.&#xD;
      Besides, the study will be overseen by an independent Data Monitoring Committee after 30% of&#xD;
      patients´ recruitment.&#xD;
