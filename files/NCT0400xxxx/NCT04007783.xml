      Surgical reconstruction to restore oral function and aesthetics after major ablative surgery&#xD;
      in the oral cavity forms a challenge to maxillofacial surgeons, and greatly impacts patient'&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL). The &quot;Oncological-bridge (O-bridge®)&quot; protocol, which offers&#xD;
      (immediate/delayed) fixed prosthetic rehabilitation in a minimum of sessions and a strongly&#xD;
      reduced two-week treatment time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The investigators aim to demonstrate the added value of the &quot;O-bridge® protocol&quot;&#xD;
      in a larger sample size of at least 20 patients eligible for (immediate/delayed) fixed&#xD;
      prosthodontic rehabilitation at time of oral cavity (mandibular) reconstruction study design:&#xD;
      a prospective, observational cohort study. The &quot;O-bridge® protocol&quot;, in which the&#xD;
      standardized concept of implant loading and that of oral cavity (mandibular) reconstruction&#xD;
      are combined with an adapted prosthetic manufacturing protocol, will be offered to eligible&#xD;
      patients requiring ablative surgery because of a benign or malignant tumour of the oral&#xD;
      cavity or stage 3-4 osteonecrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be screened by the local maxillofacial surgeon and the prosthodontist to&#xD;
      determine eligibility for the procedure. Imaging will be performed as part of routine&#xD;
      surgical preparation. Clinical function, as measured with the 11-item scale by Rogers and&#xD;
      intelligibility of speech will be assessed by the speech therapist and/or appointed health&#xD;
      care employee prior to surgery, 3 months post-surgery and/or at time of implant placement,&#xD;
      and at 6 weeks after placement of the O-bridge®. In addition, EORTC quality of life C30 and&#xD;
      HN35 questionnaires will also be completed at those time-points, and at 6 months after&#xD;
      placement of the O-bridge®. Speech-, food- and prosthetic fit-related items from the Oral&#xD;
      Health Impact Profile (OHIP) questionnaire will be completed at 6 weeks and at 6 months after&#xD;
      placement of the O-bridge®. Parameters related to implant and bridge stability and patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, measured through a 10-point visual analogue scale, will be assessed at 6, 12,&#xD;
      24, 36, 48 and 60 months at routine follow-up consultation after placement of the O-bridge®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a primary endpoint, the investigators aim to demonstrate that the O-bridge® protocol&#xD;
      significantly improves short-term patient' quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators aim to demonstrate the validity and reliability of the O-bridge®&#xD;
      protocol, based on its short- and long-term biologic implant stability and mechanical&#xD;
      stability of the prosthesis. In addition, they aim to measure the impact of the O-bridge® on&#xD;
      speech intelligibility.&#xD;
