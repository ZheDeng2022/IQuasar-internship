      pretreated HER2 negative metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women, which is a serious threat&#xD;
      to women's health. Despite the continuous improvement of treatment, 30% of breast cancer&#xD;
      eventually develops into advanced breast cancer. The median survival of advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer after routine treatment is 2-3 years. The main treatments include chemotherapy,&#xD;
      endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy. The treatment of metastatic breast cancer (MBC) aims&#xD;
      to improve quality of life, reduce pain and prolong survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Angiogenesis plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Various&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab, sunitinib, sorafenib, etc. have been developed and&#xD;
      widely used in various tumors. Treatments such as colon cancer, lung cancer, and renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma significantly improve PFS and OS in patients with advanced disease, and the adverse&#xD;
      reactions are well tolerated. However, anti-angiogenic therapy has certain limitations in the&#xD;
      treatment of advanced breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anrotinib hydrochloride capsule is a new drug independently developed in China. It is a&#xD;
      multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting angiogenesis-related kinases such&#xD;
      as VEGFR1/2/3, FGFR1/2/3 and other kinases such as cell growth-related kinases such as&#xD;
      PDGFRα/β, c-Kit, and Ret , and it was approved by China Food and Drug Administation for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have&#xD;
      progressed or relapsed after receiving at least 2 systemic chemotherapy. Basic research shows&#xD;
      that anlotinib is effective in breast cancer cell lines, but lacks the results of clinical&#xD;
      application of advanced breast cancer. This study is based on the results of phase I clinical&#xD;
      trials of allerinib in a variety of advanced solid tumors, to explore its efficacy and safety&#xD;
      in HER2-negative advanced breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Objective response rate defined as confirmed complete response or partial response under RECIST 1.1 criteria. CR is complete disappearance of all target lesions and PR is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference baseline sum LD. To be assigned a status of CR or PR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by repeat assessments performed no fewer than 4 weeks after the response criteria are first met.</description>

    <description>Progression-free survival estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods is defined as the time from the date of informed consent to the earlier of death or disease progression. Patients alive without disease progression are censored at the date of last disease evaluation. Progressive disease (PD) based on RECIST 1.1 is at least a 20% increase in the sum of longest diameter (LD) of target lesions taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Equivocal progression of non-target lesions also qualifies as PD.</description>
