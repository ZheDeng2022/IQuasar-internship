      Immunotherapy has significantly improved the survival outcomes of patients with various&#xD;
      cancer types including thoracic malignancies. In the PACIFIC study, patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC were randomized to the anti-PDL1 antibody durvalumab or placebo for up to 12&#xD;
      months after completion of concurrent chemoradiation. While NSCLC is typically considered&#xD;
      relatively non-immunogenic, RT is thought to augment tumor immunogenicity(Iyengar &amp; Gerber,&#xD;
      2013). The abscopal effect refers to the observation that the benefit seen in PACIFIC, along&#xD;
      with the growing role of immunotherapy for the treatment advanced (stage IV) NSCLC, suggests&#xD;
      that earlier exposure to durvalumab may improve outcomes and be well tolerated, thereby&#xD;
      permitting de-escalation of therapy through removal of conventional chemotherapy from these&#xD;
      regimens to a local area results in an antitumor effect distant to the radiation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab (Imfimzi; MEDI4736; AstraZeneca) is a human monoclonal antibody of the&#xD;
      immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 kappa subclass that inhibits binding of PD-L1 (B7-H1, CD274) to PD-1&#xD;
      (CD279) and CD80 (B7-1). MEDI4736 is composed of 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical&#xD;
      light chains, with an overall molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa. MEDI4736 contains a&#xD;
      triple mutation in the constant domain of the Ig G1 heavy chain that reduces binding to&#xD;
      complement protein C1q and the Fcγ receptors involved in triggering effector function.&#xD;
      Durvlumab binds with high affinity and specificity to human PD-L1 and blocks its interaction&#xD;
      with PD-1 and CD80&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1 Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) proven diagnosis of NSCLC with,&#xD;
        medically inoperable (or patients who refuse resection) stage IIIA or stage IIIB disease&#xD;
        (AJCC 8th edition);&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1.1 Inoperable Stage IIIA disease is defined by multiple and/or bulky N2 mediastinal&#xD;
        lymph nodes on computed tomography (CT) scan such that, in the opinion of the treating&#xD;
        investigator, the patient was not a candidate for surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1.2 N2 disease must have been documented by biopsy, or at a minimum by fluorodeoxyglucose&#xD;
        positron emission tomography (PET) or CT if nodes were more than 2 cm in short axis&#xD;
        diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1.3 T4 disease is often considered resectable at the discretion of a thoracic surgeon.&#xD;
        Patients with T4N0 or T4N1 disease can be enrolled if their case is reviewed by a thoracic&#xD;
        surgeon and felt to be unresectable or if they are either medically inoperable or refuse&#xD;
        surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1.4 Stage IIIB patients have N3 or T4N2 status. N3 status must have been documented by&#xD;
        the presence of a contralateral (to the primary tumor) mediastinal lymph node or&#xD;
        supraclavicular or scalene lymph node proven by biopsy, or at a minimum by&#xD;
        fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET or more than 2 cm in short axis diameter on CT scan.&#xD;
        Patients with disease extending into the cervical region (defined as disease extending&#xD;
        above cricoid cartilage) are not eligible.&#xD;

        60 days prior to registration (recommended within 30 days prior to registration);&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.2.3 MRI of the brain with contrast (or CT with contrast if MRI is medically&#xD;
        contraindicated) within 60 days prior to registration; note: the use of intravenous&#xD;
        contrast is required for the MRI or CT (unless medically contra-indicated).&#xD;
&#xD;

        intravenous antibiotics at registration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.8 Patients with a pleural effusion that is transudative, cytologically negative and&#xD;
        non-bloody, are eligible if the radiation oncologist feels the tumor can be encompassed&#xD;
        within a reasonable field of radiotherapy; if pleural fluid is too small a volume to&#xD;
        effectively sample by thoracentesis and does not show increased metabolic activity on&#xD;
        CT/PET imaging, the patient will be remain eligible.&#xD;

&#xD;
        1.12.1 A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,&#xD;

          -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has&#xD;

&#xD;
        1.12.2 Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test for&#xD;
        female pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
        amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The following age-specific&#xD;
        requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments&#xD;
             and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the&#xD;
             post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
             treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
             chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent surgical&#xD;

        prednisone equivalents) or other immunosuppressive medications within 7 days of study drug&#xD;
        administration. Inhaled or topical steroids and adrenal replacement doses &gt; 10 mg daily&#xD;
        prednisone equivalents are permitted in the absence of active autoimmune disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.7 Severe, active co-morbidity defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.7.1 Major surgical procedure (as defined by the Investigator) within 28 days prior to the&#xD;

        inflammatory bowel disease [e.g., colitis or Crohn's disease], diverticulitis [with the&#xD;
        exception of diverticulosis], systemic lupus erythematosus, Sarcoidosis syndrome, or&#xD;
        Wegener syndrome [granulomatosis with polyangiitis, Graves' disease, rheumatoid arthritis,&#xD;
        hypophysitis, uveitis, etc]). The following are exceptions to this criterion:&#xD;

&#xD;
        2.7.7 Receipt of live attenuated vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of IP.&#xD;
        Note: Patients, if enrolled, should not receive live vaccine whilst receiving IP and up to&#xD;
        30 days after the last dose of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.8 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
        investigator, would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.9 Pregnancy, nursing females, or women of childbearing potential and men who are sexually&#xD;
        active and not willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception; this&#xD;
        exclusion is necessary because the treatment involved in this study may be significantly&#xD;
        teratogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.10 Patients whose radiation treatment plans are likely to encompass a volume of whole&#xD;
        lung receiving ≥ 35% of lung volume. V20s up to 37% will be permitted and viewed as a minor&#xD;

        is within patient tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.11 Planned radiation cardiac dose V50 &gt;25%.&#xD;
