  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Helicobacter pylori (Hp) is the major cause of gastritis and gastritis-associated diseases.&#xD;
      Detection of a regular arrangement of collecting venules (RAC) pattern in the lesser gastric&#xD;
      curvature correlates with negative Hp status with a sensitivity and negative predictive value&#xD;
      (NPV) higher than 90% in Asian countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study carried out in our hospital, it has been shown that the presence of RAC&#xD;
      pattern in the lesser gastric curvature, evaluated with high definition endoscopy, can&#xD;
      accurately identify patients without Hp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to confirm the validity of the endoscopic diagnosis of Hp infection&#xD;
      in the West by means of the RAC pattern in a multicenter prospective study and to evaluate&#xD;
      interobserver variability before establishing its applicability in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We designed a prospective study including patients who will undergo upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      endoscopy from July 2019 to June 2020 at the Endoscopy Unit of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ethics Committee of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona approved the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper gastrointestinal endoscopies will be performed with high definition endoscopes&#xD;
      (Olympus, Germany) without magnification by three endoscopists. One of the endoscopists is&#xD;
      considered as an expert with more than 20 years of experience and prior training in Japanese&#xD;
      centers. All the examinations will be performed with sedation controlled by an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist. After the routine examination of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum,&#xD;
      close observation will be carried out at the distal part of the lesser curvature and pictures&#xD;
      will be taken. The Olympus system will be used for image storing and text reporting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of a regular or irregular arrangement of collecting venules will be evaluated in&#xD;
      real time during gastric exploration in the lower part of the lesser curvature of the gastric&#xD;
      body with good insufflation, close to the incisura angularis. If minute red points were&#xD;
      visible regularly and homogenously, the finding will be scored as RAC positive (RAC+). If&#xD;
      this finding was absent or there was a patchy distribution at the site of close observation,&#xD;
      it will be defined as RAC negative (RAC-).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following baseline characteristics will be collected: age, sex, antibiotics, proton-pump&#xD;
      inhibitors, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), antithrombotic or anticoagulant&#xD;
      use in the last two weeks, history of Hp eradication and detection of significant endoscopic&#xD;
      findings (erosive duodenitis, non-erosive duodenitis, duodenal ulcer, erosive gastritis,&#xD;
      gastric ulcer and signs of atrophic gastritis or intestinal metaplasia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hp infection status will be determined by mucosal biopsies. We will perform 5 samples for&#xD;
      histological study according to Sydney criteria (2 in antrum, 1 in incisura angularis and 2&#xD;
      in gastric body); or 2 biopsies (1 in antrum and 1 in gastric body) for histology and&#xD;
      immunohistochemical study for Hp. Patients were classified as Hp positive if one of these two&#xD;
      tests are positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the histological study, samples will be fixed in formalin and stained with hematoxylin&#xD;
      and eosin for the evaluation of gastritis and with Giemsa for Hp status. The&#xD;
      immunohistochemical study will be carried out systematically in the case of a negative&#xD;
      histological study for Hp. The pathologist has access to the endoscopic diagnosis but not to&#xD;
      RAC status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative variables will be described by the mean and the standard deviation, while&#xD;
      the qualitative variables by proportion. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive&#xD;
      value (PPV), NPV and accuracy of RAC for the diagnosis of uninfected Hp patients will be&#xD;
      calculated. 95% confidence interval will be calculated by using standard formula. Comparisons&#xD;
      will be done using Chi-square test for categorical variables and t test for continuous&#xD;
      variables. In addition, a multivariate logistic regression analysis will be carried out to&#xD;
      assess the existence of predictive factors of RAC and the odds ratio (OR) was calculated to&#xD;
      indicate the associated risk. P &lt;0 .05 will be considered statistically significant. All&#xD;
      statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS, version 23 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, USA).&#xD;
