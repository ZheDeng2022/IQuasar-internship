    <textblock>
      Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited heart defect where the heart takes longer to recover&#xD;
      between beats. LQTS is a known condition predisposing young footballers to sudden cardiac&#xD;
      death (SDC). The existence of LQTS can be established by measuring the QT interval in an&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG). Currently pre-participation cardiac screening is performed in young&#xD;
      athletes but players may only be screened at 16 years old using only a resting ECG, and a&#xD;
      medical check including a questionnaire on family and medical history. However, the&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity of the screening to investigate underlying causes of SCD could be&#xD;
      improved with the addition of an exercise stress test or cardiopulmonary exercise test&#xD;
      (CPET). Certain abnormalities in the heart may only become apparent when the heart has been&#xD;
      stressed (e.g. via exercise). This is particularly important as in young athletes these&#xD;
      abnormal rhythms manifest during rest and recovery rather than at peak exercise. The CPET&#xD;
      measures changes in the ECG in response to exercise that increases in intensity in a&#xD;
      continuous manner until the participant cannot exercise any long. However, football is&#xD;
      characterised by high- intensity bouts of exercise interspersed with low-intensity bouts or&#xD;
      pauses. Therefore, the continuous test does not reflect the movement patterns of football and&#xD;
      may not stress the cardiovascular system in a similar manner. To address this, intermittent&#xD;
      graded exercise tests have been developed to reflect the intermittent movement pattern. As&#xD;
      yet there is limited evidence on whether there are any differences in ECG changes during&#xD;
      intermittent exercise. Specifically, it is not clear how an intermittent movement pattern&#xD;
      might affect the QT interval.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an ion channelopathy which occurs in approximately 1 in every 2500&#xD;
      individuals. Symptoms include; syncope, seizures and sudden cardiac death (SCD). LQTS's&#xD;
      genetic defects culminate in delayed cardiac repolarization identified on a 12 lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram (ECG) as a prolonged QT interval. Due to the dynamic nature of&#xD;
      channelopathies, some abnormalities could be missed with a resting ECG alone. In young&#xD;
      athletes cardiac arrhythmia's predisposing athletes to SCD do not usually occur at peak&#xD;
      exercise but during warm-up, recovery or periods of reduced exercise intensity (e.g. rest&#xD;
      phases in football games). Environments causing increase in body temperature, heat rate, and&#xD;
      autonomic status should therefore be included in the assessment of risk of SCD. Whilst the&#xD;
      use of cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) is commonplace, the use of such an exercise&#xD;
      test is often performed using a continuous ramp or step procedure (e.g Bruce protocol).&#xD;
      However, during games play such as football, movements are not continuous but intermittent&#xD;
      characterised by rest phases and lower intensity periods of exercise. The primary aim of this&#xD;
      study is to assess the duration and dispersion of the QT interval during and immediately&#xD;
      following the performance of a continuous (CONT), and an intermittent (INT) maximal graded&#xD;
      exercise test in a group of young (&lt; 16-18 yr) semi-professional soccer players. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that the INT graded exercise test will induce greater inter-individual&#xD;
      variability in the QT interval compared to the CONT trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit approximately 50 players from Sunderland Foundation of Light&#xD;
      regional training centre (RTC) with a minimum sample size of 24. We will use a replicated&#xD;
      randomised repeated measures crossover design in which the participants will be randomised to&#xD;
      different sequences of four experimental conditions; two continuous graded exercise tests,&#xD;
      and two intermittent graded exercise tests, randomised using a Latin square counterbalanced&#xD;
      design. Participants will be required to perform all four exercise conditions at&#xD;
      approximately the same time of day (± 1 h) to control for within-athlete variation. Each&#xD;
      exercise condition will be separated by at least 72 h with all testing sessions complete&#xD;
      within a 2-4 week period. The following constraints will be placed on the participants to&#xD;
      improve the strength of the study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid strenuous physical activity for 48-72 h prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Avoid caffeine consumption for 4 h prior to testing and alcohol at least 12 h.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintain normal hydration by drinking to thirst prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consume a high carbohydrate meal 2 h prior to testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise will be performed in a temperature controlled physiology laboratory. Participants&#xD;
      will perform two graded exercise tests, repeated twice. The continuous graded exercise test&#xD;
      (CONT) will increase treadmill speed incrementally using three minute stage duration on a&#xD;
      motorised treadmill. The initial speed will be individualised designed to evoke a heart rate&#xD;
      around 40-50% of one's age predicted maximal heart rate using 206.9 - (0.67* age [yrs]). This&#xD;
      will be gauged from a 3 minute low intensity warm-up at the start. The speed will increase by&#xD;
      1 km.hr-1 every three minutes until volitional exhaustion. The gradient of the treadmill will&#xD;
      be set at 1 % to reflect energy expenditure of over-ground running. Gradient will only be&#xD;
      increased if the performer reaches the limits of their stride frequency and length and&#xD;
      therefore it would be inappropriate to continue to increase speed of the belt. The&#xD;
      intermittent graded exercise test (INT) will follow the same procedure. However, the speed&#xD;
      within each three minute exercise bout will vary every 30 s between the target speed, and a&#xD;
      complete pause for 30 s. The acceleration of the treadmill belt will be set to its maximum&#xD;
      capability. Participants will be familiarised with this acceleration to ensure safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood lactate&#xD;
&#xD;
      A post- exercise capillary blood lactate sample will be taken from the participants' finger-&#xD;
      tip of their non-dominant hand. The finger -tip will be punctured using a disposable lancet&#xD;
      to obtain the capillary blood sample. The small sample of blood is then collected and&#xD;
      analysed using a portable blood lactate analyser (Lactate Pro). The finger will be cleaned&#xD;
      using an alcohol swab to reduce infection. The researcher taking the blood will be wearing&#xD;
      appropriate personal protective equipment including latex-free gloves when obtaining the&#xD;
      blood. The blood measure is used as an end-point (among others) to confirm if maximal effort&#xD;
      has been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gas analysis Respiratory data will be recorded continuously throughout each exercise test&#xD;
      using an online breath by breath metabolic gas cart (Cortex, metamax). Certified standard&#xD;
      calibration gases of 16.4% O2 and 4.5% CO2 will be used (Cryoservice Ltd, Worcester, UK). The&#xD;
      turbine flow meter, used for the determination of V ̇E, will be calibrated with a 3 L syringe&#xD;
      (Cosmed Srl). Room temperature (°C), relative humidity (%) and barometric pressure (mmHg)&#xD;
      will recorded separately from a weather station. Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) (modified&#xD;
      category-ratio scale) (Foster et al., 2001) expressed as an arbitrary unit (AU) will obtained&#xD;
      in the final 15 s of each speed stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All breath-by-breath data will be processed using 30 s retrograde averages (Midgley et al.,&#xD;
      2007) obtained directly from the metamax software®, with the highest VO2 in the final stages&#xD;
      deemed to be VO2max (Midgley et al., 2007). The use of middle 5 of 7 breath averaging will be&#xD;
      used for assessment of submaximal data including the ventilatory threshold (Nichols et al&#xD;
      2015). VO2max will be deemed to be achieved if ≥2 of the following criteria are met (Keren et&#xD;
      al., 1980): a plateau in VO2 defined as a change of less than 0.2 L.min-1 despite an&#xD;
      increasing workload (Howley et al., 1995), a respiratory exchange ratio (RER) of &gt;1.15, a&#xD;
      maximal heart rate (HRpeak) within ±10 beats.min-1 of the estimated HRpeak (206.9 - [0.67 x&#xD;
      age]), an RPE greater than 8 (Howley et al., 1995) and a 5 min post blood lactate of &gt; 8 mM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography, Electrocardiography and QT interval analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) will be used to investigate the existence of&#xD;
      any structural cardiac abnormalities. An initial assessment will be performed on the first&#xD;
      visit to the laboratory lasting a minimum of 40-45 min. The screening will be carried out by&#xD;
      a qualified cardiac physiologist. A 5 minute resting, recovery and exercise 12 lead ECG will&#xD;
      be performed using the Mason- Likar set- up. The ECG will be recorded at a paper speed of 25&#xD;
      mm/s. The QT interval will be determined as the interval between the beginning of the Q or R&#xD;
      wave to the peak of the T wave, and the point where a tangent drawn along the maximum slope&#xD;
      of the descending limb of the T wave crosses the isoelectric TP baseline. The corrected QT&#xD;
      interval (QTc) will be calculated using an automated algorithm averaging across 3 beats for&#xD;
      each three minute stage, and 60 second recovery phases. We will use a number of different&#xD;
      formulas to assess the corrected QT (QTc);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bazett's (QTc =QT/!RR), Fridericia (QTc=QT/[RR/1000]1/3), Framingham (QTc=QT+[0.154 *&#xD;
      {1000-RR}]) Hodges (QTc=QT+1.75 * [{60 000/RR}260])&#xD;
