      This trial studies the impact of early mobility tracked with a 3-dimensional (3D) motion&#xD;
      tracking technology (XSENS) on post-surgery recovery in patients undergoing oncologic&#xD;
      surgeries. Xsens uses wireless measurements which could be used in clinical settings to&#xD;
      objectively measure movement patterns (the joint range of movement and the distance of&#xD;
      movement) during functional activities. Post-surgery mobility tracking may help doctors to&#xD;
      identify the minimum required level of mobility after inpatient oncologic surgeries to&#xD;
      enhance early post-surgery recovery and decrease early post-surgery complications.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate objectively using evidence based randomized controlled trial the impact of&#xD;
      early mobility (first day after the surgery) after any inpatient oncologic procedures on&#xD;
      early recovery of postoperative course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Try to find out the minimum level of postoperative mobility that needed for early&#xD;
      postoperative course recovery by objective assessment of range of movement for each&#xD;
      participant using 3D motion tracking system (Xsens).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients walk one to two laps around the ward twice per day, and have mobility tracked&#xD;
      with Xsens over 5-10 minutes, until discharge from hospital. Patients also mobilize (walk out&#xD;
      of the bed) on first day post-surgery under supervision and assistant of attending nurse in&#xD;
      the floor if the clinical situation allows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients walk for minimum 30 minutes per day and mobility is tracked with Xsens over&#xD;
      5-10 minutes up to discharge from hospital. Patients also mobilize (walk out of the bed) on&#xD;
      first day post-surgery under supervision and assistant of attending nurse in the floor if the&#xD;
      clinical situation allows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 30 days post discharge.&#xD;

Designed to measure the level of sedentary behavior for an individual&#xD;
The minimum score is 0 and the theoretical upper limit is 6,048&#xD;
Higher values indicate more activity, while lower scores indicate sedentary activity. In general:&#xD;
&lt;14 points = sedentary&#xD;
14 - 23 points = moderately active&#xD;
24 points or more = active</description>
