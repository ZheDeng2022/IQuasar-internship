  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraines are very common and affect over 35 million Americans a year. Migraines can be&#xD;
      painful and affect daily life. The cause of migraine is multifactorial and not completely&#xD;
      understood. Treatment usually includes different classes of medications, life style changes,&#xD;
      physical therapy, acupuncture, nerve stimulators and avoiding common triggers (like bright&#xD;
      lights, certain foods, or loud sounds).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some patients, Botox injected into the muscles of the forehead and neck can significantly&#xD;
      reduce pain. Unfortunately, this does not provide long-term relief as the effect of Botox&#xD;
      lasts for 3 months. Since year 2000 surgery to treat a selected population of migraine&#xD;
      patients has been gaining popularity and showing promising results. The surgery reduces the&#xD;
      pressure on the peripheral nerves that are believed to cause migraine headaches by resecting&#xD;
      the surrounding tissue (bone, fascia, muscle, and arteries). This surgery provides a more&#xD;
      long-term and permanent relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to follow the effectiveness and outcomes of migraine surgery.&#xD;
