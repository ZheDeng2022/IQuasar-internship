  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      COBRAH is a randomized double-blind 2-steps controlled superiority trial, with 2 parallel&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive Cobimetinib orally or placebo&#xD;
      during the first 12-weeks step, allowing the determination of the primary criteria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Histiocytoses are rare multisystemic disorders characterized by accumulation of histiocytes&#xD;
      in various organs. Virtually all the patients have a somatic mutation in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK&#xD;
      pathway. BRAF inhibitors are efficacious to treat BRAF-mutated patients but one third of the&#xD;
      patients are BRAF-wild type. For these patients, preliminary data have shown an efficacy of&#xD;
      the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. This trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of cobimetinib for&#xD;
      treating BRAF-wild type or mutated patients with L or R group histiocytoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the COBRAH trial is to demonstrate that the rate of objective&#xD;
      metabolic response (complete or partial) according to PERCIST criteria is higher under&#xD;
      Cobimetinib versus placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective metabolic response according to PERCIST criteria (Haroche, et al. 2015) is&#xD;
      defined by the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) response and will be used to evaluate the&#xD;
      overall therapeutic response at month 3 (Week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PERCIST criteria, a quantitative analysis of uptake will be performed using the standard&#xD;
      uptake value (SUV). Fitting regions of interest covering pathologic uptake will be used to&#xD;
      define target lesions. PERCIST will be used to classify the patients as complete metabolic&#xD;
      response, partial metabolic response (reduction of a minimum of 30% in target lesions),&#xD;
      stable metabolic disease or progressive metabolic disease.&#xD;

    <description>The objective metabolic responses is the percentage of patients with a complete metabolic response, partial metabolic response (reduction of a minimum of 30% in target lesions), stable metabolic disease or progressive metabolic disease according to PERCIST criteria (Haroche, et al. 2015) at Month 3. PERCIST criteria is defined by the PET response and will be used to evaluate the overall therapeutic response at month 3.&#xD;
For PERCIST criteria, a quantitative analysis of uptake will be performed using the standard uptake value (SUV). Fitting regions of interest covering pathologic uptake will be used to define target lesions. PERCIST will be used to classify patients metabolic response.</description>
