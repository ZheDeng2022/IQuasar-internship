  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of a bilberry derived anthocyanin-rich extract&#xD;
      in patients with ulcerative colitis. Two thirds of participants will receive the&#xD;
      anthocyanin-rich extract, while one third will receive placebo, for 8 weeks of treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For anthocyanins (ACs), a wide range of protective biological effects have been described,&#xD;
      such as anti-oxidative, anti-carcinogenic, anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory activities.&#xD;
      Various research groups could identify a beneficial effect of ACs in IBD and intestinal&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 112 subjects will be randomized. Subjects will be screened for eligibility between&#xD;
      0 and 28 days prior to baseline visit. At the baseline visit, subjects with moderate to&#xD;
      severe ulcerative colitis (Mayo score ≥6) and fulfilling all inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be randomized into two treatment arms (ACRE or placebo). Total duration of drug product&#xD;
      administration will be 8 weeks (56 days) followed by a follow-up phase of 30 days.&#xD;
