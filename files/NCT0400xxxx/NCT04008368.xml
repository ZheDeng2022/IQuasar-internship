      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle cell disease can often be treated with blood stem cell transplants. But for some&#xD;
      people the disease returns. This study will give a second transplant to people whose disease&#xD;
      has returned but still have some donor cells in their body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To cure people s sickle cell disease by giving a second treatment that makes more room in&#xD;
      their bone marrow for donor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 4 and older with sickle cell disease who had a transplant but the disease&#xD;
      returned, and their donor relatives. Donors can be 2 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will also be screened with heart and breathing tests, x-rays, a bone marrow&#xD;
      sample, and teeth and eye exams. They must have a caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will have 7-8 visits. They will take a drug for 5-6 days to prepare them for the&#xD;
      donation. For the donation, blood is taken from a vein in the arm or groin. The stem cells&#xD;
      are collected. The rest of the blood is returned. This may be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recipients will get a long IV line in their arm or chest for about 1-2 months. They will take&#xD;
      drugs to help their body accept the donor cells. They will get the donor cells and red blood&#xD;
      cell transfusions through the line. They will stay in the hospital about 30 days after the&#xD;
      transfusion of donor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In first 3 months after the infusion, recipients will have many visits. Then they will have&#xD;
      visits every 6 months to 1 year for 5 years. During those visits they will repeat some of the&#xD;
      screening tests....&#xD;

      Nonmyeloablative allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplants are currently being&#xD;
      investigated in phase I/II trials assessing engraftment, efficacy, and toxicity at a number&#xD;
      of transplant centers. Our ongoing protocol for patients with severe congenital anemias,&#xD;
      particularly sickle cell disease (SCD), and an HLA-matched sibling donor has had excellent&#xD;
      preliminary results. None of the patients who engrafted had sickle-related events or any&#xD;
      evidence of graft versus host disease (GVHD). There was no significant toxicity associated&#xD;
      with the conditioning regimen. An additional protocol is ongoing for patients with high risk&#xD;
      of graft rejection which employs pentostatin and oral cyclophosphamide (PC) pre-transplant to&#xD;
      further deplete recipient lymphocytes in an attempt to decrease the rate of graft rejection,&#xD;
      and to date the engraftment rate has substantially improved. Our first haploidentical&#xD;
      transplant protocol showed improving engraftment and success rates with the addition of&#xD;
      post-transplant cyclophosphamide, but with a median follow-up of 5 years, the disease-free&#xD;
      survival was at best 50%. Our new haploidentical transplant protocol has had some encouraging&#xD;
      early results in the first 5 patients transplanted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on 67 patients undergoing HLA-matched sibling or haploidentical PBSC transplants at the&#xD;
      NIH, we sought to determine what donor chimerism level is necessary to reverse SCD. Three of&#xD;
      the patients had falling donor myeloid chimerism (DMC) levels, and when the DMC level fell&#xD;
      below 20%, all 3 patients had return of their SCD. Our mathematical model showed that only&#xD;
      20% DMC (which tracks with donor erythroid chimerism) is necessary due to vast differences in&#xD;
      donor and recipient red blood cell (RBC) survival. As all 3 patients had persistent but&#xD;
      insufficient donor chimerism levels, we performed a PBSC boost using the same donor and&#xD;
      busulfan/alemtuzumab conditioning. Haploidentical patients received CD34-selected PBSCs and&#xD;
      HLA-matched sibling patients received unmanipulated PBSCs. All 3 patients now remain free of&#xD;
      SCD with DMC levels of 100% at 1, 2.5, and 3.5 years post-transplant. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      protocol, we propose repeat PBSC transplants using CD34-selected PBSCs in patients with a&#xD;
      haploidentical donor and unmanipulated PBSCs in patients with an HLA-matched sibling donor&#xD;
      from the same donor in a population of patients who have falling DMC and return of SCD.&#xD;
