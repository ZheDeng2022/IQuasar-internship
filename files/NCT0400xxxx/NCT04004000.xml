    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is a study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and changes in biomarker&#xD;
      and clinical outcome assessments of Losmapimod for patients with Facioscapulohumeral Muscular&#xD;
      Dystrophy 1 (FSHD1) with an open-label extension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-centre, open-label pilot study that will investigate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and target engagement during long-term dosing with&#xD;
      losmapimod tablets in adult subjects with FSHD1. Subjects will be evaluated during an 8- week&#xD;
      pre-treatment period (Visits 1 through 3) to establish pre-treatment baseline assessments.&#xD;
      Subjects will then be treated with losmapimod for approximately 1 year (Visits 4 through 9)&#xD;
      and assessed at relatively regular intervals for change from pre-treatment assessments. All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo two muscle biopsies; one at baseline, pre-treatment (Visit 4, Week 8 ±&#xD;
      1 week) and the second on-treatment muscle biopsy approximately 4 or 8 weeks later (Visit 5,&#xD;
      Week 14 ± 2 weeks). Up to 8 subjects will have an on-treatment biopsy at 4 weeks and up to 8&#xD;
      subjects will have the on-treatment biopsy at 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only subjects who participated in and competed all study procedures in the OLS Study&#xD;
      treatment period (Week 60) will be eligible to participate in the open-label extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extension of this study will enable continued investigation of the efficacy of long-term&#xD;
      dosing with losmapimod tablets in adult subjects with FSHD1. During the extension study,&#xD;
      subjects will receive 15 mg of losmapimod by mouth twice daily for a total of 30 mg by mouth&#xD;
      daily. All subjects will attend clinic visits approximately every 12 weeks and 7 days after&#xD;
      the last dose of study drug for safety follow-up assessment. Participation in the open-label&#xD;
      extension study will continue until losmapimod is approved, the patient withdraws from the&#xD;
      study, or the Sponsor terminates the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the main study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      long-term dosing of losmapimod tablets in subjects with FSHD1. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      assessment of target engagement of losmapimod in blood and skeletal muscle and repeated dose&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics in subjects with FSHD1 over long-term dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extension will continue investigation of efficacy with assessment of skeletal muscle by&#xD;
      ultrasound as well as the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and exploration of&#xD;
      efficacy measures including whole body skeletal muscle MRI and selected clinical outcome&#xD;
      assessments during long- term dosing with losmapimod tablets in adult subjects with FSHD1.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include assessment of efficacy as evaluated by whole body skeletal muscle&#xD;
      MRI parameters, safety and tolerability of long-term dosing, target engagement of losmapimod&#xD;
      in blood and skeletal muscle and repeated dose pharmacokinetics in subjects with FSHD1 over&#xD;
      long-term dosing.&#xD;
