    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and how well IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells work when&#xD;
      given alone or together with nivolumab and ipilimumab in treating patients with glioblastoma&#xD;
      that has come back (recurrent) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Biological&#xD;
      therapies, such as IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells, use substances made from living organisms that&#xD;
      may attack specific glioma cells and stop them from growing or kill them. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system&#xD;
      attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether giving IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cells and nivolumab together may work&#xD;
      better in treating patients with glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine and describe the safety and feasibility of nivolumab plus ipilimumab as&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy. (Arm 1) II. To examine and describe the safety and feasibility of&#xD;
      IL13Ralpha2-CAR T cell plus nivolumab as adjuvant therapy. (Arms 1 and 2) III. To provide&#xD;
      IL13Rα2-CAR T cell therapy for subjects who are unable to wait for randomization into Arms 1&#xD;
      and 2. This arm will provide additional safety data provided in COH IRB 13384 for the set&#xD;
      dose schedule. (Arm 3) III. In arms determined to be safe and feasible, a selection design&#xD;
      based on two Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) two stage designs will be used to assess which&#xD;
      arm(s) goes on for further study based on survival rate at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe persistence, expansion and phenotype of endogenous and IL13Ralpha2-CAR CAR T&#xD;
      cells in tumor cyst fluid (TCF), peripheral blood (PB), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe cytokine levels (PB, TCF, CSF) over the study period for each arm. (Arm 1 or Arm&#xD;
      2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate disease response rates. IV. Estimate time to progression. V. Estimate median&#xD;
      overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. In study participants who have completed the adjuvant dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)&#xD;
      period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIa. Estimate the mean change from baseline in quality of life using the European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core&#xD;
      (QLQ-C)30 and EORTC QLQ Brain Cancer Patients (BN-20) survey scale, domain and item scores&#xD;
      during and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIb. Assess if the area under the curve (AUC) for CD3 T cells, IFNgamma and IP-10 for the DLT&#xD;
      period is greater in one arm versus (vs.) the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. In study participants who undergo an additional biopsy/resection or autopsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIIa. Evaluate CAR T cell persistence in the tumor tissue and the location of the CAR T cells&#xD;
      with respect to the injection, and VIIb. Evaluate IL13Ralpha2 antigen and PD-L1 levels on&#xD;
      tumor tissue pre and post CAR T cell therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Use biomathematical modeling of tumor growth to evaluate benefit of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and ipilimumab IV over&#xD;
      90 minutes on day -14. Patients then receive IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells infusion over 5 minutes&#xD;
      via Rickham catheter (intracranial intraventricular [ICV]/intracranial intratumoral [ICT])&#xD;
      every week and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every other week. Treatment repeats weekly for up&#xD;
      to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After cycle 4,&#xD;
      patients may receive additional CAR T cells weekly and nivolumab IV every other week or&#xD;
      monthly at the discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells infusion over 5 minutes via Rickham catheter&#xD;
      (ICV/ICT) every week and nivolumab IV over 30 minutes every other week. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      weekly for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      After cycle 4, patients may receive additional CAR T cells weekly and nivolumab IV every&#xD;
      other week or monthly at the discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III: Patients receive IL13Ralpha2 CAR T cells infusion over 5 minutes via Rickham&#xD;
      catheter (intracranial intraventricular [ICV]/intracranial intratumoral [ICT]) every week.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats weekly for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After cycle 4, patients may receive additional CAR T cells weekly at&#xD;
      the discretion of the principal investigator and oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 3, 6, and 12&#xD;
      months, and then annually for 15 years.&#xD;
