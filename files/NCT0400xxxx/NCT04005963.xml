      With the aging of the population and the acceleration of urbanization process, the number of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases in China continues to increase, with one in five adults suffering&#xD;
      from cardiovascular disease. The mortality rate of cardiovascular disease in China is also on&#xD;
      the rise, and cardiovascular disease deaths are now the leading cause of death among urban&#xD;
      and rural residents, mainly due to ischemic heart disease (IHD). Ischemic heart disease is&#xD;
      the damage to the heart muscle caused by changes in the coronary cycle that cause an&#xD;
      imbalance between coronary blood flow and the needs of the heart muscle.This project obtains&#xD;
      MBF and CFR through 13N-NH3PET cardiac blood flow perfusion rest and load imaging, and&#xD;
      explores the diagnostic value of PET imaging to CMVD. In summary, this project will obtain&#xD;
      myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial blood flow reserve (CFR) through 13N-NH3 PET&#xD;
      cardiac blood flow perfusion rest and load imaging, explore the diagnostic value of PET&#xD;
      imaging for CMVD, and promote the widespread application of absolute quantification of&#xD;
      myocardial blood flow in China.&#xD;

      With the aging of the population and the acceleration of urbanization process, the number of&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases in China continues to increase, with one in five adults suffering&#xD;
      from cardiovascular disease. The mortality rate of cardiovascular disease in China is also on&#xD;
      the rise, and cardiovascular disease deaths are now the leading cause of death among urban&#xD;
      and rural residents, mainly due to ischemic heart disease (IHD). Ischemic heart disease is&#xD;
      the damage to the heart muscle caused by changes in the coronary cycle that cause an&#xD;
      imbalance between coronary blood flow and the needs of the heart muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common cause of which is coronary arterial stenosis and blocking caused by coronary&#xD;
      atherosclerosis, accounting for about 90% of ischemic heart disease, referred to as coronary&#xD;
      heart disease. Coronary artery microvascular lesions .coronary microvascular disease. CMVD)&#xD;
      is a type of coronary atherosclerosis heart disease (coronary heart disease) that refers to&#xD;
      the clinical syndrome of labor-induced angina or myocardial ischemia caused by abnormal&#xD;
      structure and/or dysfunction of the small and small arteries before the coronary disease&#xD;
      under the influence of a variety of pathogenic factors. The mechanisms of myocardial ischemia&#xD;
      include coronary atherosclerosis disease, vascular spasm disease and coronary artery&#xD;
      microvascular dysfunction, which may overlap between three causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Future breakthroughs in the treatment of coronary heart disease depend on the understanding&#xD;
      and intervention of CMVD. The incidence of CMVD is high, and studies show that more than 60%&#xD;
      of patients with obstructive coronary heart disease co-exist CMVD coexist with CMVD, up to&#xD;
      67. 4% of non-obstructive coronary patients have CMVD, and the proportion of non-obstructive&#xD;
      coronary heart disease in stable angina patients increased year by year. Studies in 11,223&#xD;
      patients with stable angina showed that, like obstructive coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      non-obstructive coronary heart disease also increased the incidence of major cardiovascular&#xD;
      adverse events in male and female patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the early detection, clear diagnosis and timely treatment of CMVD is essential. At&#xD;
      present, there are limited methods for evaluating CMVD in clinical conventional applications,&#xD;
      including PET, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography, SPECT, CMR Traumatic techniques&#xD;
      include selective coronary artery imaging, coronary artery doppler blood flow conduction&#xD;
      technology, temperature dilution to measure coronary artery blood flow and CFR, microvascular&#xD;
      resistance index. PET's greatest advantage is that it can make a variety of precise physical&#xD;
      corrections and measure the absolute value of myocardial blood flow in rest and congestion,&#xD;
      completely evaluate the function of the whole heart and local heart muscle, and have a higher&#xD;
      spatial resolution than traditional SPECT; Cannot be measured repeatedly and has shortcomings&#xD;
      such as radiation. TTDE has the advantages of non-invasive, time-saving, bedside examination,&#xD;
      low cost and repeatable measurement, but it has high reliability only when evaluating the&#xD;
      microvascular function of the left front drop, and the ultrasound physician must have&#xD;
      operational experience. SPECT has high diagnostic sensitivity and negative predictive value,&#xD;
      but it is not possible to quantify CFR, and has low spatial resolution and radiation. CMR&#xD;
      space resolution is high, no radiation, no signal attenuation, can simultaneously detect&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy function, tissue morphology, cardiomyopathy, cardiomyocyte and fibrosis, has&#xD;
      gradually become a noninvasive evaluation of cardiomyopathy &quot;gold standard&quot;, but the contrast&#xD;
      agent in patients with renal insufficiency is prone to adverse reactions, and there are many&#xD;
      taboo evidence. Coronary artery angiography can only show blood vessels that account for 5%&#xD;
      of the entire coronary artery tree, with a diameter greater than l00 m, and 95% of the small&#xD;
      blood vessels that cannot be displayed. The Coronary artery doppler blood flow guide wire&#xD;
      measurement CFR is considered to be the &quot;gold standard&quot; for invasive examinations, the&#xD;
      disadvantage of being traumatic and having trouble with operation. The temperature dilution&#xD;
      method has a good correlation with the CFR measured by Doppler in the coronary arteries, but&#xD;
      its measurement value will be influenced by pressure, temperature, saline injection dose and&#xD;
      speed, salt water and blood mixing unevenly, and so on. Microvascular resistance index can&#xD;
      specifically evaluate the microvascular function at the far end of narrow lesions, but the&#xD;
      relationship between the measured value and cardiovascular events is not yet clear. Coronary&#xD;
      artery microvascular function is usually assessed by detecting coronary artery blood flow&#xD;
      reserve (coronary flow reserve, CFR) function. PET is considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for&#xD;
      noninvasive evaluation of CFR and provides absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow&#xD;
      (MBF) and CFR. Studies have shown that CFR 2 is an independent predictor of adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events, and microvascular lesions increase the risk of cardiovascular adverse&#xD;
      events in patients after myocardial infarction. There is currently a lack of prospective&#xD;
      clinical studies to diagnose CMVD by using PET to evaluate CFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project obtains MBF and CFR through 13N-NH3PET cardiac blood flow perfusion rest and&#xD;
      load imaging, and explores the diagnostic value of PET imaging to CMVD. In summary, this&#xD;
      project will obtain myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial blood flow reserve (CFR)&#xD;
      through 13N-NH3 PET cardiac blood flow perfusion rest and load imaging, explore the&#xD;
      diagnostic value of PET imaging for CMVD, and promote the widespread application of absolute&#xD;
      quantification of myocardial blood flow in China.&#xD;
