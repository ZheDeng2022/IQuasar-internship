  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for women in menopause with moderate to severe hot flashes. Menopause, a normal&#xD;
      part of aging, is the time of a woman's last period. Hot flashes can interrupt a woman's&#xD;
      daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatments are fezolinetant low dose (1 tablet of fezolinetant and 1 placebo&#xD;
      tablet) once a day, fezolinetant high dose (2 tablets of fezolinetant) once a day or placebo&#xD;
      (2 tablets) once a day. (Placebo is a dummy treatment that looks like medicine but does not&#xD;
      have any medicine in it.) The study will compare fezolinetant and placebo after 4 and 12&#xD;
      weeks of dosing. The study will see if fezolinetant reduces the number of hot flashes. And&#xD;
      the study will see if fezolinetant reduces the severity of the hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in the study will receive an electronic handheld device at the first study visit. (It&#xD;
      is similar to a smart phone.) Each day of the study, study participants will use this to&#xD;
      record their hot flashes. Their record for the 10 days before the start of study treatment&#xD;
      will be checked. They can remain in the study if their record shows 7 or 8 moderate to severe&#xD;
      hot flashes per day (50 or more per week). Next, they will be picked for 1 of the 2 study&#xD;
      treatments (fezolinetant or placebo) by chance alone. It is like flipping a coin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will take study treatment for 52 weeks. The first 12 weeks of study&#xD;
      treatment are &quot;double-blinded.&quot; That means that the study participants and the study doctors&#xD;
      do not know who takes which of the study treatments (fezolinetant low dose, fezolinetant high&#xD;
      dose or placebo) during that time. The last 40 weeks of study treatment are &quot;noncontrolled.&quot;&#xD;
      That means that each study participant and the study doctors know which study treatment that&#xD;
      study participant takes during that time. Women who take fezolinetant during the first 12&#xD;
      weeks will continue to take the same dose. Women who take placebo during the first 12 weeks&#xD;
      will start taking fezolinetant. Their dose will be either low dose or high dose fezolinetant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 14, 16 and then once a month, the study participants will go to the&#xD;
      hospital or clinic for a check-up. They will be asked about medications, side effects and how&#xD;
      they feel. Other checks will include physical exam and vital signs (heart rate, temperature&#xD;
      and blood pressure). Blood and urine will be collected for laboratory tests. Study&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires that are about how hot flashes affect their daily&#xD;
      life. Study participants who still have their uterus will have the following 2 tests done at&#xD;
      the first and last study visits. One of the 2 tests is endometrial biopsy. This test involves&#xD;
      removing a small amount of tissue from the inside lining of the uterus. The tissue is then&#xD;
      checked under a microscope. The other test is transvaginal ultrasound. This test uses sound&#xD;
      waves to create pictures of the organs in the pelvis. The sound waves are transmitted by a&#xD;
      probe (transducer), which is placed inside the vagina. Study participants may have a&#xD;
      screening mammogram done at the first and/or last study visit. A mammogram is an x-ray&#xD;
      picture of the breasts used to screen for breast cancer. Study participants who did not have&#xD;
      this test done in the last 12 months will have it done at the first study visit. They will&#xD;
      have it done at the last study visit if they are due for their screening mammogram and their&#xD;
      own doctor agrees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last check-up at the hospital or clinic will be 3 weeks after the last dose of study&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The PROMIS is a National Institutes of Health Roadmap initiative designed to improve PRO measures using state-of-the-science methods. The PROMIS SD SF 8b [PROMIS SD, 2015] assesses self-reported sleep disturbance over the past 7 days and includes perceptions of restless sleep; satisfaction with sleep; refreshing sleep; difficulties sleeping, getting to sleep or staying asleep; amount of sleep; and sleep quality. Responses to each of the 8 items range from 1 to 5, and the range of possible summed raw scores is 8 to 40. Higher scores on the PROMIS SD SF 8b indicate more of the concept measured (disturbed sleep).</description>
