  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sometimes when people wear braces, the combination of dental plaque and diets high in sugar&#xD;
      and acids can lead to white spots on the teeth surrounding the braces. These are commonly&#xD;
      found in people with braces depending on their diet and care of their teeth. The white spots&#xD;
      will still be present when the braces are removed. These white spots are the beginning signs&#xD;
      of cavities and show that mineral has been lost from the tooth. This study will be testing a&#xD;
      new varnish that is painted on the tooth around the braces to prevent these white spots from&#xD;
      forming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll patients who wear braces and have planned teeth extractions. A calcium&#xD;
      and fluoride releasing varnish will be painted on the teeth planned to be extracted. Braces&#xD;
      will then be placed on the teeth. In 3-6 weeks, the extraction will occur and the teeth will&#xD;
      be collected for analysis.&#xD;

      This is a randomized split mouth double blinded clinical trial. The CPP-ACP-NaF varnish is&#xD;
      commercially available and is used for the treatment of tooth hypersensitivity under FDA 510K&#xD;
      K102808. The placebo for this study is the same product without the CPP-ACP-NaF component.&#xD;
      Patients with planned orthodontic therapy that include tooth extractions will have&#xD;
      orthodontic brackets attached to the to-be-extracted teeth. Each patient will have the&#xD;
      CPP-ACP-NaF varnish and the varnish base (without CPP-ACP-NaF) applied to teeth immediately&#xD;
      after orthodontic brackets have been applied. The specific teeth (left or right) will be&#xD;
      randomly determined as to the application of the varnish or placebo. In this experimental&#xD;
      design each patient has CPP-ACP-NaF applied to one side and placebo applied to the other&#xD;
      side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the teeth are extracted they are transferred to the Carey Laboratory for in vitro&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
