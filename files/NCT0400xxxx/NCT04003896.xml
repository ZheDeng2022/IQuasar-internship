  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of patients with recurrent, late-stage inoperable, or progressed biliary tract&#xD;
      carcinoma (BTC) is generally poor. The goal of this clinical study is to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of abemaciclib in patients with late-stage or progressed BTC that&#xD;
      has failed one line of chemotherapy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Biliary Tract Carcinoma (BTC) is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality. The newly&#xD;
      developed small molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6), abemaciclib,&#xD;
      provides a new opportunity of treating patients with BTC. The goal of this clinical study is&#xD;
      to determine the efficacy and safety of abemaciclib in patients with advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      BTC that has progressed or intolerant following one line of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's objectives for this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the objective response rate (ORR)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the disease control rate (DCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the overall survival (OS) rate at 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine quality of life (QoL) using EORTC-QLQ-C30&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a Phase 2 open label study to determine the efficacy and safety/tolerability of abemaciclib in participants with locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic biliary tract cancer who have failed (tumor progression or patient intolerance) one or more lines of systemic therapy. A Simon's two-stage design will be used. If there are no responses in the first 13 patients with a determined outcome, the study will be stopped. Otherwise, 11 additional patients will be accrued for a total of 24. Abemaciclib will be given as a single oral agent Approximately up to 27 subjects may be enrolled to attain at least 24 evaluable participants. The starting dose will be 200 mg twice daily. Dosing will continue daily for 28 days, this being one cycle. There will be no protocol scheduled hiatus and daily dosing will be continuous unless there is unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, or death.</intervention_model_description>

Capsules or tablets can be taken orally with or without food. If the participant vomits or misses a dose of abemaciclib, the participant will be instructed to take the next dose at its scheduled time.&#xD;
