  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Montalcino Aortic Consortium (MAC) will provide the infrastructure to assemble large&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with Heritable Thoracic Aortic Disease (H-TAD) with and without mutations&#xD;
      in known H-TAD genes, define the phenotype associated with these genes, determine genetic and&#xD;
      environmental modifiers of H-TAD, as well as rapidly and efficiently identify novel genes.&#xD;

      The Montalcino Aortic Consortium (MAC) will provide the infrastructure to assemble large&#xD;
      cohorts of patients with H-TAD with and without mutations in known H-TAD genes, define the&#xD;
      phenotype associated with these genes, determine genetic and environmental modifiers and&#xD;
      other biomarkers of H-TAD, as well as rapidly and efficiently identify novel genes.&#xD;
      Recruitment of large numbers of patients world-wide will improve the precision of data used&#xD;
      to predict disease risks. Retrospective and prospective study designs will be used to fully&#xD;
      characterize the different stages of H-TAD (i.e. susceptibility, presymptomatic, and&#xD;
      symptomatic) and other complications associated with the H-TAD genes, and examine clinical&#xD;
      and environmental factors that define risk of aortic dissections. The data from MAC will&#xD;
      provide the critical clinical information for precise management of thoracic aortic disease&#xD;
      and other complications caused by mutations of these genes and improve the medical management&#xD;
      and outcome of patients with genetically triggered, lethal vascular diseases.&#xD;
