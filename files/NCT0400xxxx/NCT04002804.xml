  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale of the Study: Treatment for GBM currently consists of surgical resection of the&#xD;
      tumour mass followed by radio- and chemotherapy. Nonetheless overall prognosis still remains&#xD;
      bleak, recurrence is universal, and recurrent GBM patients clearly need innovative therapies.&#xD;
      Dendritic cells (DC) immunotherapy could represent a well-tolerated, long-term&#xD;
      tumour-specific treatment to kill all (residual) tumour cells which infiltrate in the&#xD;
      adjacent areas of the brain. Preclinical investigations for the development of therapeutic&#xD;
      vaccines against high grade gliomas, based on the use of DC loaded with a mixture of&#xD;
      glioma-derived tumor have been carried out in rat as well as in mouse models, showing the&#xD;
      capacity to generate a glioma-specific immune response. Mature DC loaded with autologous&#xD;
      tumor lysate have been used also for the treatment of patients with recurrent malignant brain&#xD;
      tumors; no major adverse events have been registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results about the use of immunotherapy for GBM patients are encouraging, but further studies&#xD;
      are necessary to find out the most effective and safe combination of immunotherapy with&#xD;
      radio- and chemotherapy after exeresis of the tumour mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study: Primary objective of the study is to evaluate treatment tolerability and to&#xD;
      get preliminary information about efficacy. Secondary objective is to evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      effect on the immune response. Additional objective is to identify a possible correlation&#xD;
      between methylation status of the MGMT promoter and tumor response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two-stage Simon design will be considered for the study. The primary objectives of the&#xD;
      study include the evaluation of a PFS6 rate in treated patients. Assuming as outcome measure&#xD;
      the percentage of PFS6 patients and of clinical interest an increase to 35% (P1) of the&#xD;
      historical control response rate of 20% (P0), the null hypothesis will be rejected (a=0.05,&#xD;
      b=0.2) at the end of the first stage if the response rate will be 5/22 treated patients&#xD;
      (Fisher's exact test). In the second stage patients will be enrolled up to 72 overall. The&#xD;
      study will be successful if at least 19 subjects out of 72 have PFS6 months after the&#xD;
      beginning of the treatment.&#xD;

      Study Design: Phase I, 2-stage Simon design (Simon et al., 1997), single-centre,&#xD;
      un-controlled, open label, non randomized study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The therapeutic program will include radical surgical resection of the tumor, followed by&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Immunotherapy will comprise 4 biweekly vaccinations first (injections I, II,&#xD;
      III, IV), 2 further monthly vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination&#xD;
      (injection VII) 2 months after the sixth one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while the others&#xD;
      will be of 5 million cells only. In correspondence to the third vaccine injection (week 7), 6&#xD;
      cycles of maintenance TMZ (mTMZ) will start. On the basis of the patient clinical status,&#xD;
      further vaccine boosts will be considered as appropriate addition at the standard vaccination&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: The first stage of the study will include 22 patients with recurrent GBM.&#xD;
      The overall population at the end of the study will consist of 72 patients.&#xD;

    <description>PFS-6 is defined as the percentage of participants with PFS at 6 months from the date of surgery for tumor recurrence to the first date of objectively determined progressive disease based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria (Wen et al JCO 2010) or death from any cause. It is assumed that PFS follows an exponential distribution. Estimation using Kaplan-Meier analysis.</description>

    <description>Right after the surgical resection of the recurrent tumor, leukapheresis will be performed.&#xD;
At least 5x109 PBMC must be collected by leukapheresis, so as to make the whole immunotherapy schedule workable.&#xD;
Starting at week 3, immunotherapy will include 4 bi-weeekly vaccinations first (injections I, II, III, IV), two further monthly vaccinations (injections V, VI) and a final vaccination (injection VII) two months after the sixth one. Injections I, V, VI and VII will contain 10 million tumor lysate-loaded DC, while the others will be of 5 million cells only.&#xD;
Vaccine doses will be injected in the forearm of the patient.</description>
