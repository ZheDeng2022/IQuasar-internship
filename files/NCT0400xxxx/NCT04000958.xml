  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine whether the optimized inhalation therapy based on peak&#xD;
      inspiratory flow rates (PIFR) measured against the simulated resistance can reduce the rate&#xD;
      of treatment failure in patients recovering from acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Errors in inhaler use and quality of life are also to be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will recruit 460 patients with AECOPD whose exacerbated symptoms are relieved by&#xD;
      5-7 days of standard therapy. The participants are divided into PIFR group and control group&#xD;
      in a 1:1 ratio according to a random number table method. All the patients will be given&#xD;
      inhaled corticosteroid（ICS）/long-acting β agonist（LABA） (budesonide/ formoterolSymbicort&#xD;
      turbuhaler® 160/4.5 μg bid or Beclometasone/ Formoterol Foster® pressure metered dose&#xD;
      inhaler(pMDI) 100/6 μg 2 puff bid). For symptomatic patients before acute exacerbation,&#xD;
      Spiriva handihaler® 18μg qd or Spiriva respimat® 2.5μg qd will be prescribed in combination&#xD;
      with ICS/LABA. For PIFR group, PIFR is measured by InCheck DIAL(Clement Clarke International&#xD;
      Ltd, Harlow, UK and Alliance Tech Medical). If PIFR is less than 60L/min , the patient will&#xD;
      be given pMDI with spacer. If PIFR value is over 60 L/min, the patient will be given dry&#xD;
      powder inhaler(DPI).). The control group will be given DPI or pMDI with spacer according to&#xD;
      the judgment of a respiratory physician. Both groups will be taught to use the device after&#xD;
      the prescription, and then be reminded to use medication via a WeChat public account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of the study is the 30-day treatment failure including AECOPD recurrence&#xD;
      resulting in an emergency visit, admission, or need for intensified medication). The&#xD;
      secondary endpoints of the study are the error rate of inhalation device use, satisfaction&#xD;
      with inhalation devices, symptoms and quality of life, 30-day mortality, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary diseases(COPD)-related treatment costs and PIFR.&#xD;

    <description>Peak inspiratory flow rates(PIFR) will be measured using the InCheck DIAL(Clement Clarke International Ltd, Harlow, UK and Alliance Tech Medical). The InCheck DIAL is accurate to +/- 10% or 10 L/min, whichever is greater, and can measure flows in the range of 15 to 120 L/min. Dry powder inhaler(DPI) is to be prescribed if PIFRr is over 60L/min, otherwise pressure metered dose inhaler(pMDI) with spacer is given. All the patients will be given inhaled corticosteroid（ICS）/long-acting β agonist（LABA）. For symptomatic patients, long-acting anticholinergic agents(LAMA) will also be used.</description>
