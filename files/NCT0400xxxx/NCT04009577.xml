    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the proportion of adult [greater than or&#xD;
      equal to (&gt;=) 18 years] participants with insomnia disorder taking zolpidem tartrate&#xD;
      immediate release (ZOL-IR) or zolpidem tartrate extended release (ZOL-ER), intermittently or&#xD;
      frequently, who transition to lemborexant 5 milligram (mg) (LEM5) or 10 mg (LEM10) after 2&#xD;
      weeks of receiving LEM.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Overall Participants Who Transitioned to LEM at the End of the Titration Period of Core Study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Transition to LEM was defined as participant who remained on LEM at the end of the 2-week titration period and either 1) entered the extension phase, or 2) chooses to not enter the extension phase for reasons not related to LEM (including, but not limited to, time commitment related to the study, study-related travel expenses or preference to continue insomnia management with another health care provider).</description>

    <description>Transition to LEM was defined as participant who remained on LEM at the end of the 2-week titration period and either 1) entered the extension phase, or 2) chooses to not enter the extension phase for reasons not related to LEM (including, but not limited to, time commitment related to the study, study-related travel expenses or preference to continue insomnia management with another health care provider).</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome measure was planned for Cohort 1A, 1B and 2A. As there was no dose increase happened in Cohort 2B, this Outcome Measure is not applicable for Cohort 2B.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Positive Medication Effect Rating on Each Patient Global Impression of Insomnia (PGI-I) Item at the End of the 2-Week Titration Period of Core Study by Cohort and Overall Using End of the Titration Period Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 2 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PGI-I was a self-report assessment of participant perception of the effects of a medication on their sleep. The PGI-I had 3 items related to study medication effects (a) helped/worsened sleep, (b) decreased/increased time to fall asleep, (c) increased/decreased total sleep time, and 1 item related to perceived appropriateness of study medication strength. The first 3 items were answered on a 3-point scale (1=positive medication effect, 2=neutral medication effect, 3=negative medication effect) and the last item on a different 3 point scale (medication: 1=too strong, 2=just right, 3=too weak), only 'positive medication effects' and 'just right' are reported here.</description>

             Screening Period&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. A prolonged difference between QTc corrected by Fridericia's formulas (QTcF) interval&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Evidence of clinically significant disease (eg, cardiac, respiratory,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, and renal disease) that in the opinion of the investigator(s) could&#xD;
             affect the participant's safety or interfere with the study assessments. Participants&#xD;
             for whom a sedating drug would be contraindicated for safety reasons because of the&#xD;
             participant's occupation or activities are also excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Hypersensitivity to LEM or any of the excipients&#xD;
&#xD;

             study&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Planned surgery that requires general, spinal, or epidural anesthesia that would take&#xD;
             place during the study. Planned surgery, which requires only local anesthesia and&#xD;
             which can be undertaken as a day case without inpatient stay postoperatively, need not&#xD;
             result in exclusion if in the opinion of the investigator this operation does not&#xD;
             interfere with the study procedures and patient safety&#xD;
&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Participants took part in the study at 17 investigative sites in the United States from 15 July 2019 to 26 June 2020. This study included 2 parts: Core study (Pretreatment phase and Treatment Phase) and Extension Phase.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 99 participants were screened, of which 46 were screen failures and 53 participants were enrolled and randomized into the Core study. Out of 53 randomized and treated participants in the Core Study, 43 participants entered Extension Phase and 41 participants received study drug.</pre_assignment_details>
