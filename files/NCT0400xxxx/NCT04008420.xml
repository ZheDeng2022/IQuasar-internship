  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has proposed the use of 80% high-dose inhalation oxygen&#xD;
      (FiO2) during surgery to reduce postoperative infection in adult patients undergoing general&#xD;
      anesthesia. However, high-dose inhaled oxygen increases the risk of oxygen toxicity by&#xD;
      increasing reactive oxygen species, and according to a recent research, hyperoxia in the ICU&#xD;
      is one of the causes of mortality. In patients with general anesthesia requiring intubation,&#xD;
      high-dose inhaled oxygen was associated with postoperative pulmonary complications in a&#xD;
      dose-proportional manner and was significantly associated with mortality within 30 days after&#xD;
      surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to study the optimum oxygen concentration during surgery&#xD;
      to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in general anesthesia patients who require&#xD;
      intubation. Esophagectomy for esophageal cancer still has higher morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      rates than other common procedures. There are several factors such as aneurysmal leakage,&#xD;
      esophageal substitute necrosis, cardiac complications, and pulmonary complications. Pulmonary&#xD;
      complications have been reported to be a very important factor. Therefore, various methods&#xD;
      have been proposed to reduce pulmonary complications after esophageal cancer surgery. One of&#xD;
      them is minimally invasive surgery. However, even in the case of a thoracoscopic operation&#xD;
      using a robot, one lung ventilation is inevitable for securing the visual field during&#xD;
      surgery, and hypoxia and hyperoxia are known to be associated with postoperative acute lung&#xD;
      injury. Therefore, in order to reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in the&#xD;
      esophagectomy using robots, it is necessary to study the optimum oxygen concentration during&#xD;
      surgery. The recently developed oxygen reserve index (ORI) uses a non-invasive sensor&#xD;
      attached to the finger, similar to pulse oximetry, to detect persistent hyperoxia of more&#xD;
      than 100 mmHg and less than 200 mmHg. Therefore, if the oxygen reserve index is used for&#xD;
      robotic esophagectomy, which requires one lung ventilation, the degree of oxygenation of the&#xD;
      patient can be monitored continuously and accurately. The authors will measure the oxygen&#xD;
      reserve index in robotic esophagectomy, and analyze the correlation between oxygen reserve&#xD;
      index and postoperative pulmonary complications. Furthermore, the cut-off value of the oxygen&#xD;
      reserve index, which can reduce pulmonary complications, will be calculated.&#xD;
