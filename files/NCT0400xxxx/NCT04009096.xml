  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase IIa, controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study aimed to&#xD;
      assess whether the new vivax malaria vaccines ChAd63 PvDBP and MVA PvDBP can protect against&#xD;
      malaria infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive one or two doses of ChAd63 PvDBP followed by one dose of MVA&#xD;
      PvDBP 8 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 4 weeks after the second vacccination, the volunteers will be challenged&#xD;
      (deliberately infected) with malaria by intravenous injection blood-stage&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Volunteers will be recruited and vaccinated at the CCVTM, Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two groups vaccinated in the trial, with an optional third group included if&#xD;
      fewer than 6 volunteers complete group 2. Up to 19 volunteers will be included in total.&#xD;
      These will be compared to a matched number of infectivity controls, receiving no vaccination,&#xD;
      who will be recruited as part of a separate study (VAC069 - NCT03797989).&#xD;
