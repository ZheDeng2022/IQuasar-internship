    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess irritant or allergic response of 3 developmental cosmetic&#xD;
      facial products following a conventional human repeated insult patch test methodology for 6&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

      A randomized, single blind (evaluator), single-center, Human Repeat Insult Patch Test (HRIPT)&#xD;
      study in healthy adult participants aged 18 to 65 years to evaluate the cutaneous irritation&#xD;
      and contact sensitization potential of 3 cosmetic facial skincare products. The participants&#xD;
      will undergo repeated cutaneous application of semi-occlusive patch of 3 cosmetic facial&#xD;
      skincare products and a reference product as a negative control (saline solution). HRIPT is a&#xD;
      long standing, standard method to determine whether exposure to a topical product will elicit&#xD;
      a cutaneous (dermal) irritant or allergic response (sensitization) under exaggerated&#xD;
      (occluded) conditions. Screening of the participants will be performed at Visit 1 (i.e. from&#xD;
      Day 0 to Day 14). The study will progress in 3-phases: Induction phase, Rest Phase and&#xD;
      Challenge Phase. The Induction phase will continue for 3 consecutive weeks (Visit 2 to Visit&#xD;
      10); at visit 2, the area for patch application will be designated between the scapula and&#xD;
      waistline, away from the spinal mid-line. A controlled amount (0.02 milliliters per&#xD;
      centimeters square [mL/cm^2]) of each study product will be randomly assigned within the&#xD;
      patch system of each participant into the appropriate separate cell (3 cells for each of the&#xD;
      test products and 1 cell for the saline solution). Each patch will remain in place for 48 (±&#xD;
      4) hours on weekdays and 72 (± 4) hours on weekend. Induction phase will be followed by&#xD;
      2-week (Visit 11) Rest phase; where there will be no product or patch applications. Rest&#xD;
      phase is further followed by Challenge phase at week 6 (Visit 12 to Visit 15) in which a&#xD;
      naïve area of the skin will be selected and a new patch with each of the cells filled with&#xD;
      study products will be applied. After 48 (±4) hours of patch application, participants will&#xD;
      return to the site, the patch will be removed, and subsequent test-site evaluations will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

    <description>Human repeated insult patch test (HRIPT) reactions as per (ICDRG) were scored by trained blind evualuator on the scale of '- to +++', where '-':negative reaction,'?+':doubtful reaction; faint erythema only,'+': weak (non-vesicular) positive reaction;erythema, infiltration and possibly papules,'++': strong (vesicular) positive reaction; erythema, infiltration, papules and vesicles,'+++': extreme positive reaction; bullous reaction, intense erythema and infiltration, coalescing vesicles. Score '-' indicated no adverse reaction, whereas, '+++' indicated very strong adverse reaction. Any positive reaction (a score of '+' or greater) was considered as potential sensitization based upon dermatologist discretion. The assessment of positive reactions was determined by the blinded dermatologist and reported as Yes/ No/ Unable to determine. Percentage of participants with potential sensitization (count of &quot;Yes&quot;/ total reactions) were reported in form of numbers in this outcome measure.</description>

          <description>Fitzpatrick scale was used to classify participant's skin type by their response to sun exposure and confirm that participants were free of any pre-existing dermatological pathology.This scale emphasizes on potentials for irritation, burns and hyperpigmentation, indicators for future product choices. Scoring was done on scale I to VI, where I-always burns easily;never tans,II-always burns easily;tans minimally,III-burns moderately;tans gradually,IV-burns minimally, always tans well, V-rarely burns, tans profusely and VI-never burns. Higher score represents better results.</description>

        <description>Human repeated insult patch test (HRIPT) reactions as per (ICDRG) were scored by trained blind evualuator on the scale of '- to +++', where '-':negative reaction,'?+':doubtful reaction; faint erythema only,'+': weak (non-vesicular) positive reaction;erythema, infiltration and possibly papules,'++': strong (vesicular) positive reaction; erythema, infiltration, papules and vesicles,'+++': extreme positive reaction; bullous reaction, intense erythema and infiltration, coalescing vesicles. Score '-' indicated no adverse reaction, whereas, '+++' indicated very strong adverse reaction. Any positive reaction (a score of '+' or greater) was considered as potential sensitization based upon dermatologist discretion. The assessment of positive reactions was determined by the blinded dermatologist and reported as Yes/ No/ Unable to determine.

          <title>Percentage of Participants With a Positive Reaction Score (Score of '+' or Greater) as Assessed by a Trained Evaluator</title>
          <description>HRIPT reactions as per ICDRG were scored by trained blind evaluator on the scale of '- to +++', where '-':negative reaction,'?+':doubtful reaction; faint erythema only,'+': weak (non-vesicular) positive reaction;erythema, infiltration and possibly papules,'++': strong (vesicular) positive reaction; erythema, infiltration, papules and vesicles,'+++': extreme positive reaction; bullous reaction, intense erythema and infiltration, coalescing vesicles. Score '-' indicated no adverse reaction, whereas, '+++' indicated very strong adverse reaction. Any positive reaction (a score of '+' or greater) was considered as potential sensitization based upon dermatologist discretion. The assessment was determined by the blinded dermatologist and reported as a score of '+' or greater. Percentage of participants with any positive reaction (a score of '+' or greater) will be reported in numbers in this outcome measure.</description>
