  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The WHO (World Health Organisation) estimated the prevalence of diabetes to be 422 million&#xD;
      people in 2014, compared to 108 million in 1980. This has led to an increasing number of&#xD;
      diabetic patients referred to nephrologists for diagnostic purposes. Diabetic nephropathy is&#xD;
      the most common renal disease in this population and is usually a presumptive diagnosis based&#xD;
      on clinical and biological features although microscopic examination of a renal sample&#xD;
      acquired through renal biopsy is the only way to be certain of this diagnosis. However,&#xD;
      kidney biopsy is an invasive procedure carrying a low but incontestable risk of adverse event&#xD;
      such as post-procedural pain and bleeding. Consequently, nephrologist around the world feel&#xD;
      that renal biopsy should only be performed in patients with type 2 diabetes to detect&#xD;
      non-diabetic renal disease, when the diagnosis of diabetic nephropathy is dubious or&#xD;
      unlikely. This likeliness is based on the presence or absence of typical feature such as&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy, hematuria, progressive decline of renal function or increase of&#xD;
      proteinuria, long duration of diabetes, nephrotic syndrome. These feature were identified by&#xD;
      the comparison of patients with type 2 diabetes and non-diabetic renal disease (alone or&#xD;
      associated to diabetic nephropathy) and isolated diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not known if the presence (or absence) of these atypical features by&#xD;
      themselves are indeed signs of non-diabetic renal disease and necessitate to perform renal&#xD;
      biopsy. The aim of the study is to determine if these atypical features are relevant&#xD;
      indications to perform renal biopsy. To answer this question, will be analyze the medical&#xD;
      records of patients with type 2 diabetes who underwent renal biopsy in five French nephrology&#xD;
      center to determine, in each case, the indication of the biopsy and if this latter benefitted&#xD;
      the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, will be evaluate the prognosis value of the Renal Pathology Society&#xD;
      classification of diabetic nephropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes and diabetic&#xD;
      nephropathy.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the accuracy of kidney biopsies indications in&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes to diagnose non-diabetic renal disease based on canonical&#xD;
      atypical features (Absence of diabetic retinopathy, Low or rapidly decreasing GFR, Rapidly&#xD;
      increasing proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome and Presence of active urinary sediment. This&#xD;
      study is a retrospective observational case only study, recruiting patients over 18 years old&#xD;
      with type 2 diabetes who underwent kidney biopsy in five French nephrology centers between&#xD;
      2006 and 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be collected demographical, clinical and biological data at the time of the renal biopsy&#xD;
      and at the last follow-up from the patients' medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for renal biopsy will be categorized as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Atypical feature of etiological significance in the presence of any atypical feature not&#xD;
           listed below (including acute kidney injury as defined by the stage 1 of KDIG&#xD;
           guidelines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Brutal nephrotic syndrome in the absence of the above criterion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rapid decline of GFR (defined as 50 % eGFR decline over &gt;1 week but &lt; 1 year) in the&#xD;
           absence of criteria 1-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Absence of proteinuria in the absence of criteria 1-3&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rapid increase of proteinuria in the absence of criteria 1-4&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Presence of hematuria in the absence of criteria 1-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Absence of diabetic retinopathy in the absence of criteria 1-6 Will be evaluate the&#xD;
           actual probability to reach a non-diabetic renal disease for each of these indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be also perform a classical analysis by assessing the association of clinical and&#xD;
      biological feature such as HbA1c, diabetes duration, absence of diabetic retinopathy,… with&#xD;
      the presence of a non-diabetic renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the biopsy samples will be scored according to the RPS diabetic nephropathy&#xD;
      classification to evaluate the prognostic value of this classification.&#xD;
