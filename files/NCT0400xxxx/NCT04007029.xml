      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of CD19/CD20 chimeric antigen&#xD;
      receptor (CAR) T-cells when given together with chemotherapy, and to see how effective they&#xD;
      are in treating patients with non-Hodgkin's B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
      that has come back (recurrent) or has not responded to treatment (refractory). In CAR-T cell&#xD;
      therapy, a patient's white blood cells (T cells) are changed in the laboratory to produce an&#xD;
      engineered receptor that allows the T cell to recognize and respond to CD19 and CD20&#xD;
      proteins. CD19 and CD20 are commonly found on non-Hodgkin?s B-cell lymphoma and chronic&#xD;
      lymphocytic leukemia cells. Chemotherapy drugs such as fludarabine phosphate and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide can control cancer cells by killing them, by preventing their growth, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Combining CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells and chemotherapy may help treat&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety of the autologous anti-CD19/anti-CD20 CAR-expressing naive/memory T&#xD;
      cells (CART19/20), including determination of the maximum tolerated dose and assessment for&#xD;
      replication competent lentivirus (RCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Clinical response. Ia. Overall response rate. Ib. Duration of remission. Ic.&#xD;
      Progression-free survival. Id. Overall survival. II. CD19/CD20 bispecific CAR transgenic&#xD;
      T-cell persistence. IIa. T-cell monitoring and analyses. IIb. Evidence of B-cell aplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the serum levels of cytokines associated with cytokine release syndrome (CRS)&#xD;
      in subjects exhibiting &gt; grade-2 CRS following CART19/20 cell treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes 5, 4, and 3 days before cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-CELL INFUSION: Patients receive CD19/CD20 CAR-T cells IV on day 0. Patients with cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome may also receive tocilizumab IV on day 2 at the discretion of the clinical&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up daily for 14 days, on days 30,&#xD;
      45, 60, 70, 90, and 120, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then&#xD;
      annually for a minimum of 15 years.&#xD;

    <description>Will be assessed according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0, with the exception of cytokine release syndrome (CRS), which will be graded on the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (ASTCT) Consensus Grading for CRS scale. Simple descriptive statistics will be used to summarize toxicities observed after each transgenic T-cell infusion in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory determination such as absolute neutrophil count), severity (by CTCAE toxicity table) and minimum or maximum values for laboratory measures, time of onset, duration, and reversibility or outcome. Tables will be created to summarize these toxicities and side effects. Adverse events will be tabulated by treatment group and will include the number of patients for whom the event occurred, the rate of occurrence, and the severity and relationship to study drug.</description>

    <description>The cytokine levels in patients who receive CAR therapies will be monitored to help clarify the complex relationship between CRS severity, toxicity, T-cell survival, and disease eradication. Cytokine levels will be quantified in patients exhibiting any &gt; grade-2 CRS. Cytokine levels in patients who do not exhibit CRS, or exhibit =&lt; grade-2 CRS, will be quantified at the discretion of the investigator.

&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received an allograft transplant will NOT be allowed to participate&#xD;
             in the trial. Patients who have received an autologous transplant will not be excluded&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity or other congenital or acquired&#xD;
             immune deficiency state, which would increase the risk of opportunistic infections and&#xD;

             increase the likelihood of hepatic toxicities from the chemotherapy conditioning&#xD;
             regimen and supportive treatments. If there is a positive result in the infectious&#xD;
             disease testing that was not previously known, the patient will be referred to their&#xD;
             primary physician and/or infectious disease specialist&#xD;

             successfully treated with surgery or radiation therapy will not be exclusion for&#xD;
             participation as long as they are deemed under control at the time of study enrollment&#xD;
             and there are no neurological signs of potential brain metastases. A brain magnetic&#xD;
             resonance imaging (MRI) scan taken within 60 days of screening may be used, otherwise&#xD;
             a brain MRI must be performed to confirm absence of brain metastases&#xD;
&#xD;

             pulmonary function tests indicate they have insufficient pulmonary capability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A left ventricular ejection fraction as determined by an echocardiogram lower than 40%&#xD;
             would preclude participation&#xD;

             postmenopausal for two years, or must agree to use effective contraception during the&#xD;
             period of treatment and for 6 months afterwards. All female patients with reproductive&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum/urine) at screening and again&#xD;
             within 14 days from starting the conditioning chemotherapy. The definition of&#xD;
             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the study investigators.&#xD;
             Patients who are breastfeeding are not allowed on this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other malignancy in the past 3 years with the following exceptions:&#xD;
