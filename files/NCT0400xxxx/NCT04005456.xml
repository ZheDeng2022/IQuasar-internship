  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LIFE-HOUSE research project is designed to evaluate the impact of a personalized&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention program on functional capacity as an approach to quantitating health,&#xD;
      and its relationship to well understood disease risk determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LIFE-HOUSE will utilize an innovative Tent-Umbrella-Bucket design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will gather under the Tent of an all-inclusive 'N of 1' Case Series providing a&#xD;
      shelter of Functional Medicine interventions against the storm of chronic disease. Under this&#xD;
      Tent are a collection of Umbrellas where participants with similar clinical challenges are&#xD;
      evaluated as clinically defined groups with loose guidelines for the planned interventions.&#xD;
      Finally, participants standing under these Umbrellas may step into specific Buckets that&#xD;
      gather individuals with nearly identical clinical presentations into more formally described&#xD;
      prescriptive randomized arms for intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be offered the opportunity to participate in all Umbrellas and Buckets for&#xD;
      which they qualify. They may accept or reject participation in any Umbrella or Bucket and yet&#xD;
      remain eligible for participation in the overall Tent.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been suggested that the best medicine should value four principles (4P) - medicine&#xD;
      should be personalized, predictive, preventative and participatory. This 4P Medicine will&#xD;
      thus be personalized and patient centered with a focus on the person who has the disease and&#xD;
      not the disease the person has. It will be predictive as it identifies the pre-clinical&#xD;
      trend/decline towards illness sooner than onset of symptoms that herald the loss of function&#xD;
      and health. It will be preventative as the information gathered should offer opportunities to&#xD;
      modify these trajectories towards illness and finally it will be participatory as individuals&#xD;
      will be intimately involved in the gathering of data to identify trends and in the&#xD;
      application of lifestyle measures to improve their lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a significant unmet need to identify the value of a personalized lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention program for improving functional health outcomes. Whereas disease is well&#xD;
      understood from traditional pathology-based indices, health is less easily defined.&#xD;
      Historically, healthy has been the default term that is applied to an individual who is not&#xD;
      recognized as having a disease. This definition of health as the absence of disease has&#xD;
      resulted in the delivery of health and wellness as often lying outside the purview of&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An evolving definition of health, however, is to recognize that it is related to the&#xD;
      functional capacity of the individual. Functional capacity can be categorized in four&#xD;
      assessment areas: physiological, physical, cognitive and emotional. All four of these&#xD;
      subcategories are quantifiable by both qualitative and quantitative metrics. The effects on&#xD;
      health of a multi-modal personalized lifestyle medicine intervention program can best be&#xD;
      evaluated by using functional determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Medicine is an integrative medicine philosophy that uniquely incorporates 4P&#xD;
      Medicine with a focus on function and dysfunction and the necessity to consider the&#xD;
      physiological events that determine the balance between the two. The LIFE-HOUSE research&#xD;
      project is designed to evaluate the impact of a personalized lifestyle intervention program&#xD;
      on functional capacity as an approach to quantitating health, and its relationship to well&#xD;
      understood disease risk determinants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals will be offered the opportunity to participate in all Umbrellas and Buckets for&#xD;
      which they qualify. They may accept or reject participation in any Umbrella or Bucket and yet&#xD;
      remain eligible for participation in the overall Tent. Due to the structure of the uniquely&#xD;
      defined yet overlapping system of Umbrellas and Buckets, a specific Subject may participate&#xD;
      consecutively and/or sequentially in a series of Umbrella and Buckets as applicable and their&#xD;
      data may be included in multiple Umbrella and Bucket analyses.&#xD;
