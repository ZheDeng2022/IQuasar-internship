  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to investigate the modulation effects of Baduanjin (BDJ), a simple&#xD;
      and innovative mind-body exercise, on cognitive function, resting state functional&#xD;
      connectivity, and brain morphometry in individuals with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).&#xD;
      The results obtained will provide novel insights for improving the prevention of age-related&#xD;
      cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported perception of memory or cognitive&#xD;
      problems, is receiving increasing attention as a risk factor for the development of&#xD;
      Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since SCD manifests before the onset of clinical impairment, it&#xD;
      might be the optimal stage/window of time at which to intervene with preventative therapies&#xD;
      for AD and age-related dementia before the progressive neurological loss and irreversible&#xD;
      cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, mind-body interventions have demonstrated their potential in preventing cognitive&#xD;
      decline. Nevertheless, these mind-body therapies encompass a family of complex practices,&#xD;
      each with different characteristics and focus. Therefore, they may be associated with&#xD;
      different mechanisms and treatment effects. Baduanjin (BDJ) is an innovative and simple&#xD;
      mind-body exercise consisting of eight simple movements that can be easily practiced at home&#xD;
      with video guidance, thereby making it a more suitable option for older adults with cognitive&#xD;
      decline than other more complex exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that this study will 1) significantly improve the prevention of MCI and AD and&#xD;
      directly benefit patients suffering from these highly prevalent disorders, 2) enhance the&#xD;
      investigators' understandings of the neurobiology through which mind-body interventions&#xD;
      affect cognition and health, and 3) advance the investigators' understandings of the&#xD;
      pathophysiology and development of SCD, AD, and age-related dementia.&#xD;
