  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient participation in decision making about their care promotes patient satisfaction and&#xD;
      confidence. Further more, allowing patients to see letters written about them enables trust,&#xD;
      encourages patients to be involved in decision making process and allow patient&#xD;
      understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how young people value these letters in the same way. Only one brief&#xD;
      questionnaire study focused on adolescent views and found that young people wished to receive&#xD;
      consultation summaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims explore the views of adolescent patients related to consultation summaries&#xD;
      that they receive following a doctor's appointment. The investigator will use patients&#xD;
      attending a specialist diabetes clinic as our cohort and conduct a qualitative study using&#xD;
      focus groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patient participation in decision making processes about their care promotes patient&#xD;
      satisfaction and confidence. As part of this, allowing patients to see letters written about&#xD;
      them enables trust, encourages patients to be involved in decision making process and allow&#xD;
      patient understanding. Given this, the 2000 NHS plan made it a requirement that all medical&#xD;
      correspondence between health professionals is shared with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 40-80% of information discussed during a consultation is forgotten&#xD;
      immediately. Written summaries have shown to be an effective method of improving patient&#xD;
      recall of information by 20.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature on the benefits/disadvantages of consultation summaries is largely focused on&#xD;
      adult patients with little research done to explore the views of adolescent population. Where&#xD;
      the patient is a child, the literature is only focussed on parents of children and not the&#xD;
      children themselves. Limited research has shown that parents/care givers report clinic&#xD;
      letters being useful in assisting with better understanding and management of their child's&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about how young people value these letters in the same way. Only one brief&#xD;
      questionnaire study focused on adolescent views and found that young people wished to receive&#xD;
      consultation summaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescence is an important time of an individual's life. This is the time when many&#xD;
      independent health behaviours are established. During adolescence, young people start showing&#xD;
      more interest in their own health and often wish to participate in decision making processes&#xD;
      regarding their care. The role of health workers at this stage is to appreciate young people&#xD;
      as individuals . Clinic summaries addressed directly to young people might play an important&#xD;
      role in assisting with establishment of health behaviours and promoting good health in young&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to understand the views of adolescent patients on consultation&#xD;
      summaries and identify factors can improve these summaries and subsequently their health and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

    <description>This is a qualitative study using focus group discussions with young people aged 12-18 who are receiving consultation summaries.&#xD;
Patients attending a single diabetes service will be invited to enrol. This service serves a population from a wide geographic area and socio-economic backgrounds.&#xD;
Interviews will be conducted by a qualitative researcher with relevant experience. They will be held on the day of a participant's clinic appointment within the same hospital or on the day agreed with the participant.</description>
