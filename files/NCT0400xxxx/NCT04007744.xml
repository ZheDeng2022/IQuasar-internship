    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the best dose of sonidegib when given together with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with solid tumor that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (advanced). Sonidegib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving sonidegib and pembrolizumab may work&#xD;
      better than standard treatment in treating patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of sonidegib in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with advanced solid tumors as part of the dose escalation&#xD;
      phase. (Part A) II. To estimate the response rate of sonidegib in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in participants with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as part of the expansion cohort based on Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. (Part B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the safety profile and tolerability of sonidegib and pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To obtain preliminary estimates of efficacy as measured by response rate (based on RECIST&#xD;
      criteria), disease control rate at 6 months, duration of response, overall survival (OS), and&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) of sonidegib and pembrolizumab in patients with selected&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the immunologic effects of sonidegib and pembrolizumab by investigating the&#xD;
      changes in circulating tumor cells, immune cell markers, cytokines, and soluble PD-L1 in&#xD;
      blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of sonidegib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sonidegib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-8 and pembrolizumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 24&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 30 days.&#xD;
