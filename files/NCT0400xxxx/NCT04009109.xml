  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized Phase II clinical trial will be conducted to assess the impact on progression&#xD;
      free survival (PFS) with the addition of ixazomib and daratumumab to lenalidomide as a&#xD;
      maintenance treatment following induction with lenalidomide, ixazomib, dexamethasone, and&#xD;
      daratumumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: 12 cycles of lenalidomide, ixazomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone followed by&#xD;
      lenalidomide until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or a maximum of 2 years of&#xD;
      maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: 12 cycles of lenalidomide, ixazomib, daratumumab and dexamethasone, followed by&#xD;
      lenalidomide, ixazomib, and daratumumab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      a maximum of 2 years maintenance therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Induction Phase: 28-day treatment cycle for 12 cycles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 15 mg PO QD on Days 1-21&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib 4 mg PO on Days 1, 8, 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV Q1W week for 8 weeks, then Q2W weeks for 16 weeks, thereafter&#xD;
           Q4W weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone 20 mg PO will be administered day of and day after all doses of&#xD;
           daratumumab and ixazomib (Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16). The dexamethasone 20 mg PO oral&#xD;
           or IV dose administered as a pre-infusion medication on daratumumab infusion days (Days&#xD;
           1, 8, 15, 22) replaces the oral dexamethasone dose for that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Phase: 28-day treatment cycle until progression or excessive toxicity or a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 years of maintenance treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 10 mg PO QD on Days 1-21 Arm B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide 10 mg PO QD on Days 1-21&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ixazomib 3 mg (or last tolerated dose from the induction phase) PO on Days 1, 8, and 15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daratumumab 16 mg/kg IV on Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the maintenance phase, dexamethasone, 20 mg PO orally or IV will be administered to&#xD;
      patients as a pre-infusion medication prior to daratumumab dosing. When dexamethasone is&#xD;
      reduced to 20 mg/week and is given as pre-infusion medication, patients may receive low-dose&#xD;
      methylprednisolone (≤20 mg) orally (or equivalent in accordance with local standards) for the&#xD;
      prevention of delayed IRRs as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigator wishes to continue the maintenance regimen at the end of the 2 years&#xD;
      maintenance treatment, patients may continue current maintenance as per standard of care.&#xD;

    <measure>Quality of Life with the EQ 5D 5L Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>Consists of 2 parts: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life with the EORTC QLQ-MY20 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-MY20 module was developed as an addition to the QLQ-C30 for use specifically in MM. It has 4 domains (disease symptoms, side effects of treatment, body image, future perspectives). Scores range from 0 to 100; good HRQoL is indicated by high scores for future perspective and body image, and low scores for disease symptoms and side effects of treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life with the EORTC QLQ-C30 Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>5 Years</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status/QoL scale, and six single items. Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale. All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level. Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problems.</description>

             with the study procedures or results, or that in the opinion of the investigator,&#xD;
             would pose a risk to subject safety or interfere with study evaluation, procedures or&#xD;
             completion.&#xD;

                  response [SVR], defined as aviremia at least 12 weeks after completion of&#xD;
                  antiviral therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. A woman who is pregnant, or breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant during the&#xD;

             has surgery planned during the time the patient is expected to participate in the&#xD;
