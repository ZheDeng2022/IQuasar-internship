  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is a non-scarring hair loss disorder that affects both sexes equally.&#xD;
      Incidence of the disease varies for different populations and in different studies, with&#xD;
      global incidence ranging from 0.57% to 3.8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology of alopecia areata is not completely understood, and the majority of evidence&#xD;
      suggests that genetically predisposed individuals, when exposed to an unknown trigger,&#xD;
      develop a predominantly autoimmune reaction, leading to acute hair loss. Environmental&#xD;
      triggers, including viral or bacterial infections, along with autoimmune disorders, seem to&#xD;
      play a major role in the development of alopecia areata.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The onset and progression of alopecia areata are unpredictable. Significant variations in the&#xD;
      clinical presentation of alopecia areata have been observed, ranging from small,&#xD;
      well-circumscribed patches of hair loss to a complete absence of body and scalp hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although many patients improve spontaneously or respond to standard therapy, treatment can be&#xD;
      quite challenging in those with more severe and refractory disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent advances in the understanding of alopecia areata pathophysiology hold promise for&#xD;
      better treatments in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids either topical or intralesional are the most popular drugs for the treatment&#xD;
      of this disease. Other therapies like topical minoxidil, anthralin, immunotherapy, systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids, cyclosporine and Psoralen with Ultraviolet-A Light therapy are also commonly&#xD;
      used with varying success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various lasers have been suggested in recent studies to treat alopecia areata . The effect of&#xD;
      308-nm excimer laser was the most studied, while others, including neodymium-doped yttrium&#xD;
      aluminum garnet, erbium:glass laser, fractional carbon dioxide laser, and low-level laser&#xD;
      therapy, have also been assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the nascent state of research on lasers as a treatment option for alopecia areata ,&#xD;
      there have been a great deal of promising results. It is possible for lasers to become the&#xD;
      mainstay treatment option of alopecia areata .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was suggested that ablative fractional lasers may exert its effect through: induction of&#xD;
      moderate inflammation to promote anagen entry and creation of channel pathways for topically&#xD;
      applied medications they grant access to dermal structures such as hair follicles and&#xD;
      cutaneous vasculature. Also, creation of a wound by the ablative fractional laser may&#xD;
      stimulate stem cell populations to produce a hair shaft and progress through all stages of&#xD;
      the hair follicle cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Majid et al, investigated the efficacy and safety of the combination of fractional carbon&#xD;
      dioxide followed by topical triamcinolone acetonide application in ten patients with&#xD;
      resistant alopecia areata. Only eight patients completed the study. Seven of them had&#xD;
      complete recovery of the treated area. One patient however did not show good response. No&#xD;
      significant adverse effects were noted in any of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of platelet rich plasma in promoting hair survival and growth has been demonstrated&#xD;
      both in vitro and in vivo. The activation of platelet Î± granules releases numerous growth&#xD;
      factors, including transforming growth factor , platelet derived growth factor, vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor, epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and&#xD;
      interleukin-1. It is proposed that these growth factors may act on stem cells in the bulge&#xD;
      area of the follicles, stimulating the development of new follicles and promoting&#xD;
      neovascularization. platelet rich plasma has been found to benefit in hair growth in alopecia&#xD;
      areata. Intralesional injections of platelet rich plasma were found to increase hair regrowth&#xD;
      significantly compared with triamcinolone acetonide or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol [1, 25(OH)/2 D3] is the biologic active form of the&#xD;
      vitamin D3. Vitamin D has a multitude of biologic effects interacting with the innate and&#xD;
      adaptive immune system, mainly leading to its downregulation. It regulates the&#xD;
      differentiation of B cells, T cells, dendritic cells, and the expression of Toll-like&#xD;
      receptors. There is growing evidence that vitamin D may help in several autoimmune diseases&#xD;
      like multiple sclerosis and type I diabetes mellitus, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relation between vitamin D levels and the development of alopecia areata and whether&#xD;
      vitamin D supplementation helps in the treatment of alopecia areata represent an attractive&#xD;
      area of research. Recent studies suggest that there is deficiency of serum vitamin D and&#xD;
      reduced vitamin D receptor expression in the affected hair follicles in alopecia areata&#xD;
      patients, the results of which may prove that vitamin D is a safe and helpful choice in&#xD;
      alopecia areata treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best our knowledge no previous research studied the effect of vitamin D solution in&#xD;
      treatment of alopecia areata.&#xD;
