  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying different immunotherapy regimens as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      stage III or IV resectable melanoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved OPDIVO® (nivolumab), YERVOY®&#xD;
      (ipilimumab), and a combination of the two as treatment options for metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the combination of nivolumab&#xD;
      and BMS-986205 as a treatment for any disease. This research study is looking for more&#xD;
      information on the efficacy the combination of nivolumab and BMS-986205 in the treatment of&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, and BMS-986205 are types of immunotherapy. Immunotherapy works by&#xD;
      encouraging the body's own immune system to attack the cancer cells. Nivolumab, Ipilimumab,&#xD;
      and BMS-986205 work by stopping various molecules on cancer cells and body cells from working&#xD;
      against the immune system's natural fight against cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are going to look at the following while the&#xD;
      participants are receiving the study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The effectiveness (how well the drug works), safety, and tolerability of Nivolumab,&#xD;
      BMS-986205 and Nivolumab, and Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in people with resectable stage III or&#xD;
      IV melanoma&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must not have a history of life-threatening toxicity related to prior&#xD;
             immune therapy (eg. anti-CTLA-4 or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of other malignancy within 3 years prior to screening, with the exception of&#xD;
             those with a negligible risk of metastasis or death (e.g., 5-year OS of &gt; 90%), such&#xD;
             as adequately treated carcinoma in situ of the cervix, non-melanoma skin carcinoma,&#xD;
             localized prostate cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ, or Stage I uterine cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had major surgery requiring general anesthesia or significant&#xD;
             trauma who have not recovered per physician determination for at least 14 days prior&#xD;
             to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with conditions known to interfere significantly with the absorption of&#xD;
             oral medication, as per investigator judgment.&#xD;
