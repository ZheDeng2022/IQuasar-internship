      The investigators have developed, piloted, and propose to expand and to experimentally&#xD;
      evaluate a speech-based service that connects expectant fathers to doctors and to each other&#xD;
      over a simple phone call. This service, dubbed Super Abbu (Super Dad in English), addresses&#xD;
      the challenges faced by existing efforts in several new and important ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The service targets fathers. Currently, the entire public health infrastructure in&#xD;
           Punjab is geared towards providing information to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It supplements LHWs by providing information between LHW visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It does so in a manner appropriate for those who are illiterate and do not have&#xD;
           smartphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It does not require synchronous phone calls. Expectant fathers can leave questions to be&#xD;
           answered. And they can access past questions and answers asked by themselves and other&#xD;
           users.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Through experience developing, publicizing, and driving adoption of speech-based&#xD;
           services, the investigators believe they can overcome the slow adoption rate faced by&#xD;
           the Punjab Health Line. Principal investigator Raza previously developed and launched&#xD;
           Baang in Punjab, an entertainment speech-based social service, similar to Reddit, which&#xD;
           accumulated 42,500 calls by 1,550 users within 71 days of its launch. These users&#xD;
           listened to 393,448 speech posts.&#xD;

      Problem: Pakistan has the highest neonatal mortality rate in the world (44.2 per 1000 live&#xD;
      births), accounting for 7% of the world's neonatal deaths, and among the worst maternal&#xD;
      mortality rate in the region (178 per 100,000 live births). These indicators remain high&#xD;
      despite the best efforts of the government and NGOs to leverage modern practices and&#xD;
      technology to improve maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH). To this end, the province&#xD;
      of Punjab, Pakistan has hired 48,000 Lady Health Workers (LHWs), has introduced multiple&#xD;
      information communication technology (ICT)-based health monitoring systems, and has launched&#xD;
      the Punjab Health Line staffed by 150 doctors 24/7. LHW effectiveness has been limited,&#xD;
      however, given the size of Punjab (100+ million people). LHWs are expected to visit nine&#xD;
      homes per day and in 40 minutes cover a long syllabus and perform several tasks. Similarly,&#xD;
      high deployment costs, low smartphone penetration, and low literacy rates in rural areas have&#xD;
      limited the effectiveness of ICT-based interventions. The Punjab Health Line has been&#xD;
      ineffective for more mundane reasons-its adoption has been very slow despite extensive&#xD;
      publicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research goals and expected outcomes: Super Abbu itself will generate useful information on&#xD;
      frequently asked questions for public health professionals. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      seek to evaluate the effectiveness of Super Abbu at reducing maternal and infant mortality&#xD;
      rates, and key drivers of these rates, in Punjab, Pakistan. In order to do so, the service&#xD;
      must first be expanded to accommodate a new base of users. The investigators will then&#xD;
      conduct a careful, large-scale randomized control trial of the service to understand its&#xD;
      impacts on drivers of maternal and infant mortality rates, such as the number of antenatal&#xD;
      visits, tetanus injections administered before birth, iron supplements consumed, and&#xD;
      breastfeeding during neonatal days, and attitudes about vaccination, breastfeeding, and&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact on research fields: Current speech-based health services in the developing world&#xD;
      either depend on the functionality of a smartphone, involve synchronous contact with a&#xD;
      healthcare provider, only target women, are costly, or are any combination of these. Super&#xD;
      Abbu pushes the envelope. In addition, a careful evaluation of the service conducted by an&#xD;
      interdisciplinary team would impact future research in public health, in computer&#xD;
      science/language technologies, as well as in development economics.&#xD;

        Primary study subjects The target study population are households in Punjab, Pakistan, with&#xD;
        a pregnant woman with a male spouse. The researchers will identify households that fit&#xD;
        these criteria village-by-village, through community-based Lady Health Workers (LHWs) that,&#xD;
        among other things, are charged with knowing which women are pregnant in her catchment&#xD;
        area. LHWs are appointed by Punjab's Department of Health at the village level, and are&#xD;
        supervised by Lady Health Supervisors (LHSs) at the sub-district level, who are in turn&#xD;
        supervised by district coordinators and assistant district coordinators at the district&#xD;
        level. The research team has relationships with LHSs and district coordinators in several&#xD;
        districts in Punjab through prior work and it is these districts from which the study&#xD;
        sample will be selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        From all of the selected districts, the researchers will draw a random sample of 40 LHWs,&#xD;
        stratified on sub-district. The team will then work with each of these 40 LHWs to identify&#xD;
        all of the households in their catchment area that meet the study requirements. Note that&#xD;
        these LHWs will share location and pregnancy status of households with the researchers,&#xD;
        with permission of their supervisors, which the researchers have verified does not break&#xD;
        any confidentiality rules within Pakistan, Punjab, and/or Punjab's Department of Health. It&#xD;
        is discussed below how the researchers will maintain confidentiality of the research&#xD;
        subjects once they are in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The researchers expect each LHW to have 1000 households in her catchment area on average.&#xD;
        It is expected that four percent of households will have a pregnant woman at any given&#xD;
        time. This implies that each LHW will have forty pregnant women in her catchment area. The&#xD;
        researchers thus expect 1600 pregnant women across the sample catchment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Once all of these 1600 households have been identified across 40 LHW's catchment areas, the&#xD;
        researchers will randomly select 20 catchment areas for &quot;treatment&quot; and 20 to be &quot;control&quot;.&#xD;
        While all 1600 households will then be administered identical baseline and endline surveys,&#xD;
        as described below, spouses in households in &quot;treatment&quot; catchments will also be invited to&#xD;
        join Super Abbu at the conclusion of their baseline survey. What Super Abbu entails is&#xD;
        described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Before enrolling households into the study during the baseline survey, the research team&#xD;
        will verify that the household does in fact have a pregnant woman with a male spouse. The&#xD;
        woman and her spouse will then be enrolled into the study. The only additional criteria&#xD;
        will be that the subject is an adult who gives consent, where adult in this setting is 18&#xD;
        years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
        There will be no other inclusion or exclusion criteria for primary study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preliminary study subjects The researchers will conduct a preliminary study with&#xD;
        approximately 100 subjects prior to beginning the primary study, to pilot the service and&#xD;
        to test different versions of Super Abbu. These participants will be selected following the&#xD;
        same procedure as with the primary study subjects, with one exception---they will all be&#xD;
        invited to join Super Abbu. They will also be in a geographically distinct location from&#xD;
        the primary study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Focus group subjects The research team will also conduct focus groups prior to the primary&#xD;
        study. Separate focus groups will be conducted with: gynecologists, LHWs, pregnant mothers,&#xD;
        expectant fathers, fathers that were invited to be preliminary study subjects, fathers that&#xD;
        were invited to be primary study subjects who were also invited to Super Abbu, and fathers&#xD;
        that were invited to be primary study subjects who were not invited to Super Abbu. In all&#xD;
        cases, the researchers will only include adults (18 years or older) who give consent.&#xD;
        Selection criteria will be that subjects must match the group for which each given focus&#xD;
        group is being conducted, with no additional criteria. Groups of 1-10, identified ad-hoc&#xD;
        based on referrals, will be invited in-person to join a focus group at a central location.&#xD;
        The researchers expect to conduct two focus groups per group, except four for preliminary&#xD;
        study subjects, for a total of 16 focus groups and up to 160 participants. Note while the&#xD;
        researchers expect discussion to differ based on the background and perspectives of those&#xD;
        being focus grouped they plan to ask very similar questions of the group and, as such, only&#xD;
        have one consent form for all focus group participants.&#xD;
