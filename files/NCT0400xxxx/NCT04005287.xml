      This is a randomized outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-site study of the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy of topically administered WST-057 (4%&#xD;
      pirenzepine free base monohydrate) for 24 weeks in subjects with T2DM with peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. Subjects will attend visits at screening (day -45 to -28); day 1 (baseline);&#xD;
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24; and follow-up (week 26). Approximately 60 subjects with T2DM&#xD;
      with peripheral neuropathy will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:4:4 ratio:&#xD;
      placebo control 2 mL (n = 6 subjects), placebo control 4 mL (n = 6 subjects); low dose (2 mL)&#xD;
      WST-057 (73 mg pirenzepine free base monohydrate) (n = 24 subjects); and high dose (4 mL)&#xD;
      WST-057 (146 mg pirenzepine free base monohydrate) (n = 24 subjects), with the assumption&#xD;
      that a total of 50 subjects will complete the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed with 4 periods: screening, baseline/day 1, outpatient treatment, and&#xD;
      safety follow-up.&#xD;

    <measure>Intraepidermal Nerve Fiber Density (IENFD)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluate the efficacy of WST-057 to increase IENFD present in punch biopsies collected in the calf. The nerves will be counted in these punch biopsies and the change in the density will be measured between screening and the week 24 visit. The more nerves or a higher nerve density correlates with better sensation.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Norfolk Quality of Life Measure (QOL) Patient Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Determine the impact of once-daily topical dosing of WST-057 on a QOL measurement. The score from the QOL questionnaire will be tabulated from each visit to determine if an improvement in the quality of life could be measured using this scale between screening and the week 24 visit.All symptoms (1-7) are scored as either a 1 or a 0, indicating a presence or absence of the symptom. With the exception of Questions 31, and 32, the other items are scored according to the 5-point Likert Scale (0-4, &quot;No Problem&quot; to &quot;Severe Problem&quot;). In Question 31, &quot;Good&quot;, the middle item, is scored as O. &quot;Very Good&quot; is scored as -1, Excellent&quot; is scored as -2. &quot;Fair is scored as 1, and &quot;Poor&quot; is scored as 2. In Question 32, &quot;About the Same&quot;, the middle item, is scored as 0. &quot;Somewhat better&quot; is scored as -1, &quot;Much better&quot; is scored as -2. &quot;Somewhat worse&quot; is scored as 1, and &quot;Much worse&quot; is scored as 2. A higher score indicates worse neuropathy-related quality of life score than a lower number.</description>

             Guidelines) of at least 12 months duration in the lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Provide written informed consent prior to entering the study or undergoing any study&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Females should be either not of childbearing potential as a result of surgery or&#xD;
             menopause (1 year after onset), or of childbearing potential and must be practicing a&#xD;
             highly effective medically acceptable method of contraception (e.g. abstinence, or&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives (e.g., combined oral contraceptives, patch, vaginal ring,&#xD;
             injectables, and implants); intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS); or&#xD;
             vasectomy (partner)) for at least 1 month before the screening visit and for 1 month&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug. If access or use of a highly effective medically&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception is not achievable, then a combination of barrier&#xD;
             methods (e.g. male condom, female condom, cervical cap, diaphragm, contraceptive&#xD;
             sponge) is acceptable (e.g. male condom with diaphragm, male condom with cervical&#xD;
             cap). Eligible female subjects must also have a negative serum beta-human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (ß-hCG) at the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Males must use an acceptable form of contraception (e.g., male condom with diaphragm,&#xD;
             male condom with cervical cap, or male condom in association with spermicide)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Glycemic control has been optimized and has been stable for at least three months&#xD;
             prior to randomization. Optimal glycemic control refers to the best possible diabetic&#xD;

               -  Take study drug as required by protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Be on stable antidiabetic treatment (insulin, oral agents, or lifestyle) that is not&#xD;
             anticipated to change during the course of the study, except if medically required.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Be on stable analgesic treatment (same medication and dose) or stable&#xD;
             nonpharmacological pain treatment for at least 4 weeks prior to screening and remain&#xD;
             on this stable treatment throughout the study (unless otherwise directed by a&#xD;
             physician). Nonpharmacologic pain treatment includes the following:&#xD;
             relaxation/hypnosis, physical or occupational therapy, counseling, etc. Episodic or&#xD;
             periodic treatments, such as monthly injections for treatment of pain (eg, local&#xD;
             anesthetics), will not be permitted. Topical anesthetics/analgesics such as capsaicin,&#xD;
             topical cannabinoid (CBD) oil or extracts, lidocaine patches and compounded topical&#xD;
