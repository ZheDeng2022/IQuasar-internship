      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab in combination&#xD;
      with Pegaspargase and anlotinib in the treatment of stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma patients&#xD;
      unfit for high-dose chemotherapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma has a poor prognosis, and autologous hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation can improve the prognosis of patients who have achieved remission after&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The median survival time for patients who were not suitable for transplantation&#xD;
      was about 1 year. Asparaginase is the backbone drug for the treatment of NK/T-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
      PD-1 antibody is effective for relapsed/refractory NK/T-cell lymphoma. Our previous study&#xD;
      found that anlotinib is active in relapsed/refractory NK/T Cell lymphoma. This study is aimed&#xD;
      to investigate the efficacy and safety of Sintilimab, a PD-1 antibody approved in China, in&#xD;
      combination with Pegaspargase and anlotinib in the treatment of stage IV NK/T-cell lymphoma&#xD;
      patients unfit for high-dose chemotherapy.&#xD;
