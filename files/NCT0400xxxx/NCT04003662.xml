  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients and volunteers both with and without medical problems will be recruited; vital sign&#xD;
      measurements are taken twice with normal equipment and while recording video data at the same&#xD;
      time. The data collected will allow the Artificial Intelligence to develop the LifeLight&#xD;
      algorithm to to improve measurement accuracy of its video data based vital signs monitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate and oxygen levels currently&#xD;
      need several pieces of equipment and trained staff in order to be measured properly. The&#xD;
      LifeLight app measures the same vital signs using a camera in a phone, tablet, laptop or&#xD;
      smart TV. By using very small changes in the colour of your skin, LifeLight's AI system can&#xD;
      calculate these values without any extra equipment or training, and without contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research study is to improve the accuracy of the LifeLight system with a view&#xD;
      to a subsequent Validation study to prove the level of accuracy. The investigators will&#xD;
      recruit patients, staff and visitors, both with and without medical problems, and take vital&#xD;
      sign measurements twice with normal equipment and while recording video data at the same&#xD;
      time. This will allow the AI which develops the LifeLight algorithm to make it more accurate,&#xD;
      prior to a subsequent study which will validate the results.&#xD;
