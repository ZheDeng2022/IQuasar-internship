  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory clinical trial to assess the potential of 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab&#xD;
      Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (PET/CT) scans in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). This open label, nontherapeutic trial will&#xD;
      test the correlation of 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab immunoPET/CT with programmed death-ligand 1&#xD;
      (PD-L1) expression and the response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy in patients with&#xD;
      RCC. There will be two cohorts, one made up of patients with localized RCC who will undergo&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab PET/CT prior to nephrectomy and a second cohort of patients with&#xD;
      metastatic RCC who will undergo 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab PET/CT prior to treatment with an&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PD-L1 expression in tissue of a variety of tumor types has both prognostic and predictive&#xD;
      significance for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. A number of efforts are&#xD;
      underway to better identify patients who will benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition.&#xD;
      Among these efforts are the use of radiolabeled antibodies against PD-L1. While under&#xD;
      investigation in a number of tumor types, to our knowledge this is the first such effort in&#xD;
      renal carcinoma, despite the clear evidence of clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors in kidney cancer. Our primary aim with this study is to explore&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer in patients with RCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 40 patients distributed across two different groups. The first group is&#xD;
      made up of patients with high risk localized disease that will be having surgery.&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab PET/CT prior to surgery will be correlated with PD-L1. The second group&#xD;
      is made up of patients with unresectable or metastatic RCC that will receive an&#xD;
      anti-programmed death 1 (PD1)/programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (alone or in combination).&#xD;
      89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab PET uptake at site of diseases will be evaluated within and across&#xD;
      patients and correlated with treatment responsiveness in exploratory analyses. Each cohort&#xD;
      will be comprised of 15-25 patients. Patients will be followed for signs of recurrence or&#xD;
      progression of their cancer and repeat 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab PET scans will be offered at&#xD;
      that time. Biopsy after subsequent PET/CT will be strongly encouraged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have data collected during the course of routine clinical care including&#xD;
      response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, and toxicities developed during immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-primary endpoints will be an exploratory analysis correlating 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab uptake&#xD;
      with PD-L1 immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses in locally advanced kidney cancer (cohort 1)&#xD;
      and an investigation of whether 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab uptake across metastatic sites of&#xD;
      kidney cancer correlates with known radiographically evident metastatic sites of disease,&#xD;
      PD-L1 expression, and response to anti-PD1/PD-L1 immunotherapy treatment.&#xD;

             routinely performed in patients who will be having surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be able to lie still for a 30 to 60 minute PET/CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Patients with locally advanced RCC planned for surgery determined to be a high&#xD;
                  risk of recurrence, defined by presence of at least clinical T2 or thioredoxin 1&#xD;
                  (TxN1), OR patients with metastatic RCC for whom treatment with metastasectomy is&#xD;
                  planned by the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Patients with metastatic RCC for whom immuno-oncology (IO) therapy is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to undergo and have documented a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test on the day of 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab administration. A female of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation, having&#xD;
             undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e.,&#xD;
                  has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of severe allergic, anaphylactic, or other hypersensitivity reactions to&#xD;
             atezolizumab or any other chimeric or humanized antibodies.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled severe and irreversible intercurrent illness or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital&#xD;
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant autoimmune disease requiring treatment with either prednisone (or steroid&#xD;
             equivalent) at a dose &gt; 10 mg/day or other immunosuppressive agents. (Replacement&#xD;
             steroid therapy is acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient for whom ICI therapy would be contraindicated for other reasons. Patients&#xD;
             with adverse reactions to ICI therapy may undergo second 89Zr-DFO-Atezolizumab&#xD;
             injection and PET/CT at the discretion of the treating physician considering that the&#xD;
             dose of antibody represents 1% of a single therapeutic dose and therefore unlikely to&#xD;
             cause adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unable to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are claustrophobic or have other contraindications to PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not weigh more than the maximum weight limit for the table for the&#xD;
             PET/CT scanner where the study is being performed. (&gt;200 kg or 440 lbs).&#xD;
