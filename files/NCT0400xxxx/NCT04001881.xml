    <textblock>
      Modern guidelines have combined both the maximum diameter of IVC at expiration (dIVC max) and&#xD;
      the IVCCI to appreciate right atrial pressure (RAP) measurements and consequently to assess&#xD;
      intravascular volume status. In fact, IVC diameter &lt;2.1 cm with IVCCI &gt;20% (quite&#xD;
      inspiration) suggests normal RAP of 3mmHg (range, 0-5mmHg), whereas IVC diameter &gt;2.1 cm with&#xD;
      IVCCI&lt;20% suggests high RAP of 15mmHg (range, 10-20mmHg). In occasions where the IVC diameter&#xD;
      and collapse is not fit the above categories, an intermediate value of 8 mmHg (range, 5-10&#xD;
      mmHg) is applied. From a clinical standpoint, it is conceivable that both measurements must&#xD;
      be measured in isolation to enable RAP assessment. To circumvent this limitation the two&#xD;
      indices have been consolidated to dIVCmax-to-IVCCI ratio. Although this ratio has been shown&#xD;
      high accuracy to predict spinal-induced hypotension in elderly patients with preserved&#xD;
      ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle (LV), its value in patients with cardiac&#xD;
      dysfunction and reduced LV-EF has not been investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From the aforementioned, this study sets out to address the role of dIVCmax-to-IVCCI ratio in&#xD;
      the prediction as well as in the management of hypotension after spinal anesthesia in elderly&#xD;
      orthopaedic patients with reduced LV-EF.&#xD;

      Methods In the present prospective study, consecutive sampling is been used to recruit&#xD;
      elderly patients (age&gt;70 years) hospitalized in the Attikon University Hospital of Athens.&#xD;
      Patients is included if they sustain orthopaedic operation of the lower limb under spinal&#xD;
      anaesthesia. This study was approved for ethics and consent by the Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board/Ethics Committee of the authors' institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' medical history, physical examination, ECG, and X-ray assessment are standard&#xD;
      practice, supplemented by specific exams or tests (e.g. TTE or pro-BNP levels), are performed&#xD;
      per the consultant cardiologist's recommendations. All patients included in our study are&#xD;
      American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology(AHA/ACC) stage II or III with&#xD;
      ejection fraction (EF) of the left ventricle (LV) between 35 and 50%, and their cardiac&#xD;
      disease status always in compensated status; also, patients with right ventricle (RV)&#xD;
      dysfunction and severe valvular diseases are not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard intraoperative TTE protocol is used in all patients and included the following&#xD;
      views: subcostal 4-chamber (SUBC), apical 4-chamber (4CH), apical 2-chamber (2CH), apical&#xD;
      3-chamber (3CH), parasternal long (LAX) and short axis (SAX).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data are saved and stored digitally for off-line, postoperative analysis. The EF is&#xD;
      determined using the biplane Simpson's method, by performing automated measurements of LV&#xD;
      volumes in 2CH and 4CH views (GE, Auto-EF system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) index is used for the assessment of&#xD;
      right ventricular function. Pulsed Doppler peak velocity &lt;10 cm/sec was also considered an&#xD;
      index of right ventricular dysfunction. E/Î•' ratio is measured in patients without severe&#xD;
      mitral annulus calcification. Stroke volume (SV) and subsequent stroke volume index&#xD;
      (SVI=SV/m2) of the LV is assessed by using automated measurements of LV volumes, according to&#xD;
      the formula: SV= EDV-ESV, where EDV=end-diastolic LV volume and ESV=end-systolic LV volume.&#xD;
      From these data, we also derived values for the assessment of cardiac output (CO =SV x HR),&#xD;
      subsequent systemic vascular resistance (SVR =MAP x 80/CO), (mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure=MAP, HR=heart rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVC measurements include its maximum diameter at the end of expiration (dIVCmax), IVCCI&#xD;
      during spontaneous, quiet, breathing, [(IVC maximal diameter - IVC minimal diameter)/IVC&#xD;
      maximal diameter] and the ratio (R) of dIVCmax-to-IVCCI; the IVC diameters is measured in the&#xD;
      long axis of the IVC and just proximal to the entry of the hepatic veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic protocol and measurements. Spinal anesthesia is introduced with a single&#xD;
      intrathecal injection of 12 to 18 mg (average15 mg plain ropivacaine, 0.75% solution) using a&#xD;
      22 or 25-gauge needle (pencil-point) with the patient in the lateral position. Intraoperative&#xD;
      ECG, SPO2 and invasive arterial blood pressure (through an indwelling radial artery catheter)&#xD;
      monitoring is used. Patients who are experiencing a MAP less than or equal to 65 mmHg, or&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 25% reduction of its baseline preoperative value were considered&#xD;
      hypotensive (duration of low MAP: 30sec, time-period: from spinal anesthesia induction to the&#xD;
      end of surgery). Arterial hypotension related to blood transfusion for any reason is not&#xD;
      considered in our statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:A pilot study of 22 patients revealed a detected area under the ROC curve (AUC)&#xD;
      of 0.89 for dIVCmax-to-IVCCI, and for IVCCI 0.74, with rank correlation between the two&#xD;
      assays being 0.88 in positive and 0.62 in negative cases. Based on this result, a sample of&#xD;
      40 patients will be required to achieve a power of 80% in order to detect significant&#xD;
      difference (at a level 0.05) between dIVCmax-to-IVCCI ratio and IVCCI (MedCalc Software,&#xD;
      Mariakerke, Belgium). Quantitative variables and proportions are compared with the student&#xD;
      t-test or Mann-Whitney and chi-square tests, respectively. Normality is tested by using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov- Smirnov test. We will assess the area under the receiver operator characteristic&#xD;
      curve (AUC-ROC) to evaluate the diagnostic performance of echocardiographic parameters in&#xD;
      identifying patients who experience spinal-induced hypotension. The grey zone estimation&#xD;
      between two cut-off points will be used for clinical utility reasons.&#xD;
