    <textblock>
      Futura Medical Developments Ltd (FMD) are developing a gel formulation of GTN (MED2005) as a&#xD;
      topical treatment for ED delivered using DermaSys®, a versatile and bespoke technology.&#xD;
      Treatment requires the application of a small quantity of gel (approx 300 mg), containing a&#xD;
      fixed dose of GTN, to the glans of the penis. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      indicate rapid absorption of the drug and low systemic exposure, reducing the risk of adverse&#xD;
      events (such as headache) commonly associated with GTN therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate similar or lower bioavailability of GTN from&#xD;
      MED2005 (test IMP) with that from Nitrostat (reference IMP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two parts (Part 1 and 2). Part 1 will be conducted in 30&#xD;
      subjects and Part 2 will be conducted in 10 subjects. Part 1 will compose of a pre-study&#xD;
      screen, followed by six treatment periods and a post-study follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will compose of a pre-study screen, followed by two treatment periods and a post-study&#xD;
      follow-up. Subjects can only participate in either Part 1 or 2 of the study (not both).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GTN is a well-established vasodilatory therapeutic agent with a long, documented history of&#xD;
      use and comprehensive safety profile. In Europe, licensed indications for GTN include the&#xD;
      treatment and prophylaxis of angina pectoris and the relief of pain associated with chronic&#xD;
      anal fissure. Other indications for prescription only parenteral products include use during&#xD;
      cardiac surgery and for emergency reduction of blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GTN's vasodilatory action is thought to result from the release of nitric oxide (NO) in&#xD;
      vascular smooth muscle. NO stimulates guanylate cyclase, the enzyme responsible for&#xD;
      production of cGMP, whose action is to lower intracellular calcium resulting in smooth muscle&#xD;
      relaxation and vasodilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of erectile dysfunction, GTN works locally by penetrating the glans/penile skin&#xD;
      and directly targeting penile blood vessels. Nitrates appear to have a direct, local effect&#xD;
      on penile haemodynamics. The most likely mechanism for the erectile effect of nitrates&#xD;
      involves nitrate induced dilation of the cavernous and helicine arteries, thereby increasing&#xD;
      blood flow to the lacunar spaces, coupled with nitrate-induced relaxation of trabecular&#xD;
      smooth muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitroglycerin (Nitrostat) is indicated for the acute relief of an attack or acute prophylaxis&#xD;
      of angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal pharmacological action of nitroglycerin is relaxation of vascular smooth&#xD;
      muscle. Although venous effects predominate, nitroglycerin produces, in a dose-related&#xD;
      manner, dilation of both arterial and venous beds. Dilation of postcapillary vessels,&#xD;
      including large veins, promotes peripheral pooling of blood, decreases venous return to the&#xD;
      heart, and reduces left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (preload). Nitroglycerin also&#xD;
      produces arteriolar relaxation, thereby reducing peripheral vascular resistance and arterial&#xD;
      pressure (afterload), and dilates large epicardial coronary arteries; however, the extent to&#xD;
      which this latter effect contributes to the relief of exertional angina is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitroglycerin forms free radical nitric oxide (NO) which activates guanylate cyclase,&#xD;
      resulting in an increase of guanosine 3'5' monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in smooth muscle and&#xD;
      other tissues. These events lead to dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which regulate&#xD;
      the contractile state in smooth muscle, and result in vasodilatation.&#xD;
