    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody combined&#xD;
      with apatinib mesylate in patients with unresectable, local advanced recurrent or metastatic&#xD;
      serum AFP-elevated gastric adenocarcinoma, who have at least received first-line antitumor&#xD;
      therapy or whose standard treatment is intolerable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AFP-elevated gastric adenocarcinoma is a special type of gastric cancer, with the&#xD;
      characteristics of high risk of liver and lymph node metastasis, poor therapeutic effect, and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of PD-1 antibody combined with apatinib mesylate in patients&#xD;
      with unresectable, local advanced recurrent or metastatic serum AFP-elevated gastric&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, who have at least received first-line antitumor therapy or whose standard&#xD;
      treatment is intolerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AFP elevation is defined as serum AFP &gt; 20 ng/ml. In this prospective study, the objective&#xD;
      remission rate (ORR) will be used as primary outcome measures and 30 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited. PD-1 antibody combined with apatinib mesylate will be administered. PD-L1&#xD;
      expression and TMB will be measured before treatment. In addition, the dynamic changes of&#xD;
      serum AFP levels, T lymphocyte in peripheral blood will be monitored before each treatment&#xD;
      cycle. In the course of treatment, safety evaluation will be carried out according to the&#xD;
      standard of adverse reaction classification (CTCAE) 4.0.&#xD;
