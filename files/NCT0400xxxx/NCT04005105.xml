      BACKGROUND: The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery&#xD;
      can reach 35% and between 2 and 5% require kidney replacement therapy during the AKI episode.&#xD;
      The development of AKI n this context is independently associated with higher long-term&#xD;
      mortality (5-10 years). In addition, there is strong evidence that an episode of AKI in the&#xD;
      hospital increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the medium-long term. On&#xD;
      the other hand, once AKI has been recovered according to creatinine values, there are no&#xD;
      established biomarkers to predict patients at risk of progression to chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
      which will allow us to increase nephroprotection and surveillance measures in this group of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Open-label randomized unicentric prospective study of patients undergoing&#xD;
      valvular replacement heart surgery ± coronary bypass with acute kidney injury (AKI) risk &gt;30%&#xD;
      according to the Leicester Cardiosurgery scale. Patients will be randomized 1:1 in two&#xD;
      groups: standard hemodynamic management or intensive hemodynamic management based on&#xD;
      premorbid mean perfusion pressure (MPP). The interventional period will span from&#xD;
      intra-operation until the first 24 hours postoperative. The incidence of AKI will be&#xD;
      evaluated according to KDIGO criteria between 48 hours and 7 days after surgery. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for one year. Biomarkers of mitochondrial damage will be analyzed at various&#xD;
      points during the follow-up to patients presenting AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Group 1/Intensive management: Intra-surgical values of ± 25% basal MAP will be maintained&#xD;
      and once in the ICU an algorithm corresponding to group 1 based on cardiac index and ± 25%&#xD;
      MPP will be followed for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Group 2/Standard management: MAP during surgery will be maintained &gt; 60 mmHg according to&#xD;
      usual protocol. Once in ICU, during the first 24 hours an algorithm corresponding to group 2&#xD;
      based on cardiac index, MAP and CVP will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarkers of mitochondrial damage will be determined in urine in patients in both groups&#xD;
      only in patients developing AKI according to KDIGO guidelines between 48h and 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS:A 50% reduction in the incidence of AKI in the intervention group compared&#xD;
      to the control group is expected. At the same time, markers of mitochondrial damage are&#xD;
      expected to be validated in our cohort as biomarkers of AKI progression and to investigate&#xD;
      its usefulness as biomarkers of transition to Chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery can reach&#xD;
      35% and between 2 and 5% require kidney replacement therapy during the AKI episode. The&#xD;
      development of AKI n this context is independently associated with higher long-term mortality&#xD;
      (5-10 years). In addition, there is strong evidence that an episode of AKI in the hospital&#xD;
      increases the risk of developing chronic kidney disease in the medium-long term. That is why&#xD;
      the prevention of AKI is essential to reduce the morbidity that these patients suffer in the&#xD;
      hospital and out-of-hospital environment. On the other hand, once AKI has been recovered&#xD;
      according to creatinine values, there are no established biomarkers to predict patients at&#xD;
      risk of progression to chronic kidney disease, which will allow us to increase&#xD;
      nephroprotection and surveillance measures in this group of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label randomized unicentric prospective study of patients undergoing valvular&#xD;
      replacement heart surgery ± coronary bypass with acute kidney injury (AKI) risk &gt;30%&#xD;
      according to the Leicester Cardiosurgery scale. Patients will be randomized 1:1 in two&#xD;
      groups: standard hemodynamic management or intensive hemodynamic management based on&#xD;
      premorbid mean perfusion pressure (MPP). The interventional period will span from&#xD;
      intra-operation until the first 24 hours postoperative. The incidence of AKI will be&#xD;
      evaluated according to KDIGO criteria between 48 hours and 7 days after surgery. Patients&#xD;
      will be followed for one year. Biomarkers of mitochondrial damage will be analyzed at various&#xD;
      points during the follow-up to patients presenting AKI. Intention to treat population will be&#xD;
      defined as patients who sign informed consent and undergo planned surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS-ANALYSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Group 1/Intensive management: Baseline mean blood pressure (MAP) and central venous&#xD;
      pressure (CVP) will be measured to calculate baseline mean perfusion pressure (MPP).&#xD;
      Intra-surgical values of ± 25% basal MAP will be maintained and once in the ICU an algorithm&#xD;
      corresponding to group 1 based on cardiac index and ± 25% MPP will be followed for 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Group 2/Standard management: MAP during surgery will be maintained &gt; 60 mmHg according to&#xD;
      usual protocol. Once in ICU, during the first 24 hours an algorithm corresponding to group 2&#xD;
      based on cardiac index, MAP and CVP will be followed. Biomarkers of mitochondrial damage will&#xD;
      be determined in urine in patients in both groups only in patients developing AKI according&#xD;
      to KDIGO guidelines between 48h and 7 days. The following variables will be assessed in both&#xD;
      groups: accumulated fluid balance in first 24 hours, ICU /hospitalization length of stay,&#xD;
      days with vasoactive support, MAKE (Major Adverse Kidney Events: mortality, need for renal&#xD;
      replacement therapy, persistent renal dysfunction) at 30, 90 and 365 days and other AKI&#xD;
      episodes at one year. In the patients who develop AKI, urinary markers of mitochondrial&#xD;
      injury will also be measured at 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 50% reduction in the incidence of AKI in the intervention group compared to the control&#xD;
      group is expected. At the same time, markers of mitochondrial damage are expected to be&#xD;
      validated in our cohort as biomarkers of AKI progression and to investigate its usefulness as&#xD;
      biomarkers of transition to Chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
