    <textblock>
      The investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of custom-made 3D-printed ceramic&#xD;
      (tooth-colored) brackets (braces) compared to conventional tooth-colored brackets (braces).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be expected to come in for regularly scheduled appointments. They will be&#xD;
      treated with tooth-colored braces and will need to come in every 4-6 weeks and will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of three groups. &quot;Randomly&quot; means by chance, like a coin toss.&#xD;
      Neither participants nor the researchers may choose group assignments. Group 1 patients will&#xD;
      have tooth-colored braces placed directly on each tooth by the clinician. Group 2 patients&#xD;
      will have the braces placed on the teeth by using trays to fit them on. Group 3 patients will&#xD;
      have customized 3D printed tooth-colored braces placed on their teeth, using trays to fit&#xD;
      them on. If a participant is selected to be part of group 3, it may take up to two additional&#xD;
      weeks for these 3D brackets to be printed and shipped and so this might delay treatment&#xD;
      onset. Information on gender, age, and medical history of participants will also be obtained&#xD;
      from the electronic health record.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Teeth and orthodontic treatment plans are very unique to the specific patient, yet standard&#xD;
      orthodontic braces are currently &quot;one-size fits all&quot;. In the early 20th century, orthodontics&#xD;
      was practiced using non-programmed brackets. First, second and third order bends had to be&#xD;
      incorporated into the wire in order to achieve ideal final tooth positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Andrews' Straight Wire Appliance (SWA) in the 1970s, however, revolutionized orthodontic care&#xD;
      by presenting a standard set of brackets with pre-programmed prescriptions built into the&#xD;
      appliance system [5-7]. According to Andrews, &quot;it is far easier to control tooth movement&#xD;
      with bracket placement than bending wires&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Andrews analyzed 120 patient cases which presented with what he described as an ideal&#xD;
      occlusion. He documented common characteristics in regard to angulation, tip, and torque&#xD;
      subjectively deemed to create an ideal occlusion. This allowed him to develop a bracket&#xD;
      prescription to compensate for the disparity in the contour of the facial surfaces of teeth&#xD;
      by increasing thickness of the bracket base. Furthermore, he introduced angulations within&#xD;
      the bracket slot to achieve proper positioning of the roots [5, 8]. This &quot;straight-wire&#xD;
      appliance&quot; (SWA) method became widely accepted in orthodontics, and numerous variations of&#xD;
      pre-adjusted bracket systems have since been introduced. Pre-adjusted brackets, however, fail&#xD;
      to address deviations from average tooth morphology and other treatment nuances. These are&#xD;
      often tackled chairside by placing bends on arch wires [9-12] - bends that the SWA method was&#xD;
      invented to prevent. Additionally, mechanical boundaries and imprecision of bracket placement&#xD;
      can result in limitations to treatment. [13-15] All these inaccuracies may cumulate during&#xD;
      the course of a treatment to increase treatment time, resulting in frustration and&#xD;
      compromised results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technological advancements have allowed for some customization of brackets and wires in order&#xD;
      to address limitations of conventional pre-adjusted bracket systems. Digital intra-oral scans&#xD;
      are obtained at the onset of treatment to generate a digital study model of the dentition.&#xD;
      Virtual models are analyzed to determine the ideal position of each tooth required for&#xD;
      achieving stable occlusion. Those digital models also allow for bracket positioning set-up;&#xD;
      indirect-bonding transfer jigs allow virtual positioning to be replicated intra-orally. The&#xD;
      clinician creates a virtual design of the final occlusion and alignment using&#xD;
      computer-assisted technology, with reverse-engineered brackets and archwires used to obtain&#xD;
      the intended result. Bracket slots are customized to accommodate a straight wire that moves&#xD;
      each tooth to the ideal final position as identified by the virtual setup. Virtual bracket&#xD;
      positions are then transferred to the patient by means of indirect-bonding transfer jigs&#xD;
      [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several orthodontic systems implement some of these new technologies, [17] providing the&#xD;
      orthodontist with a treatment package consisting of digital diagnostics, 3-dimensional (3D)&#xD;
      digital planning, and computer-designed customized brackets and arch wires. One such system&#xD;
      is the Insignia (ORMCO Corporation) system [18], which entered the market several years ago.&#xD;
      Theoretically, individualized orthodontic treatment systems offer several advantages for both&#xD;
      the patient and orthodontist, with commonly mentioned benefits including better treatment&#xD;
      results, shorter treatment duration, and less chair time. [19] Manufacturers utilizing&#xD;
      virtual treatment planning and customized, computer-aided fabrication of tooth supported&#xD;
      orthodontic appliances claim to deliver superior quality and efficiency of care compared to&#xD;
      conventional preadjusted bracket systems. To date, few studies have investigated the accuracy&#xD;
      of these systems in achieving their virtually planned tooth positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2015 retrospective study [20] reported that a Computer-aided design/computer-aided&#xD;
      manufacturing (CAD/CAM) orthodontic bracket system (Insignia Â®) produced similar treatment&#xD;
      outcomes compared with direct and indirect bonded appliances. The CAD/CAM group nonetheless&#xD;
      had shorter treatment times than the direct and indirect bonded groups. To our knowledge,&#xD;
      only one prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) [21] has explored the advantage or&#xD;
      otherwise of partially customized appliances with precise placement over directly or&#xD;
      indirectly bonded stock brackets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-referenced RCT [21] concluded that &quot;compared to the non-customized system, the&#xD;
      customized orthodontic system was not associated with any significant reduction in treatment&#xD;
      duration, and the treatment outcomes were comparable with both systems. Treatment duration&#xD;
      and quality were affected by the orthodontist and the severity of malocclusion at the start&#xD;
      of treatment rather than by the orthodontic system used. Treatment with a customized&#xD;
      appliance, such as the one used in this trial, required significantly more planning time from&#xD;
      the orthodontist and was associated with a higher number of visits due to loose brackets.&quot;&#xD;
      This study, however, introduced significant variability between the two test groups by using&#xD;
      two different bonding techniques. As a result, their conclusions could be flawed. Beyond&#xD;
      this, the customized brackets they used did not include customization of the bracket base to&#xD;
      conform to tooth anatomy. This is important because bracket base-tooth surface discrepancies&#xD;
      can lead to inaccuracies in the final in-out position of the tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to recent breakthroughs in the area of 3D printing in dentistry - precisely, additive&#xD;
      manufacturing (AM) - and the limitations of previous studies (lack of&#xD;
      randomization/appropriate control for potential confounders), the need arises to evaluate if&#xD;
      3D-printed ceramic brackets offer any superiority to traditional ceramic braces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimizing errors and improving accuracy are important factors not only for patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, but also for preventing adverse effects such as root resorption that occur when&#xD;
      unwanted tooth movements occur [22]. Different strategies have been designed for this&#xD;
      purpose, foremost among which has been to enhance treatment outcomes by precisely planning&#xD;
      tooth movements and positioning brackets with greater accuracy. Since the early stages of&#xD;
      multi-bracket appliance development, it was clear that precise bracket placement is key to&#xD;
      the success of the straight-wire concept [10]. One author stated that it is impossible to&#xD;
      solve the problem of adapting a bracket to a patient's specific tooth and to individualize&#xD;
      treatment goals without individualizing at least one bracket component and that new additive&#xD;
      manufacturing (AM) options can provide the catalyst for future developments in this field&#xD;
      [23]. Treatment with computer-designed customized brackets has the potential to personalize&#xD;
      orthodontic care, but the benefits remain to be validated. The present randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial aims to compare orthodontic treatment effectiveness in a customized versus&#xD;
      non-customized ceramic orthodontic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Innovation The 3D ceramic bracket being investigated is the only available customized&#xD;
      ceramic bracket. This will be a first for the orthodontic speciality. This will also be the&#xD;
      first and only customized bracket system that includes customization of the bracket base.&#xD;
      This helps in the control of first order orthodontic movements and allows brackets to be&#xD;
      bonded on any labial surface of the tooth while maintaining an ideal prescription. As 3D&#xD;
      printing is not limited by the mold-ejection in CIM (ceramic injection molding) [24] the&#xD;
      bracket system being tested here has the potential to achieve a more accurate slot dimension.&#xD;
      This is important because a critical factor affecting the expression of a bracket&#xD;
      prescription is the accuracy of the bracket slot. Various orthodontic textbooks have defined&#xD;
      expectations for bracket slot accuracy. In Contemporary Orthodontics, Proffitt et al. [25]&#xD;
      stated that the precision of orthodontic bracket manufacturing should render slot dimension&#xD;
      accuracy of at least 1 mil to ensure accurate expression of a chosen prescription. Oversized&#xD;
      slots (due to manufacturing limitations) defeat the premise of prescription orthodontic&#xD;
      brackets as the larger slot size does not allow for complete prescription expression [26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Design This will be a parallel-arm randomized controlled clinical trial that involves 3&#xD;
      treatment groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1.1 Treatment groups Treatment group 1: Patients in this group will be treated with&#xD;
      directly-bonded traditional (stock) .018 ceramic brackets Treatment group 2: Patients will be&#xD;
      treated with the same brackets from treatment group 1 but using the indirect bonding (IDB)&#xD;
      technique Treatment group 3: Patients will be treated using indirectly bonded fully&#xD;
      customized 3D-printed ceramic brackets. All participating clinicians will be trained in&#xD;
      digital orthodontics, and the IDB technique through hands-on sessions by orthodontists who&#xD;
      are experienced in the use of IDB and digital set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Direct bonding is the traditional way of placing orthodontic brackets, in which orthodontists&#xD;
      clinically eyeball the tooth and place the bracket where they deem most appropriate.&#xD;
      Traditionally, indirect bonding, starts with creating a mold of all the teeth as an exact&#xD;
      replica of the mouth of the patient. From there, in the lab, the orthodontist positions each&#xD;
      bracket precisely where it should go on each tooth and then creates a custom tray that allows&#xD;
      transfer of the brackets from the lab model to the patient's teeth. By taking the time to&#xD;
      place the brackets in a proper position on the lab model, orthodontists eliminate the&#xD;
      inaccurate process of placing orthodontic brackets directly on the teeth. It theoretically&#xD;
      also takes less chairside time and is more comfortable for the patient. It is however more&#xD;
      technique sensitive. In this study, indirect bonding setup will be done virtually using&#xD;
      commonly-available orthodontic software. The trays/jigs will then be 3-D printed.&#xD;
