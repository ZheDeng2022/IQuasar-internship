  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in adults continues to be characterized&#xD;
      by increased development of resistant virus, increased transmission of resistant virus and&#xD;
      issues associated with the long-term toxicity of anti-retroviral therapy (ART), despite&#xD;
      advances in development of new ART, which provides extensive insight in management of&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals. Cabotegravir (CAB) is a potent integrase inhibitor (INI) and&#xD;
      rilpivirine (RPV) is a potent non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI). A&#xD;
      two-drug regimen (DR)with CAB plus RPV long acting (LA) product offers many potential&#xD;
      advantages over daily oral regimens including better tolerability, improved compliance,&#xD;
      adherence, less likely to develop resistance, and overall treatment satisfaction in&#xD;
      virologically suppressed subjects. This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter, short term&#xD;
      facilitation study to evaluate the effect of an implementation strategy on the degree of&#xD;
      acceptability, appropriateness, feasibility, fidelity and sustainability of clinical&#xD;
      practices to deliver the CAB+RPV LA regimen to HIV infected subjects and to also measure&#xD;
      subject satisfaction by recording timeliness of visits, length of visit and their education.&#xD;
      Approximately 135 subjects will be enrolled in the study and the total duration of the study&#xD;
      will be approximately 52-weeks.&#xD;
