    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study will be to evaluate and compare the effect of a single 30-minute&#xD;
      bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise to the effect of three 10-minute pre-prandial&#xD;
      bouts of energy-matched and volume-matched aerobic exercise on 2-hr post prandial and fasting&#xD;
      blood sugar levels, in a sample of type 2 diabetes patients, aged 30-65 years, living in&#xD;
      Barbados&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three bouts of pre-prandial moderate intensity aerobic exercise will result in lower post&#xD;
      prandial blood sugar levels when compared to the single bout of moderate intensity aerobic&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The three bouts of pre-prandial moderate intensity aerobic exercise will result in lower&#xD;
      fasting blood sugar levels on the morning following the exercise intervention when compared&#xD;
      to the single bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the background that there is increasing evidence that breaking up sedentary time with&#xD;
      physical activity may be potentially associated with improved blood glucose levels (Francois&#xD;
      et al., (2014) &amp; van Dijk et al., (2013), this study aims to investigate and compare the&#xD;
      effect of a single 30-minute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise to the effect of&#xD;
      three 10-minute pre-prandial bouts of energy-matched and volume-matched aerobic exercise on&#xD;
      2-hr post prandial and fasting blood sugar levels in a sample of type 2 diabetes patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different from previous studies, this research seeks to evaluate these effects in a Black&#xD;
      Caribbean population, in a type 2 diabetes population on medication including insulin and&#xD;
      also seeks to evaluate if either exercise regimen is indeed palatable to the target&#xD;
      population by evaluating treatment acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a crossover randomized controlled study. There will be two&#xD;
      intervention groups - a single 30-minute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise before&#xD;
      breakfast and three (3) 10-minute bouts of moderate intensity aerobic activity before&#xD;
      breakfast, lunch and dinner. The primary outcome measure will be 2-hr post prandial blood&#xD;
      sugar levels and fasting blood sugar levels on the day following the intervention. Neither&#xD;
      subject nor investigator will be blinded to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will include patients with a documented diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, that is a&#xD;
      documented HbA1C ≥ 6.5%. Baseline data will include body mass and body composition and will&#xD;
      be measured using the bioelectrical impedance technique (Tanita scale). Waist circumference&#xD;
      will be assessed using a Gulick tape measure. Baseline sedentary behaviour and physical&#xD;
      activity level will be assessed using the validated International Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited subjects will be asked to complete two exercise interventions separated by a&#xD;
      one-week washout period: 1) a single 30-minute bout of moderate intensity aerobic exercise&#xD;
      before breakfast and 2) three (3) 10-minute bouts of moderate intensity aerobic activity&#xD;
      before breakfast, lunch and dinner. Each subject will be randomized to one of two treatment&#xD;
      sequences: single bout followed by multiple bouts (S-M) or multiple bouts followed by single&#xD;
      bout (M-S). The randomization will be done using online statistical computing web programming&#xD;
      (www.randomization.com) to generate a randomization schedule with balanced permutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timing between exercise completion and commencement of meal intake will be approximately 15&#xD;
      minutes. A heart rate reserve range of 40-59% will be used to define moderate intensity.&#xD;
      Heart rate will be measured using a validated Polar heart rate monitor. Rate of perceived&#xD;
      exertion will be a secondary measure of exercise intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-hour (2hr) post prandial blood sugar levels and fasting blood sugar levels on the day&#xD;
      following the exercise intervention will be measured using a validated capillary blood&#xD;
      glucose meter. Blood pressure will also be measured at the same times that blood glucose&#xD;
      values are taken using a validated automated blood pressure machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized meals of fixed nutrient content and individualized to the subject's calculated&#xD;
      estimated daily caloric requirements will be provided to subjects on the day of the exercise&#xD;
      interventions. Treatment acceptability will be assessed following each exercise intervention&#xD;
      using an expert-designed questionnaire that will be piloted in this study.&#xD;
