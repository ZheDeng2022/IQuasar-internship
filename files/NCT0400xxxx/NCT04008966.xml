  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All participants started with a combination of recombinant FSH 300 U and urinary Gn 150 U&#xD;
      from the 2nd day of the cycle then the dose was adjusted according to the ovarian response&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 6 of the cycle, follow up using transvaginal ultrasound was done either daily or on&#xD;
      alternate days according to the ovarian response. When the leading follicle reached 12 mm,&#xD;
      GnRH antagonist was started using Cetrotide 0.25 subcutaneously daily till the day of&#xD;
      triggering. Triggering was done when at least 3 follicles larger than 14 mm and at least one&#xD;
      of them reached a mean diameter of 17 mm or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the day of triggering, women were randomized into 2 groups. Group I (single trigger group)&#xD;
      that included 80 women who received triggering in the form of 10,000 IU of HCG intramuscular&#xD;
      injection. Group II (Dual trigger group) that included 80 women who received triggering in&#xD;
      the form of 10,000 IU of HCG intramuscular injection in addition to GnRH agonist triptorelin&#xD;
      0.2 mg subcutaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ovum pickup was done 34 hours after triggering under the guidance of transvaginal ultrasound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ISM1 culture medium was used for oocyte collection and embryo culture. Transabdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound guided embryo transfer was done 3 days after oocyte retrieval using Labotect&#xD;
      semirigid catheter by the same expert operator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycle cancellation was done if day 9 folliculometry revealed less than 2 mature follicles, no&#xD;
      oocytes were retrieved or if fertilization failed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luteal phase support was started in all women on the day of oocyte retrieval and continued&#xD;
      till the day of serum β-hCG assessment (done 14 days after ET) through administration of 400&#xD;
      mg of natural Progesterone twice daily per vagina . In women with +ve serum β-hCG (&gt; 5&#xD;
      mIU/ml), transvaginal ultrasound evaluation was done 4 weeks after ET to confirm the presence&#xD;
      and number of intrauterine gestational sacs.&#xD;

      from the 2nd day of the cycle then the dose was adjusted according to the ovarian response&#xD;
      evaluated by transvaginal ultrasound and serum E2. Delayed start&#xD;
&#xD;
      From day 6 of the cycle, follow up using transvaginal ultrasound was done either daily or on&#xD;
      alternate days according to the ovarian response. Ultrasound follow up reported number and&#xD;
      size of follicles in each ovary and the endometrial thickness and pattern. When the leading&#xD;
      follicle reached 12 mm, GnRH antagonist was started using Cetrotide 0.25 subcutaneously daily&#xD;
      till the day of triggering. Triggering was done when at least 3 follicles larger than 14 mm&#xD;
