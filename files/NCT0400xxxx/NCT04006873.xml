  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Cystic Fibrosis (CF) have problems digesting their food properly. More than 8 in&#xD;
      10 people with CF must take medication to assist their digestion. In spite of this,&#xD;
      complications such as bowel blockage occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finding out how already licenced drugs for CF work in the gut is the first step in&#xD;
      repurposing medications. Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor with Ivacaftor is a drug combination which&#xD;
      corrects the basic defect in CF an has shown improvements on lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, whether Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor with Ivacaftor has an effect on&#xD;
      improving gastrointestinal problems in CF.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a small pilot study to compare the effects of active drug (Tezacaftor/Ivacaftor with&#xD;
      Ivacaftor) on the gut in people with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomised to take active drug or matched placebo for 28 days then&#xD;
      switch to the alternate drug after a 28 day washout period. Before participants commence&#xD;
      treatment, they will have blood pressure and baseline blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will attend once per treatment period for MRI scanning at the Sir Peter&#xD;
      Mansfield Imaging Centre, after an overnight fast. On this day, participants will be asked to&#xD;
      withhold any medicines directly altering bowel habit such as laxatives. They will continue to&#xD;
      take pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy and other medications for CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators will use the same MRI protocol as described in GIFT-CF (NCT03566550).&#xD;
      Participants will have their first MRI scan fasted. After the first scan, they will eat a&#xD;
      first standardised meal . They will then have 7 MRI scans at half hourly intervals and 3 MRI&#xD;
      scans at hourly intervals. Participants will be given a second standardised meal after their&#xD;
      ninth MRI scan. Each MRI scan will last approximately 15 minutes. After each MRI scan,&#xD;
      participants will complete a validated gastrointestinal symptom questionnaire&#xD;
      (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale). In between scans, participants will have access to&#xD;
      an adjacent room with Wifi and television access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the day, participants will have their lung function, blood pressure and blood tests&#xD;
      taken. They will also provide a sputum and stool sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection control requirements mean that only 1 participant will attend for MRI scanning per&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Amendment to study due to COVID-19*** From mid-March 2020, all face to face clinical&#xD;
      research in the UK has been suspended (apart from studies directly related to the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic). Patients in the GIFT-CF 2 trial who had not yet completed the full trial protocol&#xD;
      were therefore unable to continue. Funding for SymkeviTM (tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)&#xD;
      in the UK was announced at the end of 2019 and some of the trial participants, who have not&#xD;
      completed GIFT-CF 2, may be prescribed SymkeviTM by their CF team. It will therefore not be&#xD;
      possible for them to complete the placebo controlled cross-over trial, once COVID&#xD;
      restrictions are eased. We plan to mitigate the effects of COVID-related disruption by&#xD;
      ensuring all trial participants have had the full, protocol-defined, scan sequence both on&#xD;
      and off SymkeviTM. When restrictions are eased, we will invite participants who have been&#xD;
      prescribed SymkeviTM by their CF centre to attend for scanning, if they have not previously&#xD;
      had an &quot;on treatment&quot; scan. We will follow the same scanning protocol. We will ensure that&#xD;
      adherence to SymkeviTM is good and they have received at least 21 days of treatment (as&#xD;
      specified in the trial protocol). Our primary analysis will be on the patients who completed&#xD;
      the trial per protocol but we will present a secondary analysis on all 12 patients, comparing&#xD;
      outcome measures on SymkeviTM with their outcome measures previously recorded at baseline&#xD;
      (off treatment). The personnel interpreting the MRI scans will be blind to whether they were&#xD;
      performed on or off SymkeviTM - reducing the probability of observer bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Post hoc analysis*** For participants who are invited for an open-label &quot;on treatment&quot; MRI&#xD;
      scan day, the statistical analysis will involve a comparison between their pre-treatment MRI&#xD;
      scans and the open-label scan. The researcher analysing the images will remain blinded.&#xD;
      Statistical analysis for these participants will be a comparison between their pre-treatment&#xD;
      scan and open-label on-treatment scan. Motility outcomes will not be analysed as the specific&#xD;
      MR sequencing was adapted to focus on the terminal ileum in the cross-over trial, whilst in&#xD;
      the pre-treatment scans, the motility was across the whole small bowel.&#xD;
