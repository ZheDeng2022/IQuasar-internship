  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose iRADIOMICS, a highly innovative and potentially clinical practice changing tool,&#xD;
      which will allow for better management of patients undergoing immunotherapy. iRADIOMICS is&#xD;
      based on in-depth interrogation of the molecular imaging (FDG PET/CT) data, extracting&#xD;
      &quot;invisible&quot; information based on physical description of the imaging information. Based on&#xD;
      the promising preliminary results of our pilot study, we hypothesise that radiomics analyses&#xD;
      of FDG PET/CT scans of patients treated with immunotherapy (iRADIOMICS) can better predict&#xD;
      response to immunotherapy compared to the current standards (iRC). iRADIOMICS will be&#xD;
      assessed in a prospective clinical study, involving 30 patients with metastatic&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer, treated with anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD1) antibodies.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo FDG PET/CT before the administration of anti-PD-1, at 1 month and 4&#xD;
      months after the administration. Afterwards, the patients will be imaged with FDG PET/CT&#xD;
      every 6 months. Additionally, the patients will undergo diagnostic CT scan every 3 months to&#xD;
      allow for comparison to the current standard (irRC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesise that molecular imaging-based RADIOMICS analysis of FDG PET/CT data (termed&#xD;
      iRADIOMICS) provides more information than standard anatomical imaging-based irRC analysis&#xD;
      regarding the assessment of the effectiveness of immunotherapy and will have a stronger&#xD;
      predictive power. It is widely accepted that molecular imaging (e.g. PET/CT) reflects changes&#xD;
      in tissues much sooner than anatomical imaging (CT, MRI). Therefore, we expect that an&#xD;
      immunotherapy assessment tool based on FDG PET/CT should outperform anatomical-imaging-based&#xD;
      irRC also timewise. Although we do expect an initial increase in FDG PET uptake (mainly due&#xD;
      to the metabolic activity of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)), followed by a late&#xD;
      decrease, we argue that the predictive power of FDG PET can be even further increased by&#xD;
      including an in-depth analysis of additional imaging features - the aforementioned &quot;radiomics&#xD;
      texture features&quot;. Many studies across different types of cancer have found a correlation&#xD;
      between the presence of TILs and patient survival. Therefore we expect that iRADIOMICS&#xD;
      signature of responders will be different from the irRADIOMICS signature of non-responders to&#xD;
      antiPD1 immunotherapy due to the different levels of TILs infiltration, different TILs&#xD;
      spatial distribution within the tumour, and different composition of immunosuppressive tumour&#xD;
      microenvironment containing different levels and spatial distribution of various&#xD;
      immunosuppressive cells, such as myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSC), regulatory T cells&#xD;
      (Treg), tumour-associated macrophages (TAM), regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg) and others&#xD;
      30. Thus we anticipate that it might be possible to assess the response to immunotherapy at&#xD;
      just one imaging time-point, preferably already in the pseudo-progression phase, thus much&#xD;
      earlier than with irRC. Based on the assumption that irRADIOMICS might be able to detect&#xD;
      differences in tumour immunosuppressive microenvironment, we further hypothesise that it&#xD;
      might be also possible to predict, which patients are most likely to benefit from anti-PD1&#xD;
      immunotherapy already before the therapy.&#xD;
