      The goal if the project is to develop a learning health network devoted to the treatment of&#xD;
      first episode psychosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The RAISE ETP study, designed and conducted by our group, signaled that a Coordinated&#xD;
      Specialty Care (CSC) model could be feasibly delivered in community mental health clinics in&#xD;
      multiple states and was effective. Since then, with the support of SAMSHA block grants to&#xD;
      states, there are CSC programs across the nation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is to develop a learning health system with sites providing CSC&#xD;
      treatment of first-episode psychosis (FEP). Sites are drawn from five states: Connecticut,&#xD;
      Florida, Michigan, Oklahoma and South Carolina. They vary in populations served, levels of&#xD;
      funding available and research experience. All are committed to advancing the development of&#xD;
      CSC using a health learning system model, to implementing a practical assessment strategy to&#xD;
      enhance outcome assessment and to conducting research to improve outcomes that will be&#xD;
      meaningful to the full range of stakeholders.&#xD;
