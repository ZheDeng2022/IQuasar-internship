      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability of&#xD;
      JNJ-73763989 in healthy Japanese adult participants following single-dose subcutaneous&#xD;
      administration of 3 different doses of JNJ-73763989, Dose Level 1 (Panel A), Dose Level 2&#xD;
      (Panel B) or Dose Level 3 (Panel C).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be a Japanese participant who has resided outside Japan for no more&#xD;
             than 10 years and whose parents and grandparents are Japanese, as determined by&#xD;
             participant's verbal report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilogram [kg] divided by the&#xD;
             square of height in meters) of 18.0 to 30.0 kilogram per square meter (kg/m^2)&#xD;
             extremes included, and body weight not less than 45.0 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant must be healthy on the basis of physical examination, clinical laboratory&#xD;
             tests, medical history, and vital signs performed at screening. In case of&#xD;
             abnormalities (except for those listed in the exclusion criteria) a participant may be&#xD;
             included after all if the investigator judges the abnormalities not clinically&#xD;
             significant or appropriate and reasonable for the population under study. This&#xD;
             determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and initialed by&#xD;
             the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female participant of childbearing potential must have a negative highly sensitive&#xD;
             serum (beta-human chorionic gonadotropin [beta-hCG]) at screening and a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test on Day -1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A male participant must agree not to donate sperm after enrollment (Day 1) in the&#xD;
             study until at least 90 days after receiving the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with a history of cardiac arrhythmias (for example, premature ventricular&#xD;
             contractions), history of risk factors for Torsade de Pointes syndrome (for example,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participant who is pregnant, breast-feeding, or planning to become pregnant&#xD;
             during the study or within 90 days after receiving the study drug (or longer, if&#xD;
             dictated by local regulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male participants who plan to father a child during the study or within 90 days after&#xD;
             receiving the study drug (or longer, if dictated by local regulation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) or type 2 (HIV-2)&#xD;
             infection (confirmed by antibodies) at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant with current hepatitis A infection (confirmed by hepatitis A antibody&#xD;
             immunoglobulin M [IgM]), or hepatitis B infection (confirmed by Hepatitis B surface&#xD;
             antigen [HBsAg]), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection (confirmed by HCV antibody), or&#xD;
             hepatitis E infection (confirmed by hepatitis E antibody IgM) at screening&#xD;
