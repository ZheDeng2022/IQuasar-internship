      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Most people&#xD;
      with this cancer can be cured. But those who are not cured have a poor prognosis. Researchers&#xD;
      want to add another drug to standard treatment see if it can improve the cure rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To see if the drug acalabrutinib given with rituximab and standard combination chemotherapy&#xD;
      can improve the cure rate of aggressive B-cell lymphomas such as diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with an aggressive B-cell lymphomas that have not been treated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow biopsy: A needle will remove marrow from the participant s hipbone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lumbar puncture: If necessary, a needle will remove fluid from the participant s spinal&#xD;
      canal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the study drug for up to 14 days. It is a pill taken 2 times a day.&#xD;
      Then they will have more scans. They will get rituximab and chemotherapy. They may get these&#xD;
      drugs through a needle in an arm vein. Or they may them through a tube placed in a vein in&#xD;
      their chest or in their neck. They might also keep taking the study drug. Each treatment&#xD;
      cycle lasts 21 days. They will have up to 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have 4 doses of another drug injected into their spinal fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have repeats of the screening tests throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up visit 30 days after their last treatment, then every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gene-expression profiling (GEP) has identified two dominant molecular subtypes, activated B&#xD;
      cell like (ABC) and germinal center B cell like (GCB), that arise by distinct mechanisms,&#xD;
      have distinct prognoses, and respond differently to targeted therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, genetic subtypes of DLBCL have been described within molecular subtypes that have&#xD;
      distinct genotypic, epigenetic, and clinical characteristics providing biologic rationale for&#xD;
      precision medicine strategies in DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frontline treatment of DLBCL is either rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine,&#xD;
      and prednisone (R-CHOP), or infusional rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, etoposide,&#xD;
      vincristine, and prednisone (DA-EPOCH-R) but up to 40% of patients are not cured with&#xD;
      frontline treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bruton s tyrosine kinase (BTK) is a key component of the B-cell receptor (BCR)-signaling&#xD;
      cascade and selective BTK inhibitors have clinical activity preferentially in ABC-DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acalabrutinib is a selective, small molecule, next-generation BTK inhibitor approved for&#xD;
      relapsed mantle cell lymphoma and demonstrated activity in DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The molecular characterization of tumors that respond to DLBCL BTK inhibitors is incomplete;&#xD;
      although responses occur more commonly in ABC-DLBCL, cases of GCB-DLBCL show minor responses,&#xD;
      and no information is available within genetic subtypes of DLBCL&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with minor responses during 2-week window of treatment with acalabrutinib (100mg&#xD;
      BID) as a single agent may benefit from acalabrutinib added to standard combination therapy&#xD;
      as part of frontline therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the response rate, including minor response (MR), to acalabrutinib administered&#xD;
      for 14 days in molecular and genetic subtypes of untreated DLBLC (ABC, GCB, unclassified,&#xD;
      genetic subtypes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically confirmed DLBCL or high-grade B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and CNS involvement excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stages II-IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV negative or positive&#xD;
&#xD;
      Available FFPE or fresh frozen biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label, single center, non-randomized phase 2 study, with enrollment of 100 untreated&#xD;
      DLBCL patients. It is estimated that there may be 50% who are ABC (~50 patients), and 50% who&#xD;
      are GCB or unclassified (~50 patients). The accrual ceiling will be set at 132 to allow for&#xD;
      inevaluable patients and to account for screen fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will start with an initial 2-week window of treatment with acalabrutinib (100mg&#xD;
      BID) as a single agent, with collection and assessment of molecular correlates as well as&#xD;
      response rates (by imaging) by molecular subtype&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with chemoimmunotherapy (R-CHOP or DA-EPOCH-R) either alone or in combination with&#xD;
      acalabrutinib will depend on response during window; those with less than 25% reduction&#xD;
      during window will receive chemoimmunotherapy alone, while those with at least a 25%&#xD;
      reduction in tumor lesions (sum of the products of the longest diameter) will receive&#xD;
      combination therapy of chemoimmunotherapy with acalabrutinib (100mg BID on days 1-10 of each&#xD;
      cycle); those with clinical progression during window will move immediately to&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include integrative genomic analysis of all untreated DLBCL that respond&#xD;
      or are resistant to acalabrutinib for 14 days, event-free survival (EFS), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of combination therapy of acalabrutinib and&#xD;
      chemoimmunotherapy will be assessed&#xD;

                  highly-effective contraception (e.g., hormonal or barrier method of birth&#xD;
                  control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
                  participation, and for at least 2 days after the last dose of acalabrutinib or 12&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of combined chemotherapy, whichever is later. Male&#xD;
                  subjects must use highly effective contraception prior to study entry, for the&#xD;
                  duration of study participation, and for 12 months after the last dose of&#xD;
                  combined chemotherapy; there is no contraception timing requirement post-last&#xD;
                  dose of acalabrutinib alone if male subject does not initiate chemotherapy on&#xD;
                  study after the acalabrutinib window.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants must not be planning to conceive or father children within the&#xD;

                  dose of combined chemotherapy, whichever is later.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability of patient to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any HIV status will be included in this study; status must be confirmed prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who meet histologic criteria for the following subtypes are excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary DLBCL of the central nervous system (PCNSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasmablastic lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  B-cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and&#xD;
                  classical Hodgkin lymphoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who, at the discretion of the investigator, need immediate cytoreductive&#xD;
             chemotherapy such as patients with evidence of spontaneous tumor lysis or impending&#xD;
             organ compromise are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current or prior anti-cancer treatment for DLBCL prior to enrollment. Short course of&#xD;
             corticosteroids (&lt;7 days) for acute issues prior to study enrollment are permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Major surgical procedure within 30 days of first dose of study drug. If a subject had&#xD;
             major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from any toxicity and/or&#xD;
             complications from the intervention before the first dose of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Requires treatment with proton-pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole, esomeprazole,&#xD;
             lansoprazole, dexlansoprazole, rabeprazole or pantoprazole). Subjects receiving&#xD;
             proton-pump inhibitors who switch to H2-receptor antagonists or antacids are eligible&#xD;
             for enrollment to this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Requires treatment with moderate or strong CYP3A inhibitors or inducers&#xD;
&#xD;

             from this study because of potential teratogenic effects associated with&#xD;
             acalabrutinib, R-CHOP, and/or DA-EPOCH-R&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The potential for all study treatments to be excreted in breast milk of nursing&#xD;
             mothers is unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events&#xD;
             in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with acalabrutinib,&#xD;
             breastfeeding must be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        11. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to the following that may&#xD;
        limit interpretation of results or that could increase risk to the patient at the&#xD;
        discretion of the investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;

             (HbcsAg) or hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) positive will need to have a negative&#xD;
             HBV PCR result before enrollment. Those with a positive PCR for hepatitis B are&#xD;
             excluded. Those who are hepatitis B surface antigen (HbcsAg) or hepatitis B core&#xD;
             antibody (HbcAb) positive with a negative PCR for hepatitis B will be treated with&#xD;
             antivirals designed to prevent hepatitis B reactivation (e.g., entecavir) throughout&#xD;
             therapy and for 12 months after therapy and have monitoring for hepatitis B&#xD;
             reactivation with PCR.&#xD;

          -  Diagnosed or treated for malignancy other than DLBCL, except:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Malignancy treated with curative surgical resection and no evidence of active&#xD;
                  disease for 2 years prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer without evidence of disease&#xD;

             screening, or any Class 3 (moderate) or Class 4 (severe) cardiac disease as defined by&#xD;
             the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. Subjects with controlled&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation/flutter during screening are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled autoimmune hemolytic anemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow oral medications, or disease involve that significantly limits&#xD;
