  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines sexual harassment and abuse in and outside sports among adolescent elite&#xD;
      athlete boys and girls, adolescent control students, trainers and leaders at elite sport high&#xD;
      schools and regular high schools in Norway.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the prevalence and outcome of sexual harassment within&#xD;
      and outside sports, including who the perpetrators are, the association between experienced&#xD;
      sexual harassment and psychological health, knowledge of report mechanisms and emergency&#xD;
      plans, and the participants suggestions for preventive strategies. The knowledge from this&#xD;
      study will be a good basis to establish and implement prevention strategies and educational&#xD;
      programs in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students, trainers (with more than 20 % employment status) and leaders at elite sport high&#xD;
      schools and regular high schools in Norway will answer a questionnaire at two measurement&#xD;
      points. Additionally, a sample of randomly selected students who report experiences with&#xD;
      sexual harassment, and a random sample of trainers and leaders, will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in an individual in-depth interview. Students scoring above cut-off on the&#xD;
      questionnaire measuring symptoms of eating disorders (EDE-q) will be invited to a separate&#xD;
      diagnostic interview (EDE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of students will also participate in a test-retest examination of the reliability of&#xD;
      the questionnaire.&#xD;
