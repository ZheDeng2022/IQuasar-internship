      Combination immune checkpoint inhibitor and DNA vaccine will result in clearance of HPV DNA&#xD;

      after treatment with curative intent.&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether combination immune checkpoint inhibitor, alone or together with a DNA&#xD;
      vaccine will result in clearance of HPV biomarkers for patients at risk of disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the time to progression among patients with detectable HPV DNA when treated&#xD;
           with the durvalumab/MEDI0457 versus durvalumab monotherapy versus observation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the toxicity of durvalumab and MEDI0457 in the adjuvant setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether anti-PD-L1 alone or together with an HPV DNA vaccine will enhance&#xD;
           HPV E6/E7-specific and/or mutation-associated neoantigen (MANA)-specific T cell&#xD;
           responses and whether these responses correlate with enhanced clearance of HPV as&#xD;
           measured by DNA in oral rinses and/or plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether anti-PD-L1 alone or together with an HPV DNA vaccine will enhance&#xD;
           HPV 16 E6/E7-specific IgG and whether these responses correlate with enhanced clearance&#xD;
           of HPV as measured by DNA in oral rinses and/or plasma&#xD;
