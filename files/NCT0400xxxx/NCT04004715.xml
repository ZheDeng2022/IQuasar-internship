  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The optimal EAA-containing protein format necessary to maximally stimulate muscle protein&#xD;
      synthesis and optimize whole-body net protein balance during caloric deprivation has not been&#xD;
      determined. This study will address that gap in knowledge by examining post, whole-body&#xD;
      exercise muscle and whole-body protein kinetic responses to ingesting varying EAA-containing&#xD;
      protein formats after a 5 day period of negative energy balance. This study will provide the&#xD;
      initial evidence to support the development of a recovery-based food product for military&#xD;
      combat rations.&#xD;

      Ten resistance-trained adults will complete this ~55-d randomized, cross-over study.&#xD;
      Participants will participate in three, non-consecutive 5-d controlled energy deficit&#xD;
      periods, each separated by a 14-d washout period (i.e., sufficient time to restore nitrogen&#xD;
      and metabolic homeostasis after moderate weight loss). Post-exercise (whole-body exercise&#xD;
      model) muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and whole-body protein turnover responses to varying&#xD;
      EAA-containing protein formats will be determined the morning after completing the 5-d energy&#xD;
      deficit.&#xD;
