  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess patient's quality of life 5 to 10 years after a severe&#xD;
      bacterial infection with hospitalization in a intensive unit care. The population is derived&#xD;
      from the DIABACT III study. The investigators will include every patient still alive. To&#xD;
      evaluate our question, patients and their parents will answer quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;
      The investigators will also have telephone interviews with the parents to know somatic and&#xD;
      psychological effects on their child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will see if quality of life and sequelae differ depending on various&#xD;
      studied factors.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to assess patient's quality of life 5 to 10 years after&#xD;
      hospitalization in intensive car unit for a severe bacterial infection. The population is&#xD;
      derived from DIABACT III study, and includes all patients still alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate their quality of life, patients and parents will answer specific questionnaries.&#xD;
      The Pediatric Quality of Life inventory (PedSQL) has various versions for children depending&#xD;
      on their age, adults and parents. The investigators will get physical, emotional, social and&#xD;
      academic scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess somatic and psychological effect after the severe bacterial infection, the&#xD;
