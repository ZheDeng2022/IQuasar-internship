  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the absence of sensitisation and irritation&#xD;
      potential of a product when applied to the skin and exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.&#xD;
      Photo-sensitisation potential will primarily be evaluated through a subsequent semi-occluded&#xD;
      application and UV exposure (challenge phase) after a 2-week rest period. Photo-irritation&#xD;
      potential will primarily be evaluated through the repeated occluded application and UV&#xD;
      exposure of the study products over 3 weeks (induction phase).&#xD;

      A single-center, randomised, evaluator (single) blind study in healthy adult participants&#xD;
      aged 18 to 65 years with no dermatological disorders to evaluate the cutaneous photo-&#xD;
      irritation and photo-sensitisation potential of three cosmetic facial skincare products.&#xD;
      During Screening (Visit 1), the participants will sign an informed consent, will undergo&#xD;
      dermatological assessment to ensure they have no dermatoses on their dorsum that might impact&#xD;
      their safety, Fitzpatrick Phototype of II to IV and colorimetry analysis of their skin type&#xD;
      using the Individual Typology Angle, which will be used to estimate minimal erythemal dose&#xD;
      (MED). At Visit 2, the eligible participants will undergo MED irradiation where the&#xD;
      participant will be administered a series of 6 controlled doses of UV radiation. At Visit 3,&#xD;
      the participants will undergo MED determination, where a trained evaluator will evaluate the&#xD;
      exposed skin to determine the lowest dose of UV radiation required to induce uniform,&#xD;
      unambiguous erythema for signs of visible erythema. Further, the study will progress in&#xD;
      3-phases: Induction phase, Rest Phase and Challenge Phase. The Induction phase (3 weeks:&#xD;
      Visit 4 to Visit 18); at visit 4, the area for applying 2 consecutive patches will be&#xD;
      designated between the scapula and waistline. A controlled amount (0.02 mL/cm^2) of each&#xD;
      study product will be randomly assigned within the patch system of each participant into the&#xD;
      appropriate separate cell (3 cells for each of the test products and 1 cell for the saline&#xD;
      solution). Every Monday, patch sites will be evaluated, 2 patches will be applied, post 24&#xD;
      hours (Tuesday) the patches will be removed, patch sites can be cleaned, patch sites will be&#xD;
      evaluated, test products/ saline will be re-applied and 1 of the 2 sites will be irradiated&#xD;
      with 2.5 Joules per centimetre square UVA radiation with a Schott UG11+WG335 filter (or&#xD;
      equivalent) in place, and then with 0.3 MEDs of UVA+UVB radiation (filters UG11+WG320). The&#xD;
      sites will be assessed immediately after irradiation and 24 hours post irradiation&#xD;
      (Wednesday) and duplicate patches will be re-applied as applied on Monday. Same procedure&#xD;
      will be repeated on Thursday as done on Tuesday and on Friday the patch sites will be&#xD;
      evaluated. The same process will continue for 3 consecutive weeks. Then there will be 2 weeks&#xD;
      of Rest phase; where there will be no product or patch applications. Rest phase is further&#xD;
      followed by Challenge phase at week 6 (Visit 19 to Visit 23) where there will be a duplicate&#xD;
      parallel series of product applications under semi-occlusive patches to 2 na√Øve areas on&#xD;
      Monday. Post 24 hours (Tuesday) patches will be removed and 1 of the 2 sites will be&#xD;
      irradiated similar as done in induction phase. The sites will be assessed immediately post&#xD;
      irradiation and after 24 hours (Tuesday), 48 hours (Wednesday) and 72 hours (Thursday) of&#xD;
      irradiation. At visit 23, after the challenge phase the final assessments will be performed&#xD;
      by the dermatologist.&#xD;

          <description>Fitzpatrick scale was used to classify a participant's skin type by their response to sun exposure. This scale emphasizes on potentials for irritation, burns and hyperpigmentation, indicators for future product choices. This scale has six grading, where I refers to always burns easily; never tans, II refers to always burns easily; tans minimally, III refers to burns moderately; tans gradually, IV refers to burns minimally, always tans well, V refers to rarely burns, tans profusely and VI refers to never burns.</description>

          <description>All participants in induction phase were topically applied 2 semi-occlusive patch (Monday) containing developmental serum (0.02 mL/cm^2 in an individual cell of patch) at 2 sites on the dorsum for 24 hours, post patch removal(Tuesday), sites were cleaned, developmental serum was re-applied and 1 of the 2 sites were irradiated with 2.5 J/cm^2 UV A radiation,then with 0.3 MEDs of UVA+UVB radiation. 24 hours post irradiation (Wednesday), sites were assessed and duplicate patches applied as on Monday for 24 hours. Irradiation on Thursday similar to Tuesday and assessment post 24 hour irradiation on Friday. Same process repeated for 3 weeks. In challenge phase all participants were applied 2 semi-occlusive patches at 2 naive sites for 24 hours, post which 1 site was irradiated (same as induction phase).
