  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are unmet medical needs in patients who resist to EGFR TKIs, especially to osimertinib;&#xD;
      APG-1252 shows synergy with osimertinib in both osimertinib treatment naïve and resistant&#xD;
      cell lines. This study is to explore the safety and efficacy of the combination of APG-1252&#xD;
      and osimertinib in 3rd generation TKI resistant patients and 3rd generation TKI treatment&#xD;
      naïve patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, Phase 1b study evaluating the adverse events and best&#xD;
      dose of the combination of fixed dose AZD9291 with APG-1252 in EGFR-TKI resistant NSCLC&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In exploration phase, 3+3 design will be used to determine the MTD/RP2D of the combination of&#xD;
      AZD9291 with APG-1252; Dose of AZD9291 will be fixed at 80mg QD, APG-1252 will start with&#xD;
      240mg weekly, then escalate to 320mg weekly and 400mg weekly or decline to 160mg weekly and&#xD;
      80weekly if not tolerate to 240mg weekly dosage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In expansion phase, IF 1 confirmed PR or CR observed in NSCLC patients who failed 3rd&#xD;
      generation EGFR TKI, the exploration of the combination of AZD9291 with APG-1252 in 3rd&#xD;
      generation EGFR TKI naïve NSCLC patients will be initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the enrollment of these two cohorts, a new cohort was added: to explore the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of APG-1252 combined with osimertinib in the treatment of EGFR Exon20&#xD;
      Insertion or other rare mutant NSCLC patients, and enroll 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated in 21-day cycles. APG-1252 administered via intravenous infusion for&#xD;
      30 minutes weekly (,Day 1, 8 15), AZD9291 via oral daily with 80mg.&#xD;
