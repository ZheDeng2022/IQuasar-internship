  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in adults with geographic atrophy, an advanced form of age-related macular&#xD;
      degeneration. The purpose of this study is to find out how well different doses of BI 754132&#xD;
      are tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are in the study for about 4 months. During this time, they visit the study&#xD;
      site about 10 times. Participants receive 1 injection of BI 754132 directly into one of the&#xD;
      eyes affected by geographic atrophy. In this study, BI 754132 is given to humans for the&#xD;
      first time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors compare how well participants tolerate the different doses of BI 754132. The&#xD;
      doctors also regularly check the general health of the participants.&#xD;
