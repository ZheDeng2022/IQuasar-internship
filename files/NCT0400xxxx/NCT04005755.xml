      The study aims to determine the tolerability of repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV over an&#xD;
      extended period of exposure.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen has been shown to provide superior&#xD;
      analgesia over administration of comparable doses of either component alone or placebo, when&#xD;
      given as an intravenous formulation or as a solid oral tablet in the postoperative setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The superior efficacy of the combination does not appear to come at the expense of&#xD;
      tolerability. A previous study of Maxigesic® IV in bunionectomy patients found that there&#xD;
      were no differences between patients treated with repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV and those&#xD;
      treated with intravenous acetaminophen, ibuprofen or placebo in the rate of discontinuations&#xD;
      due to adverse events (AEs), the overall incidence of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) or the&#xD;
      severity of TEAEs. The incidence of common TEAEs (affecting ≥ 10% of the study population),&#xD;
      including gastrointestinal disorders, nervous system disorders, general disorders and&#xD;
      administration site conditions, and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, was not changed&#xD;
      due to combined administration of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in Maxigesic® IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine the tolerability of repeated doses of Maxigesic® IV over an&#xD;
      extended period of exposure (≥ 48 hours).&#xD;

             receive the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is receiving systemic chemotherapy, has an active malignancy of any type, or has been&#xD;
             diagnosed with cancer within 5 years before Screening (excluding treated squamous or&#xD;

             test, including aspartate aminotransferase [AST], alanine aminotransferase [ALT], or&#xD;
             creatinine ≥ 1.5 times the ULN).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any clinically significant laboratory finding at screening that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the Investigator, contraindicates study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously participated in another clinical study of Maxigesic® IV or received any&#xD;
             investigational drug or device or investigational therapy within 30 days before&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>323 subjects were screened, of whom 90 subjects were screening failures, and a total of 233 subjects were enrolled. 1 subject was enrolled but not dosed due to receiving prohibited concomitant medications during surgery, therefore a total of 232 subjects were administered at least one dose of the study drug. 17 subjects discontinued from the study, including 14 discontinuations during the treatment period, and 3 discontinuations during the follow-up period. 215 subjects completed the full study</recruitment_details>
