  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort study aimed to determine the impact of increased physician patient&#xD;
      interaction on physician well being and patient satisfaction. It involves recording time&#xD;
      spent by physicians at the patient's bedside using tracking devices and providing feedback&#xD;
      emails encouraging them to spend more time. The data will be analyzed to see if bedside time&#xD;
      correlates with patient satisfaction scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has 3 phases - 1. Observational phase for 3 months: Only involves recording&#xD;
      baseline physician bedside time using tracking devices. 2. Interventional phase for 6 months&#xD;
      involves generating percentile scores for physician bedside time and providing feedback&#xD;
      through emails and texts. 3. Post intervention phase for 3 months to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      intervention on daily practice of physicians.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      All residents and staff members who do not opt out of the study by July 1, 2019 will be&#xD;
      included as the final study population. The planned duration of the study is 12 months&#xD;
      starting from July 2019 - June 2020. The total time period will be further divided into three&#xD;
      phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 (Observational phase): All residents and staff physicians rotating through the&#xD;
      inpatient medicine services during the initial 3 months who agreed to be a part of the study&#xD;
      will be provided with Hill Rom tracking devices to quantify the time spent at the patient's&#xD;
      bedside by each member as part of the daily practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 (Intervention phase): Following the initial observational phase, the interventional&#xD;
      phase will be 6 months in duration . During this period, the recorded time spent by the&#xD;
      individual study participants at the patient's bedside will be compared to their respective&#xD;
      peers (e.g. intern to intern, senior resident to senior resident and staff physician to staff&#xD;
      physician), and percentile scores will be generated. Time spent by each member of each team&#xD;
      at the patient's bedside will be abstracted from the tracking software daily and added on a&#xD;
      weekly basis to generate cumulative values by the research coordinator. Patients not assigned&#xD;
      to a particular team member will not count towards the denominator. Data will be collected&#xD;
      individually for the staff physician, senior resident and intern in each team and compared to&#xD;
      peer members in the other teams and converted to percentiles. Based on these percentile&#xD;
      scores, the study participants will receive emails and text pages notifying them of the&#xD;
      results. The participants whose scores fall in the lower 50th percentile, will be encouraged&#xD;
      to increase patient interaction times to reach a target of at least 50th percentile. Striving&#xD;
      to stay in the top 50th percentile will provide continuous reinforcement. The participants&#xD;
      with scores in the top 50th percentile will receive congratulatory emails to encourage them&#xD;
      to keep up the performance. In case of scheduling changes or absences, team members can&#xD;
      notify the study coordinator to exclude their data for the said number of days. The&#xD;
      percentile scores will be used solely for the purpose of this study and will neither impact&#xD;
      trainee evaluation nor their learning objectives for the rotation. Similarly for staff&#xD;
      physicians, the scores generated will not be a part of their annual performance reviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: (Post Intervention observation phase): The final phase of the study will be 3&#xD;
      months. The intervention of feedback emails and text pages will be discontinued and the study&#xD;
      participants will only be monitored to see if the past intervention made an impact on their&#xD;
      daily clinical practice in terms of time spent with the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the rotation the study participants will be assessed for their well-being and&#xD;
      burnout by surveying them using the standard, validated, IRB-approved, anonymous&#xD;
      questionnaires provided by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME),&#xD;
      during each of the above phases&#xD;
