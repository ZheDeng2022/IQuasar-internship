  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      anti-CD22 CAR-T cells in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell Malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells (CAR-T cells) have the capabilities to&#xD;
      recognize tumor associated antigen and kill tumor cells specifically. CAR-T therapy showed&#xD;
      great effect on patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. CAR consists of&#xD;
      single chain variable fragment (scFv) and activation domain of T cell. In preclinical study,&#xD;
      the researchers constructed a third generation CAR containing CD137 and CD28 costimulatory&#xD;
      domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-CD22 CAR-T cells in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory B-cell Malignancies.&#xD;
