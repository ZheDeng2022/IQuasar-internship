      This is a double-blinded randomized study to determine the effects of treatment on&#xD;
      biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption, and bone mineral density (BMD) for&#xD;
      6 months of treatment with EBP05 or placebo. Approximately 160 postmenopausal women with low&#xD;
      bone mass (BMD T-score lower than or equal to -2.0 in at least one location: Lumbar Spine,&#xD;
      Femoral Neck or Total Hip sites) over 50 years of age will receive Study Medication. Protocol&#xD;
      Version 3.0 describes the treatment and evaluation of the initial 103 subjects randomized. In&#xD;
      Protocol Version 4.0 the treatment phase will consist of 4 different treatment arms as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral EBP05 0.5mg x3 tablets (1.5mg), N=6 Oral EBP05 0.5mg x5 tablets (2.5mg), N=36 Oral&#xD;
      Placebo for EBP05 0.5mg (split to sub-groups of: 3 or 5 tablets), N=18&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a double-blinded randomized study to determine the effects of treatment on&#xD;
      biochemical markers of bone formation and bone resorption after 6 months of treatment with&#xD;
      EBP05 or placebo. Approximately 160 postmenopausal women with low bone mass (BMD T-score less&#xD;
      than or equal to -2.0 in at least one location: Lumbar Spine, Femoral Neck or Total Hip&#xD;
      sites) over 50 years of age will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Version 3.0 described the study design for the initial 103 subjects randomized. The&#xD;
      current Version 4.0 describes the study design for approximately 60 additional randomized&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening phase to evaluate subject eligibility may start 56 days prior to the treatment&#xD;
      phase. BMD screening (DXA scan) will be performed locally on approved vendors standardized&#xD;
      machines and interpreted locally. If a subject is found to be suitable, the BMD results will&#xD;
      be sent for central reading. The screening DXA scan should be sent to the central reading&#xD;
      vendor at least 10 days prior to scheduled potential Day 1 in order to allow timely&#xD;
      turnaround of results. The site will receive unblinded results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A DXA BMD scan performed for medical care unrelated to the study may be used as the screening&#xD;
      BMD if obtained no more than 14 days prior the start of screening and performed with the same&#xD;
      scanner which was qualified for the study and according to the study specific guidelines and&#xD;
      procedures referenced in section 8.1.2. If the subject is eligible for randomization, the DXA&#xD;
      scan does not have to be repeated unless there is a delay in the start of Study Medication&#xD;
      beyond the 28-day Screening period (see 4.4.3, Extension of Screening window).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol Version 3.0 describes the randomization of the first 103 subjects. In Protocol&#xD;
      version 4.0, after completion of all screening procedures eligible subjects will come for the&#xD;
      first visit and will be randomized to one of three treatment arms (EBP05 1.5 mg, 2.5 mg or&#xD;
      placebo). A randomized allocation schedule will allocate 6 to EBP05 1.5 mg, 36 to 2.5 mg and&#xD;
      18 to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Protocol Version 5.0 the starting dose of EBP05 for subjects randomized into the EBP05 2.5&#xD;
      mg treatment group was changed to 1.5 mg (3 tablets). Subjects randomized to Placebo and&#xD;
      assigned to the 5 placebo tablet group will also be started on 3 tablets. At the Month 1&#xD;
      visit, the starting dose will be increased to 4 tablets of EPB05 (2.0 mg) or placebo if no&#xD;
      continuing drug-related AEs (as assessed by the Investiagor) are present. At Month 2 the dose&#xD;
      will be increased to 5 tablets of EPB05 (2.5 mg) or placebo if no continuing drug-related AEs&#xD;
      are present. If symptoms associated with administration of Study Medication occur with a dose&#xD;
      increase, the dose should be decreased to 3 tablets daily (1.5 mg). Subjects who tolerate the&#xD;
      highest dose (5 tablets ,2.5 mg) without drug-related sympoms will continue on that dose for&#xD;
      the remainder of the study. Subjects who do not tolerate a dose increase (either 3 tablets to&#xD;
      4 tablets or 4 tablets to 5 tablets) will have their dose reduced to 3 tablets (1.5 mg)&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive Study Medication and education on Study Medication intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will visit the clinic once a month for the first three months, and at 6 months for&#xD;
      the end of treatment or at any time in-between for an Early Termination Visit, if applicable.&#xD;
      There will be telephone calls at Week 2, Month 4 and Month 5 for a general compliance/safety&#xD;
      check. The final follow-up visit will also be conducted by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-month DXA scan will be sent for central reading. Unblinded results will not be released&#xD;
      to the sites prior to Data Base Lock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the End of Treatment visit, concomitant medications will be reviewed, and outcome of AEs&#xD;
      recorded, if applicable. The subjects must return all used Study Medication containers.&#xD;
      Unused medication should also be returned, collected and accounted for.&#xD;
