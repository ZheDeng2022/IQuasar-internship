  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of YIV-906 plus standard-of-care&#xD;
      sorafenib versus those of sorafenib alone as a first-line systemic treatment for patients&#xD;
      with Hepatitis B (+) associated advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YIV-906 (PHY906, KD018) is an immune system modulator. Clinical and preclinical research&#xD;
      suggests that YIV-906 could act to enhance the body's immune response to fight cancer and&#xD;
      increase the anti-tumor activity of sorafenib and protect and repair the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      tract by reducing inflammation and promoting tissue regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspired by a 1,800-year-old traditional medicine still in use today, YIV-906 is a botanical&#xD;
      drug candidate, composed of an extract of four herbs and administered in oral capsule form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CALM (Combination of YIV-906 and Sorafenib to treat Advanced Liver cancer in a&#xD;
      Multi-center study) trial is a multi-regional, randomized, placebo-controlled study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCC patients with chronic HBV (+) (HBsAg(+) and IgM anti-HBc (-)), and Child-Pugh A status&#xD;
      will be randomized to either the study arm (YIV-906 plus sorafenib) or control arm (placebo&#xD;
      plus sorafenib) at ratio of 2:1. Patients will be stratified according to metastatic status&#xD;
      (extrahepatic/vascular invasion vs. none), and their ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1) at&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARM I: Patients receive Placebo + Sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ARM II: Patients receive YIV-906+ Sorafenib&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study arm will be treated orally each 28-day course with YIV-906 (600 mg (3&#xD;
      capsules) BID) + sorafenib (400 mg BID) according to the following schedule: sorafenib BID&#xD;
      daily treatment for 28 days, and YIV-906 BID 4 days on and 3 days off weekly in each course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be evaluated and graded for adverse events according to the NCI Common&#xD;
      Terminology for Adverse Events, version 5.0 (CTCAE). The Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors 1.1 (RECIST 1.1) will be used to establish disease response or progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for PFS, TTP, OS, antitumor response every two cycles, and QoL and&#xD;
      safety at the beginning of each cycle. Biomarkers are mandatory and will be studied prior to&#xD;
      drug administration on day 1 of each cycle. Gut and oral microbiota studies as well as TCM&#xD;
      Syndrome Research are optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK is only optional in China study sites, and limited to the first 15 male and 15 female&#xD;
      patients. Patients will be randomized to either study drug arm or placebo arm (2:1 ratio). PK&#xD;
      studied immediately prior to dose administration and at 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 12&#xD;
      hours post-dose administration on Day 1 of Cycles 1.&#xD;
