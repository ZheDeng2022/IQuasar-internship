    <measure>Change in teacher use of TCIT skills</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Teacher-Child Interaction Coding System (TCICS) in a behavioral coding system that allows trained observers to tally the occurrence of certain teacher behaviors. For CDI skills, if teachers use the skills at a frequency of 5 or more each, they have demonstrated proficiency. If they use the skills at a frequency of 7 or more each, they have demonstrated mastery. For TDI skills, percent correct follow-up of commands and questions at a rate of 50% demonstrates proficiency. Percent correct follow-up at a rate of 75% demonstrates mastery.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Student social-emotional functioning</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Devereux Early Childhood Assessment (DECA) identifies each domain as an area of strength (T-score &gt;=60), an area of need (T-score &lt;=40), or an area of typical functioning (T-score = 41-59). DECA t-scores range from 28 to 72 with higher scores indicating higher functioning.</description>

    <measure>Child prosocial behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Third Edition - Student Observation System (BASC-3 SOS) is a behavioral observation coding system that allows for interval recording of a wide range of child positive and negative behaviors that may promote or impede learning and adjustment in the classroom.&#xD;
For the Adaptive Behaviors scale, there are 4 behaviors rated across 30 intervals, for a total possible score of 120 (range 0-120). Higher scores on the Adaptive Behaviors scale are indicative of higher functioning.</description>

    <description>The Behavior Assessment System for Children, Third Edition - Student Observation System (BASC-3 SOS) is a behavioral observation coding system that allows for interval recording of a wide range of child positive and negative behaviors that may promote or impede learning and adjustment in the classroom.&#xD;
The Problem Behaviors scale consists of 10 behaviors rated across 30 intervals, for a total possible score of 300 (range 0-300). Higher scores on the Problem Behaviors scale are indicative of poorer functioning.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child disruptive behaviors</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Sutter-Eyberg Student Behavior Inventory-Related (SESBI-R) is a teacher rating scale of disruptive behavior of children. It is a 38-item questionnaire with each item scored from 1 (never) to 7 (always) for a total scoring range of 38-266. The higher score indicates increased child's disruptive behavior in the classroom setting.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child language development</measure>
    <time_frame>8 months</time_frame>
    <description>Assess early language based on the MacArthur Communicative Development Inventories (CDI). It is comprised of an 89-word vocabulary checklist. The score is assessed in the amount of correct answers and measured in percentiles, from less than 1 to 100, depending on the child's age. Higher percentile scores indicate a higher vocabulary (i.e., more language) and lower percentile scores indicate a lower vocabulary (i.e., less language).</description>

    <description>TCIT consists of the following:&#xD;
CDI Teach Session: Teachers will participate in two training workshops in Child-Directed Interaction (CDI) skills. Specifically, teachers will learn to use positive attention skills and active ignoring.&#xD;
CDI Coaching: Teachers will receive 90 minutes of CDI coaching in the classroom once or twice weekly for 6 total coaching sessions over a period of 4-6 weeks. The coach will observe the class and coach the teacher live using a microphone and bug-in-the-ear device.&#xD;
TDI Teach Session: Teachers will complete two training workshops in Teacher Directed Interaction (TDI) skills, which focus on increasing compliance and reducing disruptive behavior. Teachers will learn to present developmentally appropriate, direct, and clear instructions and consistent positive and negative consequences.&#xD;
TDI Coaching: Teachers will receive six 90-minute TDI coaching sessions once or twice weekly for 4-6 weeks.</description>
