      Current guidelines for the prevention and treatment of obesity focus on caloric restriction&#xD;
      diets and increasing physical activity, but long-term compliance to these strategies is poor.&#xD;
      The timing of meal intake relative to the light-dark and sleep-wake cycle is rarely&#xD;
      considered in metabolic health; and modifying meal timing is likely easier to implement in&#xD;
      daily life than reducing caloric intake and/or increasing physical activity. This project&#xD;
      will test whether restricting the timing of energy intake to a short-defined period during&#xD;
      wakefulness can be used to improve fuel utilization patterns and enhance circadian rhythms in&#xD;
      metabolic tissues to optimize health.&#xD;

      Time restricted feeding (TRF; eating within &lt;10-h period followed by &gt;14-h fast) is a&#xD;
      promising meal timing paradigm that in rodent studies improves multiple health indicators.&#xD;
      When provided access to a high-fat diet ad libitum, mice rapidly gain weight. However, when&#xD;
      fed the same diet under TRF conditions (food access restricted to an 8-h window during the&#xD;
      active phase) mice appear to be protected from excessive weight gain and metabolic diseases.&#xD;
      Preliminary studies in humans are showing improvements in 24-h glucose variability, fat&#xD;
      oxidation, and blood pressure with TRF aligned to the early portion of the day compared to&#xD;
      the ad libitum feeding schedule. A major research gap is whether the timing of the feeding&#xD;
      window relative to sleep modifies metabolic responses. In a recent pilot and feasibility&#xD;
      study incorporating TRF into a weight loss intervention the researchers asked participants to&#xD;
      consume all food within a 10-h window to starting 1-h after waking for 12-weeks. The&#xD;
      researchers' design choice was based on data showing that consuming energy in the evening is&#xD;
      related to a two-fold increase in obesity risk. There also appears to be reduced weight loss&#xD;
      effectiveness in dieters who consume the main meal later in the day. Some of the participants&#xD;
      in the weight loss trial reported difficulty adhering to the early feeding schedule because&#xD;
      it does not align well with social schedule (e.g., eating dinner with the family in the&#xD;
      evening). Therefore, an important clinical question is whether late or mid-day TRF will&#xD;
      result in similar metabolic benefits compared to the early TRF paradigm that has been tested&#xD;
      in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional rationale for studying early vs. late timed feeding is to address a fundamental&#xD;
      question, &quot;can timed meals shift the timing of metabolic rhythms?&quot;. Peripheral circadian&#xD;
      clocks located in liver, adipose, and muscle tissue are sensitive to meal timing and control&#xD;
      daily oscillations in fuel utilization and storage. A small study of 8 men demonstrated that&#xD;
      a 5-h delay and meal timing was sufficient to delay the rhythmic expression of clock genes in&#xD;
      white adipose tissue. Therefore, the investigators will leverage the design of the present&#xD;
      study to examine the impact of meal timing on peripheral circadian rhythms in metabolism and&#xD;
      their alignment to the sleep cycle.&#xD;
