  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial design is a quasi-experimental cohort trial that includes women referred for pelvic&#xD;
      organ prolapse specific physiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates will be selected via a convenience sampling method from four physiotherapy&#xD;
      outpatient departments at a NHS trust within Greater Manchester. The data collection occurred&#xD;
      in January-June 2019 and ethical approval was granted by School Research Ethics, University&#xD;
      of Salford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment aims to ensure there is respect for their autonomy, treatment is fair (Justice), no&#xD;
      harm is done to the participant (nonmaleficence) and treatment benefits the participants&#xD;
      (beneficence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are required to complete a consent form prior to their initial session. To&#xD;
      ensure methodological quality, the STROBE guidelines will be followed to make certain all apt&#xD;
      information required is reported to allow for replication of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial aims to include (n=60) women with a diagnosed pelvic organ prolapse. They are&#xD;
      required to complete 16 weeks of supervised pelvic floor exercises with a specialist&#xD;
      physiotherapist as documented within the most recent NICE guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures used will be the Pelvic Organ Prolapse symptom score (POPSS) and this&#xD;
      will be documented before and after the 16 week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along side the POPSS, the patients body mass index and severity of pelvic organ prolapse will&#xD;
      also be recorded and the results of this will be correlated post trial using the relevant&#xD;
      data analysis testing methods.&#xD;

    <description>The POPSS is a patient-reported Outcome Measure consisting of seven POP symptom specific items, each with a five-point Likert response set (0 = never, 1 = occasionally, 2 = sometimes, 3 = most of the time and 4 = all of the time). The minimum score is 0 which would indicate that the pelvic organ prolapse in a-symptomatic and the maximum score for the POPSS is 28 which would indicate higher severity in pelvic organ prolapse symptoms. In addition, the women select a specific symptom which is most bothersome for them.</description>

    <description>Sixteen weeks of supervised pelvic floor muscle training with a specialist physiotherapist.&#xD;
Participants will be assessed at weeks 0 / 4 / 10 &amp; 16 and the outcome measures will be recorded at week 0 &amp; week 16.&#xD;
During each assessment, participants will be educated regarding the anatomy of pelvic organ prolapses and the pelvic floor muscles. They will be taught how to contract their pelvic floor, offered a vaginal examination, given a personalised pelvic floor muscle training programme (including the Knack) - up to a ten second hold long contractions (x 10 repitations) and up to 10 quick contractions. They will also be taught a sub max contraction for up to 30 seconds, offered lifestyle management advice including avoiding heavy lifting or straining. A leaflet explaining the aforementioned information will also be provided at the initial assessment.</description>
