    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and Dose-Limiting Toxicity&#xD;
      (DLT) of recombinant humanized PD-L1/4-1BB bispecific antibody (ES101) in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ES101 (INBRX-105; PDL1x4-1BB antibody) is a recombinant humanized bispecific IgG1 antibody&#xD;
      targeting human PD-L1 and 4-1BB. This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation and&#xD;
      cohort expansion phase 1 clinical study to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      characteristics and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ES101 in patients with advanced&#xD;
      malignant solid tumors whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy, or who has no&#xD;
      further standard therapy, or who is unsuitable for available standard treatment options.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Males or females aged ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has pathological or cytological diagnosed advanced malignant solid tumor,&#xD;
             whose disease has progressed despite standard therapy, or who has no further standard&#xD;
             therapy, or who is unsuitable for available standard treatment options&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Part A: There is no mandatory requirement for PD-L1 expression status of subject's&#xD;
             tumor tissue. Part B:Tumor tissue of subject should be PD-L1 positivity by&#xD;
             immunohistochemistry (IHC).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects in part A shall have at least one evaluable lesion, and subjects enrolled in&#xD;
             part B shall have at least one measurable lesion (RECIST v1.1). Tumor lesions located&#xD;
             in previously irradiated (or other local treated) areas will be considered measurable,&#xD;
             provided that there has been clear imaging-based progression of the lesions since the&#xD;
             time of radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate hematologic, coagulation, hepatic and renal function as defined per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

             the time of signing informed consent and for the duration of study participation&#xD;
             through 3 months, following the last dose of study drug. Postmenopausal women are&#xD;
             considered to have no fertility potential only if menostasis lasts for at least 12&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent form&#xD;

             biological products (except hormone-replacement therapy, testosterone or oral&#xD;
             contraceptives) within 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug. Previous&#xD;
             exposure to oral fluorouracils or small molecular targeted drugs require a minimum&#xD;
             washout period of 2 weeks or 5 half-lives prior to the first dose of study drug&#xD;

             minimum washout period of 6 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known allergies to CHO-produced antibodies, which in the opinion of the Investigator&#xD;
             suggests an increased potential for an adverse hypersensitivity to ES101.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Primary or metastatic brain or meningeal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with other malignancies previously or currently shall be excluded in Part B.&#xD;

             study participation and/or will not compromise trial objectives) per judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator and with approval of the Medical Monitor or Study Director.&#xD;
