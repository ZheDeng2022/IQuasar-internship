      ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To evaluate a new technique of posterior capsulorhexis using air support to&#xD;
      treat primary posterior capsular opacification (PCO) during cataract extraction surgery or to&#xD;
      prevent post-operative PCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SETTING: 1-Ophthalmology department, Faculty of medicine, Minia University, El-Minia, Egypt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2- Security Forces Hospital, Ophthalmology Department, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: Prospective, randomized case-control comparative study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 100 eyes of 100 patients with a mean age of 63.3 years with dens cataract. Fifty of&#xD;
      them ( group 1) with primary PCO (discovered during the operations) and fifty (group 2) with&#xD;
      clear posterior capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All cases undergone phacoemulsification, posterior capsulorhexis using the air to support the&#xD;
      posterior capsule and separate it from the vitreous (the novel technique will be discussed&#xD;
      later). Then IOL implantations wear done in the bag between the anterior and posterior&#xD;
      capsular rim. Each patient was evaluated for the following:- visual acuity (UCVA and BCVA),&#xD;
      intraocular pressure, intra ocular lens stability, visual axis opacification and posterior&#xD;
      segment complications as retinal break, retinal detachment or cystoid macular oedema.&#xD;

      Introduction. Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is one of the common late post-operative&#xD;
      complications of phacoemulsification and ECCE. The treatment of PCO by YAG laser capsulotomy&#xD;
      usually leads to the famous annoying symptom (musca) and carries the risk of IOP elevation.&#xD;
      Moreover, it may lead to the posterior segment complications ( cystoid macular edema, retinal&#xD;
      breaks and detachment). There is no reliable treatment for prevention of PCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current available modalities to prevent postoperative PCO are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some surgical modifications as hydrodissection, repeated nucleus rotation and meticulous&#xD;
           polishing of the lens epithelial cells (LECs) from anterior capsular rim and equator. In&#xD;
           1989 David Apple and his group (1) had demonstrated the value of hydrodissection. In&#xD;
           1992, they further emphasized hydrodissection as well as barriers to migration of&#xD;
           equatorial cells to the posterior capsule as methods which could reduce PCO (2). In the&#xD;
           same year Fine described a technique which he termed 'cortical cleaving&#xD;
           hydrodissection', (3) which was designed to break the equatorial adhesions between lens&#xD;
           epithelial cells and the capsule, thus increasing the chance of significant clearance of&#xD;
           these cells which are the progenitors of PCO. In 2006 they pointed out to the laboratory&#xD;
           and clinical evidence that good hydrodissection, coupled with mechanical 'scouring' of&#xD;
           LECs from the equator may have beneficial effect on decreasing PCO incidence. (4,5). In&#xD;
           a laboratory experiment they found that there were significantly fewer cells remaining&#xD;
           in the capsule equator in the group of eyes where the lens had been rotated three times&#xD;
           within the bag prior to removal, compared with no such rotation(4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Changes in the IOL design and materials: e.g. The square edge of the optic and acrylic&#xD;
           IOL decreases the incidence of postoperative PCO than with PMMA IOLs of similar design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacological strategies either to kill the residual epithelial cells or to prevent&#xD;
           their post operative proliferation. The pharmacological prevention has been largely&#xD;
           unsuccessful so far. Moreover, any agent must be toxic to these epithelial cells without&#xD;
           being toxic to the corneal endothelium. Few agents have been partially successful&#xD;
           without clinical application till now (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of PCO following successful cataract surgery has been falling since the general&#xD;
      acceptance of posterior chamber in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Improvement&#xD;
      in lens materials, lens design and technique are well documented to decrease the incidence of&#xD;
      postoperative PCO (8, 9). Rotation three times of the hydrodissected nucleus prior to&#xD;
      phacoemulsification and a second hydrodissection after nucleus removal are simple and safe&#xD;
      maneuvers that statistically improve the results (9). Bimanual irrigation/aspiration may also&#xD;
      help.(10) Treatment options for PCO&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  YAG laser posterior capsulotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical posterior capsulotomy or capsulectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary (Intra-operative)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications of the new technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intraoperative PCO in white cataract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. As a primary procedure during cataract extraction to prevent post-operative PCO. Thirty&#xD;
           eyes of 100 patients with dens cataract were chosen from the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
           ophthalmology department, Minia University Hospital, El-Minia Egypt. The patient's age&#xD;
           ranged from 50-73 years with a mean age of 63.3 years 50 males and 50 females without&#xD;
           any local or systemic causes for the cataract. The study group included fifty eyes&#xD;
           (group1) with PCO, and fifty eyes (group 2) with clear posterior capsule (discovered&#xD;
           intra-operative). All cases were subjected to complete ophthalmic examinations and&#xD;
           echographic data registration. All cases undergone Phacoemulsification, posterior&#xD;
           capsulorhexis using the air to support the posterior capsule and separate it from the&#xD;
           vitreous face. Table (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After complete phacoemulsification of the nucleus and I/A:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visco-elastic material was injected to make the anterior chamber formed without&#xD;
           deepening so that the posterior capsule is not forcibly pushed backward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The posterior capsule punctured centrally using cysteotome Fig. (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Controllable one shot injection of 0.1 ml of sterile air through the posterior capsule&#xD;
           puncture which elevate, support and separate the posterior capsule from vitreous face.&#xD;
           (Insulin syringe and Helon cannula were used) Fig. (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Another visco-elastic injection to the anterior chamber to stretch the posterior capsule&#xD;
           and sandwitich it between visco-elastic above and the air below Fig. (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Posterior capsulorhexis 4-5 mm is now performed easily using capsulorhexis forceps then&#xD;
           foldable IOL was implanted between the anterior and posterior capsular rim .&#xD;
