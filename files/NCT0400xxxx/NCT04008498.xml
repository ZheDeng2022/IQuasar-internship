    <textblock>
      Amplitude integrated encephalography (aEEG) is a monitor that measures brain activity by&#xD;
      attaching leads to a baby's head, and is used routinely in term babies who have brain injury&#xD;
      because of a difficult birth. There is little information on how useful aEEG is in premature&#xD;
      babies, and most studies only look at small numbers of babies. However, these studies suggest&#xD;
      that the aEEG is different in premature babies with brain injury, infections / meningitis,&#xD;
      and in those receiving certain drugs. It is also affected by changes in blood pressure and&#xD;
      blood acid levels. It is theoretically possible that, if we can detect changes using aEEG&#xD;
      early on, we will be able adjust treatment to make a baby better.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      At the request of our funder (The Children's Hospital Charity), we have been asked to split&#xD;
      the research methodology into two phases to secure the full amount of our funding. The&#xD;
      differences between the two phases relates to the length of aEEG recording and whether the&#xD;
      babies get the follow-up at discharge from the neonatal unit. The reason for developing two&#xD;
      phases is that the funder wishes us to prove the concept that we can recruit premature babies&#xD;
      to have aEEG using one machine before they pay for a second monitor to allow for the full&#xD;
      study to run. The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be the same for both phases of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE ONE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The baby of any family who consent to be involved in the study will have their head cleaned&#xD;
      using a sterile solution. The 5 sticky EEG leads placed on the head and connected to the&#xD;
      monitor. We will not use needle electrodes because of the risk of infection and scarring. The&#xD;
      screen of the monitor will be covered with a black piece of card so it is not visible to&#xD;
      staff or families. This is because the staff do not know what is a normal or abnormal aEEG in&#xD;
      a premature baby, and we do not want them making treatment decisions based on a test result&#xD;
      they do not understand. However, we will ask the nurses to check the screen at the time of&#xD;
      usual observations to check that the monitor is still recording and the leads have not fallen&#xD;
      off. This can be done by looking at the &quot;impedance&quot; on the screen, as would happen for babies&#xD;
      born at term who have aEEG. Nursing staff will also be asked to review the skin regularly at&#xD;
      the time of usual cares to make sure it remains healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aEEG will be recorded continuously for one week, and will then stop. No further follow-up&#xD;
      or intervention is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The funders require us to show proof of concept in 6 premature babies before releasing the&#xD;
      remainder of our money for additional monitors, nursing time and equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff will review the aEEG monitor at the time of usual observations to ensure that the&#xD;
      machine is recording, the impedence is within normal levels, a trace is recorded, the EEG&#xD;
      leads remain attached, and the skin condition is good.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHASE TWO:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies whose families consent to involvement will have their head cleaned, EEG leads&#xD;
      attached, the monitor set up, and observations as described in phase one. The main difference&#xD;
      in the two phases is the timing of recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In phase two, babies will be recorded continuously for the entire duration of their time on&#xD;
      the intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the child is receiving high dependency or special care, we will record aEEG for 4 hours&#xD;
      once a week until the baby is discharged home. If a participant is moved back to intensive&#xD;
      care, the aEEG will be started again if the aEEG monitor is not being used on another baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being discharged home, the babies in phase two will have additional follow-up. They&#xD;
      will receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain on either a 1.5T or dedicated 3T&#xD;
      (Firefly) scanner at the University of Sheffield. They will also have a standardised&#xD;
      examination of their neurological system performed by a physiotherapist (The Hammersmith&#xD;
      Neonatal Neurological Examination).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect clinical details retrospectively from the observation charts and medical&#xD;
      notes, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The gestation age of the baby&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long they received ventilation or other forms of respiratory support for&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How long they needed oxygen for and, and maximum oxygen requirement each day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How many infections (sepsis) they had and which organisms were found&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether they had a heart defect called a patent ductus arteriosus and whether treatment&#xD;
           was needed for this&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What the results of their ultrasound scans of the brain were, which are performed&#xD;
           routinely in premature babies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether they had a gut problem called necrotising enterocolitis and whether surgery was&#xD;
           needed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Whether they developed post-haemorrhagic ventricular dilation, and need for intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival to discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask the families for consent to examine any future medical notes / clinic letters to&#xD;
      see what the baby's development was like later in life. We will also ask the families for&#xD;
      their permission to contact them in the future in the event that we obtain funding for a&#xD;
      follow-on study, such as to examine their child's development in more detail in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask parents to complete a short questionnaire about their experience of the&#xD;
      monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask the neonatal nurses to complete a short questionnaire about their experience of&#xD;
      the monitoring and whether they have ideas for improving the process, or any training they&#xD;
      would like to have.&#xD;
