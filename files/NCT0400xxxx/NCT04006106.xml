  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perioperative Acute Hypersensitivity (PAH) is a systemic reaction that occurs rapidly&#xD;
      following injection of a drug during anesthesia. The main mechanism evoked is an immune&#xD;
      response of immediate systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis. Anaphylactic reactions are&#xD;
      classically described as IgE-dependent and triggered by the injection of allergen which by&#xD;
      bridging specific IgE present on the surface of mast cells, induces a massive release of&#xD;
      histamine responsible for the observed symptoms. The diagnosis of this mechanism (IgE&#xD;
      endotype) requires the determination of associated circulating mediators (histamine and mast&#xD;
      cell tryptase) as well as skin tests performed during an allergologic evaluation. However,&#xD;
      our previous work on patients with PAH (NASA study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01637220)&#xD;
      demonstrated that classical markers of IgE endotype are present in only 42% of patients. This&#xD;
      finding has three consequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a diagnostic inaccuracy with deleterious consequences for the patient,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the existence of undocumented endotypes explaining the observed clinical manifestations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a lack of formal identification of culprit drug, with uncertainty about the eviction&#xD;
           recommendations leading to consequences for the safety of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that symptoms associated with PAH are caused by several&#xD;
      distinct endotypes involving different cellular effectors and molecular mediators. These&#xD;
      endotypes may be related to the immune system but independent of IgE, or independent of the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess these endotypes, The investigators will be measuring the activation status of blood&#xD;
      cells and a wide range of secreted mediators in blood drawn as soon as possible after PAH&#xD;
      onset, and at steady state during a subsequent allergology visit. These data will be analyzed&#xD;
      along with clinical data in multivariate analysis and clustering to define coherent profiles&#xD;
      among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of previously unexplored endotypes will allow to explain more PAH reactions and to&#xD;
      design new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perioperative Acute Hypersensitivity (PAH) is a systemic reaction that occurs rapidly&#xD;
      following injection of a drug during anesthesia. Symptoms may include erythema, angioedema,&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction, vasodilation, and increased capillary permeability leading to severe&#xD;
      hypotension or even cardiac arrest. The rate of occurrence is estimated between 1/6,000 and&#xD;
      1/20,000 anesthesia according to literature. Despite adequate management, mortality is&#xD;
      estimated between 3 and 9%. The main substances responsible for these reactions are the&#xD;
      neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBA) and beta-lactams, more rarely the gelatin-based filling&#xD;
      solutions, contrast agents, antiseptics or other hypnotic or analgesic drugs. The main&#xD;
      mechanism is an immune response of immediate systemic hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis.&#xD;
      Anaphylactic reactions are classically described as IgE-dependent and triggered by the&#xD;
      injection of allergen which by bridging specific IgE present on the surface of mast cells,&#xD;
      induces a massive release of histamine responsible for the observed symptoms. The diagnosis&#xD;
      of this mechanism (IgE endotype) requires the determination of associated circulating&#xD;
      mediators (histamine and mast cell tryptase) as well as skin tests performed in an&#xD;
      allergology consultation. However, our previous work on patients with NMBA-triggered PAH&#xD;
      (NASA study, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01637220) demonstrated that classical markers of IgE&#xD;
      endotype are present in only 42% of patients. This finding has three consequences:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a diagnostic inaccuracy with deleterious consequences for the patient,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the existence of undocumented endotypes explaining the observed clinical manifestations,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a lack of formal identification of the culprit drug, with uncertainty about the eviction&#xD;
           recommendations leading to consequences for the safety of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis and aims The investigators hypothesize that symptoms associated with PAH are&#xD;
      caused by several distinct endotypes involving different cellular effectors and molecular&#xD;
      mediators. These endotypes may be related to the immune system but independent of IgE, or&#xD;
      independent of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to characterize the different endotypes of PAH reactions&#xD;
      by an exploratory clustering approach based on analysis of i) activation state of blood cells&#xD;
      and ii) concentration of secreted mediators, all measured during PAH onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess links between the different endotypes identified and the clinical and&#xD;
           biological parameters of the PAH reaction, in particular the severity and the&#xD;
           responsible drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Constitute a biobank (serum, plasma, DNA) to be able to continue the exploration of the&#xD;
           different endotypes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The investigators will include all patients &gt;18 years old presenting, during a&#xD;
      general anesthesia, symptoms compatible with a PAH severe enough to for the anesthetist to&#xD;
      request biological exploration using the &quot;anaphylaxis kit&quot; (tryptase, histamine and specific&#xD;
      IgE measurement). The anaphylaxis kit will be modified to contain additional tubes allowing&#xD;
      to measure blood cell counts, blood cell activation (flow cytometry), proteic and lipidic&#xD;
      mediators. Clinical data about the reaction will be collected by the local investigator via&#xD;
      an electronic form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon recovery, patients will sign informed consent and will be planned for allergological&#xD;
      evaluation 6-8 weeks after (standard care). During allergological evaluation, skin test&#xD;
      against all drugs received will be performed and blood will be drawn to measure tryptase and&#xD;
      specific IgE as per standard care. Additional tubes will allow to measure the same parameters&#xD;
      as at inclusion, and additionally to recover DNA and peripheral mononucleated blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and analyses The main goal is to define sets of biological parameters corresponding&#xD;
      to distinct endotypes. The data will be submitted to principal component analysis (PCA) to&#xD;
      determine groups of patients with distinct profiles, and which parameters are the more&#xD;
      relevant for each profile. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering will also be used to define&#xD;
      groups of patients with distinct clinical and biological profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the link between severity and clinical/biological data, logistic regression models&#xD;
      will be used as well as severity-adjusted PCA.&#xD;
