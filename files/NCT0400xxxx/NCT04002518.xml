      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow up study is to collect data&#xD;
      confirming safety, performance, and clinical benefits of the Biomet Cannulated Bone Screw&#xD;
      System (Implants and Instrumentation) when used according to the approved Indications for Use&#xD;
      (IFU).&#xD;

      The objective of this retrospective enrollment/prospective follow up study is to collect data&#xD;
      confirming safety, performance, and clinical benefits of the Biomet Cannulated Bone Screw&#xD;
      System (Implants and Instrumentation) when used according to the approved Indications for Use&#xD;
      (IFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be established by recording the incidence and frequency of complications and&#xD;
      adverse events. Relationship of the events to either implant or instrumentation should be&#xD;
      specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performance and clinical benefits will be assessed by analyzing fracture healing/fusion and&#xD;
      the overall pain and functional performance of subjects who received the Biomet Cannulated&#xD;
      Bone Screws by recording survey questions. Zimmer Biomet defines the expected performance&#xD;
      rate for Cannulated Screws for long and small bone fractures to be a union rate of at least&#xD;
      81% at 8-12 months.&#xD;

        The study populations will be a consecutive series of subjects that have received the&#xD;
        Biomet Cannulated Screw. Patients will be enrolled into one of the three identified groups:&#xD;
        Group 1 (3.0mm and 4.0mm), Group 2 (5.0mm), and Group 3 (6.5mm and 8.0mm).&#xD;
