  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to population ageing, osteoarthritis of knees and hips become major orthopaedic problems&#xD;
      in Hong Kong. Osteoarthritis of knees and hips are associated with significant pain problems&#xD;
      and functional disability. Total joint replacement is the ultimate surgical procedure to deal&#xD;
      with these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, total joint replacement is associated with significant tissue damage and&#xD;
      post-operative pain problems, which would affect post-operative recovery and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aims of total knee replacement are improvement in functional activities and&#xD;
      reducing pain due to degenerated knee joints. However, there are around 20-30% of patients&#xD;
      who would develop significant pain problems after undergoing uncomplicated total knee&#xD;
      replacement. It accounts for major post-operative problems and burdens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure-specific analgesic method with multi-model analgesia technique is well-known to be&#xD;
      useful in post-operative pain management, which reduces the post-operative pain score.&#xD;
      Despite the use of multi-modal analgesic technique, pain after total joint replacement&#xD;
      remains unsolved. It prolongs the recovery period and increases post-operative analgesic&#xD;
      consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodal analgesia which includes periarticular local infiltration of analgesia (LIA),&#xD;
      regional nerve block, opioid and non-opioid have been shown to be effective in managing&#xD;
      postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periarticular LIA has been shown to be an effective way of pain management. Regional nerve&#xD;
      block using femoral nerve block or adductor canal block (ACB) is also a well-established&#xD;
      anlagesic technique for total knee replacement. Compared with femoral nerve block, it&#xD;
      involves more sensory blockade. Hence, it has the advantage of quadriceps sparing. Moreover,&#xD;
      post-operative mobilization is less affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent meta-analysis and systemic review suggests that periarticular LIA is associated with&#xD;
      better pain control and reduced opioid consumption compared to using ACB alone. However,&#xD;
      duration of action and efficacy of a single-dose LIA may not be sufficient for total knee&#xD;
      replacement. Whether the combination use of ACB and periarticular LIA has additional benefit&#xD;
      of prolonging analgesia or comes with synergistic effect remains controversial. Although&#xD;
      recent meta analysis has shown that combined ACB with LIA could significantly reduce pain&#xD;
      score and morphine consumption compared with LIA alone after TKA, only 7 RCTS were involved&#xD;
      in this analysis. It is essential to have more RCTs to further evaluate the usefulness of&#xD;
      combining both LIA and ACB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plain bupivacaine or ropivocaine were used in ACB in all previous studies. They are local&#xD;
      anaesthetics with half-life ranging from 3-6 hours. With the availability of liposomal&#xD;
      bupivacaine, analgesic effect of ACB may be prolonged. It is because the therapeutic level of&#xD;
      bupivacaine is below the toxic range and sustained for 72 hours after injection. Only one&#xD;
      study evaluated the effect of adductor canal block using liposomal bupivacaine. However, it&#xD;
      was a retrospectively study which compared ACB using liposomal bupivacaine and 0.1 %&#xD;
      Ropivociane infusion. It didn't evaluate the efficacy of combining ACB using LB and&#xD;
      periarticular LIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of combining periarticular local&#xD;
      infiltration of analgesia and adductor canal block using liposomal bupivacaine&#xD;
