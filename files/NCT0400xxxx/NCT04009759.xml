  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small numbers of patients (10-15%) treated with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) are&#xD;
      discharged from hospitals with a favorable neurologic outcome. However, a higher incidence of&#xD;
      chest injuries (30-70%), mainly rib and sternum fractures, are observed among the survivors.&#xD;
      It's no surprise that 6 months after cardiac arrest (CA) 50-70% of the patients who have&#xD;
      survived continue to have pain and stress-related problems. Based on the need for the&#xD;
      pain/stress treatment in these patients and several experimental evidences demonstrating&#xD;
      neuroprotective features of anesthetics it is logical to presume that application of&#xD;
      anesthesia during CPR may be indicated. In rodents exposed to hypoxic gas (5% 02, 95% N2) for&#xD;
      70 min, all seven animals died at the end of the experiments in the naloxone pre-treated&#xD;
      group while only one out of seven rats died in the morphine pre-treated group, and five of&#xD;
      seven rats died in the control group. In human volunteers, intravenously administered 60 mg&#xD;
      of morphine did not alter cerebral blood flow and cerebral vascular resistance but markedly&#xD;
      depressed cerebral oxygen uptake. Interestingly, in critical patients, morphine even in low&#xD;
      doses is effective in relieving dyspnea by altering central perception and decreasing&#xD;
      anxiety. In rats, morphine demonstrates dose- depending reduction of cerebral glucose&#xD;
      utilization in limbic and forebrain regions. Thus, the main points of application for&#xD;
      morphine in treatment of CA may be a reduction of oxygen/glucose consumption. Pre-treatment&#xD;
      of zebrafish with ketamine protects against cardiac arrest-induced brain injury by inhibiting&#xD;
      Ca2+ wave propagation and consequently it improves survival rate. Inhibition of NMDA&#xD;
      receptors by ketamine reduces neuronal apoptosis and attenuates the systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      response to tissue injury. The sympathomimetic effects of ketamine may facilitates recovery&#xD;
      of systemic blood pressure during CPR. Retrospective investigations demonstrate that patients&#xD;
      who are treated with opioids before or during CA have a statistically significantly higher&#xD;
      survival rate and much better neurological outcome compared to untreated patients.&#xD;
      Experimental studies have a limitation as all animals are treated with anesthesia and&#xD;
      therefore survival rate varies between 50-90%. Thus, prospective research is urgently needed&#xD;
      to investigate the influence of morphine or/and ketamine on survival and neurological outcome&#xD;
      in patients with CA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Almost 35 years ago, Dr Peter Safar wrote that &quot;cerebral recovery from more than 5 min of&#xD;
      cardiac arrest is hampered by complex secondary derangements of multiple organ systems after&#xD;
      reperfusion&quot;. Actually, these 5 &quot;golden&quot; minutes determine the ability of cerebral neurones&#xD;
      to regain ordinary function after anoxia. The ordinary function of cerebral neurones is&#xD;
      conduction of electrical impulses across their length from the post-synaptic membrane of&#xD;
      dendrites to the presynaptic membrane of an axon. The process is based on exchange of Ca2+,&#xD;
      Na+ and K+ between the extra- and intracellular space of cerebral neurones, and therefore a&#xD;
      lot of energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is needed to remove Ca2+ and Na+&#xD;
      from the intracellular space of these cells. Cardiac arrest (CA) initiates a switch to&#xD;
      glycolytic metabolism with very low production of ATP and the increased levels of lactate and&#xD;
      H+. Both acidosis and the lack of ATP inhibit the ions pumps, which are responsible for&#xD;
      handling excessive intracellular accumulation of Ca2+ and Na+. Preclinical studies&#xD;
      demonstrate that acute hypoxia results in an uncontrolled release of glutamate with&#xD;
      consequent stimulation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors causing also an excessive&#xD;
      Ca2+ influx. Meanwhile, the ATP reservoir in neurones can be completely depleted after 5&#xD;
      minutes of no-flow state. In case of oxygen supplying restoration, two molecules of ATP are&#xD;
      initially required to split glucose and restart the cellular respiration. Thus, the presence&#xD;
      or absence of these two molecules of ATP in neurones actually determine restoring of both&#xD;
      oxidative phosphorylation and the ordinary function of the neurones. Finally, prolonged&#xD;
      intracellular Ca2+ overload results in increased mitochondrial permeability causing following&#xD;
      release of cytochrome C from mitochondria, and consequent cleavage and activation of&#xD;
      caspase-3. Caspase-3 is an essential protease, which is involved in the early stage of&#xD;
      apoptosis and it is generally accepted as a hallmark of irreversible cell death.&#xD;
      Interestingly, in an experimental study with rats, the activation of caspase-3 was observed&#xD;
      in a significant number of neurones of the cerebellum and neocortex only after 9 hours&#xD;
      following asphyxial cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, only therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to have a beneficial impact on the ion&#xD;
      pump dysfunction, and thereby reduce neurotoxicity. Interestingly, in hibernators,&#xD;
      hypothermia is also believed to protect against hypoxic brain damage. Meanwhile, if naloxone,&#xD;
      a non selective opioid receptor antagonist, is injected during the maintenance phase of&#xD;
      hibernation, arousal is quickly achieved and the protective effects are vanished. Delta&#xD;
      opioid peptides, previously discovered to induce hibernation have also been shown to protect&#xD;
      rats from hypoxic brain damage. Based on the ability of opioids to reduce the level of cyclic&#xD;
      adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and consequently to block Na+ channels, it would be logical&#xD;
      to propose that opioids might prevent the disturbance of ionic homeostasis during acute&#xD;
      hypoxia. Indeed, preclinical studies demonstrate that opioids can preserve cellular integrity&#xD;
      status during acute hypoxia in many organs and tissues including: intestine, skeletal muscle,&#xD;
      myocardium and brain. Moreover, Morphine has been shown to significantly increase the&#xD;
      survival of mice and rats in acute hypoxia conditions. In the experimental model with rats&#xD;
      exposed to hypoxic gas (5% oxygen, 95% N2) for 70 min, all seven rats in the naloxone&#xD;
      pre-treated group died at the end of the experiments while only one out of seven rats died in&#xD;
      the Morphine (5 mg/kg) pretreated group, and five from the seven rats died in the control&#xD;
      group. In the experiments where the rats were exposed to 8 min anoxia, pre-treatment with&#xD;
      Morphine (5mg/kg), or Ketamine (40 mg/kg), resulted in higher survival in both groups as&#xD;
      compared to the control group (data not yet published). No publications looking at the&#xD;
      survival rate in animals with treatment by Morphine before cardiac arrest have been published&#xD;
      yet. Meanwhile, two recent retrospective studies demonstrated that patients who were treated&#xD;
      with opioids before or during cardiac arrest had a statistically significantly higher&#xD;
      survival rate and much better neurological outcome compared to untreated patients. Recently&#xD;
      published data shows that the Na+ influx initiating the action potential in neurones consumes&#xD;
      one third the ATP of synaptic potentials associated with Ca2+ influx. In theory, Ketamine&#xD;
      that inhibits the synaptic potentials by NMDA receptor blockade, might save much more ATP in&#xD;
      the neurones compared to Morphine, which inhibits only Na+ influx and accordingly the action&#xD;
      potentials. Certainly, after restoration of blood flow, the residual saved ATP may contribute&#xD;
      to restoration of both neuronal oxidative phosphorylation and ionic exchange. Newly published&#xD;
      experimental data demonstrates that pre-treatment of zebrafish with Ketamine protects against&#xD;
      cardiac arrest induced brain injury by inhibiting Ca2+ wave propagation, which consequently&#xD;
      improves survival rate. Contrary to the results seen in these studies, two NMDA antagonist,&#xD;
      MK-801 and GPI-3000 in high doses did not improve survival rate and brain outcome after&#xD;
      cardiac arrest and resuscitation in a dog model. These studies did not suggest any mechanisms&#xD;
      of the negative results, but they contributed to a lack of interest for testing NMDA blockade&#xD;
      in CA for years. More recently, a study of the effects of using the noncompetitive NMDA&#xD;
      antagonist Ifenprodil demonstrated a significant reduction of brain oedema following&#xD;
      asphyxial cardiac arrest in rats. In this study, i.v. injection of Ifenprodil also resulted&#xD;
      in much more stable hemodynamic status after CA as compared with salt treated animals.&#xD;
      Another experimental study of different anaesthesia regimes in a rodent cardiac arrest model&#xD;
      also demonstrated much better hemodynamic status in the early post resuscitation period in&#xD;
      the rats treated with Ketamine and Medetomidine as compared to anaesthesia with Sevoflurane&#xD;
      and Fentanyl. All anaesthetics, with their ability to antagonise glutamate mediated&#xD;
      excitotoxicity and inflammation might be logical candidates for neuroprotective treatment&#xD;
      during cardiac arrest. However, the ability of anaesthetics to produce vasodilatation with a&#xD;
      significant reduction of blood perfusing pressure can be the main argument against the idea&#xD;
      to test their effects during cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in human. However, due to&#xD;
      their minimal influences on hemodynamic status in therapeutic doses, Ketamine as well as&#xD;
      Morphine can be considered as the safe candidates during neuroprotective treatment trials in&#xD;
      CPR patients. Another argument for possible application of Morphine or Ketamine during CPR&#xD;
      could be as an analgesic. Vigorous thoracic compression with possible trauma of the ribs may&#xD;
      lead to severe pain and stress reactions in patients surviving CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for analysing plasma levels of S-100B protein and NSE in this trial will be&#xD;
      their different distribution within the white (S100B protein) and grey (NSE) matter of the&#xD;
      brain, and the fact that both of them are extensively involved in the pathogenesis of anoxial&#xD;
      brain damage. S100 B protein is an intracellular calcium-binding dimer that has a molecular&#xD;
      weight of 21 kDa and two hours of half life. Thanks to the low molecular weight, S100 B&#xD;
      protein easily cross the blood-brain barrier and rapidly end up in the systemic circulation.&#xD;
      NSE is a neuronal isoform of the glycolytic enzyme enolase that has a molecular weight of 78&#xD;
      kDa and a twenty four hours half life. Further, NSE is extensively involved in glucose&#xD;
      metabolism in the neurones and can be detected only in neuronal and neuroendocrine tissues.&#xD;
      Due to this organ specificity, concentration of NSE in blood is often elevated as a result of&#xD;
      relative rapid and massive neuronal destruction. In clinical practice, elevated serum NSE&#xD;
      levels, above 30 ng/ml, correlate well with a poor outcome in coma, particularly when caused&#xD;
      by an hypoxic insult. Thus, these two markers of early neuronal damage is a good fit for&#xD;
      testing the neuroprotective features of Morphine or Ketamine application during CPR. A&#xD;
      retrospective evaluation of patients after cardiac arrest in the University hospital of&#xD;
      Northern Norway demonstrated significantly higher 1, 2, 3 and 28 days survival rate and&#xD;
      reduced duration of CPR in the patients additionally treated with opioids compared to&#xD;
      ordinary resuscitation. Two years later another retrospective, observational cohort study&#xD;
      from Pittsburgh, USA reported that despite poor baseline prognostic factors, survival after&#xD;
      recreational drug overdose-related cardiac arrests (CA) was no worse than after non&#xD;
      overdose-related arrest, and among survivors the majority had a good neurological outcome.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the same research group reported in one previous retrospective study a higher&#xD;
      rate of survival to hospital discharge (19% vs. 12%, p = 0.014) in the overdose CA group&#xD;
      compared to the non-overdoses one. However, patients in these overdose cases were&#xD;
      significantly younger (45 vs. 65, p &lt; 0.001), but less likely to be witnessed by a bystander&#xD;
      (29% vs. 41%, p &lt; 0.005). Suspected overdose cases had a higher overall chest compression&#xD;
      fraction (0.69 vs. 0.67, p = 0.018) and higher probability of adrenaline, sodium bicarbonate,&#xD;
      and atropine administration (p &lt; 0.001). Application of Naloxone in these overdose cases&#xD;
      might have had an influence on survival as well. One previously published clinical case&#xD;
      described full neurological recovery in a young man who overdosed on opioids and who regained&#xD;
      sinus rhythm many minutes after resuscitation had been abandoned. Based on all of the above,&#xD;
      it can be hypothesised that treatment with Morphine or Ketamine might have a beneficial&#xD;
      impact on the conservation of ATP in the brain, and thereby the treatment might increase the&#xD;
      ability of cerebral neurones to survive and regain ordinary function after CPR.&#xD;
