  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder&#xD;
      characterized by age inappropriate symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, or&#xD;
      both. The diagnosis of ADHD correlates with several negative outcomes during childhood,&#xD;
      adolescence and adulthood, creating huge direct and indirect costs for the health system. The&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD involves the use of pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic approaches, and&#xD;
      stimulant medications are the most commonly used. Although effective, stimulant medication&#xD;
      presents several limitations, reducing long-term adherence. Transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation (tDCS) is a neuromodulatory tool that has been shown to be effective for the&#xD;
      treatment of various neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous pilot studies applying tDCS in ADHD&#xD;
      patients showed conflicting results, and were characterized by heterogeneous methodologies.&#xD;
      This study aims at evaluating the effectiveness and safety of tDCS for improving attention in&#xD;
      adult ADHD patients by using a more strict methodology, based on a pilot study from our group&#xD;
      that showed promising results. Besides that, we aim at exploring the mechanisms of action&#xD;
      involved in the effect by using genomic and neuroimaging approaches. By using a computational&#xD;
      model, we will also measure the association between clinical response and electric field&#xD;
      density propagated with the use of tDCS in brain regions involved in attentional tasks. This&#xD;
      will be a phase II-III, parallel, with two intervention groups, randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled and double blind study. Only patients without current pharmacological&#xD;
      treatment for ADHD will be included in order to evaluate the effectiveness of tDCS as an&#xD;
      alternative treatment for the disorder. Patients will be randomized to receive tDCS&#xD;
      stimulation with either active or sham home-based devices. The stimulation protocol will&#xD;
      include one daily stimulation during the first 4 weeks, 2 weekly stimulations for the next 4&#xD;
      weeks, and one weekly stimulation over the last 4 weeks. After the end of the 12 weeks of&#xD;
      stimulation, patients will be followed-up during 6 months in order to observe for how long&#xD;
      the effects last. The primary outcome will be obtained after the first 4 weeks of&#xD;
      stimulation, with the use of a scale that evaluates inattention symptoms. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      the active tDCS will reduce inattention symptoms when compared to sham stimulation, and will&#xD;
      result in an increased activation of brain regions related to attention performance. In&#xD;
      exploratory analyses, by using genomic approaches, we will observe possible associations&#xD;
      between treatment response and specific genes, gene pools and polygenic risk scores. In&#xD;
      addition, a functional magnetic resonance imaging test will be performed at rest and during&#xD;
      both a sustained attention task (Sustained Attention Test), and a working memory task (N-back&#xD;
      Test). This will be performed in order to measure the effects of treatment in the activation&#xD;
      of brain regions related to attention performance before and after the first 4 weeks of&#xD;
      stimulation.&#xD;
