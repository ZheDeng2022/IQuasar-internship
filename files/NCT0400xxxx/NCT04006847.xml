  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II single site, open label clinical trial. The purpose of the Phase I&#xD;
      portion is to determine the safety, tolerability, and recommended Phase II dose of&#xD;
      Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) when given daily in combination with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor&#xD;
      (TKI) in subjects with Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic stable phase. The&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose will be the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of EPA as determined by&#xD;
      the evaluation of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs). The Phase II portion will subsequently&#xD;
      examine the Anti-CML effects of EPA when administered with a TKI at the recommended Phase II&#xD;
      dose. This efficacy objective will be done by evaluating BCR-ABL p210 quantitative PCR blood&#xD;
      levels every 3 months to 1 year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Targeting CML leukemia stem cells is of paramount importance in successfully preventing&#xD;
      cancer relapse. EPA metabolite, Δ12-PGJ3 may represent a new chemotherapeutic agent for&#xD;
      leukemia that targets leukemia stem cells. Selective targeting of cancer stem cells may be&#xD;
      potentially a highly effective treatment for cancer. As most CML patients treated with a TKI&#xD;
      will reach a complete cytogenetic response, quantification of residual BCR-ABL transcripts by&#xD;
      quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is a critical tool to further monitor&#xD;
      response kinetics. Addition of EPA to TKI may help decrease residual BCR-ABL positive (Ph+)&#xD;
      leukemia stem cells.&#xD;
