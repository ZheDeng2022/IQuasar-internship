  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AZD7594 is in clinical development for the treatment of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre, open-label, single period study in 6 healthy subjects, to determine&#xD;
      the mass balance recovery and generate samples to enable metabolite profiling and structural&#xD;
      identification of AZD7594.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive a single inhaled 792 µg nominal dose (720 µg delivered dose) of&#xD;
      AZD7594 followed by an IV dose of 30 µg [14C]AZD7594 containing not more than (NMT) 6.7 kBq&#xD;
      (180 nCi) carbon-14 (14C) as a 1 h infusion. The IV dose will be administered approximately&#xD;
      10 min after the inhaled dose. Subjects will remain resident in the clinical unit up to 168 h&#xD;
      post dose (up to Day 8).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, open-label, single period study in 6 healthy male and non-pregnant,&#xD;
      non-lactating female subjects to determine the mass balance recovery after a single&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) dose of [14C]AZD7594 and to generate samples to enable metabolite profiling&#xD;
      and structural identification of AZD7594 in plasma, urine and faeces. It is planned to enrol&#xD;
      6 subjects to ensure data in at least 4 evaluable subjects. A subject will be considered&#xD;
      evaluable if they have provided mass balance and PK samples for up to 48 h after drug&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened for eligibility to participate in the study up to 28 days before&#xD;
      dosing. Eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical unit in the afternoon on the day&#xD;
      before dosing (Day 1). Subjects will be dosed on the morning of Day 1 in the fasted state (8&#xD;
      h overnight fast). Before oral inhalation of AZD7594 using the Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI), all&#xD;
      subjects must demonstrate their ability to use the DPI as intended. Subjects will receive&#xD;
      training with an empty DPI at screening, Day -1 and pre-dose (optional) in accordance with&#xD;
      study specific instructions. Each subject will receive a single inhaled 792 µg nominal dose&#xD;
      (720 µg delivered dose) of AZD7594 followed by an IV dose of 30 µg [14C]AZD7594 containing&#xD;
      6.7 kBq (180 nCi) carbon-14 (14C) as a 1 h infusion. The infusion of the IV dose will be&#xD;
      started approximately 15 min after the inhaled dose. Subjects will remain resident in the&#xD;
      clinical unit up to 168 h post dose (up to Day 8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whole blood, plasma, urine and faeces will be collected from pre-dose until discharge (168 h&#xD;
      post-dose; Day 8). Any accidental sources of elimination (eg emesis) will be collected and&#xD;
      sent to the mass balance laboratory for total radioactivity analysis.&#xD;
