  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and safety of&#xD;
      single and multiple doses of exenatide once-weekly suspension via subcutaneous (SC) injection&#xD;
      using a pre-filled, single-dose autoinjector in male and female Chinese with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single- and multiple-dose, PK study in Chinese subjects with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Up to 30 patients may initially be enrolled to target at least 20 patients&#xD;
      completing the study. Up to 10 more patients (ie, 40 in total) may be subsequently recruited&#xD;
      to replace patients who discontinue, provided such discontinuations are not due to&#xD;
      significant (based on PI and Sponsor judgment) safety or tolerability issues. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will receive their first 2.0-mg dose of exenatide once-weekly suspension via&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SC) injection using a pre-filled, single-dose autoinjector at Visit 3 (Day&#xD;
      1).Blood samples will be drawn for up to 168 hours after the first dose on Day 1 to assess&#xD;
      single-dose PK for exenatide once-weekly suspension. Patients will receive the second dose of&#xD;
      the investigational product (IP) at Visit 6 (Day 8). Thereafter, patients will receive weekly&#xD;
      (±1 day) doses of IP up to Visit 18 (Week 14). Intensive and extended PK sampling will be&#xD;
      conducted after administration of the final dose (Dose 14) to assess multiple-dose PK for&#xD;
      exenatide once-weekly suspension. Follow-up observations will be conducted at Visits 22 to 29&#xD;
      (Weeks 15 to 26), with the final follow-up at/after Visit 29 (Week 26 ±2 days). During&#xD;
      follow-up period, Blood samples will be collected for PK analyses. Subjects will be monitored&#xD;
      closely for adverse events throughout the study.&#xD;
