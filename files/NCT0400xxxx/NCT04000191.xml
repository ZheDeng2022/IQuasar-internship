  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine, among patients receiving elective anorectal&#xD;
      surgery, does application of ice to the perianal area prior to the procedure, lead to use of&#xD;
      decreased amounts of intravenous (IV) anesthesia? Anorectal surgeries for hemorrhoids,&#xD;
      fistulas and fissures are done on an outpatient basis under monitored anesthesia care. This&#xD;
      means patients get sedating medications through an IV but often do not require intubation.&#xD;
      The difficulty with monitored anesthesia is balancing patient comfort against the risk of&#xD;
      apnea (not breathing due to over sedation). Application of ice to the perianal area may help&#xD;
      increase patient comfort, decrease the amounts of medications given for sedation and&#xD;
      therefore decrease risk and increase recovery from the anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design will be a randomized control trial of adults undergoing elective surgery for&#xD;
      hemorrhoids, fistulas, perianal/perirectal abscess and anal fissure. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1 to 1 ratio using a random number generator to two arms to the study - usual&#xD;
      care vs. usual care plus ice to numb the anal area prior to incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes will be measured the same day as the surgery. Prior to leaving the operating&#xD;
      room the anesthesia team will share with the surgeon the amount of each drug they&#xD;
      administered. A comfort score will be recorded by the study personnel in the recovery area&#xD;
      prior to discharge for each participant.&#xD;

    <description>A validated instrument that consists of a 10cm line will be used to assess post-operative discomfort. Each participant will be asked to make a mark on the line to indicate their level of pain. The left end of the line indicates a score of &quot;No Pain&quot; and the right end of the line indicates &quot;Worst Pain.&quot; The location of the mark will be measured and the pain score will be a ratio of the distance of the mark measured from the &quot;No Pain&quot; end over the total length of the line (10cm).</description>
