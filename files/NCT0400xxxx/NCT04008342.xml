    <textblock>
      Dementia is one of the main causes of disability in the elderly. It is characterized by&#xD;
      cognitive, functional and social impairment, as well as behavioral changes. Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms (NPS) are experienced by patients and observed by caregivers during the natural&#xD;
      course of dementia. These symptoms, such as apathy, depression and agitation, are a&#xD;
      heterogeneous group of noncognitive symptoms and behaviors. When these symptoms are present,&#xD;
      it is more likely that the elderly will be institutionalized as the caregivers will be&#xD;
      overloaded with demands. Pharmacological treatment presents little efficacy for the adequate&#xD;
      control of these symptoms, and nonpharmacological interventions have been recommended as the&#xD;
      first line of treatment. Multisensory stimulation (MSS), a nonpharmacological intervention,&#xD;
      is one of the possibilities for intervention in people with dementia and NPS. MSS aims to&#xD;
      stimulate the five primary senses, namely, hearing, sight, taste, smell and touch, through&#xD;
      pleasurable sensory experiences, in a safe and relaxed environment. This work aims to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of an MSS protocol in aged people with dementia living in long-term&#xD;
      care institutions in Brazil.&#xD;

      Background: Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in people with dementia frequently evolve with&#xD;
      progression of the disorder. Nonpharmacological interventions are the first-line treatment to&#xD;
      control NPS in dementia. Multisensory stimulation (MSS) is a nonpharmacological intervention&#xD;
      that is conducted by stimulating one or more of the five senses of the body with pleasant&#xD;
      sensory experiences. This work aims to investigate the effects of a MSS protocol in elderly&#xD;
      people with moderate to advanced dementia living in long-term care institutions in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A specific MSS protocol was developed by the researchers for the study. Sixty&#xD;
      elderly people with moderate to advanced dementia (Clinical Dementia Rating of 2 or 3 and a&#xD;
      Mini-Mental State Examination score â‰¤17) were randomly allocated to intervention (n=30) and&#xD;
      control (n=30) groups. The sample size estimation was established with a paired bilateral&#xD;
      t-test with a 0.05 significance level. This sample size would have 80% power to detect a mean&#xD;
      difference of 9.50 in the NPI scores from pre- to post-intervention and a standard deviation&#xD;
      of 17.28, as proposed by Fu et al. (2013). The intervention group participated in 16&#xD;
      individual 30-minute sessions over eight weeks in a quiet room, and the control group&#xD;
      received usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MSS program includes eight sessions. During these sessions, the five body senses (sight,&#xD;
      taste, hearing, smell, and feeling) are stimulated using songs, fruits, fiber optic lamps,&#xD;
      natural scents, among other stimuli, to promote interactions between the participants and the&#xD;
      therapist, as well as the objects. In each session, at least two senses are stimulated in a&#xD;
      safe, quiet and confidential environment. The sessions last 30 minutes and are conducted&#xD;
      twice a week, on the same day and time whenever possible. Nonetheless, the session can be&#xD;
      interrupted when the participant wishes or if the therapist observes that the patient is&#xD;
      uncomfortable. A nondirective approach and one-to-one intervention were adopted.The MSS&#xD;
      protocol was conducted by an occupational therapist. In this study, the eight-session&#xD;
      protocol was used twice, that is, the protocol was repeated from the ninth session forward,&#xD;
      but the protocol was customized for each participant by consideration of the participants'&#xD;
      interests in previous sessions and the protocol rules.&#xD;

    <description>The frequency and intensity of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) were assessed by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). The scale considered 12 domains and the total score (0-144) was calculated by multiplying the frequency (1-4) and the severiity (1-3) of the symptoms. A higher score indicated more severe NPS. Assessment results are presented for the total score and the four neuropsychiatric subsyndromes of the NPI: hyperactivity, psychosis, affective symptoms and apathy.</description>

    <description>The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) was employed to evaluate depressive symptoms. Each item was scored as zero (absent), one (mild), two (severe), or unable to evaluate, and the total score (0-38) was calculated by adding the item scores. The scale is divided into five subscales: mood-related signs, behavioral disturbance, physical signs, cyclic functions and ideational disturbance. The total score ranged from 0 to 38; a higher score indicated greater levels of depression.</description>
