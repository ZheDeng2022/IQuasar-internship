  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is intended to provide CAR-T cell therapy products for patients with severely&#xD;
      life-threatening relapsed and refractory hematological malignancies. These patients have been&#xD;
      previously treated sufficiently, currently have no other treatment methods available, and do&#xD;
      not meet the inclusion criteria of other clinical trial projects in the process of subject&#xD;
      recruitment or meet their exclusion criteria. This project is designed to meet the urgent&#xD;
      clinical needs of individual patients.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients suffering from a hematological malignancy that is severely life-threatening&#xD;
             or seriously affects the patient's quality of life and has no effective treatment&#xD;
             available, who not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for other clinical trials in&#xD;
             the process of subject recruitment, or who are unable to obtain other study drugs or&#xD;
             participate in clinical studies/trials for some reason (regional or time restriction,&#xD;
             etc., or the recruitment of subjects for clinical studies/trials has ended but the&#xD;
             drug has not yet been approved for marketing in China);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are definitely diagnosed with the corresponding target-positive relapsed&#xD;
             and refractory hematological malignancies, including but not limited to the following&#xD;
             circumstances:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who do not meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria for existing clinical&#xD;
                  trials, such as age &lt;18 years, ECOG &gt;1, extramedullary recurrence, persistent or&#xD;
                  repeatedly positive for minimal residual disease;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have relapsed after remission following CAR-T cell therapy, and are&#xD;
                  expected as judged by the investigator to benefit more from re-use of the same&#xD;
                  cell or sequential use of other CAR-T cells compared with the risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The quantity of CAR-T cells produced does not meet the release criteria of&#xD;
                  production quality inspection, but is &gt;0.1× 106/kg CAR positive T cells, and the&#xD;
                  investigator judges that the expected benefit of cell infusion is greater than&#xD;
                  the risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The disease progresses rapidly after cell collection and before infusion, and the&#xD;
                  investigator judges that the expected benefit of cell infusion is greater than&#xD;
                  the risk;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients who have relapsed after autologous/heterogeneous hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
                  transplantation (including those positive for minimal residual disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Other circumstances where the investigator judges that the expected benefit of&#xD;
                  cell infusion is greater than the risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with appropriate bone marrow reserve: such as lymphocyte count &gt;0.3×109/L;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with proper heart, lung, liver, kidney and coagulation functions;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The selected patients or their legal representatives voluntarily sign the informed&#xD;
             consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are positive for any of HIV antibody, TP antibody, HBsAg and HCV&#xD;
             antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of epilepsy or other central nervous system diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of currently uncontrollable serious active infections (e.g.,&#xD;
             sepsis, bacteremia, fungemia, viremia, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other conditions making the patients unsuitable for receiving cell&#xD;
             therapy as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
