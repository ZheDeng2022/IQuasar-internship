  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical emergency management is frequently associated with a combination of physical and&#xD;
      psychological stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stress is known to lead to a broad variety of changes in the physiology even extending&#xD;
      in the cardiovascular system. Both physical and psychological stress induces ECG changes.&#xD;
      These changes include not only arrhythmias but also deviations in ST-T segment representing&#xD;
      the phase of repolarization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about changes in ST-T segment are missing until now. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesise that ST-T deviations occur in emergency physicians during shift at an emergency&#xD;
      response car.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to show changes in ST-T segment a prospective observational trial will be conducted.&#xD;
      By using a 12 lead ECG Holter the investigators will obtain ECGs during shifts of emergency&#xD;
      physicians at an emergency response vehicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During 12-hour shifts emergency physicians will be attached to the 12 lead Holter ECG. ECGs&#xD;
      will be analysed after blinding of names and reason of call (code) to the investigators. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be ST-T segment changes greater than 0.1mV in two corresponding leads&#xD;
      for more than 30 seconds per 100 calls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary outcomes, other ECG changes such as ST-T segment changes &lt;0.1mV, T wave&#xD;
      inversion or HRV will be analysed. Furthermore, surrogate parameter of stress will be&#xD;
      measured using NASA-Task Load Index and cognitive appraisal and correlated to ST-T segment&#xD;
      changes. Correlations between different phases of calls, different indications of calls and&#xD;
      ECG changes will be assessed. Furthermore, correlation between alarm codes apriori defined as&#xD;
      stressfull using a delphi process and ST-T segment changes as well es surrogate parameters of&#xD;
      stress will be assessed.&#xD;
