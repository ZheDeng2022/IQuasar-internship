  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BRITEPath (BP) aims to support co-located mental health clinicians in the development of a&#xD;
      high quality, effective, and personalized safety plan for referred patients who screen&#xD;
      positive for depression and/or suicidal ideation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRITEPath utilizes BRITE, a safety planning and emotion regulation app that is loaded on the&#xD;
      patient's smart phone and has previously been shown to be well accepted and to reduce suicide&#xD;
      attempts compared to usual care in psychiatric inpatients (HR = 0.49). To support mental&#xD;
      health clinicians in the development of effective safety plans, study investigators will&#xD;
      develop Guide2Brite (G2B), which provides step-by-step instructions for the mental health&#xD;
      clinician on how to populate BRITE onto the patient's smartphone and BRITEBoard, a clinician&#xD;
      dashboard that tracks patient symptoms, app use, and rating on helpfulness of different&#xD;
      interventions assessed through BRITE.&#xD;

      Delivery of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BRITEPath has 3 components:1) BRITE, an emotion regulation and safety planning phone app that&#xD;
      is delivered by a co-located mental health (MH) clinician to adolescents at the time of their&#xD;
      first therapy appointment; 2) Guide2Brite, which will guide the co-located MH clinician in&#xD;
      working with the adolescent to population content onto BRITE; and 3) BRITEBoard, which is a&#xD;
      clinician dashboard delivered to the MH clinician and PCP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assignment of Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilized an open trial design. A stepped wedge design was originally proposed and&#xD;
      efforts were made to adhere to this study design, however after a year of low recruitment and&#xD;
      resultant recruitment sites pulling out the of the study, the overall study design was&#xD;
      changed to an open trial. Additional recruitment sites were onboarded to the study and&#xD;
      provided with the intervention arm in order to obtain feasibility data on the intervention&#xD;
      components of the study. As a result of the change, there are some TAU participants included&#xD;
      in this study. For reference a stepped wedge design involves the sequential random rollout of&#xD;
      an intervention over two time periods. Following a baseline period in which no clusters&#xD;
      (=practices) are exposed to the intervention, the crossover is typically in one direction,&#xD;
      from control to intervention and continues until both of the clusters have crossed-over to&#xD;
      receive the intervention, with observations taken from each cluster and at each time period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators will pilot BRITEPath in community pediatric and mental health practices&#xD;
      using a stepped wedge design (n =50 adolescents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The use of BRITEPath will decrease depressive symptoms, distress, and suicidality&#xD;
      (any self-injurious ideation, urges, or behavior) as well as improve overall functioning&#xD;
      compared to TAU.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Ultimately, this study design was an open trial after unsuccessful attempts to maintain initial recruitment sites in the study.&#xD;
This study initially attempted to use a stepped wedge design, which involves the sequential random rollout of an intervention over 2 time periods.

    <description>Satisfaction to BRITEPath will be assessed through questions developed by investigators to understand experience with the program. Questions investigators have adapted from literature reviews on satisfaction include: &quot;If a friend were in need of mental health care for depression or suicidal thoughts or behaviors, would you recommend BRITEPath to help him/her manage symptoms?; How satisfied are you with the amount of help you received?; Have the services you received helped you to deal more effectively with your problems?.
