  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Previous studies have reported that intermittent hypoxia in obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea (OSA) is associated with tumor progression, metastasis and treatment outcomes. However,&#xD;
      studies explaining the relationships between specific types of cancer and OSA are needed. In&#xD;
      this study, it is aimed to show the effect of excessive daytime sleepiness as determined by&#xD;
      Epworth sleepiness scale(ESS) and the effect of OSA risk determined by STOP BANG&#xD;
      questionnaire on survival and treatment outcomes in lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The patients who admit the palliative care outpatient clinic of our hospital with the&#xD;
      diagnosis of lung cancer (stage 3 and stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer or limited /&#xD;
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer) between July 2019-2020 will be assessed for excessive&#xD;
      daytime sleepiness(EDS) and risk of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by Epworth sleepiness scale&#xD;
      and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. The patients will be grouped according to the risk of OSA&#xD;
      and EDS.Total / progression-free survival, treatment outcomes and side effects of the&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated comparatively.&#xD;

      The patients who admit the palliative care outpatient clinic of our hospital with the&#xD;
      diagnosis of lung cancer (stage 3 and stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer or limited /&#xD;
      extensive stage small cell lung cancer) between July 2019-2020 prior to the treatment and the&#xD;
      patient who has not yet completed the first-line chemotherapy with a weight loss &lt;10% will be&#xD;
      invited to fill the Epworth sleepiness scale and the STOP-BANG questionnaire. Patients'&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI, fat-free BMI, neck circumference) will be&#xD;
      taken. The treatment outcomes and side-effects in patients with EDS and moderate / high risk&#xD;
      for OSA will be compared with patients with low OSA risk. Demographic information (age,&#xD;
      gender, smoking history), anthropometric measurements (height, weight, body mass index, fat&#xD;
      free body mass index, neck circumference), clinical information (snoring, witnessed apnea,&#xD;
      daytime excessive sleep presence of symptoms of symptoms, pulmonary function tests,&#xD;
      radiological TNM stages, diagnostic method, diagnosis date, fiberoptic bronchoscopy findings,&#xD;
      ECOG performance status, treatment results, treatment-related side effects) laboratory values&#xD;
      (complete blood count results albumin, lactate dehydrogenase level) and the results of&#xD;
      Epworth sleepiness scale and of STOP-BANG questionnaire will be recorded.&#xD;

    <description>Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self-administered questionnaire with 8 questions by which daytime sleepiness in eight different activities is assessed on a 4-point scale (0-3). The ESS score can range from 0 to 24. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person's 'daytime sleepiness'. ESS score ≥ 10 will be used to indicate excessive daytime sleepiness.</description>
