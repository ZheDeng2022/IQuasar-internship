  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of VT ablation guided by functional&#xD;
      evaluation of the substrate to specifically target the reentry-vulnerable zones in patients&#xD;
      with infarct-related VT.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Activation mapping of VT is the gold-standard method for description of the reentrant circuit&#xD;
      and identification of its isthmus, however this is uncommonly accomplished due to hemodynamic&#xD;
      non-tolerance and limited temporal and spatial resolution. Substrate mapping has been&#xD;
      developed as an alternative method to identify the isthmus of post-infarction VT during sinus&#xD;
      rhythm (SR). However, it has limited specificity to critical VT sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundamental work in animal models of healed infarction and humans has shown that the VT&#xD;
      isthmus corresponds to locations characterized by marked activation slowing during SR.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these locations serve as &quot;anchors&quot; for multiple VT morphologies and cycle&#xD;
      lengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is that activation mapping during SR or pacing can improve the&#xD;
      specifically for identifying the critical VT sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this prospective, multi-center controlled study is to evaluate the utility and&#xD;
      limitations of functional mapping for guiding ablation of reentry vulnerably zones for&#xD;
      long-term control of VT&#xD;

    <description>The left ventricle is mapped during atrial and right or left ventricular pacing (site close to the infarct) at a similar cycle length of 600ms. Radio-frequency ablation is performed selectively in areas of activation slowing (defined as ≤40ms per 5mm while voltage abnormalities and late potentials were not specifically targeted.</description>
