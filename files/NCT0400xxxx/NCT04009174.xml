      This is a non-randomized, prospective trial of men who are scheduled for radical&#xD;
      prostatectomy for treatment of prostate cancer, or repeat biopsy for localized prostate&#xD;
      cancer as standard of care and who will undergo a series of pre-operative multi-modality&#xD;
      imaging studies. Post intervention, hybrid imaging maps (HIM) will be generated and the&#xD;
      predictions of the HIM (3D location, volume and grade of cancer) will be correlated with&#xD;
      actual pathology results to gauge the performance of the HIM in both radical prostatectomy&#xD;
      and biopsy settings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study was built on our first study (IGPC-1, REB number 15551) which acquired&#xD;
      multi-modality imaging in 36 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. We successfully&#xD;
      demonstrated the ability to accurately co-register pre-operative multi-modality images (MRI:&#xD;
      T1, T2, Diffusion Weighed (DW), Dynamic Contrast enhanced (DCE); Dynamic Contrast Enhanced&#xD;
      CT, 3D Ultrasound with post-operative whole mount pathology specimens. We have developed a&#xD;
      platform for the segmentation of prostate cancer on the whole mount pathology specimens and&#xD;
      are in the process of analyzing the data to develop a hybrid imaging map (HIM) of prostate&#xD;
      cancer distribution (location and grade) based on the correlation of the pre-operative&#xD;
      imaging signals and the post-operative pathology (citation provided below). The HIM will need&#xD;
      subsequent validation in a separate cohort of radical prostatectomy patients and evaluated as&#xD;
      to its ability to be incorporated as a targeting tool for prostate interventions such as&#xD;
      prostate biopsy and this is the purpose of this follow-up study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the IGPC-2 study, pre-operative imaging panels were successfully obtained in 24 patients&#xD;
      accrued to cohort 1. The protocol was then amended to include [18-F]-DCFPyl instead of&#xD;
      [18F]-FCH. [18-F]-DCFPyl was a newer PET probe that may possess superior performance because&#xD;
      it is directed against prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a protein commonly&#xD;
      expressed on prostate cancer cells. Imaging-pathology correlations in the first 6 patients&#xD;
      imaged with [18-F]-DCFPyl were compared to the correlations obtained with [18F]-FCH imaging&#xD;
      in the first 24 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IGPC-2 Cohort 1 (Radical Prostatectomy) was expanded to provide an additional 20 men imaged&#xD;
      with [18-F]-DCFPyl as part of the imaging panel. The goal was to acquire 24 complete imaging&#xD;
      datasets with [18-F]-DCFPyl as the PET imaging agent to enable us to draw comparisons with&#xD;
      the 24 [18F]-FCH imaging data sets acquired.&#xD;
