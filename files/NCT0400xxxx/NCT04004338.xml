  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Carfilzomib is approved in Turkey for the treatment of adult relapsed multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients who have received at least one prior treatment. It is approved for use in&#xD;
      combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) in and with dexamethasone alone (Kd).&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to describe contemporary, real-world patterns of patient&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical disease presentation, prior therapeutic regimen chosen, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) who&#xD;
      receive Carfilzomib combination treatment. Real-world evidence is crucial to understand how&#xD;
      carfilzomib-based regimens are used in practice and in relation to local prescribing&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include patients with relapsed/refractory MM who have received 1 to&#xD;
      3 prior lines of therapy with documented data in the medical record regarding diagnosis&#xD;
      (month and year), the regimens used in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line as applicable, whether stem&#xD;
      cell transplant was part of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line of therapy at participating clinical sites&#xD;
      in Turkey.&#xD;

      Carfilzomib is approved in Turkey for the treatment of adult relapsed multiple myeloma&#xD;
      patients who have received at least one prior treatment. It is approved for use in&#xD;
      combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (KRd) in and with dexamethasone alone (Kd).&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to describe contemporary, real-world patterns of patient&#xD;
      characteristics, clinical disease presentation, prior therapeutic regimen chosen, and&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in participants with relapsed/refractory (R/R) multiple myeloma (MM) who&#xD;
      receive Carfilzomib combination treatment. Real-world evidence is crucial to understand how&#xD;
      carfilzomib-based regimens are used in practice and in relation to local prescribing&#xD;
      information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include patients with relapsed/refractory MM who have received 1 to&#xD;
      3 prior lines of therapy with documented data in the medical record regarding diagnosis&#xD;
      (month and year), the regimens used in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line as applicable, whether stem&#xD;
      cell transplant was part of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd line of therapy at participating clinical sites&#xD;
      in Turkey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the primary and secondary objectives, analyses will be descriptive and include&#xD;
      estimations; no formal hypotheses will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 300 participants. This multi-center trial will be conducted in Turkish&#xD;
      Hematology clinics. The overall time to participate in this study is 12 months. Participants&#xD;
      will be evaluated and followed-up for a period of at 12 months, until death, are lost to&#xD;
      follow-up, or the end of the study, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All hematology centers that treat MM will be eligible for participation in this study; it is&#xD;
      likely that most participating sites will be academic institutions and/or large specialized&#xD;
      hematology centers that treat a relatively high volume of patients with MM. It is estimated&#xD;
      that a selection of 20 sites will be required to achieve a target of 300 patients in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that 300 RR MM patients receiving treatment will be included in the study. It&#xD;
      is expected that this sample size will provide acceptable precision around the estimates of&#xD;
      the primary and secondary study outcomes.&#xD;
