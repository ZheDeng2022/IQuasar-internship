  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of patients with advanced cancer also suffer from cachexia. Cachexia is a&#xD;
      syndrome characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass (with/or without loss of fat mass)&#xD;
      that cannot be reversed by nutritional support and progressively leads to functional&#xD;
      impairment. Patients who suffer from anorexia and cachexia have lower survival rates. Some&#xD;
      patients with cancer use cannabis to improve the way they feel and relieve their pain.&#xD;
      However, there is very sparse high-quality research to prove that cannabis products are truly&#xD;
      effective. This study will investigate patients with advanced cancer who use inhaled&#xD;
      therapeutic cannabinoid-based medication (PPP011), in addition to palliative care management,&#xD;
      and will assess if these patients experience improvement in functional status as a surrogate&#xD;
      endpoint for survivalquality&#xD;

      This is a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the safety and efficacy of inhaled PPP011 on physical functioning and cachexia&#xD;
      progression in patients with cachexia related to advanced incurable cancer.&#xD;
