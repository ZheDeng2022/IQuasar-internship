  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well topical afimoxifene works in treating patients with&#xD;
      breast cancer who have undergone radiation therapy on one breast. Topical afimoxifene is a&#xD;
      quick-drying medicated gel that may block the growth of breast cancer cells when applied to&#xD;
      the breast skin. The purpose of this research is to determine what effect, if any,&#xD;
      differences in skin type between women have on the delivery of topical afimoxifene to the&#xD;
      breast tissue, and whether radiation affects the delivery of topical afimoxifene to breast&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the skin features that drive inter-individual variation in dermal drug&#xD;
      permeation between individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To relate breast tissue drug concentration to skin histology, skin vascularity, skin&#xD;
      transporter proteins, and skin features measured using confocal reflectance microscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the feasibility of transdermal drug delivery to the radiated breast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients apply afimoxifene gel topically once daily (QD) to both breasts for 4 weeks and then&#xD;
      undergo core needle biopsies of both breasts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive follow up phone call 21-35 days after biopsy.&#xD;

    <description>Tissue drug concentrations will be compared between radiated and non-radiated breasts using a mixed linear model, with breast radiation status as a fixed effect of interest and person as a random effect.

&#xD;
               -  Note: The upper limit for interval since RT will be 5 years, since oral endocrine&#xD;
                  therapy (OET) for DCIS is usually administered during the 5 years that follow the&#xD;
                  end of RT.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent prior to registration on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
