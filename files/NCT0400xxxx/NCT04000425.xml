      This study is designed to evaluate the potential clinical utility of ctDNA in the field of&#xD;
      gastric cancer treatment,especially the usage of an indicator of MRD(minimal residual&#xD;
      disease) in post radical gastrectomy patients. The primary purpose of this trial is to&#xD;
      demonstrate if the postoperative ctDNA analysis could be used as an indicator of MRD or&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy response in advanced gastric cancer after radical gastrectomy.The&#xD;
      second purpose is to describe the profile of ctDNA in gastric cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is an important health problem, being the fifth most common cancer and the&#xD;
      third leading cause of cancer related death worldwide.Incidence shows clear regional and sex&#xD;
      variations-rates are highest in Eastern Asia, Eastern Europe, and South America and lowest in&#xD;
      Northern and Southern Africa. In China, gastric cancer accounts for nearly 16% of all&#xD;
      malignant tumors and more than 80% of gastric cancer are in advanced stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minimal residual disease (MRD) was proposed to describe the remaining tumor cells after&#xD;
      treatment with curative intent. For curable gastric cancer, MRD means residential cancer&#xD;
      cells after radical gastrectomy which share phenotypic similarity and genetic heritage with&#xD;
      the original tumor. Treating MRD can increase the rates of cure had been supported by the&#xD;
      experience of using adjuvant therapy for some type of solid tumor (for example, colorectal&#xD;
      cancer, breast cancer). The challenge in monitoring the MRD in gastric cancer patients is&#xD;
      that there is no very sensitive method. Computed tomography(CT) and blood tumor markers are&#xD;
      either difficult to detect peritonial dissemination, the most frequent recurrent pattern in&#xD;
      gastric caner or with limited sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor-specific DNA mutations detected in the cell-free component of peripheral blood, which&#xD;
      is known as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), in most patients, allow for the noninvasive&#xD;
      molecular characterization detection of tumors, including genetic changes that are revealed&#xD;
      by the selective pressure of adjuvant therapies. Considering the origin of ctDNA, it can be&#xD;
      from different subclones of primary tumor or both primary and metastatic tumors, the ctDNA&#xD;
      may overcome the problems caused by tumor heterogeneity. Additionally, the short half-life of&#xD;
      ctDNA, about 2 hours, makes ctDNA an ideal dynamic marker of tumor bulk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the ctDNA is a good candidate to be a new kind of blood tumor marker. The&#xD;
      preliminary studies had shown very good prospects in some tumors, including breast caner and&#xD;
      colon cancer.But little was known in gastric cancer, so we designed this study to demonstrate&#xD;
      the potential clinical utility of ctDNA in the field of gastric cancer treatment, especially&#xD;
      the usage of an indicator of MRD in post radical gastrectomy patients.&#xD;
