      Abstract&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Postpartum contraception is important to prevent unintended and closely spaced&#xD;
      pregnancies following childbirth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study is a cluster-randomized trial of communities in rural Guatemala where&#xD;
      women receive ante- and postnatal care through a community-based nursing program. When nurses&#xD;
      visit women for their postpartum visit in the intervention clusters, instead of providing&#xD;
      only routine care that includes postpartum contraceptive education and counseling, the nurses&#xD;
      will also bring a range of barrier, short-acting, and long-acting contraceptives that will be&#xD;
      offered and administered in the home setting, after routine clinical care is provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: A barrier to postpartum contraception is access to medications and devices. The&#xD;
      study removes some access barriers (distance, time, cost) by providing contraception in the&#xD;
      home. The community nurses were trained to place implants, which are a type of long-acting&#xD;
      reversible contraceptive method that was previously only available in the closest town, which&#xD;
      is about an hour away by vehicle. Therefore, the study examines how home-based delivery of&#xD;
      routinely available contraceptives and the less routinely available implant may be associated&#xD;
      with increased uptake of postpartum contraception within three months of childbirth. The&#xD;
      potential implications of this study include: nurses may be able to be trained to safely&#xD;
      provide contraceptives, including place implants, in the home setting, and provision of&#xD;
      home-based contraception may be an effective way of delivering an evidence-based intervention&#xD;
      for preventing unintended and closely spaced pregnancies in the postpartum period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and Rationale: Postpartum contraception is important to prevent unintended and&#xD;
      closely spaced pregnancies following childbirth as well as to avoid future pregnancy in&#xD;
      mothers who have achieved their desired family size. Proper pregnancy spacing can prevent&#xD;
      maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Globally, there is significant unmet need for&#xD;
      postpartum contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, in the community of interest, which is in the rural Southwest corner of&#xD;
      Guatemala bordering Mexico, a large majority (88%) of a convenience sample of women in the&#xD;
      community-based care program self-reported postpartum contraceptive use. However, 72% of&#xD;
      these women were using injectable contraceptives, which are considered short-acting, and are&#xD;
      less effective at preventing unintended and closely spaced pregnancies; the second most&#xD;
      common method was sterilization (21%). For the remaining women who did not seek sterilization&#xD;
      or injectable contraceptives, 0.5% of them reportedly used contraceptive pills, 0.5% condoms,&#xD;
      0.5% lactational amenorrhea, and 1.6% reportedly relied on natural family planning. Less than&#xD;
      4% of women were using long-acting reversible contraceptives (intrauterine devices or&#xD;
      implants), which are more effective at preventing unintended and closely spaced pregnancies&#xD;
      than injectables. The providers in the community had not been trained in implant and&#xD;
      intrauterine device placement, so the closest place to have a device placed was the most&#xD;
      proximate town to the communities, which is an hour away by vehicle. Additional barriers&#xD;
      discovered through qualitative research in the study communities found that barriers to&#xD;
      family planning use historically included knowledge, access to methods, fear of adverse&#xD;
      events, and a woman garnering her partner's approval. Community women's ideas for future&#xD;
      educational programming included teaching about how birth control methods work, how to talk&#xD;
      to partners about birth spacing, and myth debunking, and they requested the location and time&#xD;
      of teaching to occur at peripartum and pediatric visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, based on this preliminary data, the prospective research question is: if&#xD;
      community-based nurses are trained to place contraceptive implants, and they offer women&#xD;
      placement in the home at their postpartum visit (among other routinely available&#xD;
      contraceptive methods), will the ability to provide this service increase the uptake of&#xD;
      contraceptive implants in our communities of interest?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives or Hypotheses: The specific objective of the study is to observe in this&#xD;
      population where use of postpartum contraception is historically common among women, does&#xD;
      home delivery of the contraceptive implant increase utilization of the device above the&#xD;
      baseline rate of 3.2%. The investigators hypothesize, based on published data from other&#xD;
      settings, that if women receive proper counseling about all contraceptive methods, uptake of&#xD;
      long-acting reversible contraceptives, which in this study includes only the contraceptive&#xD;
      implant, is about 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to observe if the home-based contraceptive delivery intervention&#xD;
      featured in this study is associated with overall increased contraceptive uptake,&#xD;
      continuation, and satisfaction in the intervention compared to the control clusters. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that with increased uptake of the implant there will be longer continuation&#xD;
      rates and more satisfaction in the intervention clusters. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that increased contraceptive uptake, continuation, and satisfaction may be associated with&#xD;
      reduced short interval repeat pregnancy rates so the study also aims to survey participants&#xD;
      on their pregnancy status at enrollment, and three- and twelve-months after enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: The protocol features an interventional, cluster-randomized, unmasked, parallel&#xD;
      group trial design. The eight study communities were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to&#xD;
      either the intervention or control arms of the study, and the study is designed on a&#xD;
      superiority framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting: The study setting is in the home of women enrolled in the &quot;Madres Sanas&quot;&#xD;
      community-based nursing program offered by the Fundaci√≥n para la Salud Integral de los&#xD;
      Guatemaltecos (FSIG). FSIG supports a community-based clinic called the Center for Human&#xD;
      Development in a region of Guatemala informally referred to as the Southwest Trifinio. This&#xD;
      region is at the intersection of the boundaries of three departments in Guatemala, and as&#xD;
      such no single Department takes responsibility for the health of the migrant workers that&#xD;
      reside there. The impoverished area has a population of around 25,000 people and experiences&#xD;
      poor pregnancy outcomes. This is why the University of Colorado Center for Global Health, in&#xD;
      partnership with AgroAmerica, built the Center for Human Development clinic and initiated the&#xD;
      community-based maternal and perinatal care programs, called Madres Sanas and Ninos Sanos,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Madres Sanas is executed by teams of community nurses. The nurse teams are comprised of two&#xD;
      nurses, who are responsible for a segment of the communities in the region. There are ten&#xD;
      communities in the Madres Sanas program that were combined into eight clusters; our&#xD;
      biostastician did this in order to achieve similar cluster sizes, which was determined by the&#xD;
      number of births in the communities in 2017. Because our study enrolls women at their final&#xD;
      Madres Sanas visit, which is a postpartum visit that occurs about forty days out from&#xD;
      delivery, the cluster size was based on delivery volume of the communities. The nurse teams&#xD;
      are assigned by the nursing supervisor to their respective communities. They drive auto&#xD;
      rickshaws provided by the Center for Human Development out to the communities to conduct&#xD;
      their home visits, which include four antenatal visits and two postpartum visits. During the&#xD;
      visits the nurses both provide clinical care and collect quality improvement and research&#xD;
      data, and as such serve a dual function in their role. As noted, this study takes place at&#xD;
      the final Madres Sanas visit, which occurs forty days after delivery. Routine clinical care,&#xD;
      including postpartum contraceptive education, culminates at this time, although counseling on&#xD;
      postpartum contraception begins at the enrollment visit. After routine clinical care is&#xD;
      provided, the nurses offer enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: All study activities and procedures begin at the forty-day postpartum visit,&#xD;
      which is the sixth and final scheduled visit of the Madres Sanas program. At this visit the&#xD;
      community nurses perform routine maternal and neonatal clinical care, which includes amongst&#xD;
      other activities, final counseling and education about postpartum contraception. In&#xD;
      intervention clusters, nurse teams bring a kit with them to the visit. After the visit they&#xD;
      describe the study and offer consent. Once a woman has discussed the risks, benefits, and&#xD;
      alternatives with her providers and determines she wishes to participate in the study, she&#xD;
      signs the consent form and the nurses offer her condoms, contraceptive pills, a&#xD;
      medroxyprogesterone contraceptive injection, or the levonorgestrel implant. The kit is&#xD;
      stocked with 10 condoms, one pack of pills, one syringe of medroxyprogesterone, and one&#xD;
      implant for each postpartum visit planned for that day. It also contains all the necessary&#xD;
      materials to place the implant or administer the injection under sterile conditions, such as&#xD;
      alcohol swabs and sterile gloves, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All contraceptives are purchased using study funds and are sourced from a local provider of&#xD;
      contraceptive medications and devices. All contraceptives are routinely available and&#xD;
      approved for distribution in Guatemala. Because these are routinely available medications and&#xD;
      the study does not testing their effectiveness as contraceptives, there are no criteria for&#xD;
      discontinuing or modifying allocated interventions for a given trial participant such as&#xD;
      changing the drug dosing. Women are, however, screened for contraindications to the&#xD;
      contraceptive methods provided using the Medical Eligibility Criteria. The nurses have the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria chart in Spanish, laminated, and included in their kit for use during&#xD;
      study enrollment. As this is a pragmatic trial, there are no restrictions on care and&#xD;
      interventions that are permitted or prohibited during the trial. For example, if a&#xD;
      participant did not initiate a contraceptive method and wishes to, she can seek the method in&#xD;
      the community. Conversely, if she chose a method and opted for the implant but does not like&#xD;
      it, she is free to remove it at any time. The nurses will either remove it in the home&#xD;
      setting or advise the woman to present to the Center for Human Development where they can&#xD;
      remove it and potentially initiate a new method. The initial contraceptive provided in the&#xD;
      study setting is free, but any contraceptives sought or utilized after the study enrollment&#xD;
      visit is the woman's responsibility to locate and finance. Study contraceptives are only&#xD;
      provided in the home setting by the nurses at the enrollment visit and are not available or&#xD;
      offered at any subsequent visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Methods: Quality improvement data from prior to study initiation was&#xD;
      collected from June 2017 - September 2018 by the Madres Sanas community nurses. This database&#xD;
      includes antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum quality improvement data collected by the&#xD;
      community nurses during routine antenatal and postnatal care visits. The data is collected on&#xD;
      tablets and transmitted through the application REDCap. REDCap (Research Electronic Data&#xD;
      Capture) is a secure, HIPAA-compliant web-based application designed for data collection for&#xD;
      research studies. It provides an easy-to-use data entry system with data validation, the&#xD;
      ability to import data from external sources (Guatemala), automated exports to statistical&#xD;
      software, audit trails, branching logic and calculations, and sophisticated tool for building&#xD;
      and managing online surveys. As the community nurses have been using this software for years,&#xD;
      our study links to the Madres Sanas dataset, but involves separate forms in a separate REDCap&#xD;
      database. Just as the nurses prompt women during routine visits and collect general pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes data for our quality improvement database, so will they use REDCap and the same&#xD;
      methods to collect enrollment and follow-up on participants and transmit the data to password&#xD;
      protected servers at the University of Colorado. There are cluster-specific REDCap forms that&#xD;
      are collected on enrollment, at three months, and at twelve months following enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods: To analyze our primary outcome the investigators are planning a&#xD;
      difference in differences analysis of the proportion of women actively using a contraceptive&#xD;
      implant three months after enrollment in intervention clusters as compared to control&#xD;
      clusters. The investigators plan to provide an unadjusted analysis and an adjusted analysis&#xD;
      for any cluster characteristics that are imbalanced between the two study arms. Once the&#xD;
      primary outcome is assessed, the investigators will likely use multivariate modeling to&#xD;
      determine characteristics of women, in each study arm, who used any postpartum contraception&#xD;
      within three months of delivery as compared to those who didn't, in both adjusted and&#xD;
      unadjusted analysis. The plan is to use descriptive statistics to compare the other secondary&#xD;
      outcomes between study arms (continuation and satisfaction). Finally, analysts will likely&#xD;
      perform survival analysis of time to repeat pregnancy by study arm to observe if there is any&#xD;
      statistically significant difference in the time to repeat pregnancy of women who became&#xD;
      pregnant by twelve months in the study groups. In summary, our analysis plans a difference in&#xD;
      differences analysis for our primary outcome, bivariate and multivariate analyses for our&#xD;
      secondary outcome of any contraception use by study arm, descriptive statistics for our&#xD;
      secondary outcomes of continuation and satisfaction rates among contraceptive users by study&#xD;
      arm, and a survival analysis for time to repeat pregnancy by study arm.&#xD;
