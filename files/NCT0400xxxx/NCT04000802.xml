    <textblock>
      Nowadays, the recommended approach for decision-making for oncology patients is based on&#xD;
      multidisciplinary meetings (MDT). However, the quality of decision-making during MDT depends&#xD;
      on other factors such as the quality of presentation of clinical cases, the degree of&#xD;
      participation of different specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the decision-making during digestive oncology&#xD;
      MDT using the validated &quot;Metric Of Decision-Making&quot; tool (MDT-MODe), in the national&#xD;
      institute of oncology (Rabat, Morocco).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Multidisciplinary cancer meetings are a multidisciplinary discussion and decision-making&#xD;
      process for a patient with cancer. It allows a sharing of knowledge and decision-making,&#xD;
      taking into account the opinion of all the specialists involved in the treatment of cancer,&#xD;
      in order to propose the best possible decision for the patient. Nevertheless, the quality of&#xD;
      decision-making during CPR depends on other factors such as the quality of presentation of&#xD;
      clinical cases, the degree of participation of different specialists and the dynamics of&#xD;
      meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several validated tools for the quantitative assessment of the decision-making mode&#xD;
      during CPRs. The best known is the Metric Of Decision-Making (MDT-MODe). MDT-MODe is a&#xD;
      validated tool for the observational evaluation of teamwork and the quality of&#xD;
      decision-making during cancer CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDT-MODe is designed to encourage teams to make holistic decisions tailored to each patient&#xD;
      and allows an observer to assess, on a case-by-case basis, in a quantitative and objective&#xD;
      way:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of the clinical information (antecedents, radiological pathologies, pathological,&#xD;
      comorbid, psychosocial problems and patients' points of view) Contribution to decision-making&#xD;
      in teams of key professional groups (surgeons, physicians, oncologists, nurses, health&#xD;
      professionals, radiologists, pathologists) Taken together, these notes provide an indication&#xD;
      of the quality of team decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the decision-making during digestive oncology&#xD;
      MDT using the validated &quot;Metric Of Decision-Making&quot; tool (MDT-MODe), in the national&#xD;
      institute of oncology (Rabat, Morocco).&#xD;

    <description>The scores of the Metric Of Decision-Making tool during multidisciplinary team meeting for digestive cancer. The instrument include 10 questions rated from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate better results. The instrument include questions about the quality of clinical information (History, radiological, pathological, comorbid health conditions, psychosocial issues, and patients' views) and the contribution to team decision making of key professional groups (Surgeons, physicians, oncologists, nurses, allied healthcare professionals, radiologists, pathologists and MDT coordinators) ans a question about the decision (Clear, deferred, no decision. Each question is analyzed separately (mean, median, standard deviation, quartiles).</description>
