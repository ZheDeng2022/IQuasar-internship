  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of either morning or evening&#xD;
      time-restricted feeding on body composition in sedentary, breakfast eating overweight and&#xD;
      obese adults. Three parallel groups were assigned to either morning fasting (MF), evening&#xD;
      fasting (EF), or a control group and asked to do the intervention for 6 weeks. Changes in&#xD;
      body composition (change in weight, percent body fat percent, and percent lean body mass) are&#xD;
      the primary outcome, and hunger and satiety ratings and physical activity are secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures.&#xD;
