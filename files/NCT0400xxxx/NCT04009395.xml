  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is on the increase and black Africans in the United Kingdom (UK) make up a&#xD;
      significant part of this population (32%). Weight retention after pregnancy is considered as&#xD;
      one of the leading causes of obesity. African women living in high-income countries have been&#xD;
      found to experience more weight retention after pregnancy than Caucasian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy eating guidelines have been provided in pregnancy in the UK (National Institute for&#xD;
      Health and Care Excellence) and midwives have been placed to provide healthy eating advice in&#xD;
      pregnancy, but some studies have identified that African migrants in the UK often eat and&#xD;
      prepare food in a different way to the traditional British approach. It has also been&#xD;
      observed that the recommended advice for pregnant women, for example, the Eat well plate and&#xD;
      start4life are focused on traditional British foods and cooking patterns and do not include&#xD;
      food that would be familiar to African migrants. This may impact on the meaningfulness of&#xD;
      such guidance to African women. Therefore, this research aims to understand what prevents&#xD;
      healthy eating or makes healthy eating easier for pregnant African migrant women in the UK.&#xD;
      This would include understanding how healthy eating is interpreted, the cultural factors that&#xD;
      are considered important in healthy eating, the current sources of nutrition information and&#xD;
      midwives view on providing healthy eating advice to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnant African migrant women (18 and above) attending ante-natal clinics in NHS&#xD;
           hospital sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midwives who provide ante-natal advice to pregnant Africans Where Study sites will be&#xD;
           hospitals covered by the Epsom and St Helier University trust, London North West&#xD;
           University Healthcare National Health Service (NHS) trust and the Lewisham &amp; Greenwich&#xD;
           NHS trusts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How: The study will involve one-on-one interviewing with pregnant women and midwives using&#xD;
      hospital spaces provided by the hospital. Focus group discussions with midwives will be&#xD;
      attempted depending on logistics. The interviews are expected to last about one hour to one&#xD;
      and a half hours. Interview sessions will be audio-taped with the permission of the&#xD;
      participants. Data collection is expected to last for 6 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is concerned with exploring the perception of pregnant African migrant women&#xD;
      living in the United Kingdom (UK) towards healthy eating messages and midwives perception of&#xD;
      providing healthy eating advice to these women. The prevalence of obesity among women of&#xD;
      reproductive age (15-49 years) including pregnant women is increasing nationally and&#xD;
      internationally. Maternal obesity has adverse consequences for both mother and child&#xD;
      including higher risks of perinatal mortality, Caesarean sections, preterm birth, postpartum&#xD;
      weight retention, increased risk of macrosomia, stillbirth, congenital malformation,&#xD;
      childhood overweight and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently postpartum weight retention is a significant contributor to the general obesity&#xD;
      epidemic and obesity is a significant contributor to chronic disease burden worldwide and a&#xD;
      public health concern. Presently, the United Kingdom (UK) has the highest level of maternal&#xD;
      obesity in Europe with approximately 46% of women classified as either obese (20%) or&#xD;
      overweight (26%) at their booking appointment. Non-Hispanic black women make up a significant&#xD;
      proportion (32%) of this population. With migration rates increasing, and black Africans&#xD;
      being considered the fastest growing ethnic group in the UK (73% of the UK population&#xD;
      growth), the rates of obesity in the population is expected to increase. Studies have shown&#xD;
      pre-pregnancy weight to be a significant predictor of weight changes in pregnancy and&#xD;
      postpartum weight retention certain studies have found that more African women are overweight&#xD;
      before pregnancy and experience more weight retention after pregnancy than Caucasian women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, pregnancy has been indicated as a time when public health nutrition messages can be&#xD;
      communicated and an &quot;opportunity for change&quot;, with women showing an inclination to modify&#xD;
      behaviour. Therefore, globally and in the UK, there has been an increased interest in&#xD;
      dietary/healthy eating interventions in pregnancy (sometimes in addition to physical&#xD;
      activity) to improve folic acid intake, improve fruits and vegetables intake, limit&#xD;
      gestational weight gain, and prevent postpartum weight retention. With systematic reviews of&#xD;
      dietary clinical trials showing that dietary interventions in pregnancy resulted in reduction&#xD;
      in maternal gestational weight gain and improved pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, current&#xD;
      clinical guidelines in the UK advocate a healthy weight before pregnancy, a healthy diet and&#xD;
      being physically active, returning to a healthy weight post pregnancy with healthy eating&#xD;
      guidelines provided. Midwives are also recommended and ideally placed to provide healthy&#xD;
      eating, weight management and physical activity support to help women eat well and manage&#xD;
      their weight during pregnancy and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies evaluating healthy eating adherence in pregnancy show that although a majority of&#xD;
      pregnant women in the studies believed that their diet was healthy, just a fraction of them&#xD;
      met the recommended dietary intake for all the food groups in pregnancy. There is very little&#xD;
      known about the uptake of healthy eating messages/interventions and adherence to healthy&#xD;
      eating guidelines in pregnancy amongst pregnant African migrant women living in the UK.&#xD;
      Considering also that the healthy eating guideline is made to suit the cultural preferences&#xD;
      of the host nation, it is imperative that dietary interventions and/or healthy eating&#xD;
      messages targeted at this group are conducted. Following a review of literature, and&#xD;
      discussions with practitioners, there has been no known dietary intervention in pregnancy in&#xD;
      the UK particularly targeting pregnant migrant African women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analysis suggests that culturally adapted health&#xD;
      interventions are effective in ethnic minority population, including those targeted at&#xD;
      smoking cessation, physical activity and healthy diet. Health is also said to be influenced&#xD;
      by culture-linked behaviours. Such behaviours are transmitted from elders to children and&#xD;
      continue through generations which are evident in patterns of food selection, food&#xD;
      preparation and mental constructions of body shape, size, functions and disease processes.&#xD;
      Cultural adaptation involves a consideration of language, culture and context in an&#xD;
      intervention such that it suits cultural patterns, meanings and values of the target&#xD;
      population.The need for cultural adaptation of healthy eating messages for pregnant Africans&#xD;
      is further buttressed by the fact that dietary behaviours of pregnant Africans post migration&#xD;
      are not completely changed from traditional dietary practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the need for interventions to promote healthy eating in pregnancy amongst pregnant&#xD;
      African migrant women in the UK, very little is known about the perceptions of these women&#xD;
      around healthy eating, factors that influence healthy eating (barriers and facilitators) and&#xD;
      the perception of midwives regarding the provision of healthy eating advice to this&#xD;
      population. Qualitative evidence that has considered perceptions of pregnant African women&#xD;
      living in high income countries exist mainly in the United States and is centred on&#xD;
      sociocultural influences regarding body size, misunderstanding about what is considered as&#xD;
      healthy, cravings and palatability, and the belief that gaining weight indicate healthy&#xD;
      babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also qualitative studies evaluating the experiences of midwives and other healthcare&#xD;
      providers in providing healthy eating advice to pregnant women show that although healthy&#xD;
      eating advice was offered in pregnancy, it was not regarded as a priority. Barriers for the&#xD;
      midwives existed in terms of topic sensitivity, inadequate training and cultural differences.&#xD;
      Considering that qualitative evidence is context specific and might not be generalizable, it&#xD;
      is important to explore the barriers and facilitators to healthy eating amongst pregnant&#xD;
      African migrant women as peculiar to the United Kingdom. It is also important to explore&#xD;
      midwives perspectives concerning the provision of healthy eating advice to this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a formative research. Formative researches are used to determine how well an&#xD;
      intervention would fit the needs and preferences of a group. It follows the social&#xD;
      constructivist relativist point of view and the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for&#xD;
      the development and evaluation of complex interventions. The social constructivist&#xD;
      epistemology emphasises that our reality is socially constructed based on human perception,&#xD;
      experience, opinions, beliefs and the context of their lives and knowledge is dependent on&#xD;
      the environment in which we live. Culture and context is emphasized with regards to&#xD;
      understanding what occurs in the society and constructing knowledge around it. This study&#xD;
      will attempt to understand the perception towards healthy eating by pregnant African migrant&#xD;
      women based on their socially constructed reality within their culture and the context of&#xD;
      living in the United Kingdom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRC framework emphasizes the need to interview potential recipients of an intervention&#xD;
      and the stakeholders with the view to identify and develop appropriate theory and increase&#xD;
      acceptability of the intervention. Qualitative interviewing will be used to explore the&#xD;
      concept of perceived barriers and facilitators to healthy eating during pregnancy among&#xD;
      pregnant African migrant women living in the UK and the perception of midwives to providing&#xD;
      healthy eating advice to pregnant African migrant women. It is hoped that evidence from this&#xD;
      study will be used to develop a culturally adapted healthy eating intervention framework for&#xD;
      migrant African women in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To explore perceived barriers and facilitators to healthy eating amongst pregnant African&#xD;
      migrant women in the UK and midwives perception of providing healthy eating advice to this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how healthy eating is interpreted and understood by pregnant African&#xD;
           migrant women living in the UK&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the factors considered significant (barriers and facilitators) to healthy&#xD;
           eating in this population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify cultural factors considered significant to the uptake of healthy eating&#xD;
           messages in this population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the current sources of nutrition information in pregnancy for African&#xD;
           migrants living in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore midwives perspectives on providing healthy eating advice to pregnant African&#xD;
           migrants.&#xD;
