  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine if allopregnanolone (ALLO) improves depression and pain symptoms in&#xD;
      patients who have a history of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) [primary endpoints]. The&#xD;
      investigators will also determine if ALLO improves functional outcome [secondary endpoint].&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive an intravenous infusion of either ALLO or placebo.&#xD;
      Behavioral assessments will be conducted during the infusion and at several time points&#xD;
      post-infusion.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALLO is a neurosteroid that exhibits multiple actions highly relevant to the treatment of&#xD;
      chronic complex TBI. The investigators' recent human data suggest that ALLO is decreased in&#xD;
      patients with TBI, suggesting that ameliorating deficits of this neurosteroid may be&#xD;
      clinically therapeutic. In addition, multiple groups have reported ALLO reductions in&#xD;
      patients with conditions that frequently co-occur with TBI, including depression and pain&#xD;
      disorders. 132 Veterans with a history of mild TBI with co-occurring depression and pain&#xD;
      symptoms (chronic complex TBI) will be randomized to either intravenous placebo or ALLO (3&#xD;
      groups/44 participants per group: placebo, lower dose ALLO, higher dose ALLO). Following a&#xD;
      loading dose, Veterans will receive placebo or ALLO infusion targeted to achieve serum ALLO&#xD;
      levels of 0 nM (placebo), 50 nM (ALLO lower dose), or 150nM (ALLO higher dose). Behavioral&#xD;
      assessments will be conducted during the infusion, post-taper, and 24 hours post-infusion. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will conduct behavioral assessments 7 days and 14 days&#xD;
      post-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that ALLO will be well-tolerated in patients with complex TBI,&#xD;
      and that this intervention may reduce depression and pain symptoms (in addition to&#xD;
      potentially improving function).&#xD;

    <measure>Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (BPI-SF) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form (BPI-SF) is a self-reported scale that measures the severity of pain and the interference of pain on function. The scores range from 0 (no pain) to 10 (pain as severe as you can imagine). There are 4 questions assessing worst pain, least pain, average pain in the past 24 hours, and pain right now. The Interference scores range from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely interferes). There are 7 questions assessing the interference of pain in the past 24 hours for general activity, mood, walking ability, normal work, relations with other people, sleep, and enjoyment of life.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hamilton-Depression Inventory (HAM-D) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The HAM-D measures the severity of depressive symptoms. It is a checklist of 17 items that are ranked on a scale of 0-4 or 0-2. The range for the total score (which is the sum of the scores of all 17 items) is 0-52; a higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Change</measure>
    <time_frame>6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, and 14 days</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 is a health survey with an 8-scale profile embedded in 36 questions that measures physical and mental components of health. Each item is scored on a 0 to 100 range with the lowest and highest possible scores are set at 0 and 100, respectively. All of these items are scored so that a high score defines a more favorable health state.</description>
