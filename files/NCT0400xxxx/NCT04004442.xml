  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety of avelumab and AVB-S6-500 and see&#xD;
      what effects (good and bad) this combination treatment has on patients with advanced&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will have tests and exams to see if they are eligible for the clinical trial. If&#xD;
      found eligible, the patient will receive treatment with avelumab and AVB-S6-500 by vein once&#xD;
      every two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AVB-S6-500. If&#xD;
      the patient is enrolled on the first dose level, the patient will be treated at a higher dose&#xD;
      every two weeks with AVB-S6-500. If the patient is enrolled on the second dose level, the&#xD;
      patient will be receive AVB-S6-500 only once a week at a lower dose. The patient would&#xD;
      continue to receive avelumab twice weekly at the same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive the study treatment as long as there is evidence that the tumor is not&#xD;
      growing or spreading and they are not having any unacceptable, bad side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored during treatment with tests and exams and after treatment&#xD;
      completion for up to one year.&#xD;

             conditions including recent (within the past year) or active suicidal ideation or&#xD;
             behavior; or laboratory abnormalities that may increase the risk associated with study&#xD;
             participation or study treatment administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make&#xD;
