  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysmenorrhea or painful menstruation is a common symptom of menses. Dysmenorrhea is defined&#xD;
      as a painful, cramping sensation in the lower abdomen or back associated with menstrual&#xD;
      periods and is classified into primary and secondary types. Primary dysmenorrhea is painful&#xD;
      menstrual periods not due to other diseases, and often occurs soon after menarche. Secondary&#xD;
      dysmenorrhea is due to an underlying pelvic abnormality, such as endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dysmenorrhea is the most common gynecological complaint. In many studies, the prevalence of&#xD;
      primary dysmenorrhea varies between 34 % in 2010 in Egypt, 86.6% in 2002 in Switzerland, and&#xD;
      21% in 1999 in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, physiopathology is better understood, which suggests that we have treatments&#xD;
      Although dysmenorrhea is a common concern, many women never seek medical advice, even though&#xD;
      treatments are easily available and simple.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, despite the high prevalence, dysmenorrhea is undertreated and even disregarded by&#xD;
      health professionals, and the girls themselves, who may accept it as a normal part of the&#xD;
      menstrual cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pain occurs just before and/or during menstruation ; it can be mild to severe and is&#xD;
      frequently associated with many other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, headache, diarrhea,&#xD;
      tiredness and has many consequences in wellbeing and school. Dysmenorrhea is known to be the&#xD;
      first cause of absenteism from school, and appears to have many consequences and a real&#xD;
      impact on women's daily activities, which is why it's a public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the lack of recent studies in France, the aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      prevalence of adolescent dysmenorrhea. We also assessed its severity, how adolescent girls&#xD;
      experienced their menses, and how they manage their pain (seeking medical consultation, use&#xD;
      of medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We used a self-assessment questionnaire in a cohort of high school girls, aged 15 to 19 years&#xD;
      old, during April and May of 2019, in 8 private and public high schools in Ille-et-Vilaine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It was an observational, quantitative and prospective study, in a cohort of adolescent girls,&#xD;
      to assess the prevalence of adolescent dysmenorrhea through an anonymous self-assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire, which took place in 8 randomised public and private high schools in&#xD;
      Ille-et-Vilaine, Brittany, France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only adolescents aged between 15 and 19 years old who agreed to participate were included.&#xD;
      Girls who had experienced primary or secondary amenorrhea for more than 6 months in the past&#xD;
      year were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target number of participants was 770 adolescents girls aged between 15 and 19 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective was to determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhea within adolescent girls in&#xD;
      a sample in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other objectives were to assess the severity, how girls experienced their menses, the&#xD;
      consequences on daily living activities or at school, and how they manage their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of dysmenorrhea were assessed with Andersch and Milsom's scale and Numerical&#xD;
      Rating Scale (NRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      First of all, we obtained the authorization of the Academic Rectorat of Rennes and Diocesan&#xD;
      Direction of Catholic Teaching respectively for public and private schools. We also obtained&#xD;
      the authorization of the Committee of Protection of People of Montpellier University&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, we contacted the high school principals of the 8 high schools which were&#xD;
      randomized, and obtained their authorization to organise this study in their schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We gave an information to the parents and adolescent girls about ten days before the study.&#xD;
      If a girl or their parents didn't want their daughter to participate, they could inform the&#xD;
      high school principal or the school nurse. We asked the nurse or the directos of high schools&#xD;
      to make a randomisation of the girls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, we gathered them in a classroom, with no boys, to make sure that they felt free and&#xD;
      confident enough to complete the questionnaire in the most honest way. We gave them the&#xD;
      questionnaires, and let them complete it, which took about 15-20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main investigator was present to answer the girls if any questions were not understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion, the questionnaires were immediately retrieved by the main investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we briefly communicated what menses are and other symptoms, how to relieve the pain,&#xD;
      with or without medication, and in what case the girls must see a doctor. We gave them an&#xD;
      advice sheet. The aim was to improve the management of dysmenorrhea and their quality of life&#xD;
      by informing adolescent girls of the availability of effective therapy and the need to&#xD;
      consult a doctor in some situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample of 960 adolescents completed the questionnaire, and 19 were excluded. The prevalence&#xD;
      of dysmenorrhea will be calculated. Then, we will analyze the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results will provide a better understanding of dysmenorrhea, its recent prevalence, its&#xD;
      severity, its influencing factors and its consequences on daily activities. This study will&#xD;
      help us to better know the impact of dysmenorrhea, which is frequently underestimated and&#xD;
      misunderstood by girls themselves, their parents, their families and their teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, throughout this study, the reasons why adolescent girls may not want to seek&#xD;
      medical consultation might be known. We could as general practitionner or gynecologist better&#xD;
      explain and advise adolescent girls, offer them relief and better conditions of life, while&#xD;
      staying aware of the possibility of secondary dysmenorrhea.&#xD;
