  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of urinary incontinence seems to improve daily activities and the practice of&#xD;
      physical activity, according to the literature. Unfortunately, all of these studies are based&#xD;
      on self-questionnaires with the disadvantages of self-evaluation, more subjective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For several years activity sensors have been used in the medical field (rheumatology,&#xD;
      cardiology, diabetology, etc.). They allowed the evaluation of physical activity in real life&#xD;
      situations, whether to evaluate the degree of severity of a pathology or the impact of a new&#xD;
      treatment on the resumption of activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity sensors are devices that transform body motion into digital measurements. They&#xD;
      provide detailed information on the frequency, duration, intensity and type of movement to&#xD;
      determine, for example, the number of steps taken, the distance traveled, calories burned and&#xD;
      the quality of sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that urinary incontinence treatment can increase physical activity and so&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of patients, that can be measure by activity sensors.&#xD;

      The management of urinary incontinence seems to improve daily activities and the practice of&#xD;
      physical activity, according to the literature. Unfortunately, all of these studies are based&#xD;
      on self-questionnaires with the disadvantages of self-evaluation, more subjective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation is an effective treatment on stress&#xD;
      urinary incontinence in men and women. Currently the PadTest/24 hours is the reference for&#xD;
      his evaluation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that urinary incontinence treatment can increase physical activity and so&#xD;
      improve the quality of life of patients, that can be measure by activity sensors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a monocentric, prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary objective of this study is to evaluate the variation of physical activity&#xD;
      measured by the number of steps per day, before AUS implantation and 3 months after the&#xD;
      activation of the sphincter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For that, the primary outcome measure is the number of steps per day measured 24h/24 for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days by activity sensor, before AUS implantation and 3 months after activation of&#xD;
      the sphincter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult patients (men and women) with a surgical indication for urinary incontinence&#xD;
      treatment by AUS in the urology department of Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital will be screened for&#xD;
      eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four visits will be programed as standard of care :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first visit, patients will be informed of the study and their agreement will&#xD;
           be recorded. Patients' eligibility will be checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUS implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUS activation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AUS follow-up, around fourteen weeks after activation The activity sensor, the&#xD;
           Pad/Test/24 hours and questionnaires such as eQOL will be performed at home before AUS&#xD;
           implantation, 1 month after the AUS activation and 3 months after the AUS activation.&#xD;

    <measure>Incontinence Quality of Life (I-QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>I-QOL is a self-report Quality of Life measure specific to urinary problems. The I-QOL is commonly used and consists of 22 items, all of which use a five-point ordinal response scale in which 1 = extremely, 2 = quite a bit, 3 = moderately, 4 = a little, and 5 = not at all.&#xD;
I-QOL scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale for easy interpretability. Higher scores indicate better quality of life.&#xD;
Scale score = ((The sum of the items - lowest possible score) / Possible raw score range ) x 100.&#xD;

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Through the study completion, an average of 8 months</time_frame>
    <description>IPAQ is a 8 items questionnaire that assess 3 types of activity (walking, moderate-intensity activities and vigorous-intensity activities) in the following domains: leisure time, domestic/gardening, work-related, transport-related. It provide separate scores on each type of activity. Computation of the total score requires summation of the duration (in minutes) and frequency (days) of each type of activity. A Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) is a multiple of the estimated resting energy expenditure.&#xD;
Walking MET-minutes/week=3.3*walking minutes*walking days Moderate MET-minutes/week=4.0*moderate-intensity activity minutes*moderate days Vigorous MET-minutes/week=8.0*vigorous-intensity activity minutes*vigorous-intensity days Total =sum of Walking+Moderate+Vigorous METminutes/week scores.&#xD;
