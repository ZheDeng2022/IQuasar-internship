  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is a procedure used for the diagnosis&#xD;
      and treatment of diseases of the biliary tract, pancreas and papilla of Vater. The ERCP&#xD;
      allows an indirect vision of the ductal and pancreatic system by means of the endoductal&#xD;
      injection of contrast medium and the evaluation of these by X-rays. Recently, cholangioscopy&#xD;
      has been developed using the Spy Glass system, introduced on the market in 2007. This allows&#xD;
      a direct visualization of the bile duct and pancreatic pathway through the introduction of an&#xD;
      optical probe inside the ductal system. SpyGlass was developed to overcome the limitations of&#xD;
      traditional cholangioscopy and allow optically guided therapies for the treatment of stenoses&#xD;
      and calculations. This is the first cholangioscopy system performed by a single disposable&#xD;
      operator (SOC), with two dedicated irrigation channels, an optical channel and a therapeutic&#xD;
      channel with a diameter of 1.2 mm. Everything is placed inside a 10 Fr Spy Scope ™ access and&#xD;
      delivery catheter (3.3 mm), which allows the tip to flex in 4 directions to facilitate&#xD;
      maneuverability and directionality in small ducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The irrigation channels of the SOC system allow a fluid flow rate of four to five times&#xD;
      higher than that which can be obtained through the operating channel of conventional systems.&#xD;
      In bench simulations with loaded Spy Bite ™ biopsy forceps, the SOC system presented a&#xD;
      success rate in obtaining access to sites of double interest compared to that of a&#xD;
      conventional 2-way limited bending choledocoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have confirmed the adequacy of the Spy Glass system in providing adequate&#xD;
      samples for histological diagnosis and successfully facilitating the treatment of stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new single-use Spy Glass digital display system was introduced in 2014 and no&#xD;
      multi-center experience on the use of this device is described to date.&#xD;
