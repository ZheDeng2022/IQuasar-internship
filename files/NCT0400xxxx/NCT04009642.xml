  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of people with diabetes is rising. One of the major causes of premature death in&#xD;
      diabetes is heart failure (HF). This is when the heart cannot pump blood effectively, and&#xD;
      this may be related to abnormalities in energy production in the heart muscle. In healthy&#xD;
      people, the heart muscle cells show flexibility and can use both sugar and fat molecules for&#xD;
      energy production. Although burning fat provides more energy, this process requires more&#xD;
      oxygen than burning sugars. As a result, fat is a less efficient fuel for the heart compared&#xD;
      to sugars, especially in situations where the energy and oxygen needs are higher, such as&#xD;
      during exercise. The investigators propose that the heart muscle in patients with type 2&#xD;
      diabetes relies heavily on fat for energy provision, and fails to burn more sugar molecules&#xD;
      for energy provision during exercise to more efficiently use oxygen. Fat and sugar uptake by&#xD;
      the heart can be detected by the difference between the blood sugar and fat levels delivered&#xD;
      to the heart and returning from the heart, both at rest and also when the heart is working&#xD;
      faster during Dobutamine infusion. Dobutamine is a drug frequently used to mimic exercise,&#xD;
      and get the heart running faster during medical tests. To test the hypothesis, the&#xD;
      investigators will assess fat and sugar uptake by the heart at rest and when the heart is&#xD;
      running faster, in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing investigations to rule out&#xD;
      coronary disease. Heart function, and blood supply to heart muscle, at rest and during&#xD;
      Dobutamine infusion, will also be measured using MRI scanning. The same tests will be&#xD;
      performed in people without diabetes for comparison. It will help understand diabetic heart&#xD;
      disease and which aspects may be targeted with new treatments.&#xD;
