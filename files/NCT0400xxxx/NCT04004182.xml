  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Strategies to control chronic postprandial hyperglycaemia by optimizing the functionality of&#xD;
      foods would strengthen efforts to reduce the risk of developing T2D in the general&#xD;
      population. Polyphenolic constituents, may help to delay starch and disaccharide digestion&#xD;
      and glucose absorption following a carbohydrate-containing meal or beverage. In vitro studies&#xD;
      suggest that some berry anthocyanins and apple polyphenols are effective inhibitors of&#xD;
      digestive enzymes, α-amylases and α-glucosidases. Furthermore, polyphenols found in berries&#xD;
      and apples inhibit the action of intestinal glucose transporters. Human data is limited;&#xD;
      however, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that berries and apple products&#xD;
      reduced postprandial glucose concentrations following consumption of either starch, glucose&#xD;
      or sucrose loads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that consumption of a fruit bar containing&#xD;
      anthocyanin-rich bilberry and polyphenol-rich apple extracts together with a starch and&#xD;
      sucrose meal would reduce the postprandial glycemic response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized cross over study and will aim to recruit 24 overweight (BMI &gt;&#xD;
      25.0), men or post-menopausal women, aged ≥40 and ≤ 70 years who will attend four study&#xD;
      sessions. The first study session will be an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and the&#xD;
      remaining three will be identical in all respects except for the composition of the fruit&#xD;
      bar. Consecutive blood samples will be collected in all 4 study sessions which will be used&#xD;
      to measure glucose, insulin, C-peptide, incretins and lipids.&#xD;

      This acute intervention study will have a randomised controlled crossover design where the&#xD;
      volunteers will return for 4 stand-alone study sessions. All study procedures will be carried&#xD;
      out at the Human Nutrition Unit (HNU) of the Rowett Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first study session will be an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The remaining three&#xD;
      will be intervention sessions which will be identical in all respects except for the&#xD;
      composition of the fruit bar. There will have a minimum of 1 week washout period. Volunteers&#xD;
      will be asked to consume a low polyphenol diet three days prior to each intervention. To&#xD;
      ensure compliance, participants will be provided with a list of 'allowed' and 'excluded'&#xD;
      foods as well as food diaries to complete over the three day period. The Fruit bars will be&#xD;
      made in the HNU kitchens by trained staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Table 1. Study sessions Intervention/Meal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral Glucose Tolerance test (OGTT) Fruit bar Plus OGTT Fruit bar with addition of 600 mg&#xD;
      bilberry anthocyanins Plus OGTT Fruit bar with addition of 600mg bilberry anthocyanins and&#xD;
      1200mg apple polyphenols Plus OGTT&#xD;
&#xD;
      The glucose load for the OGTT in all sessions will be given as carbohydrate meal consisting&#xD;
      of white bread, spread, low-polyphenol jam. (meal: 75g carbohydrate total)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening session Once the volunteer expresses interest in the study, they will be invited to&#xD;
      attend a screening visit lasting approximately 1 h. Informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      all participants, ensuring that they have fully understood all the study procedures before&#xD;
      continuing. A full eligibility assessment (for assessing inclusion and exclusion criteria)&#xD;
      will be carried out following consenting. This will include the completion of a health&#xD;
      screening questionnaire, anthropometric measurements (height, weight, BMI,). HbA1c will be&#xD;
      measured using finger prick blood samples. Volunteers fulfilling all the criteria and who&#xD;
      wish to continue will be accepted into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OGTT and Intervention sessions (study sessions 1-3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each session the volunteers will return for 2 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Pre - Study Session Day This session will last approximately 1 hour. Volunteers will&#xD;
      arrive at the HNU on the day preceding the study session day for the insertion of the&#xD;
      continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor (iPro 2, Medtronic Ltd, UK). Upon arrival,&#xD;
      their weight will be measured for calculating BMI. Waist circumference and body fat&#xD;
      composition using bio-impedance will be also be measured. The CGM records interstitial&#xD;
      glucose levels at five minute intervals and provides a detailed picture of glucose fluxes.&#xD;
      The CGM monitors are widely used by diabetics to monitor blood glucose fluxes and are&#xD;
      designed for self-insertion. Their accuracy and level of data detail has also made them a&#xD;
      powerful and widely used research tool. The sensor will be inserted into the subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      layer (just below the skin surface) in the belly area by a trained researcher or HNU staff&#xD;
      member. Insertion will be carried out using a tailor-made inserter provided with the CGM&#xD;
      which causes minimum discomfort. Following stabilisation of the sensor a data acquisition&#xD;
      unit will be attached to it. The sensor will be calibrated using a finger prick blood sample.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be shown how to calibrate the CGM at home using a standard blood glucose&#xD;
      meter and finger prick samples, and instructed on the times when they would have to do so.&#xD;
      Wearing the sensor (which is about the size of a £2 coin) causes minimum discomfort to the&#xD;
      wearer and does not hinder daily activities (including sleeping and having baths). The&#xD;
      volunteers will be provided with a list of foods to consume that evening before each session&#xD;
      day. We will ask the volunteer to consume the same meal before each session day. No&#xD;
      restrictions will be made on water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: study session day This session will last approximately 4 h. The volunteers will&#xD;
      return to the HNU the following morning in an overnight fasted state of approximately 10 h. A&#xD;
      cannula will be inserted into a vein in the antecubital fossa at the front of an elbow of the&#xD;
      left or right arm and kept patent with sterile saline (0.9% NaCl). Baseline fasted blood (10&#xD;
      mL) samples will be collected into K-EDTA tubes (6 mL serum). The plasma blood collection&#xD;
      tubes will also contain DPP-4 inhibitors to preserve incretin hormone integrity. Following&#xD;
      baseline sample collection, volunteers will consume the fruit bar and then the carbohydrate&#xD;
      meal within 10 min. Periodic blood samples 10 mL will be collected into K-EDTA tubes at&#xD;
      15min, 30min, 45min, 1h, 1.5h, 2h, 2.5h, and 3h post fruit bar/carbohydrate meal consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 3 h, the cannula will be removed; volunteers will consume a standardised&#xD;
      lunch the CGM sensor will be removed and volunteers will be free to leave the HNU.&#xD;
