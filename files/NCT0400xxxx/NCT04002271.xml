  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total knee replacement (TKR) is a commonly performed surgical procedure, and is associated&#xD;
      with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. Poor acute postoperative pain control has&#xD;
      been associated with increased morbidity, prolonged recovery, reduced patient satisfaction&#xD;
      and chronic post-surgical pain. Multimodal analgesia in the context of enhanced recovery&#xD;
      after surgery programs is advocated for conventional total knee replacement. More recently,&#xD;
      robotic arm assisted total knee replacement has been introduced. TKR is most commonly&#xD;
      performed under spinal anaesthesia or general anaesthesia using inhalational agents or&#xD;
      propofol total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). It is unclear which is the best anaesthetic&#xD;
      technique for postoperative analgesia. There has been no head to head trial comparing these 3&#xD;
      anaesthetic techniques in the context of modern multimodal and enhanced recovery after&#xD;
      surgery (ERAS) protocols for conventional and robotic arm assisted TKR. Propofol TIVA may&#xD;
      reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption after surgery, but the overall evidence is&#xD;
      still controversial. Whether propofol TIVA provides better analgesia compared to inhalational&#xD;
      anaesthesia for TKR is not known. A prospective, randomized controlled trial providing head&#xD;
      to head comparisons between general anaesthesia with propofol TIVA, inhalational anaesthesia,&#xD;
      and spinal anaesthesia under is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to perform a randomized controlled trial to compare postoperative&#xD;
      analgesia after robotic arm assisted TKR in three commonly used anaesthetic techniques: 1)&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia (SA), 2) general anaesthesia with inhalational anaesthesia (GAS), 3)&#xD;
      general anaesthesia with propofol TIVA (TIVA). This clinical trial will be conducted within&#xD;
      the framework of modern multimodal analgesic and enhanced recovery after surgery pathways.&#xD;

      Preoperative Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached at the preadmission clinic or in the general ward before&#xD;
      operation. The anaesthetic techniques will be explained and s/he will be recruited into the&#xD;
      study if s/he agrees. Fasting will start 6 hours before surgery for solids and 2 hours clear&#xD;
      fluid. All patients will be given oral celebrex 200mg, paracetamol 1g and pregabalin 50mg po,&#xD;
      two hours before start of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of movement of the operating knee, quadriceps function, pain scores of the affecting&#xD;
      knee will be assessed on day before operation. Baseline data for health related quality of&#xD;
      life, psychological status, and quality of recovery will be obtained using the Chinese Hong&#xD;
      Kong version of SF-36, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) and the Chinese quality of&#xD;
      recovery (QoR) score, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and intraoperative care&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the operation theatre, a 18 or 16 gauge intravenous cannula will be inserted.&#xD;
      Standard monitoring with pulse oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure, and three lead&#xD;
      electrocardiogram will be applied before start of anaesthesia. Non-invasive blood pressure&#xD;
      will be checked at least every 5 minutes throughout the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinal anaesthesia (SA) group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the SA group will receive intrathecal (L4-5, or L3-4 if failed at L4-5)&#xD;
      administration of 2.2-2.4ml 0.5% heavy bupivicaine using a 25G Whitacare needle. No&#xD;
      intrathecal opioid will be given during the procedure. Light sedation will be given during&#xD;
      surgery with target-controlled infusion of propofol using the Marsh effect site model (0.3 -1&#xD;
      mcg/ml). Supplemental oxygen 2L/min will be given via the nasal cannula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anaesthesia with inhalational anaesthesia (GAS) group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving inhalational general anaesthesia will be induced with intravenous bolus&#xD;
      propofol 1.5-3mg/kg, remifentanil 1mcg/kg, and rocuronium 0.6mg/kg for induction of general&#xD;
      anaesthesia and intubation of the patient. General anesthesia monitoring will be used.&#xD;
      Maintenance of general anesthesia would be provided using sevoflurane, together with air and&#xD;
      oxygen. FiO2 will be maintained between 35-50%. Bispectral (BIS) monitoring will be applied&#xD;
      and level of anaesthesia will be maintained at a BIS value of between 40-60. Remifentanil&#xD;
      infusion will be given at between 0.1-0.2mcg/kg/min. This will be titrated to maintain mean&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure within 20% of baseline (blood pressure in the ward before surgery&#xD;
      will be taken as baseline) and heart rate between 45 to 100 beats per minute. Muscle&#xD;
      relaxants can be given as required. Morphine sulphate will be given at a dose of 0.1mg/kg&#xD;
      before skin incision. Sevoflurane and remifentanil infusion will be switched off at the end&#xD;
      of the procedure. Reversal of muscle relaxation will be achieved using intravenous&#xD;
      neostigmine 50mcg/kg and atropine 20mcg/kg after the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General anaesthesia with propofol total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target controlled infusion (TCI) with modified Marsh effect site model (Fresenius Kabi) will&#xD;
      be used for induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. Level of anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      titrated to produce a BIS value of between 40-60. For induction, remifentanil 1mcg/kg and&#xD;
      rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg will be given intravenously prior to intubation. Sevoflurane will not be&#xD;
      given. Air and oxygen will be given, and FiO2 will be kept at between 35-50%. Similarly, to&#xD;
      the GAS group, remifentanil will be infused at a rate of between 0.1-0.2mcg/kg/min and&#xD;
      titrated according to the haemodynamic parameters stated for the GAS group. Morphine sulphate&#xD;
      will be given at a dose of 0.1mg/kg before skin incision. TCI propofol and remifentanil will&#xD;
      be switched off at the end of the procedure. Reversal of muscle relaxation will be achieved&#xD;
      as for the GAS group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative care for all 3 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous antibiotic will be given before skin incision. Hypotension will be managed with&#xD;
      intravenous phenylephrine or ephedrine at the discretion of the anaesthesiologist.&#xD;
      Hypertension or tachycardia in patients from the TIVA and GAS groups will be managed by&#xD;
      titrating the remifentanil infusion up to 0.2mcg/kg. Intravenous anti-hypertensive drugs such&#xD;
      as beta-blockers (eg esmolol, metoprolol), hydralazine, glyceryl trinitrate and phentolamine&#xD;
      can be given if hypertension persists. Intra-operative fluid 8-10ml/kg/hr will be infused as&#xD;
      maintenance. In addition, fluid replacement will be given for of blood loss. Infusion fluid&#xD;
      warmer and thermal blankets will be used with the aim of keeping a core temperature of&#xD;
      35.5-37.5 degrees Celsius. All patients will be given 4mg of intravenous ondansetron 30&#xD;
      minutes before end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local anaesthetic infiltration with 40ml 0.75% ropivacaine, 0.5ml 1:200,000 adrenaline, 30mg&#xD;
      ketorolac in 60ml normal saline over the perisurgical area will be administrated by&#xD;
      orthopaedic surgeon after implant insertion and wound closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will subsequently be transferred to the post anaesthetic care unit (PACU) for&#xD;
      monitoring for at least 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analgesic modalities and assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for all the analgesic modalities are described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting numerical rating scale (NRS) pain scores will be checked every 5 minutes in the PACU.&#xD;
      In the PACU, 2mg intravenous morphine will be given every 5 minutes until the numerical&#xD;
      rating pain score (NRS) is less than 4/10. Patient controlled analgesia (PCA) with morphine&#xD;
      will then be given once NRS is less than 4/10. The PCA device will be configured to give 1 mg&#xD;
      of bolus dose of morphine with each demand and the lockout duration will be 5 minutes. No&#xD;
      background infusion will be given and the maximum dose limit of morphine will be 0.1mg/kg per&#xD;
      hour. Intramuscular morphine sulphate at a dose of 0.1mg/kg will be prescribed every 4 hours&#xD;
      if necessary, for breakthrough beginning from postoperative day (POD) 0. Intravenous 4mg&#xD;
      ondansetron every 4 hours as necessary will be prescribed for nausea or/and vomiting. While&#xD;
      in the PACU, the respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, Ramsay sedation scores, blood pressure&#xD;
      and heart rate will be monitored every 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On POD 0, patients will resume oral diet if not contraindicated. Oral paracetamol 1g tds,&#xD;
      celebrex 200mg daily, and pregabalin 50mg once at night will be given to all patients for 5&#xD;
      days. Dihydrocodeine 30mg q6h po prn for 5 days will be prescribed after cessation of PCA&#xD;
      morphine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on PCA morphine, the patient's respiratory rate, SpO2 and sedation score will be&#xD;
      monitored every hour. Heart rate and blood pressure will be checked every 4 hours. NRS pain&#xD;
      scores at rest, during knee movement (knee flexion), cumulative PCA morphine doses, and&#xD;
      number of PCA demands/goods delivered, and side effects (eg nausea, vomiting, dizziness,&#xD;
      pruritis) will be recorded every 4 hours. Patients will be assessed by the pain team every&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be on PCA morphine for 2 days. If NRS pain scores during knee movement on POD 2&#xD;
      is less than 4/10 and morphine consumption is low, PCA morphine will be stopped. PCA morphine&#xD;
      will be continued if NRS pain score is equal or greater than 4, or if PCA morphine&#xD;
      consumption is high. After cessation of PCA morphine, NRS pain scores at rest and during knee&#xD;
      movement, as well as the dose and frequency of rescue analgesia and the incidence of side&#xD;
      effects will be charted once a day until discharge. Patient satisfaction with analgesia&#xD;
      (0-10, where 0 is the least satisfaction, and 10 is the most satisfaction) will be assessed&#xD;
      daily during hospital stay. Overall benefit of analgesic scores (OBAS) will be checked once a&#xD;
      day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone follow up will be done for all patients on POD 3, 4, and 5 (if patient discharged home&#xD;
      on those days). NRS pain scores at rest and with movement, analgesic medication consumption&#xD;
      (pill count), incidence of adverse side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritis, dizziness), and&#xD;
      OBAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique/Prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be performed by the same surgical team with standardized surgical technique.&#xD;
      All the patients will have posterior stabilized knee prosthesis. Tranexamic acid will be&#xD;
      given according to protocol. Standardized regimen and technique of local infiltration of&#xD;
      analgesic at the end of the surgery will be given as part of the multi-modal pain control&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative care and assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      POD 0 mobilization or early mobilization with physiotherapy and occupational therapy&#xD;
      rehabilitation is encouraged after operation. Fluid diet will be allowed on POD 0. The&#xD;
      surgical team will assess for occurrences of postoperative surgical complications,&#xD;
      suitability for discharge (good pain control, ambulation, normal bowel function, and ability&#xD;
      to eat properly without vomiting. Urinary retention will be documented as well. Time to&#xD;
      mobilization and time to soft diet intake will be recorded. Active and passive range of&#xD;
      movement of the operated knee, ability to achieve straight leg raising, and other&#xD;
      rehabilitation parameters will be assessment by allied health staffs from POD 0 till day of&#xD;
      discharge. Sleep disturbance due to pain (0-10, where 0 represents no disturbance and 10&#xD;
      represents the most disturbance possible) and quality of recovery (Chinese QoR) will be&#xD;
      assessed on POD 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow up (3 months, 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about pain that will be asked during the face-to-face interview at 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months. Chronic post-surgical pain will be assessed based on the core outcome set recommended&#xD;
      by Wylde et al, which is specific for total knee replacement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence or absence of chronic pain (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain intensity (NRS pain score, 0-10): at rest, during movement of the ipsilateral knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain and physical functioning: pain with general activity, with walking, when kneeling,&#xD;
           climbing stairs, descending stairs (NRS 0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temporal aspects of pain: frequency breakthrough pain (NRS pain score over 6/10),&#xD;
           duration of pain since operation, night pain, constant pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain description: location of the pain: medial or lateral aspect of knee, scar; pain&#xD;
           quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identification Pain Questionnaire to test for neuropathic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any analgesic consumption: yes/no, frequency of use (eg number of times analgesics taken&#xD;
           per week), type of medication used, dose of medication used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Global Impression of Change Scale (PGIC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health related quality of life (Chinese SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain self-efficacy questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Effect of pain on sleep disturbance (0-10)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Range of motion of the knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any area of decreased sensation, brush allodynia and pinprick hyperalgesia at the&#xD;
           ipsilateral knee, scar site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  KSKS and KSK functional score (done by physiotherapist and occupational therapist)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood taking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood taking will be performed to check for the levels of potential pain mediators. These&#xD;
      include PTEN, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-β. These will be collected just before surgery (during&#xD;
      induction of anaesthesia), on POD 0 and POD1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected during the perioperative period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraoperative vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, oxygen saturation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimated intraoperative blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tourniquet time if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume of intraoperative fluid/blood infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of surgery and anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time of discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at certain time point after operation, the patients cannot be managed according to the&#xD;
      protocol due to any reason such as the development of complication, no further data will be&#xD;
      collected. These patients will still be followed up. Intention-to-treat analysis will be&#xD;
      used. Patients will remain in their initial designated groups for data analysis even if there&#xD;
      is a change in surgical or anaesthetic/analgesic management, as long as they have had&#xD;
      unilateral total knee replacement.&#xD;
