    <textblock>
      The Investigators would like to study the incidence of complete remission (CR) at day +30&#xD;
      after Clofarabine followed by haploidentical transplant. The conditioning regimen used is&#xD;
      Fludarabine, Busulfan (2 doses) or cyclophosphamide (2 doses) and Total Body Irradiation&#xD;
      (TBI) with post transplant cyclophosphamide for patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      who are not in remission prior to considering allogeneic transplant with haploidentical&#xD;
      donors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30-40% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) experience induction&#xD;
      failures. In these patients who do not achieve remission with two cycles of standard&#xD;
      induction therapies, the probability of achieving remission with subsequent inductions is&#xD;
      limited. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the only curative option for these&#xD;
      patients, but high relapse rate and transplant-related mortality often preclude them to&#xD;
      proceed to transplant. Thus, AML not in remission at time of HSCT remains a huge unmet need&#xD;
      in current HSCT practice, particularly if the patient does not have a Human Leukocyte Antigen&#xD;
      (HLA)-matched donor identified by the time of two induction failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salvage chemotherapy with clofarabine appears to be another promising option in relapsed and&#xD;
      refractory AML. Clofarabine is a second-generation purine nucleoside analog with substantial&#xD;
      single-agent activity in adult patients with AML. It is an effective immunosuppressive agent&#xD;
      and several trials have shown the feasibility of conditioning with clofarabine-based regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, a conditioning regimen of clofarabine with busulfan (4 doses) has been&#xD;
      successfully used prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation for non-remission AML with&#xD;
      day +30 complete remission rates were 90-100%. However, these patients were transplanted with&#xD;
      HLA matched donors. This study will examine those patients undergoing transplantation from&#xD;
      haploidentical related donor or matched and mismatched unrelated donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Achieving a long-term remission is clearly the goal of AML treatment. The investigators would&#xD;
      like to propose a protocol for non-remission AML and expand the patient population to older&#xD;
      than 55 years of age as well as those who relapsed after initial allogeneic transplant to&#xD;
      improve enrolling patients in the near future. The investigators have many patients achieving&#xD;
      remission but for those without remission, clofarabine preconditioning may be a reliable&#xD;
      protocol to bring these patients into the early complete remission.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Dose de-escalation: Enrollment will begin at 30 mg/m2 to analyze any grade 4-5 organ toxicities as defined in Section 12.2. If the trial is stopped due to excessive toxicities, then dose de-escalation to 20 mg/m2 will occur for the next cohort of participants. For each participant, the observation period is from start of treatment through post-transplant day +30. Adverse effects will be continuously monitored as patients are enrolled. The trial will be stopped when the toxicity rate exceeds 20% with a posterior probability of 80% and a margin of no more than 5%. This leads to the following stopping rule: the trial will be stopped if 2 of the first 3 subjects experience grade 4-5 organ toxicity, or 3 out of 6, 4 out 9, 5 out of 12, 6 out of 16, or 7 out 19.</intervention_model_description>
