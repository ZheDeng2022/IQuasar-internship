  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, only 33% of Nigerian children aged 12-23 months had been vaccinated with the 3rd&#xD;
      dose of the pentavalent vaccine. Lack of knowledge was the leading reason for&#xD;
      non-vaccination. To overcome this knowledge gap, this project, &quot;Tunatar da ni&quot;, will deliver&#xD;
      targeted text messages to community leaders and individualized text messages to parents and&#xD;
      caregivers in Kebbi state, Northwest Nigeria, a state with very low coverage of immunization&#xD;
      (19% penta 3 coverage in 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These text messages, also known as Short Messaging System (SMS) messages will be managed,&#xD;
      scheduled and sent from a purpose-built, cloud-based Immunization Reminder and Information&#xD;
      SMS System (IRISS). The messages will be deployed in three ways, as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General broadcast of messages on the importance of immunization to all active mobile&#xD;
           phone subscribers in the intervention area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Targeted educational, informational, normative and motivational messages on&#xD;
           immunization, and reminders on the local immunization clinic schedules, to community&#xD;
           members who voluntarily registered into IRISS for these messages, and to traditional and&#xD;
           religious leaders who then share these information with their communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Individualized reminders of a child's immunization due dates and local clinic schedule&#xD;
           to parents who voluntarily registered their child's information on IRISS in order to&#xD;
           receive these reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators hypothesize that providing community leaders with positive and actionable&#xD;
      messages on immunization services will improve their understanding of the value of vaccines&#xD;
      and provide them facts to drive discussions, build positive norms and increase acceptance of&#xD;
      vaccination. Providing targeted reminders to parents about their child's vaccination due date&#xD;
      and the schedule of their local vaccination clinics will motivate their timely action to seek&#xD;
      vaccination services for their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will be evaluated using a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial design.&#xD;
      All 21 Local Government Areas (LGAs) in Kebbi state will be involved. Based on a 2:1 ratio,&#xD;
      14 LGAs will be randomly assigned to receive the SMS intervention while 7 LGAs will serve as&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the proportion of children aged 0-11 months who are&#xD;
      appropriately vaccinated for age. The data to compare this outcome between the intervention&#xD;
      and control arms, will be obtained from the quarterly lot quality assurance surveys done by&#xD;
      the Nigerian government.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines are one of the most effective and cost-effective interventions available to public&#xD;
      health today. But the benefits of vaccines are not getting to all children, particularly in&#xD;
      Nigeria. The 2016 National Immunization Coverage Survey (NICS) reports that only 33% of&#xD;
      children aged 12-23 months received the third dose of the pentavalent vaccine nationally. In&#xD;
      addition, as much as 40% of children had zero dose of vaccines from the routine immunization&#xD;
      (RI) program by the age of two years, having been left out of the &quot;service grid&quot;. Even among&#xD;
      children that have access, retention and utilization is poor; as much as 31% of children who&#xD;
      received their first pentavalent vaccine dose, drop out. They do not return to complete the&#xD;
      third dose in the series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the 2016 NICS, barriers related to lack of knowledge were the most frequently cited&#xD;
      barriers by parents of under-vaccinated children. In Nigeria, RI is delivered through fixed&#xD;
      sessions at health clinics and outreach sessions in the communities. To complete the RI&#xD;
      schedule, caregivers are required to proactively take their infants to the service sites a&#xD;
      total of 5 times in the child's first year of life. As much as 42% of parents cited&#xD;
      knowledge-deficits such as, not appreciating the importance of vaccines, not knowing the&#xD;
      schedule or not recognizing the need to seek out vaccination services as reasons for not&#xD;
      vaccinating their children. The complacency to seek RI services may be linked to some&#xD;
      parent's erroneous belief that the door-to-door vaccination of their children during polio&#xD;
      eradication campaigns (with oral polio vaccine) provides their children with all the vaccines&#xD;
      they need. Low confidence, inconvenient clinic schedules and location may also underline the&#xD;
      poor demand for RI services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health belief model and theory of planned behavior provides an organizing framework to&#xD;
      articulate how knowledge, perceptions, subjective norms, self-efficacy and cues to action&#xD;
      influence behavioral intention and action. Based on this theory, the team identified that&#xD;
      Short Messaging System (SMS) messages and reminders could serve the three-fold purpose of&#xD;
      providing information, shaping subjective norms and cueing caregivers to action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study investigators hypothesize that providing community leaders with positive and actionable&#xD;
      messages on immunization services will improve their understanding of the value of vaccines&#xD;
      and provide them facts to drive discussions about vaccination in the community. These&#xD;
      discussions about vaccination will result in a common understanding of its importance,&#xD;
      increase support for it and build greater positive norms about it in the community.&#xD;
      Furthermore, if vaccination schedules for local clinics are sent to the community leaders&#xD;
      through SMS, and they, in turn, ask their town announcers to announce the session times in&#xD;
      the community, this may serve as cues to action for parents of vaccine age children. In the&#xD;
      same vein, providing targeted reminders to parents about their child's vaccination due date&#xD;
      and the schedule of their health center will motivate their timely action to seek vaccination&#xD;
      services for their children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evidence that SMS reminders improve vaccine uptake and coverage is strong, however, most&#xD;
      of these studies come from small research settings with tightly controlled and well-resourced&#xD;
      program infrastructure. The feasibility of implementing an SMS messaging and reminder&#xD;
      intervention like this, at scale, and in a rural and low coverage setting like Kebbi, will be&#xD;
      tested by integrating the intervention into RI services, using existing government&#xD;
      immunization providers and managers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mixed methods study comprising a qualitative component (formative study) to&#xD;
      understand the context, test the messages and refine intervention strategies, and a&#xD;
      quantitative component (evaluative studies) to evaluate the impact of the intervention on&#xD;
      immunization uptake, with a cluster randomized controlled trial (CRCT), covering all LGAs,&#xD;
      and a complementary before-and-after study, in one sentinel LGA. A costing of the program&#xD;
      will also be done to evaluate affordability by the government. Only the CRCT is described&#xD;
      here.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the CRCT is to: assess the impact of the SMS interventions on the&#xD;
      age-appropriate rates of routine vaccination among children 0-11 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting: Kebbi state, is one of the 37 states in Nigeria, with an estimated population of&#xD;
      4.4 million and 180,000 newborns every year. Located in the Northwest of the country, Kebbi&#xD;
      has 21 LGAs further divided into 225 wards. Each ward 1 to 3 health facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system: The project will develop the SMS platform, The Immunization Reminder and&#xD;
      Information SMS System (IRISS), to register contacts, manage the contact database and&#xD;
      coordinate, schedule and send the messages, as well as track messages sent. The SMS messages&#xD;
      will be sent in three ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The message targets: As described above in the summary, the project will send out a general&#xD;
      SMS broadcast to active phone users in the intervention LGAs, targeted messages to community&#xD;
      leaders and other community members who opt-in for the messages, and individualized reminders&#xD;
      of a child's vaccination dates and clinic schedule to parents of infants who opt-in for the&#xD;
      messages. The SMS messages will be deployed over a period of 9 months between June 2019 to&#xD;
      March 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All individuals, including Leads, community gatekeepers, community volunteers, health&#xD;
      workers, and caregivers living in the intervention LGAs will be eligible for enrollment into&#xD;
      the IRISS e-registry without limitations if they meet the following criteria: for the public&#xD;
      broadcast - have an active phone; for the targeted messages to traditional (Mai-unguwas) and&#xD;
      religious leaders (Imams) at the community level - have a phone or access to one; for&#xD;
      caregivers - have a vaccine-age child (less than 12 months of age), have a phone or access to&#xD;
      one, and currently reside in the intervention area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the number of community leaders in the 14 intervention LGAs, the phone ownership&#xD;
      rate, and an assumption of the level of uptake, the projection is that about 7,000&#xD;
      traditional leaders, 1,000 Leads, and 72,000 parents will be enrolled in IRISS making it a&#xD;
      total of 80,000 enrollees. The projected enrollment of 72,000 parents of newborns is based on&#xD;
      an assumption that 20% of the parents of the 360,000 babies born annually in the intervention&#xD;
      LGAs will uptake the service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The messages. Four types of messages will be sent: normative, educational, informative and&#xD;
      motivational. Vaccination schedule reminders will also be sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advertising IRISS: To sensitize community leaders about IRISS and build capacity of RI&#xD;
      providers to assist caregivers with opting in, when needed, the study will leverage a&#xD;
      community engagement strategy (CES) being rolled out by the government. This strategy aims to&#xD;
      involve traditional leaders in the registration of newborns, reconciliation of the data on&#xD;
      children vaccinated, comparing community and health facility records, and the follow up of&#xD;
      children who missed their vaccine doses. The state immunization officers will conduct cascade&#xD;
      of sensitization meetings from the Emirs at the top of the traditional leadership ladder to&#xD;
      the Mai-unguwas at the lowest rung. This CES will be implemented in both intervention and&#xD;
      control LGAs by government officials, the difference is that IRISS sensitization module will&#xD;
      be presented only in the intervention areas. It is likely that advert for enrollment into&#xD;
      IRISS for health information may spill over to control LGAs, particularly if information is&#xD;
      shared by the public on social media in ways beyond the project's control. If this happens&#xD;
      and individuals from control LGAs register into IRISS expecting a message, they will receive&#xD;
      a general message about the importance of hand-washing. This is to avoid people losing trust&#xD;
      in the program, if they feel SMS messages were advertised but not sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation - CRCT Clusters were defined as the LGAs, the next lower administrative unit below&#xD;
      the state. In line with the goal of implementing at scale, all 21 LGAs in Kebbi state were&#xD;
      eligible to participate. The 21 clusters (LGAs) were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to&#xD;
      maximize the number of LGAs receiving the intervention while maintaining sufficient power to&#xD;
      detect meaningful difference between the two parallel arms. The intervention arm (14 LGAs)&#xD;
      are to receive both the scheduled and responsive SMS messages on immunization. The control&#xD;
      arm (7 LGAs) is designed to receive no SMS intervention, unless some individuals erroneously&#xD;
      registered in IRISS, then only those individuals received a one-time message on hand-washing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be accomplished with un-stratified covariate-constrained randomization&#xD;
      using a macro accessible from: https://github.com/ejgreene/ccr-sas to generate multiple&#xD;
      allocations of each LGA into one of three groups. The covariates are: phone ownership/access&#xD;
      (continuous variable) - % of population with mobile phones; target population (continuous&#xD;
      variable) - number of children 0-11 months; immunization coverage (continuous variable) - %&#xD;
      of children 0-11 months appropriately vaccinated for age; emirate (4 binary variables for&#xD;
      each emirate where the variable equals 1 if the LGA is in that emirate and 0 otherwise).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each LGA will be allocated to one of three groups, and the process is repeated 100,000 times.&#xD;
      To achieve the 2:1 ratio, two groups will be combined later to form the intervention arm,&#xD;
      while the third becomes the control arm. For each of the 100,000 allocations, the&#xD;
      within-group mean for each covariate will be calculated and compared to the overall state&#xD;
      covariate mean. The allocations where the groups' covariates means fall with 30% of the state&#xD;
      covariate mean, will be kept, otherwise, they will be discarded. The criteria used for the&#xD;
      emirate variables is that the groups could not differ in size by more than 1 LGA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the qualifying allocations are generated, the next step is to conduct a transparent and&#xD;
      public draw. At a meeting of stakeholders from the state primary health care development&#xD;
      agency, a volunteer will be asked to randomly select one allocation out of those that&#xD;
      qualified. For example, if 200 allocations met the criteria, a random number from 1 to 200&#xD;
      will be generated from www.numbergenerator.org. The allocation corresponding to the generated&#xD;
      number is then taken. Next, the groups in the selected allocation are assigned to either&#xD;
      intervention or control by having three volunteers draw three balls labelled - intervention&#xD;
      1, intervention 2 and control from an opaque black bag. The groups assigned intervention 1&#xD;
      and 2 will be collapsed into one intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: In a CRCT, sample size depends on both the number of clusters and of respondents&#xD;
      within each cluster. In this study, the number of clusters is 21 LGAs with 14 intervention&#xD;
      and 7 control LGAs. Similarly, the number of respondents per LGA in the Lot Quality Assurance&#xD;
      Surveys (LQAS) that study team plans to leverage to assess impact, is fixed at 60. The LQAS&#xD;
      are conducted by the government quarterly. Given a fixed sample size, the power of the study&#xD;
      to detect a meaningful difference in the primary outcome at the cluster level was calculated&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 households will be sampled from each LGA. One infant per household will be&#xD;
      interviewed through their caregivers. Total no. of respondents is 21*60 =1,260. Based on the&#xD;
      2:1 allocation ratio of the 21 clusters, a baseline rate of 12% of infants appropriately&#xD;
      vaccinated for age in the state, assumed increase to 30% in intervention arm after 9 months&#xD;
      of intervention, a design effect of 3, type 1 error of 5%, a one-sided test; the study has&#xD;
      99% power to detect a difference of 18% percent between the intervention and control LGAs.&#xD;

The message categories are: 1) Educational messages that provide facts and increase knowledge, e.g. &quot;Have you heard of Penta vaccine? It protects against 5 diseases: they are diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, HiB and Hepatitis B.&quot; 2) Informative messages that dispel myths about immunization, e.g. &quot;Getting more than one vaccine at the same time does not harm a child. It is very important to completely receive all vaccine doses for full protection.&quot; 3) Normative messages to promote positive norms, e.g. &quot;Our religious leaders have immunized their children, what are we waiting for&quot;? 4) Motivational messages to inspire action, e.g. &quot;Each visit to the health center for vaccination will reap many health benefits. Say YES to good health, be on time and complete your child's vaccination.&quot;</description>
