    <textblock>
      This randomised controlled trial will determine if exercise (150 - 200 min per week, 6 weeks)&#xD;
      can beneficially modify liver fat quality in non alcohol fatty liver disease patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (n = 26, 13 per group). Liver fat quality will be assessed via&#xD;
      magnetic resonance (3T) spectroscopy (1H-MRS) using validated methods.&#xD;

      Verbal eligibility check&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to commencing the study, participants will be contacted via telephone and an initial&#xD;
      verbal eligibility check will take place (approx. 30 min conversation). Following this,&#xD;
      potentially eligible participants will be invited to visit the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging&#xD;
      Centre for study assessment visit one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment visit 1 - Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (University of Nottingham) Informed&#xD;
      consent Before any study related procedures can take place, the participant must sign and&#xD;
      date the most recent approved version of the Informed Consent Form. Before consent is&#xD;
      obtained the responsible individual will ensure that the participant fully understands all&#xD;
      aspects of the study. It will also be clearly stated that the participant is free to withdraw&#xD;
      from the study at any time, for any reason, without prejudice to future care, and with no&#xD;
      obligation to give the reason for withdrawal. If a participant withdraws from the study but&#xD;
      does not withdraw their consent, then data already obtained may be used for the study. If a&#xD;
      participant has withdrawn due to an adverse event, a medical professional will follow up as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent form will be signed and dated based up on an informed decision. The consent&#xD;
      process will be performed by someone who has received consent training, has been authorised&#xD;
      by the Chief Investigator, and is named on the delegation of authority log. The original&#xD;
      signed form will be retained at the study site and copy will be given to the participant. A&#xD;
      third copy will be posted to the participant's GP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will complete several pen and paper based questionnaires to assess their&#xD;
      eligibility to participate in the study and to provide baseline study data. These will&#xD;
      include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  International Physical Activity Questionnaire - to assess habitual physical activity and&#xD;
           sitting time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire - to determine participants' readiness to&#xD;
           exercise and/or contraindications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loughborough University Health Screen Questionnaire - to obtain an overview of&#xD;
           participants' medical history, current medications and family history of disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sir Peter Mansfield Imagining Centre Magnetic Resonance Safety Screening Form - to&#xD;
           assess potential contraindications to MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics &amp; contact details - to determine participants' date of birth, ethnicity and&#xD;
           postal address&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry, blood pressure and finger prick blood test Height, body mass and waist&#xD;
      circumference will be measured using standard techniques and body mass index (BMI) will be&#xD;
      calculated. Body fat percentage will be estimated using bioelectrical impedance analysis.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be assessed using an automated monitor after participants have sat&#xD;
      quietly for 10 minutes (average of three measurements). A finger prick blood test will be&#xD;
      taken to check preliminary eligibility (HbA1c, glucose, lipids) using a point-of-care device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) MRI data will be acquired using a 3T Philips Ingenia MRI&#xD;
      scanner. Liver fat quality indices and total intrahepatocellular liver fat fractions will be&#xD;
      determined using 1H-MRS via the quantification of individual lipid group peaks. Liver&#xD;
      inflammation, visceral adipose tissue and subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue will be&#xD;
      measured via MRI. The techniques used to measure these outcomes have been validated and&#xD;
      published previously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Familiarisation with weighed food records and physical activity monitors Participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a wrist worn (watch-like) physical activity monitor (GENEactiv) that they will&#xD;
      wear 24 h/day for the next seven days. Participants will also be shown how to keep an&#xD;
      accurate weighed food record and will be provided with food scales and diary to facilitate a&#xD;
      three day record within the next seven days (two week and one weekend day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this session, MRI scans will be assessed to examine whether or not participants have an&#xD;
      amount of liver fat that if high enough for inclusion in the study (&gt; 5.56%). If liver fat is&#xD;
      less than this then participants will not be permitted to participate. If liver fat is equal&#xD;
      to or greater than this level then participants will be invited to attend study assessment&#xD;
      visit two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment visit 2 - Leicester General Hospital (Leicester Diabetes Centre) or Queens Medical&#xD;
      Centre Hospital (NIHR Nottingham BRC)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to attend the second study assessment visit having not eaten since&#xD;
      the prior evening. These visits will therefore occur in the morning (before 10:30). At the&#xD;
      start of this visit participants will provide a fasting venepuncture blood sample (40 mL&#xD;
      blood) after having sat down for 10 minutes. This sample will be collected from an&#xD;
      antecubital vein by an individual trained and experienced in phlebotomy. One blood bottle&#xD;
      will be sent to hospital pathology labs for the analysis of glycated haemoglobin. The&#xD;
      remaining samples will be spun immediately in a refrigerated centrifuge to obtain&#xD;
      plasma/serum. These samples will subsequently be stored until the end of the trial within -80&#xD;
      degrees (celsius) freezers at the research sites. Following the last participants visit,&#xD;
      samples will be transported to Loughborough University (at -80 degrees ) by a commercial&#xD;
      courier. Samples will then be analysed in batch for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  C-reactive protein&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Liver enzymes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nonesterifed fatty acids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hepatokines&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inflammatory proteins&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical evaluation and aerobic fitness A medical professional will take a full medical&#xD;
      history from participants in order to identify any factors that may prohibit individuals from&#xD;
      completing the study. A 12 lead ECG will also be performed along with a physical examination.&#xD;
      Finally, a symptom limited progressive treadmill exercise test will be undertaken on a&#xD;
      treadmill. This test will require participants to exercise at increasingly harder intensities&#xD;
      until volitional exhaustion. A clinical professional will monitor participants' blood&#xD;
      pressure and ECG during this test which will be terminated if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation After visit two participants will be randomised (1:1) to condition (exercise&#xD;
      training or control). Randomisation will be performed by the trial statistician (Dr Ghazala&#xD;
      Waheed) (see section 13 for additional details). The involvement of participants who are only&#xD;
      completing Part A of the study will end at this point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six week intervention Participants randomised to control will receive no interventions during&#xD;
      the six week intervention phase. During this time, control participants will be asked to not&#xD;
      change any aspects of their lifestyles. Ahead of week five, participants will be posted a&#xD;
      physical activity monitor to wear continuously during week five and six. Participants will&#xD;
      also complete weighed food diaries during week five (two week days and one weekend day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomised to exercise training will complete four exercise training sessions&#xD;
      per week during the six week intervention. Each week, three sessions will be supervised by&#xD;
      the research team whilst one session of brisk walking will be undertaken on participants'&#xD;
      own. All exercise sessions will be composed of continuous moderate-intensity exercise and&#xD;
      last 35 - 50 minutes in duration (depending on intervention week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment visit 3 (post-intervention) - Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Centre (University of&#xD;
      Nottingham) The assessments undertaken at visit three will be a repeat of those completed&#xD;
      during visit one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment visit 4 (post-intervention) - Leicester General Hospital (Leicester Diabetes&#xD;
      Centre) or Queens Medical Centre Hospital (NIHR Nottingham BRC) The assessments undertaken at&#xD;
      visit four will be a repeat of those completed during visit two except that a medical&#xD;
      examination will not be performed.&#xD;
