  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is known that cryotherapy has various therapeutic applications, among which are the&#xD;
      control of the inflammatory process, resolution of edema, analgesia and decreased spasticity.&#xD;
      In addition, the use of cold as an agent to decrease or facilitate neuromuscular activity has&#xD;
      been documented. The scientific information that supports the relationship of short duration&#xD;
      cold with the improvement of the motor response is scarce and outdated. The objective of this&#xD;
      design is to evaluate the effectiveness of rapid cooling or Quick Icing technique in the&#xD;
      improvement of muscular performance. The foregoing would be relevant in the field of&#xD;
      Kinesiology (Physiotherapy) because it would attribute cold properties that could influence&#xD;
      the increase in muscle strength, favoring the performance of different therapeutic exercises,&#xD;
      training or high performance sport, in addition to supporting the proposal of this&#xD;
      intervention in patients with particular neurological disorders.&#xD;

      Methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type of study. Experimental study, randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Conceptual definition of the variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jump strength: Maximum force developed by an individual for a counter-movement jump&#xD;
                test measured in Newtons.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Flight time: Maximum air suspension time when performing the counter movement jump&#xD;
                test measured in seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jump height: Maximum height reached by an individual for a counter movement jump&#xD;
                test measured in centimeters for the &quot;My Jump 2®&quot; application.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Rapid cooling (Quick Icing): Short application of cold for a time not greater than&#xD;
                thirty seconds on a body surface, seeking to promote neuromuscular excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prolonged cold: Application of cold for at least five minutes or more on a body&#xD;
                surface, seeking to decrease the VCN of the underlying muscles and skin receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Operational definition of the variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jumping strength: It will be obtained through the program &quot;My Jump 2®&quot; whose&#xD;
                software integrates the variables of flight time and height for its determination,&#xD;
                will be measured in Newton.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time of flight: &quot;Globus Ergo Tester ®&quot; through a processor, which time the takeoff&#xD;
                and landing of the individual, the processor has incorporated a formula that&#xD;
                determines the height in meters through the following h = (t2 xg) / 8 (68).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jump height: On the other hand, the &quot;My Jump 2®&quot; application incorporates a&#xD;
                mathematical program that determines the jump height in centimeters.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quick Icing: It will be applied through the technique of ice cups on the anterior&#xD;
                region of both thighs in the experimental group (ANNEX 5. ICE CUPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prolonged cold: It will be applied through the ice bag technique (Ice Bag) on the&#xD;
                anterior region of both thighs in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Definition of the type of variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jump strength: Dependent, quantitative, reason variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Jump height: Dependent, quantitative, reason variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quick cooling (Quick Icing): Independent variable, qualitative, nominal.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Prolonged cold: Independent variable, qualitative, nominal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Students of the Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences (FCR) of careers in occupational&#xD;
           therapy and phonoaudiology, and kinesiology from the first to third year of the Andrés&#xD;
           Bello University (UNAB).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Place of investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will be carried out in the physiotherapy laboratory of the Faculty of&#xD;
           Rehabilitation Sciences (FCR), building C5, laboratory 401, Campus Casona Andrés Bello&#xD;
           University, Santiago de Chile.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has the characteristics of a randomized analytical experimental design (RCT).&#xD;
      The study will be presented to the ethics committee of the Metropolitan Health Service East&#xD;
      (SSMO) of the city of Santiago, to ensure that the study meets the necessary ethical&#xD;
      considerations. Once the study is approved by the committee, the investigation will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be determined through an intentional selection process through a&#xD;
      participation survey constituted by closed questions. This survey will allow the selection of&#xD;
      potential participants according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria proposed in the&#xD;
      research. The number of participants that will make up the sample will be taken by the&#xD;
      convenience of the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three stages of study conduction have been designated. Stage one, called &quot;sampling stage&quot;,&#xD;
      will consist in the application of the survey to the students of the different levels of the&#xD;
      three careers of the Faculty and will last for four weeks. Then the information collected&#xD;
      will be analyzed by making a first filter in the selection of potential participants. This&#xD;
      filter is given by the survey questions that will reflect the inclusive and exclusive&#xD;
      criteria. A personal contact will be made of the participants that fulfill the selection&#xD;
      characteristics and they will be invited to be part of the study. The purpose of the&#xD;
      investigation will be explained to the potential participants and their written consent of&#xD;
      participation will be requested. The consent document delivered will be previously approved&#xD;
      by the bioethics committee of the Metropolitan Health Service East (SSMO), with headquarters&#xD;
      in the Hospital Salvador, Providencia district. Stage one will last three weeks, following&#xD;
      the planned proposal in the Gantt letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage two of the design, called the &quot;Evaluation stage&quot;, will last four weeks according to&#xD;
      what is proposed in the Gantt chart. This stage will consist in carrying out the ice cube&#xD;
      test following the established evaluation protocol. With this test it will be possible to&#xD;
      assess whether or not there are adverse responses to cold. This will allow applying a second&#xD;
      filter of the selectable participants and who consented to participate consensually, and who&#xD;
      were not excluded from the selection survey. Next, an assessment of the participants' ability&#xD;
      to perform a jump type against movement in a painless way will be made in a scenario with the&#xD;
      same environmental conditions in which the research will be carried out (Physiotherapy&#xD;
      laboratory of the Faculty of Rehabilitation Sciences, room 401, C5). Stage two will be an&#xD;
      instance of second filtering of the participants' selection, in order to have the people who&#xD;
      will finally form the working groups of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage three, called experimentation stage, will last for eight weeks. The participants will&#xD;
      be distributed forming three working groups, a group called rapid cooling (ER), another group&#xD;
      called prolonged cooling (EP) and a third group called control (C). The designation for each&#xD;
      group will be previously carried out by a simple randomization process using a table of&#xD;
      random numbers, and will be in charge of the study director. This randomization process will&#xD;
      try to minimize the selection bias. The principal investigator will be the only one with the&#xD;
      numbered list of the participants of each group. From this process of randomization the&#xD;
      division of the groups will be established; G1 (ER), G2 (EP) and G3 (C). Once the three&#xD;
      groups have been formed, an evaluator 1 will record the demographic characteristics of each&#xD;
      participant. This record will include data such as; age, body mass index (BMI), gender and&#xD;
      percentage of body fat. This information will be extracted from the survey of selection of&#xD;
      the participants that will make up the groups and measurement of body fat percentage through&#xD;
      bioimpedance. This analysis will allow to determine the homogeneity of the groups. An&#xD;
      evaluator 2, unaware of the groups, will perform the jump measurements (counter movement&#xD;
      mode) using the jump platform (Globus Ergo Tester®) and the mobile application (MyJump2®)&#xD;
      following the protocol for evaluating and recording proposed data. By means of the jump&#xD;
      platform, the flight times of each execution will be obtained, while with the mobile program&#xD;
      the strength of the jump and height will be determined. Before performing the jump test, a&#xD;
      five-minute pre-heating in a cycloergometer (MONARK 915E®) at a power of 80 watts will be&#xD;
      performed. The heating will be done in the same room where the jump platform and the mobile&#xD;
      application will be arranged. Evaluator 2 will request three jump executions in&#xD;
      counter-movement mode (CMJ) (pre-intervention jumps) considering 15 seconds for each&#xD;
      execution (including verbal order and execution) and leaving a rest interval of 60 seconds&#xD;
      between each attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The variables flight time, strength and height of the jump of the three executions will be&#xD;
      tabulated in a Microsoft Excel® program template and the best values will be marked, such as&#xD;
      &quot;flight time, jump force and maximum pre height&quot;. Subsequently the participants will be&#xD;
      referred to their corresponding intervention group, that is, rapid cooling (ER), prolonged&#xD;
      cooling (EP) or control group (C). In the laboratory there will be three work boxes, one for&#xD;
      each intervention procedure. Interveners will only have contact with the subjects belonging&#xD;
      to their work group, without knowing the participants of the other groups, thus ensuring&#xD;
      blinding and avoiding intervention bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be 10 minutes in their respective work box. In each box an interventor&#xD;
      will be placed. The first minute of the contemplated time will be used for the installation&#xD;
      of each individual, leaving the remaining 9 for the intervention. The participants will be&#xD;
      positioned lying on a stretcher with their back inclined at 45° leaving both thighs&#xD;
      uncovered. The subjects of the Quick Icing group (G1) will be subjected to the application of&#xD;
      cold on the front of both thighs for 30 seconds, using the technique of ice cups dynamically.&#xD;
      Group 1 participants must wait for eight minutes for the application after they are&#xD;
      installed. The application will be made within the last minute before ending the 10 minutes&#xD;
      of stay in the box. The group of prolonged cold (G2) will receive the intervention of ice bag&#xD;
      for a period of 10 minutes after the first minute of installation, which will be applied on&#xD;
      the anterior side of the thighs. The ice pack will weigh 700 grams. The control group (G3)&#xD;
      will not receive any intervention and will be left to rest for 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 10 minutes the individuals of each group will be driven back to the jump measurement&#xD;
      laboratory. Evaluator 2 will again record the execution of 3 jumps following the same&#xD;
      protocol described before the intervention. The variable flight time, strength and height of&#xD;
      the jump of the three executions will be tabulated in a Microsoft Excel® program spreadsheet&#xD;
      and the best post-intervention values will be marked as &quot;flight time, strength and height&#xD;
      maximum jump post&quot;. Based on the data obtained, that is, pre and post intervention, the&#xD;
      variables &quot;flight time difference, force difference and jump height&quot; will be determined for&#xD;
      sessions 1, 2 and 3, which will allow analyzing the changes before and after the&#xD;
      intervention. All the described measurement will be recorded as the data obtained on day 1.&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to repeat the same test on two other occasions, on day 3&#xD;
      (session 2) and on day 7 (session 3), leaving thus an interval of two days between each&#xD;
      measurement. For session 2 and 3, the jump test will be repeated following the same protocol&#xD;
      described and already used on day 1 of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Statistic analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This stage will be in charge of the principal investigator, who will be responsible for&#xD;
      storing and organizing the data collected by the evaluators. The statistical analysis of the&#xD;
      data will be carried out with the STATA v13.0® program. The flight time, force and height&#xD;
      jump will be considered as primary variables of the study. On the other hand, age, sex and&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) will be considered as secondary variables. The Shapiro Wilk test&#xD;
      (S-Wilk) will be applied to evaluate the statistical distribution behavior of the primary&#xD;
      variables. and height of jump pre, post and its difference. According to their statistical&#xD;
      behavior, averages or medians will be used to represent the data. The same statistic will be&#xD;
      applied to the secondary variables such as age and BMI to represent them as averages or&#xD;
      medians. The secondary sex variable will be described as a function of frequencies. To&#xD;
      perform the intra and intergroup comparisons, the ANOVA or K-WALLIS statistics will be used&#xD;
      depending on the statistical behavior of the variables thrown by the S-Wilk test. The&#xD;
      analysis will also consider the differences of the values obtained for the primary variables&#xD;
      in between sessions 1, 2 and 3 of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation protocol: Ice cube test. The ice cube test involves placing an ice cube (0 to 4&#xD;
      °C) on the forearm for five minutes, then removing it and waiting approximately 10 minutes&#xD;
      for the skin to return to its normal temperature. It is considered that the test is positive&#xD;
      when there is formation of a welt or confluent welts at the place of application. It is&#xD;
      recommended to cover the ice cube with a plastic bag to avoid contact of the skin with water.&#xD;
      If there is wheal formation, we proceed to produce shorter stimuli with reductions of one&#xD;
      minute, until we find the minimum time with which the patient reacts. These new exposures&#xD;
      should be done in different sites of the forearm, to avoid negative results by degranulation&#xD;
      of mast cells and desensitization of the skin. If there is no wheal training at the first&#xD;
      five-minute exposure, the exposure time is increased by one minute, usually up to ten&#xD;
      minutes; if there is no wheal training in any of these new exposures, the test is considered&#xD;
      negative and the patient is unlikely to experience cold hives. In the scientific literature&#xD;
      it is considered that the ice cube test has a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 100%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the ice cube test it is posible obtain three results: a negative test, a positive test&#xD;
      during the registration period or an atypical response. Cold urticarias with an atypical&#xD;
      response share two common characteristics: 1) clinical history of urticaria or cold&#xD;
      angioedema, and 2) negative ice cube test immediately (except for cold reflex urticaria).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol for conducting the Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject sitting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder position: adducted without rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Elbow position: flexed at 90º. This will be ensured by a splint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Forearm position: supination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place an ice cube on the ventral side of the opposite forearm for a period of 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unwanted responses are observed within 10 minutes after the test. The test will be&#xD;
           positive if there are responses such as: hives, appearance of flictenas, cold&#xD;
           intolerance, profuse erythema or pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Jump protocol and parameter registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anthropometric data of each user will be recorded: age, weight and height since&#xD;
           these are required for the use of the MyJump2® application.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be taught the execution of the jump-against-movement (CMJ) test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will then undergo a previous warm-up on a cycle ergometer (MONARK 915E®)&#xD;
           for a period of five minutes. The heating will be done with a load power of 80 watts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the warm-up the subjects will go to the jump platform (Globus Ergo tester®). The&#xD;
           subject A video camera of a mobile phone will be placed in front of the subject at 1.5&#xD;
           meters focusing on the feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For simultaneous measurement with the MyJump2® application, the subject must jump 3&#xD;
           times with 1-minute rest intervals. A time of 15 seconds will be consigned for the&#xD;
           completion of each attempt. Once the 3 jumps have been made, the subjects will be taken&#xD;
           to the intervention boxes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In each of the boxes it will be designated for different groups: control, cold and&#xD;
           long-term cold and short duration, in each box will be ten minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the intervention, the three groups will repeat the jump test.&#xD;
