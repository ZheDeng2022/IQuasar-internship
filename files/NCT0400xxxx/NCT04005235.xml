  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upper extremity nerve blocks of the brachial plexus using local anesthetic can inadvertently&#xD;
      affect the ipsilateral phrenic nerve and result in hemidiaphragm dysfunction. Ultrasonography&#xD;
      is often used to assess for hemidiaphragm dysfunction after brachial plexus nerve blocks.&#xD;
      Alternately, post-operative chest x-rays can also be used to document unilateral&#xD;
      hemidiaphragm elevation secondary to phrenic nerve dysfunction. Newly developed passive&#xD;
      breathing testing devices (Forced Oscillometry Technique - FOT) use small composite pressure&#xD;
      waveforms (5-37Hz) imposed on top of normal breathing and measure the resulting reflected&#xD;
      oscillations to assess the mechanical properties of the lungs. The lung resistance R(f) and&#xD;
      reactance X(f) are automatically mathematically derived from the reflected pressure waveforms&#xD;
      returning from the respiratory system to the FOT device. In this study, we will assess if FOT&#xD;
      can be used to detect changes in lung mechanics (lung resistance R(f) and reactance X(f))&#xD;
      after ultrasound proven hemidiaphragm dysfunction secondary to brachial plexus nerve block.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective single centre observational trial using the Tremoflo Forced&#xD;
      Oscillometry Technique (FOT) device to assess the changes in lung mechanical parameters after&#xD;
      a brachial plexus nerve block with ultrasound confirmed hemidiaphragm dysfunction (HDD). The&#xD;
      serial cohort in this study will be patients presenting for unilateral upper extremity&#xD;
      surgery who are having a regional nerve block for anesthesia as part of their normal standard&#xD;
      of care for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOT has proven useful in monitoring and diagnosing small airway diseases such as asthma and&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, with further applications of FOT being researched in&#xD;
      perioperative care applications including inhaled anesthesia and mechanical ventilation. The&#xD;
      Tremoflo is useful in perioperative applications because it does not require active breathing&#xD;
      maneuvers, unlike traditional pulmonary function tests like spirometry. This technique uses a&#xD;
      composite waveform of (5,11,13,17,19,23, 29, 31 and 37 Hz) to measures respiratory system&#xD;
      resistance (R(f), cmH2O/L/sec) as a function of frequency, reactance (X(f), cmH2O/L/sec) as a&#xD;
      function of frequency, and the resonance frequency. Resistance increases as the airways&#xD;
      narrow while a decrease in reactance represents stiffening or loss of inertia in the lungs.&#xD;
      Resonance frequency is the frequency at which reactance as a function of frequency is equal&#xD;
      to zero, it represents both the overall stiffening of the lungs and obstruction of the small&#xD;
      airways. Oscillation, specifically at low frequencies (5-20Hz), measures the mechanical&#xD;
      properties of the peripheral airways while oscillation at higher frequencies (&gt;20Hz) measures&#xD;
      the mechanical properties of the central and upper respiratory system, giving one a more&#xD;
      complete overview of lung function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to study enrollment, patients will be screened and consented accordance to the&#xD;
      department standard operating procedures. Demographic data will be collected including age,&#xD;
      sex, weight, height, comorbid conditions to rule out any exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline ultrasonographic diaphragmatic assessment and Tremoflo measurement will be&#xD;
      completed by all participants prior to nerve block. Any significant neurologic dysfunction,&#xD;
      inability to visualize the diaphragm during sonographic assessment, pre-existing HDD or&#xD;
      inability to use the Tremoflo device will result in withdrawing the patient from the study.&#xD;
      Study participants will then receive a pre-operative ultrasound guided interscalene (ISB) or&#xD;
      supraclavicular (SCB) brachial plexus block as per standard of care. A standard clinical&#xD;
      mixture of ropivacaine and lidocaine will be injected incrementally at the discretion of the&#xD;
      attending anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ultrasound machine with a linear transducer will be used to assess for hemidiaphragm&#xD;
      dysfunction every 5 minutes after nerve block or until 30 minutes has elapsed. All subjects&#xD;
      will lie in a semi-recumbent position. With the ultrasound set in B-mode, a longitudinal scan&#xD;
      will be performed. The ABCDE (airway, breathing, circulation, disability and exposure)&#xD;
      evaluation approach will be used which involves first placing the ultrasound probe along the&#xD;
      anterior axillary line just below the 4th intercostal space on the ipsilateral side to the&#xD;
      brachial plexus block. The movement of the pleura on top of the diaphragm will be visualized&#xD;
      between the two ribs during normal breathing. The probe will then be moved caudally along the&#xD;
      anterior axillary line to identify diaphragmatic thickening, where it will no longer be&#xD;
      hidden under the pleura during inspiration, for examination. The diaphragm can then be easily&#xD;
      distinguished from the adjacent intercostal muscles with visualization of the pleura just&#xD;
      superficial to the diaphragm. The operator will visually examine the diaphragmatic muscle for&#xD;
      the presence of a change in thickness. The probe will then be moved caudally, and when&#xD;
      diaphragmatic thickening is clearly visualized in the zone of apposition, the thickness of&#xD;
      diaphragm during expiration and deep inspiration will be determined using on-screen&#xD;
      measurement caliper software built into ultrasound machine. Diaphragmatic dysfunction will be&#xD;
      determined by intercostal diaphragm thickening based on validated criteria, with diaphragm&#xD;
      thickening of less than 20% defined as dysfunction. The ultrasound image will be saved&#xD;
      anonymously using a predefined study number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Tremoflo FOT assessment will be repeated after confirmed HDD by ultrasound criteria. All&#xD;
      measurements will be taken while patients are in the semi-recumbent position, with the&#xD;
      nostrils occluded using a disposable plastic clip that is routinely used with the Tremoflo&#xD;
      device. A research team member will hold the Tremoflo device in the patients mouth and&#xD;
      research staff or a Block room team member will gently support cheeks during all Tremoflo&#xD;
      measurements. The research team will need to hold the device and support the cheeks as the&#xD;
      patient will lack motor and sensory function due to the ISB/SCB nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the surgery, ultrasound diaphragmatic motion assessment and Tremoflo FOT&#xD;
      measurement will be repeated in the post-operative care unit in the semi-recumbent position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective self-reported dyspnea (using the Modified Borg Dyspnea Scale, ordinal 0-10 scale&#xD;
      with 0 = no breathlessness and 10 = maximal breathlessness) will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      then every 5 minutes after the nerve block until patient leaves for operating room or 30&#xD;
      minutes (whatever is earlier) and in the post-operative care unit at the time of ultrasound&#xD;
      and FOT measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients' data including age, sex, height (cm), weight (kg), body mass index (BMI) kg/m2,&#xD;
      pertinent cardio-thoracic and neurologic medical history, nerve block details, ultrasound&#xD;
      images and relevant anesthesia/surgical details (duration of surgical procedure, anesthetic&#xD;
      type - regional anesthesia only vs. general anesthesia combined with upper extremity nerve&#xD;
      block, muscle relaxant/reversal use - drug type and dose, airway management - oxygen face&#xD;
      mask vs. laryngeal mask airway vs. tracheal tube) will be recorded for study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The co-primary outcome measures of this pilot study will be to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Changes in FOT measured lung resistance R(f) after ultrasound confirmed HDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in FOT measured lung reactance X(f) after ultrasound confirmed HDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes will be to determine the incidence of subjective shortness of breath&#xD;
      associated with an ISB/SCB and to determine FOT measured lung reactance and resistance&#xD;
      changes after both a regional block and general anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for the primary outcome measure was estimated using data from a study of FOT&#xD;
      lung resistance changes at 5 Hz (R5) before and after patients underwent surgery for &gt;2hrs&#xD;
      under general anesthetic. Based on those outcomes, using a 1-sided T-test with alpha = 0.05,&#xD;
      and beta = 0.8, sigma = 0.82, u1 = 2.31 and u2 = 2.75 the sample size required is 22&#xD;
      subjects. In order to account for drop-outs/attrition, 25 patients who experience HDD will be&#xD;
      recruited to complete the study. The rate of HDD is different for the two standard types of&#xD;
      upper extremity of nerve blocks used in this study. In the literature, ISB causes HDD in 100%&#xD;
      of cases, while SCB incidence of HDD has been estimated at 50-67%. Historically, SCB are&#xD;
      performed at a 4:1 ratio compared to ISB at our institution during normal surgical case&#xD;
      loads. Based on these approximations, we anticipate recruiting 5 ISB (with 100% HDD) and 40&#xD;
      SCB (with a conservative estimated rate of 50% HDD) nerve block patients to meet our event&#xD;
      rate based recruitment of a total of 25 patients who develop HDD for a total of 45 patients&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous respiratory variables automatically calculated by the Tremflo FOT device, such as&#xD;
      respiratory system resistance, reactance, resonance frequency, tidal volume and respiratory&#xD;
      rate will be expressed as mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range&#xD;
      dependant on their distribution. Changes in respiratory system resistance, reactance,&#xD;
      resonance frequency, tidal volume and respiratory rate from before and after nerve block will&#xD;
      be compared using ANOVA or appropriate non-parametric testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be receiving any compensation, financial or otherwise, for their&#xD;
      participation in this study.&#xD;
