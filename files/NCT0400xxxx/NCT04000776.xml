      Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid organ cancer in North American men. Patients&#xD;
      becoming refractory to loco-regional therapy receive androgen deprivation therapy, but their&#xD;
      disease will inevitably progress to metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
      Treatment failure and poor progression-free survival could be explained by the fact that PCa&#xD;
      metastases in the same patient may be polyclonal, showing opposite responses to systemic&#xD;
      therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to recruit 100 patients with mCRPC in order to determine the prevalence of&#xD;
      intrapatient intermetastasis polyclonality and NED using PET/CT triple-tracer&#xD;
      PSMA/FDG/OCTREOTATE imaging and eligibility for either PSMA or OCTREOTATE radioligand therapy&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common solid organ cancer in North American&#xD;
      men. Patients becoming refractory to loco-regional therapy receive androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy, but their disease will inevitably progress to metastatic castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (mCRPC). Of the five treatments approved for mCRPC patients, none has been&#xD;
      shown to increase median overall survival beyond 4.8 months. Treatment failure and poor&#xD;
      progression-free survival could be explained by the fact that PCa metastases in the same&#xD;
      patient may be polyclonal, showing opposite responses to systemic therapies. Indeed,&#xD;
      neuroendocrine differentiation from adenocarcinoma is often reported in metastatic PCa, which&#xD;
      is associated with increased disease aggressiveness. Currently, no molecular tools are&#xD;
      available to follow non-invasively mCRPC transdifferentiation and diagnose patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine and/or polyclonal PCa. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a promising type&#xD;
      of imaging using radio-labeled tracers to specifically identify tumour cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The hypothesis of the 3TMPO clinical study is that the prevalence of intrapatient&#xD;
      intermetastasis polyclonality can be diagnosed by combining 18F-FDG to other specific PET&#xD;
      tracers that have the ability to non-invasively differentiate CRPC adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      (CRPC-Adeno) (68Ga-PSMA) from neuroendocrine CRPC (CRPC-NE) tumours (68Ga-OCTREOTATE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The study objectives are to determine, in mCRPC patients, the prevalence of&#xD;
      intrapatient intermetastasis polyclonality and NED using PET/CT triple tracer&#xD;
      PSMA/FDG/OCTREOTATE imaging and their eligibility for radioligand therapy (RLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This multicentre observational clinical study, for which prevalence of intrapatient&#xD;
      intermetastasis polyclonality was set as the primary outcome, will recruit 100 mCRPC patients&#xD;
      at 5 different sites across the province of Québec. 68Ga-PSMA and 18F-FDG PET scans will be&#xD;
      performed on all enrolled patients, while 68Ga-OCTREOTATE will be performed on those&#xD;
      presenting at least one PSMA-negative/FDG-positive lesion. The uptake of each individual&#xD;
      lesion will be assessed for each PET tracer and patients with lesions presenting discordant&#xD;
      uptake profiles will be considered as having polyclonal disease. OCTREOTATE-positivity will&#xD;
      confirm the presence of CRPC-NE. PSMA or OCTREOTATE positivity of all lesions (or at least&#xD;
      those with FDG uptake) will determine the eligibility for PSMA and OCTREOTATE RLT,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Paradigm-shifting diagnostic and therapeutic strategies are urgently needed to&#xD;
      improve the survival of patients with PCa and to deepen our understanding of mCRPC&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
