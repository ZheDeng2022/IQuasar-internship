  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Febrile neutropenia (FN) continues to be the infectious complication that most commonly&#xD;
      requires hospitalization in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. In recent&#xD;
      years, data have been published on the effectiveness of treatment of FN events with oral&#xD;
      antibiotics, mainly in developed countries, but data from developing countries continue to be&#xD;
      scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis was that early change from initial in-patient intravenous antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      to oral outpatient antibiotic treatment in children with cancer and FN is as safe and&#xD;
      effective as in-patient intravenous antibiotic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study was to determine whether early outpatient oral antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment is not inferior in safety and efficacy to in-hospital intravenous antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment in pediatric patients with cancer and low-risk FN events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multicenter, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted in three public&#xD;
      hospitals in Mexico City. Low-risk FN events were identified in children aged 1 to 18 years.&#xD;
      After 48 to 72 hours of receiving intravenous in-hospital antibiotics, children were randomly&#xD;
      allocated to receive outpatient oral treatment (cefixime) or to continue in-hospital&#xD;
      intravenous treatment (cefepime). Daily monitoring was performed until the resolution of&#xD;
      neutropenia. Our outcome of interest was the presence of any unfavorable clinical outcome.&#xD;

      Introduction: Febrile neutropenia (FN) continues to be the infectious complication that most&#xD;
      commonly requires hospitalization in pediatric cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Classically these patients have been managed as inpatient. In recent years, data have been&#xD;
      published on the effectiveness of treatment of FN events with oral antibiotics, mainly in&#xD;
      developed countries, but data from developing countries continue to be scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Our hypothesis was that early change from initial in-patient intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment to oral outpatient antibiotic treatment in children with cancer and FN&#xD;
      is as safe and effective as in-patient intravenous antibiotic management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The purpose of this clinical study was to determine whether early outpatient oral&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment is not inferior in safety and efficacy to in-hospital intravenous&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment in pediatric patients with cancer and low-risk FN events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: A multicenter, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial was conducted in three&#xD;
      public hospitals in Mexico City. Low-risk FN events were identified in children aged 1 to 18&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete medical history, physical examination and review of laboratory tests and cultures&#xD;
      were performed on all subjects with FN events who were considered low risk. According to&#xD;
      local guidelines for the treatment of FN, all subjects began receiving cefepime at a dose of&#xD;
      150 mg/kg/day. Subjects were followed-up daily, and those who met the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria after 48 to 72 hours of in-hospital intravenous treatment with cefepime were&#xD;
      randomly assigned to receive outpatient treatment with oral cefixime at a dose of 8 mg/kg/day&#xD;
      or to continue in-hospital intravenous treatment. The treatment was administered by the&#xD;
      researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in both treatment groups were evaluated daily by a complete physical&#xD;
      examination. Subjects in the outpatient group were evaluated at the outpatient clinic of the&#xD;
      hospital. All patients underwent a blood count every 48 to 72 hours. FN event resolution was&#xD;
      defined as when the patient remained afebrile and the absolute neutrophil count (ANC)&#xD;
      increased to above 500 per microliter. If fever resumed, the antibiotic regimen was modified.&#xD;
      If the subjects were in the outpatient group, they were re-admitted to the hospital to&#xD;
      receive intravenous antibiotics. Resolution of the FN event was defined as the end of&#xD;
      participation of the subjects in the study, and they were followed up for an additional 72&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The occurrence of any of the following conditions was considered an unfavorable clinical&#xD;
      outcome: 1) therapeutic failure, defined as the resumption of fever in a patient with&#xD;
      persistent neutropenia. For all patients with resumption of fever, the antibiotic regimen was&#xD;
      switched, and if the patients were in the outpatient treatment group, they were re-admitted&#xD;
      to the hospital; 2) new focus of infection, documented both by the clinical condition and by&#xD;
      laboratory and other diagnostic tests; 3) hemodynamic instability, defined as a decrease in&#xD;
      blood pressure below the 5th percentile for the patient age that did not revert with the&#xD;
      administration of crystalloid solutions; and 4) death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The sample size was calculated to reject a null hypothesis of inferiority, with&#xD;
      a non-inferiority margin of presentation of unfavorable clinical outcomes of 15%. A formula&#xD;
      including a statistical power of 80% and a one-tailed alpha value of 0.025 was used to&#xD;
      calculate the sample size of 2 independent proportions. Based on previous reports of 10% of&#xD;
      unfavorable clinical outcomes during the management of FN events, the calculation yielded a&#xD;
      total of 63 FN events per group for a total of 126 events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: A random sequence balanced by blocks of 4 FN events was generated using a&#xD;
      computer program. A physician who did not participate in the subject selection assigned&#xD;
      subjects to receive either outpatient oral treatment at home or to continue in-hospital&#xD;
      intravenous treatment. If the subjects lived more than 1 hour away from the hospital, they&#xD;
      were assigned to a care home to ensure that they could return to the hospital in case of any&#xD;
      event. Because the study intervention involved outpatient treatment, the study was open. All&#xD;
      patients were provided with the antibiotic free of charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The focus of analysis was intention-to-treat. For each comparison&#xD;
      group, measures of central tendency and dispersion were estimated for continuous variables,&#xD;
      and absolute and relative frequencies were determined for discrete and nominal variables. The&#xD;
      statistical test performed to test the hypothesis of non-inferiority is very similar to the&#xD;
      traditional test for comparison of proportions; the only difference is that the&#xD;
      non-inferiority margin is added to the formula, and a p-value &lt; 0.05 confirms&#xD;
      non-inferiority. The statistical program STATA version 14.2 was used for the analysis.&#xD;
