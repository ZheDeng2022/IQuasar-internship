      This study research the similarity of coronary artery lesions according to HLA tissue&#xD;
      compatibility in fisrt degree relatives of the patients who just admitted clinic as Acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome and underwent angiyography before .&#xD;

      Coronary artery disease (CAD), which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis, is the most&#xD;
      prevalent illness and the leading cause of death worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that&#xD;
      inflammation plays a primordial role in atherogenesis and is closely associated with the&#xD;
      major histocompatibility complex (MHC) (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules.&#xD;
      HLA genes are located in 6p21.3, the proteins encoded by these HLA genes have a major role to&#xD;
      play in antigen presentation and inflammatory pathways. HLA involvement in inflammation is&#xD;
      mainly associated with the HLA-dependent activation of T cells. studies reported that the&#xD;
      susceptibility to CAD is related with the polymorphisms in HLA-DRB1. The above evidence&#xD;
      indicates that the polymorphisms in HLA class II are associated with the risk of CAD . This&#xD;
      study research investigate three objects , firstly what is the similarity of the coronary&#xD;
      artery lesions according to the compatability of HLA alleles between the first degree&#xD;
      relatives who went angiography before , secondly is there any relation between HLA subtype&#xD;
      allels and the coronary artery (RCA ?LAD ? ,CX? and can such a relation be responsible from&#xD;
      the lesions in this artery ,finally is there any relation between HLA subtypes and turkish&#xD;
      race coronary artery disease&#xD;
