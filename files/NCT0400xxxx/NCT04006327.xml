      This study aims to explore the prevalence of demoralization among palliative care patients&#xD;
      and family caregivers in Hong Kong and examines psychosocial factors associated with&#xD;
      demoralization. We hypothesized that higher depression, caregiving strain and caregiver&#xD;
      support needs would lead to higher demoralization, and greater perceived family support was&#xD;
      associated with lower demoralization among patients and family caregivers.&#xD;

      Literature Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demoralization in palliative care Palliative care patients (PCP) and their family caregivers&#xD;
      are always confronted with death and dying issues. The nature of terminal illness may lead to&#xD;
      their experience of demoralization. The importance of addressing the demoralization syndrome&#xD;
      among PCP was first proposed by Clarke and Kissane (2002). A systematic review reported that&#xD;
      the prevalence of demoralization is about 13% to 18% among palliative care patients&#xD;
      (Robinson, Kissane, Brooker &amp; Burney, 2016). Only one study examined the prevalence of&#xD;
      demoralization among family caregivers of PCP and that aro10% of them suffered from moderate&#xD;
      to severe demoralization (Hudson, Thomas, Trauer, Remedios, &amp; Clarke, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCP and family caregivers may find it difficult to cope with the challenges associated with&#xD;
      the terminal illness, and that they may experience a form of existential distress, which is&#xD;
      characterized by a sense of meaninglessness, hopelessness and helplessness (Figueriredo,&#xD;
      2013; Robinson, et al., 2016). Demoralization was considered as a key cause of developing&#xD;
      suicidal ideations (Julião, Nunes &amp; Barbosa, 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conceptualization and definition of demoralization Kissane (2000) conceptualized&#xD;
      demoralization as a syndrome with the following diagnostic criteria: 1. The experience of&#xD;
      emotional distress such as hopelessness and having meaning and purpose in life lost; 2.&#xD;
      Attitudes of helplessness, failure, pessimism, and lack of a worthwhile future; 3. Reduced&#xD;
      coping to respond differently; 4. Social isolation and deficiencies in social support;&#xD;
      5.Persistence if the above-mentioned phenomena across 2 or more weeks; and 6. Features of&#xD;
      major depression have not superseded as the primary disorder (Robinson et al., 2016, p.96).&#xD;
      Demoralization should be differentiated from depression, e.g. demoralized patients may still&#xD;
      enjoy the present moment but feel despair towards future (Clarke &amp; Kissane, 2002; Kissane &amp;&#xD;
      Doolittle, 2015). Demoralization may exist independently but can also co-exist with&#xD;
      depression. Previous studies showed that 14-27.4% of patients were demoralized but not&#xD;
      depressive, while 21.7-33% patients experienced both demoralization and depression (Fang et&#xD;
      al., 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors associated with demoralization Previous studies showed that demoralization was&#xD;
      associated with various socio-economic, physical and psychosocial factors. High&#xD;
      demoralization was associated with reduced quality of life, emotional and existential&#xD;
      distress (e.g. depression, anxiety and desire for hastened death, hopelessness, helplessness&#xD;
      and loss of meaning) and declining physiological functions (e.g. pain, fatigue and sleep&#xD;
      disorders) (Robinson, Kissane, Brooker &amp; Burney, 2015; Tang, Wang &amp; Chou, 2015). A strong&#xD;
      relationship was also found between demoralization and social functioning (Kissane and&#xD;
      Doolittle, 2015; Robinson et al., 2015; Tang et. al, 2015). Furthermore, demoralization was&#xD;
      found associated with sociodemographic, spiritual and familial factors, such as unemployment,&#xD;
      sex, family dysfunction, spiritual problem and dimensions to a person's life (Lee et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Li et al, 2017; Kissane and Doolittle, 2015; Robinson et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demoralization has been studied in the western societies in the past decade but little has&#xD;
      been known about demoralization prevalence among palliative care patients and family&#xD;
      caregivers in Hong Kong. As demoralization is a newly introduced concept, there is limited&#xD;
      understanding on its epidemiology and how it can be minimized among PC patients and&#xD;
      caregivers. It is thus important to conduct a pilot study in Hong Kong to explore the&#xD;
      prevalence of demoralization and factors associated with demoralization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore the prevalence of demoralization among palliative care patients and their&#xD;
           family caregiver in Hong Kong;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To examine the relationships of demoralization with different psychosocial factors (e.g.&#xD;
           depression, perceived family support, caregiving strain) among palliative care patients&#xD;
           and family caregivers in Hong Kong;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To understand how the illness experience may lead to demoralization among palliative&#xD;
           care patients and their family caregivers in Hong Kong;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To understand how palliative care may reduce demoralization among palliative care&#xD;
           patients and their family caregivers in Hong Kong;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To understand how palliative care patients and family caregivers care may cope with the&#xD;
           illness to avoid demoralization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study targets to recruit 200 palliative care patients (PCP) and family caregivers who&#xD;
      are newly referred to the Medical Social work department of Bradbury Hospice. This study will&#xD;
      employ a mixed method design to achieve the study objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative arm, patients and caregivers will be asked to complete a survey&#xD;
      respectively, which include different validated instruments. Assistance will be given for&#xD;
      completing the survey if necessary. For patient questionnaire, we will include the Chinese&#xD;
      version of Demoralization Scale (Hung et al., 2010), the 10-item version of Center for&#xD;
      Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D), and the Family subscale of the Chinese version of&#xD;
      Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. For the caregiver's questionnaire,&#xD;
      similar to the patient questionnaire, we plan to include the Demoralization Scale and CES-D,&#xD;
      but we also include the Chinese version of Modified Caregivers' Strain Index and the Carer&#xD;
      Support Needs Assessment tool (CSNAT). A total of 200 patients and caregivers will be&#xD;
      recruited. Data will be entered into SPSS for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For qualitative arm, individual interviews will be conducted with PCP and caregivers by a&#xD;
      trained research assistant. 6 PCP and 6 family caregivers will be purposively selected for&#xD;
      interview based on their demoralization level which was reflected from their demoralization&#xD;
      scores in the quantitative data. (i.e. 3 patients and 3 family caregivers from each of the&#xD;
      following groups: Low demoralization and high demoralization group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management and analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be stored confidentially in order to protect participant's privacy.&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be entered to SPSS for data analysis. Descriptive, bivariate&#xD;
      correlations bivariate correlations and regression analysis will be conducted and missing&#xD;
      data will be handled by mean substitution. For interviews data, all the audio-recorded&#xD;
      interviews will be transcribed to text for data analysis. Thematic analysis will be conducted&#xD;
      to identify the key themes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>This is a one-time self-reported assessment which will take less than 15 minutes to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver strain of caregivers will be measured with the Chinese version of Modified caregiver strain index (M-CSI). The scale comprises of 13 items that measure strain related to care provision. Caregivers will be asked to indicate the level of distress caused by each item, ranging from &quot;not at all&quot; to &quot;Yes, quite often,&quot; on a scale of 0 to 2. A total strain score will be obtained by adding up the scores for each response, with a possible total score ranging from 0 to 26. A higher score indicates higher level of caregiver strain.</description>

    <measure>Caregiver Support Needs of caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>This is a one-time self-reported assessment which will take less than 15 minutes to complete.</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver Support needs of family caregivers will be measured by the Chinese version of caregivers support needs assessment tool (CSNAT). The CSNAT was originally designed as a screening tool to identify caregivers key support needs that require further supports. This tool contains 14 support domains and there are 4 response options for each of the CSNAT items, which allows family caregivers to indicate the extent of their support requirements for each domain: &quot;no more&quot;, &quot;a little more,&quot; &quot;quite a bit more,&quot; or &quot;very much more&quot;. This assessment tool does not create a total score of caregiver support needs.</description>
