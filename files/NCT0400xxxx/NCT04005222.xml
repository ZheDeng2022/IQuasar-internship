      ABSTRACT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: To determine the effects of selenium, melatonin and selenium + melatonin&#xD;
      administered for one month on anterior chamber (AC ) malondialdehyde (MDA) and AC glutathione&#xD;
      (GSH) levels in patients with Ocular ischemic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirtyfive patients were included in the study. Study groups were&#xD;
      formed as follows: 1-Control group, 2-Ischemia group 3-Selenium Ischemia group, 4-Melatonin&#xD;
      Ischemia group, 5-Selenium + Melatonin + Ischemia group. AC samples were obtained. MDA and&#xD;
      GSH levels in AC samples were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESULTS : MDA levels were significantly increased in ischemia groups. Selenium and melatonin&#xD;
      supplementation resulted in reduction of MDA levels and significant increase in GSH values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION: Increased lipid peroxidation associated with ischemia of the anterior segment has&#xD;
      been prevented by selenium and melatonin supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;

      In this retroprospective study, patients who presented with the clinical features of OIS or&#xD;
      who had a history of OIS and who had visited the Department of Ophthalmology or who were&#xD;
      referred by the Department of Cardiology were considered for inclusion. The patients of OIS&#xD;
      were included according to the following criteria (26-29) (1) when the stenosis of the&#xD;
      ipsilateral (to the affected eye) internal carotid artery (ICA) was &gt;50% and the ICA blood&#xD;
      flow velocity was abnormal; (2) abnormal ocular symptoms and/or signs that could not be&#xD;
      explained by other ocular diseases. The ocular symptoms included amaurosis fugax , visual&#xD;
      loss ,floaters, metamorphopsia, phosphenes ,diplopia ,and ocular/periorbital pain . Most&#xD;
      patients (88.10%) complained of constitutional symptoms, such as headache, syncope,&#xD;
      palpitations, hemiplegia, and claudication.The patients who were suffered from other ocular&#xD;
      diseases, including primary glaucoma, uveitis, age-related macular degeneration, symmetrical&#xD;
      proliferative diabetic retinopathy, choroidal detachment, retinal detachment, hereditary eye&#xD;
      diseases, ocular tumor, or ocular trauma, were excluded. Informed consent was acquired from&#xD;
      all of the participants before the collection of clinical materials. The study adhered to the&#xD;
      tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of the OIS patients underwent carotid artery color Doppler imaging (CDI) and/or computed&#xD;
      tomographic angiography (CTA) to identify the ICA stenosis. Detailed ophthalmic examinations,&#xD;
      including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), slit-lamp exam,&#xD;
      and funduscopy were performed at each follow-up visit. Constitutional and ocular symptoms,&#xD;
      medical history (arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), hyperlipidemia (HLP),&#xD;
      coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and so on), the clinical department of the&#xD;
      first visit, and treatments were also recorded. A statistical description was generated using&#xD;
      SPSS for Windows, version 22.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty eight OIS patients were recruited in our study, including 20 males (%71,4) and 8&#xD;
      females (%28,6). The age of onset ranged from 58 to 87 years (65.10 ± 10.95), with the&#xD;
      majority of patients aged between 61 and 75 years (69.50%). No statistically significant&#xD;
      difference was found for gender and age between groups (p &lt;0,01) The study was conducted at&#xD;
      Trabzon Numune Training and Research Hospital between May 2014 and September 2016. Approval&#xD;
      from the Trabzon Numune Training and Research Hospital Ethics Committee was obtained. All&#xD;
      procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the&#xD;
      ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964&#xD;
      Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were divided into five groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: Seven healty person were included in this group. After topical anesthesia&#xD;
           approximately 0.1 cc samples were obtained from the anterior chamber.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ischemia group: Seven OIS patients were included in this group. Under topical&#xD;
           anesthesia, 0.1 cc samples were obtained from the AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Selenium + Ischemia group: Seven OIS patients were included in this group. The patients&#xD;
           in this group were supplemented with oral selenium at 0.1mg/kg doses twice daily for one&#xD;
           month. After selenium supplementation period was completed, AC sampling as described&#xD;
           above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Melatonin + Ischemia group: Seven OIS patients were included in this group. The patients&#xD;
           in this group were supplemented with oral melatonin 0.5 mg/kg/day doses twice daily for&#xD;
           one month. After supplementation was completed 0.1 cc sampling from AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Selenium + Melatonin + Ischemia group: Seven OIS patients were included in this group .&#xD;
           The patients were supplemented with selenium and melatonin for one month as described&#xD;
           above, subsequently 0.1 cc sampling from AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine AC Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, 2.5 ml of 10% TCA&#xD;
      (tricholoroessigaurekrist.) was put in a test tube, 0.1 ml of AC sample from the patients was&#xD;
      added. Tubes were vortexed and sealed. Incubation was applied for 15 minutes in 90ºC water&#xD;
      bath. They were cooled in cold water and their absorbance values were read with reference to&#xD;
      blank on spectrophotometer at 532 nm. Results were presented as nmol/ml. At the beginning of&#xD;
      the testing, blank was prepared by placing the same amount of distilled water instead of&#xD;
      plasma in the blank tube and performing the same procedures. In order to measure AC&#xD;
      Glutathione (GSH) levels, AC samples placed in tubes containing EDTA were centrifuged at 3000&#xD;
      rpm for 5 minutes. The samples were washed 3 times with 0.9% saline solution and 50μl of each&#xD;
      sample was derived. Consecutively, 450μl of distilled water and 500μl of 10% sulfosalicylic&#xD;
      acid were added. The mixture was cooled in ice for 1 hour and then centrifuged at 4000 rev&#xD;
      for 3 minutes. Subsequently, 200μl of the supernatant was derived and consecutively 8 ml of&#xD;
      phosphate buffer with pH of 6.8, 78 μl of 1 N NaOH and 100μl of Ellman solution were added.&#xD;
      After waiting for 5 minutes, absorbance values in reagent tube were read with reference to&#xD;
      distilled water on spectrophotometer at 412 nm.Ellman solution was prepared by dissolving 100&#xD;
      mg of 5'-5'-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acit (DTNB) in 100 ml of pH 7.8 phosphate buffer.&#xD;
      Glutathione standard was prepared as 15.34mg/100 ml by dissolving 15.34 mg of reduced&#xD;
      glutathione in 100 ml of 1 nm sodium EDTA. Results were presented as mg/dl.&#xD;
