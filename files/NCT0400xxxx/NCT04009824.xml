  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of AGS-v PLUS, a universal&#xD;
      mosquito-borne disease and mosquito control vaccine, in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to five groups. Participants in Group 1 will receive&#xD;
      placebo on Days 1 and 22. Participants in Group 2 will receive unadjuvanted AGS-v PLUS&#xD;
      vaccine on Days 1 and 22. Participants in Group 3 will receive Montanide ISA-51 adjuvanted&#xD;
      AGS-v PLUS vaccine on Day 1 and placebo on Day 22. Participants in Group 4 will receive&#xD;
      Montanide ISA-51 adjuvanted AGS-v PLUS vaccine on Days 1 and 22. Participants in Group 5 will&#xD;
      receive Alhydrogel® adjuvanted AGS-v PLUS vaccine on Days 1 and 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in the study for approximately 12 months. During this time, they will&#xD;
      attend several study visits, which may include physical examinations, blood collection, skin&#xD;
      biopsies, and a mosquito feeding procedure. Study staff will also follow up with participants&#xD;
      by phone several times throughout the study.&#xD;
