  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will examine the efficacy of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      therapy in improving psychosocial, neurocognitive and behavioral consequences of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe sleep-related breathing disorders (SRBDs) in people living with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCI is a potentially catastrophic event for individuals who may sustain motor, sensory, and&#xD;
      autonomic deficit, as well as secondary conditions including SRBDs. The SRBDs include&#xD;
      central, obstructive and mixed sleep apnea that can occur in up to 50% of the paraplegics and&#xD;
      up to 91% of the motor complete tetraplegics. Although the frequency of SRBDs after SCI is&#xD;
      much greater than in able-bodied people, this condition is still a largely under-recognized&#xD;
      in the SCI population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this, the investigators hypothesize that regular use of CPAP for treatment of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe SRBDs in individuals living with SCI significantly improve their fatigue,&#xD;
      depressive symptoms, anxiety, cognitive impairment, quality of life, and social and work&#xD;
      participation. This research project will include: (i) a single-arm clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy of nightly use of CPAP for 4 consecutive months in the management of&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe SRBDs among 24 adults with subacute to chronic, cervical or thoracic,&#xD;
      complete or incomplete SCI; and (ii) a qualitative study of the challenges experienced by the&#xD;
      24 people with SCI who undergo an unattended-hospital or home-based sleep study for diagnosis&#xD;
      of SRBDs followed by CPAP therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, this clinical study has the potential to ultimately improve fatigue, mood,&#xD;
      cognition, quality of life, and social and work participation of people living with SCI, by&#xD;
      examining under-explored links with the SRBDs.&#xD;

    <description>Self-reported (or administered by an interviewer) scale where participants choose one of seven levels of agreement for each question.

    <time_frame>Change in Epworth Sleepiness Score from baseline to after 4-month period of CPAP therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported (or administered by an interviewer) where participants answer the 8 brief questions. Range from 0 (best outcome) to 24 (worst outcome). This secondary outcome comprises the difference between post-intervention and pre-intervention Epworth sleepiness scores.</description>

    <measure>Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change in Medical Outcomes Study Sleep Scale from baseline to after 4-month period of CPAP therapy</time_frame>
    <description>Self-reported scale that consists of 12 Likert-type items assessing six dimensions of sleep problems: sleep disturbance (i.e. difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep), snoring, respiratory problems, sleep quantity, sleep adequacy, and daytime somnolence). Higher scores for the domains of sleep disturbance, somnolence and sleep indices indicate worse sleep disturbances, whereas lower scores for sleep quantity and sleep adequacy indicate worse sleep disturbances.</description>

    <description>Self-reported (or administered by an interviewer) scale where participants rate questions on depression, anxiety and stress. Depression subscale varies from 0 (best outcome) to 21 (worst outcome). Anxiety subscale varies from 0 (best outcome) to 21 (worst outcome). Stress subscale varies from 0 (best outcome) to 21 (worst outcome). This secondary outcome comprises the difference in the overall pre-intervention and post-intervention DASS-21 scores.</description>
