      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder. People with SCD have abnormal&#xD;
      hemoglobin in their red blood cells. Researchers are investigating the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      an investigational medicine called AG-348 (mitapivat sulfate) to determine if it will help&#xD;
      people with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the tolerability and safety of AG-348 in people with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 8 visits over approximately 14 weeks. At the first visit participants&#xD;
      will be screened with a medical history; a physical exam; and blood, urine, and heart tests.&#xD;
      At the following 5 visits participants will stay at the clinic for 1 night each. Participants&#xD;
      will take study drug in increasing doses upto visit 6, after which the drug will be tapered&#xD;
      off. All visits will include physical exam, blood, and urine tests. The last visit will occur&#xD;
      4 weeks after stopping the drug and also includes a heart test. Participants will provide DNA&#xD;
      from the blood samples they provide. The DNA will be tested for an inherited gene that can&#xD;
      cause differences in response to the study drug. Researchers may also test other genes to see&#xD;
      if they can find any genes that interact with SCD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a multisystem disorder associated with episodes of acute&#xD;
      clinical events and progressive organ damage. Episodic pain, triggered by micro-vasoocclusion&#xD;
      induced by sickled red blood cells, is the most common acute complication and the leading&#xD;
      cause of hospitalization. Management strategies for SCD have evolved very slowly, and&#xD;
      treatment of acute pain is still limited to supportive therapy with opioid medication. Until&#xD;
      recently in 2017, the only approved therapy for SCD was hydroxyurea (HU), indicated to reduce&#xD;
      frequency of acute painful crises but not universally effective. In addition to HU,&#xD;
      transfusions with normal red blood cells are widely used to treat severe sickle crises, but&#xD;
      this strategy has limitations (not uniformly accessible, accompanied by risks of&#xD;
      alloimmunization, hemolytic transfusion reactions and transfusional iron overload). The only&#xD;
      curative treatment is bone marrow transplantation, but this option carries significant risks&#xD;
      and is limited by the availability of histocompatible donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the root cause of SCD is polymerization of deoxy-HbS, there is a strong rationale for&#xD;
      exploring agents that could inhibit/reduce the polymerization process itself. HbS polymerizes&#xD;
      only when deoxygenated, its oxygenation is influenced by a few factors, one key factor being&#xD;
      the 2,3- diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration in the red blood cell. Increased&#xD;
      intracellular 2,3-DPG decreases oxygen binding and stabilizes the deoxygenated form (T form)&#xD;
      of hemoglobin. In addition, increased 2,3-DPG concentration decreases intracellular red cell&#xD;
      pH further promoting HbS polymerization. 2,3-DPG is an intermediate substrate in the&#xD;
      glycolytic pathway, the only source of ATP production in red blood cells. Pyruvate kinase&#xD;
      (PK) is a key enzyme in the final step of glycolysis; PK converts phosphoenolpyruvate to&#xD;
      pyruvate, creating 50% of the total red cell ATP that is essential for maintaining integrity&#xD;
      of the red cell membrane. Reduced PK activity leads to accumulation of the upstream enzyme&#xD;
      substrates, including 2,3- DPG, that favours polymerization of deoxy-HbS. In humans with SCD,&#xD;
      and even in sickle carriers who are generally asymptomatic, reduced oxygen affinity will&#xD;
      favour deoxygenation of HbS and its polymerisation, and thus sickling. Indeed, the&#xD;
      combination of PK deficiency and sickle cell trait causing an acute sickling syndrome has&#xD;
      been previously reported in two cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current approaches to reduce HbS polymerization include fetal haemoglobin induction via&#xD;
      multiple strategies and drugs that targets HbS polymerization through increasing affinity of&#xD;
      hemoglobin for oxygen (eg. Oxbryta (TM) / Voxelotor / GBT440). Increasing red cell PK (PK-R)&#xD;
      activity, leading to a decrease in intracellular 2,3-DPG concentration, presents a&#xD;
      potentially attractive therapeutic target for thwarting HbS polymerization and acute sickle&#xD;
      pain. AG-348 is a novel, orally bioavailable, small molecule allosteric activator of PK-R,&#xD;
      that is currently in Phase II/III clinical trials in humans with PK deficiency (NCT02476916,&#xD;
      NCT03548220 / AG348-C-006; NCT03559699 / AG348-C-007). Overview of the preclinical AG-348&#xD;
      data and other data support dose-dependent changes in blood glycolytic intermediates&#xD;
      consistent with glycolytic pathway activation at all multiple ascending doses tested,&#xD;
      supporting the potential role of AG-348 in the treatment of sickle cell disease. The overall&#xD;
      objective of the present study is to determine the clinical safety and tolerability of AG-348&#xD;
      in subjects with SCD.&#xD;

                  Limit of Normal (ULN) (unless the increased AST is assessed by the Investigator&#xD;
                  as due to hemolysis and/or hepatic iron deposition) and alanine aminotransferase&#xD;

             occlusion; or who have not been naturally postmenopausal (i.e., who have not&#xD;
             menstruated at all for at least the preceding 12 months prior to signing informed&#xD;
             consent and have an elevated folliclestimulating hormone level indicative of menopause&#xD;
             during the screening period).&#xD;

             the study, and for 28 days for women and 90 days for men following the last dose of&#xD;
             study treatment. An effective form of contraception is defined as&#xD;
&#xD;
             hormonal oral contraceptives, injectables, patches, and barrier methods.&#xD;

                  positive for HCV Ab, a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test will&#xD;
                  be conducted. Subjects with hepatitis C may be rescreened after receiving&#xD;
                  appropriate hepatitis C treatment.&#xD;
