      Open-label randomized controlled trial to study the efficacy of continuous daily use of&#xD;
      ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (30/150 µg/day) compared with vitamin E (400 IU/day) in the&#xD;
      treatment of women with menstrually-related and perimenopausal migraine.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The prevalence of migraine is three times higher in women than in men. Clinical&#xD;
      and epidemiological studies suggest a prominent role for sex hormones in female migraine&#xD;
      patients. Menstruation is an important factor increasing the susceptibility for an upcoming&#xD;
      attack. Perimenstrual migraine attacks are also more disabling, longer lasting, and more&#xD;
      difficult to treat than other attacks. Hormonal fluctuations during menopausal transition are&#xD;
      associated with increased susceptibility for migraine as well, whereas hormonal changes in&#xD;
      migraine during pregnancy seem to be associated with decreased attack frequency. Thus, sex&#xD;
      hormonal conditions seem to affect the susceptibility for migraine attacks in women, but&#xD;
      there is a lack of understanding the underlying pathophysiological mechanism. Currently,&#xD;
      there is no clear evidence-based hormonal intervention for the treatment of migraine in&#xD;
      women. The investigators hypothesize that continuous daily use of an oral contraceptive pill&#xD;
      will be an effective, well-tolerated preventive treatment for 1) menstrually-related migraine&#xD;
      and 2) perimenopausal migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To study the efficacy of continuous daily use of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel&#xD;
      (30/150 µg/day) compared with vitamin E (400 IU/day) in the treatment of menstrually-related&#xD;
      and perimenopausal migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Open-label randomized controlled trial. Study population: Women with&#xD;
      menstrually-related or pure menstrual migraine and women with perimenopausal migraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Continuous daily use of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel (30/150 µg/day)&#xD;
      compared with vitamin E (400 IU/day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: Change in monthly migraine days from baseline to the last 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment (weeks 9-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The study will encompass a period of 4 months (1 baseline month and 3 treatment&#xD;
      months). Patients have to fill out daily headache diaries throughout the study using a&#xD;
      web-based app (≈ 5 min). Patients visit the headache clinic thrice, once for inclusion, once&#xD;
      during the baseline period and once after 3 months of therapy (duration ≈ 1 hour). During the&#xD;
      first and last visit blood samples will be taken. Patients will be contacted twice during&#xD;
      follow-up to evaluate (S)AE's. Treatment with the oral contraceptive pill is accompanied by a&#xD;
      very low risk of developing thromboembolisms. Participation might benefit participants by&#xD;
      reducing their migraine attack frequency or intensity.&#xD;
