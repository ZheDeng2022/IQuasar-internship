      Background: Approximately 65% of obese individuals have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease&#xD;
      (NAFLD), and this condition is strongly related to the development of insulin resistance and&#xD;
      diabetes. Innovative lifestyle strategies to treat NAFLD are critically needed. Alternate day&#xD;
      fasting (ADF) has been shown in animals to reduce hepatic steatosis and improve hepatic&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, but these findings have yet to be confirmed in human subjects. ADF&#xD;
      consists of a &quot;feast day&quot; where individuals are permitted to consume food ad libitum,&#xD;
      alternated with a &quot;fast day&quot; where individuals consume 25% of their usual intake (~500 kcal).&#xD;
      We performed a pilot study to evaluate the effects of ADF combined with exercise, versus ADF&#xD;
      or exercise alone, on hepatic parameters in prediabetic patients. Our results show that the&#xD;
      combination of ADF plus exercise produced greater reductions in alanine aminotransferase&#xD;
      (ALT; an indirect marker of hepatic steatosis), compared to ADF alone, or exercise alone,&#xD;
      after 12 weeks. Greater decreases in insulin resistance, HbA1c, LDL cholesterol, and more&#xD;
      pronounced increases in HDL cholesterol, were observed in the combination group versus&#xD;
      individual interventions. Data from our pilot trial also suggest that these decreases in&#xD;
      insulin resistance may be mediated in part by changes in hepatocyte-derived hormones&#xD;
      (hepatokines) that occur with liver fat reduction. Although these pilot findings are very&#xD;
      promising, these data still require confirmation by a well powered clinical trial.&#xD;
      Hypotheses: The present proposal will test the following hypotheses: (1) The combination&#xD;
      group (ADF plus exercise) will experience greater reductions in hepatic steatosis (measured&#xD;
      by magnetic resonance imaging; MRI) when compared to ADF or exercise alone; (2) The&#xD;
      combination group will experience greater improvements in hepatokine profile (fetuin-A,&#xD;
      fetuin B, FGF-21, RBP4, selenoprotein P, SHBG, adropin) when compared to ADF or exercise&#xD;
      alone; (3) The combination group will experience greater improvements in hepatic insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity, insulin resistance and HbA1c and other metabolic disease risk variables (fasting&#xD;
      glucose, fasting insulin, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, inflammatory&#xD;
      parameters) when compared to ADF or exercise alone. Methods: To test these objectives, a&#xD;
      12-week randomized, controlled, parallel-arm feeding trial will be implemented. Obese&#xD;
      prediabetic individuals with NAFLD (n = 360) will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: (1) ADF&#xD;
      (fast day: 25% energy intake, feed day: ad libitum fed, no exercise), (2) exercise (ad&#xD;
      libitum fed, training 5 days/week supervised), (3) combination (ADF plus exercise), and (4)&#xD;
      control (ad libitum fed, no exercise). Significance: If the aims of this application are&#xD;
      achieved, this study will be the first to show that the combination of alternate day fasting&#xD;
      plus aerobic exercise is an effective non-pharmacological therapy to reduce hepatic&#xD;
      steatosis, improve hepatic insulin sensitivity and prevent the progression of prediabetes to&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes in NAFLD patients.&#xD;
