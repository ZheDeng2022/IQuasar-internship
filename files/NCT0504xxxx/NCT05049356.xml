      In this study the investigators will examine psychiatric symptoms, central neurocognitive&#xD;
      functions, parental stress and attachment styles, and biological factors that can give new&#xD;
      knowledge about some of the mechanisms present in children referred to outpatient psychiatric&#xD;
      service. A specific focus will be given to children suffering from severe irritability making&#xD;
      problems at home, in school, and/or with peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD) is characterized by chronic and severe&#xD;
      irritability and anger in children. DMDD understood as severe or clinical irritability can be&#xD;
      regarded as laying above a certain threshold on a irritability continuum. Due to DMDD being a&#xD;
      relatively new and debated diagnosis there is an urgent need to gain better understanding of&#xD;
      the underlying mechanisms of severe irritability in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will explore emotion and behavior symptoms, neuropsychological functions&#xD;
      (including social perception), perceived parental stress and attachment styles, and cortisol&#xD;
      levels of children and their mothers, in children referred to outpatient psychiatric service&#xD;
      including children with severe irritability. Parents of children 6 to 12 years will be&#xD;
      informed and asked to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work on severe irritability will be divided into six main areas:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Severe irritability in a Norwegian clinical population: prevalence, comorbidity and&#xD;
           associated difficulties&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Social and emotional understanding in severe irritability in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Executive function in severe irritability in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Stress response in severe irritability in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Parental stress and attachment style in parents of severe irritability in children&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. DMDD: An affective or conduct disorder? Comparing anxiety and depressive symptoms&#xD;

6 years old children: 4 (minimum) - 25 (maximum).&#xD;
7-12 years old children: 12 (min.) - 35 (max.).&#xD;
Raw scores are converted to scaled scores by Pearson's NEPSY-2 machine based scoring tool. Converted scaled scores have a mean of 10, a standard deviation of 3, and a range from 1-19.</description>

    <description>The DSM-Oriented Scale Oppositional Defiant Problems of the ASEBA (6-18 years by parent- and teacher-report) will be used to measure oppositional defiant Symptoms. Raw scores will be calculated to T-scores using a computer based program. Higher scores means worse symptom level. A t-score ≤ 64 indicates non-clinical symptoms, a t-score between 65 and 69 indicates that the child is at risk for clinical symptoms, and a t-score ≥ 70 indicates clinical symptoms.</description>

    <description>The DSM-Oriented Scale Conduct Problems of the ASEBA (6-18 years by parent- and teacher-report) will be used to measure conduct problems. Raw scores will be calculated to T-scores using a computer based program. Higher scores means worse symptom level. A t-score ≤ 64 indicates non-clinical symptoms, a t-score between 65 and 69 indicates that the child is at risk for clinical symptoms, and a t-score ≥ 70 indicates clinical symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Irritability by report</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The following items of the ASEBA for children 6-18 years by parent- and teacher report will be used to measure irritability symptoms on a continous scale: 86. Stubborn, Sullen, or Irritable, 87. Sudden mood changes, and 95. Temper tantrums or hot temper. Each item is rated on the same 0-1-2 Likert scale: 0 = Not True, 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, 2 = Very True or Often True. Minimum value is 0 and Maximum value is 6. Higher scores means more irritability and vice versa.</description>
