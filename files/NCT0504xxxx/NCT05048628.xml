  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned to determine the effect of arnica montana, green tea mouthwash and ice&#xD;
      particles impregnation on postoperative sore throat and hoarseness.&#xD;

      Research Hypotheses Hl: Gargling with green tea after surgery reduces sore throat. H2:&#xD;
      Impregnation of postoperative ice particles reduces sore throat. H3: Post-operative gargling&#xD;
      with arnico montana reduces sore throat. H4: Gargling with green tea after surgery reduces&#xD;
      hoarseness. H5: Impregnation of postoperative ice particles reduces hoarseness. H6:&#xD;
      Postoperative mouthwash with arnico montana reduces hoarseness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do ice particles impregnation, gargling with green tea and gargling with arnico montana&#xD;
           reduce intubation-related sore throat in patients undergoing general anesthesia?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do ice particles impregnation, gargling with green tea and gargling with arnico montana&#xD;
           reduce hoarseness due to intubation in patients undergoing general anesthesia?&#xD;

    <description>Impregnation of pieces of ice was delivered to us; one ice cube is planned after wearing and movements automatically by the throat purchase to exit use and sound program, and move with one ice cube after movement. It can be used after extubation. It is in sound class with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for the use of customers before and after the application. Extubation is in the last 0. hours, no small application is made, only in sound class with VAS. Evaluated by Stout's Hoarseness Scale</description>

    <description>To the patients included in the gargle group with green tea; four after, six after eigth after hours after extubation, the patients of the intervention group were asked to gargle 30 cc of green tea and before the application and after the patient's oral intake was requested by the physician to prevent sore throat and hoarseness afterwards, patients' sore throat is measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and hoarseness is measured with Stout's Hoarseness Scale. At the 0. th hour after extubation, no treatment is applied to the patients, only sore throat is evaluated with VAS and hoarseness is evaluated with Stout's Hoarseness Scale.0</description>
