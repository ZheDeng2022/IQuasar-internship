  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a single-blinded, randomized, controlled, 12 months clinical trial. The&#xD;
      objective is to investigate the feasibility, effects and side-effects of virtual&#xD;
      reality-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT) vs. cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      in patients with a diagnosis of alcohol dependence.&#xD;

      Recruitment of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      102 patients will be recruited from the Novaví outpatient clinics, where they will be&#xD;
      informed orally and in writing about the research project and, if they are interested, an&#xD;
      information meeting is booked. If patients show symptoms of abstinence, these are treated&#xD;
      prior to the information meeting by doctors and nurses in Novaví. If the patient then wishes&#xD;
      to participate and meets the inclusion criteria, informed consent is obtained and screening&#xD;
      is performed using the questionnaires described later. Included patients will then be&#xD;
      randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Virtual reality-assisted cognitive behavioral therapy (VR-CBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) without VR (control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the screening sessions, patients' medical history is obtained, as well as their alcohol&#xD;
      intake over the past 30 days recorded via Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB). Patients are also&#xD;
      asked about previous alcohol dependence treatment and general information about psychosocial&#xD;
      factors incl. education, work, marital status, and functional level using Global Assessment&#xD;
      of functioning (GAF). In addition, alcohol-related problems are assessed using the Alcohol&#xD;
      Users Identification Test (AUDIT), abstinence using the Clinical Institute Withdrawal&#xD;
      Assessment of Alcohol Scale Revised (CIWA-Ar), intake of other drugs using the Drug User&#xD;
      Identification Test (DUDIT), and alcohol craving using the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS).&#xD;
      The Becks questionnaires, Depression Inventory 2 (BDI-II) and Beck's Anxiety Inventory (BAI),&#xD;
      are included to assess the degree of anxiety and depression, and in addition, tests of mental&#xD;
      function are performed using the Screening for Cognitive Impairment in Psychiatry (SCIP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included participants will in collaboration with their therapist schedule a standard course&#xD;
      of treatment based on national guidelines from health authorities. After inclusion,&#xD;
      participants are randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 14 sessions of VR-CBT (Group A)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 14 sessions of CBT without VR (Group B, control group)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in group A are exposed to VR-simulated high-risk situations filmed in a&#xD;
      restaurant, a pub, at home, at a party or at the supermarket, to trigger alcohol cravings and&#xD;
      other high-risk induced reactions of which the participants are subsequently trained to&#xD;
      handle by trained therapists using CBT-based techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in group B receive the same treatment without VR exposure. The will be 4&#xD;
      weeks of weekly-biweekly treatment, followed by 20-21 weeks of treatment every 2-3 weeks,&#xD;
      which is in line with the standard treatment in the Novaví outpatient clinics. The&#xD;
      intervention deviates from standard treatment, as none of the participants receive&#xD;
      pharmaceutical alcohol treatment during the treatment period (6 months) except for abstinence&#xD;
      treatment if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening a patient (ensuring that all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      met) the patient is included. Participants are randomly allocated to either VR-CBT og CBT, 51&#xD;
      participants in each group. Randomization takes place in REDCap, which is a secure web&#xD;
      application for building and managing surveys and databases. Age, sex and alcohol consumption&#xD;
      are stratified at the time of inclusion ('heavy drinking days' and alcohol consumption -&#xD;
      evaluated by TLFB). The technical setup of the randomization tool is performed in close&#xD;
      collaboration with an expert in statistics, which ensures correct functionality before&#xD;
      starting the experiment. After randomization, the therapist ensures that the participant&#xD;
      receives the correct treatment and performs the alcohol craving assessment during each VR-CBT&#xD;
      session unblinded using visual analog score (VAS). The study staff conducting the remaining&#xD;
      data collections and the entire data analysis remain blinded until the database is opened at&#xD;
      the end of the study. In situations where it is necessary to break the blind, it is possible&#xD;
      to change the user rights in REDCap and gain access to the randomization tools. With the&#xD;
      randomization tools, it is possible to detect the treatment (VR-CBT or CBT) based on study ID&#xD;
      and all activities performed in REDCap are registered in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant must attend a follow-up visit 3, 6, and 12 months from inclusion, where data&#xD;
      collection will take place using the before mentioned questionnaires. The follow-up visit&#xD;
      will be approx. 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyzes are performed using the intention-to-treat principle, where all&#xD;
      patients who have become randomized and has received a minimum of 1 session of VR-CBT (group&#xD;
      A) or CBT without VR (group B), is included in the analysis. Missing data are implemented&#xD;
      through the multiple imputation method and the analyzes are performed in the program &quot;R&quot; with&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05 and 2-sided test. All continuous effect measures are analyzed using ANOVA from&#xD;
      baseline to most recent measurement, and categorical data are analyzed using chi2 analysis.&#xD;
      All data distributions will be assessed for normality by visual inspection of histogram and&#xD;
      by Q-Q plots. If data is not normally distributed, log transformation is performed, and if&#xD;
      this is not successful, non-parametric testing is used.&#xD;
