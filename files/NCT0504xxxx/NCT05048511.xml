  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non skeletal effect of vitamin D have been the focus of much interest in the past decade.&#xD;
      During the last years, special attention has been given to the impact of vitamin D on human&#xD;
      reproduction. Its receptor is expressed in most reproductive organs including hypothalamus,&#xD;
      pituitary gland, uterus, ovary, mammary gland and the placenta. In vitro experiments suggest&#xD;
      that vitamin D would be involved in regulated embryo-implantation. Concerning AMH, vitamin D&#xD;
      seems to alters AMH signaling in human granulosa cells although their circulated levels are&#xD;
      correlated in lated reproductive aged women. The results of precedents studies about the&#xD;
      impact of vitamin D on IVF outcomes remain conflicting The aim of our study was to assess in&#xD;
      a large unselected population of infertile women, the impact of vitamin D deficiency on IVF&#xD;
      outcome and to examine the relationship between serum vitamin D levels and the ovarian&#xD;
      reserve marker AMH.&#xD;

      Vitamin D was measured on the sixth day of stimulation. According to vitamin D level, women&#xD;
      were divided into 2 groups (deficiency when 25(OH)D &lt;20 ng/ml and sufficient when 25(OH)D &gt;20&#xD;
      ng/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy rates were compared among these two groups after controlling age, BMI,&#xD;
      characteristics of ovarian stimulation, number of ovocytes obtains, etc.&#xD;
