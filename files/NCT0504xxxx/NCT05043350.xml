  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of antihistaminic medications could result in a significant immune modulation which&#xD;
      may help in the treatment of cytokine storm of COVID-19.Thus, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate efficacy and safety of famotidine and loratadine combination in covid 19 treatment&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;

      On admission to hospital, the patient will be diagnosed for suspected COVID-19 based&#xD;
      primarily upon pulmonary symptoms, and will be confirmed positive for COVID-19 by RT-PCR&#xD;
      diagnostic test and then will be located within a COVID-19 ward. According to Ministry of&#xD;
      Health guidelines, moderate cases of COVID 19 will be identified if the Patient has pneumonia&#xD;
      manifestations on radiology associated with symptoms (fever, cough, general weakness&#xD;
      /fatigue, headache, sore throat, anorexia, diarrhea and vomiting) and / or leucopenia or&#xD;
      lymphopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be initiated in ER with standard of care per admitting provider. Standard of&#xD;
      care includes radiologic assessments, supplemental oxygen when necessary, and intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) hydration when necessary. In addition to concomitant treatments like the antimalarial&#xD;
      drug hydroxychloroquine, the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone (IV).plus, Famotidine 40 mg&#xD;
      po twice daily and loratadine 10 mg po once daily (Interventional group) and Control group&#xD;
      will receive standard drug therapy according to the treatment protocols of the National&#xD;
      Committee of COVID-19 + Famotidine 40 mg twice daily po. The COVID-19 standard of care as&#xD;
      provided by the ministry of health is attached in appendix1.Blood samples will be withdrawn&#xD;
      from the patients at baseline and every 7 days to assess the following parameters using&#xD;
      routine laboratory methods Complete blood picture: Lymphopenia, eosinopenia,&#xD;
      neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio and platelet count, C-reactive protein and ferritin, lactate&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (LDH), d-dimer Cardiac markers, IL-6, Procalcitonin, Prothrombin time,&#xD;
      Activated partial thromboplastin time, Creatine kinase (CK), Glutamic-pyruvic transaminase&#xD;
      (SGPT) and Urea, and serum creatinine to determine the incidence of organ failure Sample&#xD;
      handling: Syringes used in sample withdrawal will be discarded in appropriate safety box and&#xD;
      serum samples will be discarded in biohazards box. These biohazard waste will be sent to&#xD;
      incinerators through the hospital laboratory as per hospital protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precaution against infections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator and all healthcare professional must wear full protective personal&#xD;
      equipment (PPE) as per hospital protocol including full gown, full facial mask and safety&#xD;
      gloves when in direct contact with patients for follow ups. These PPE are removed before the&#xD;
      exit of COVID-19 ward and discarded as hazard waste. Disinfectant will be used by all&#xD;
      personal before leaving the ward&#xD;
