  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In view of the research gap in the safety of traditional ketogenic diet, there is a need for&#xD;
      a healthy alternative to the ketogenic diet that reduces the individual's propensity to&#xD;
      adverse diet choices. Healthy guidelines to be adopted include a diet low in saturated fat,&#xD;
      trans fat, and sugar, along with adequate fibre. Potentially with these guidelines in effect,&#xD;
      the associated risks for CVD would be reduced. Therefore, this study will investigate the&#xD;
      effect of a calorie-restricted healthy ketogenic diet versus a calorie-restricted low fat&#xD;
      diet on weight loss and metabolic outcomes among individuals with obesity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ketogenic diet has recently gained popularity as an effective dietary plan for weight&#xD;
      management. Some of the cited benefits include a reduction in appetite and hunger, as well as&#xD;
      improvements in fat oxidation leading to weight loss. Remarkably, some studies have also&#xD;
      demonstrated increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and decreases in&#xD;
      triglyceride levels, which point to a reduction in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of these, there are still widespread concerns regarding the potentially high&#xD;
      proportion of total and saturated fats derived from ketogenic diets owing to the high-fat and&#xD;
      moderate-protein nature. These are associated with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)&#xD;
      cholesterol levels which may offset the purportedly lower CVD risk, especially in obese&#xD;
      individuals. Furthermore, few randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have placed emphasis on the&#xD;
      reduction of saturated fat, leading to confounding effects on the safety of the traditional&#xD;
      ketogenic diet. To address the research gap, our study aims to assess the effect of a&#xD;
      calorie-restricted healthy ketogenic diet, as compared to a calorie-restricted low fat diet&#xD;
      on weight loss and metabolic outcomes among Asian individuals with obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized controlled trial, participants will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      healthy ketogenic diet (HKD) or low fat calorie-restricted diet (LFD) using&#xD;
      computer-generated random sequencing. Both the HKD and LFD groups will attend group workshops&#xD;
      conducted by dietitians at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and thereafter at 6-week intervals over the&#xD;
      course of a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be recommended to achieve their incremental daily step count goal from&#xD;
      3,000, 7,000 to 10,000 to promote increased physical activity, as per their tolerance. All&#xD;
      participants are to provide for their own meals and follow a calorie-restricted diet with&#xD;
      emphasis on the consumption of healthy fats and the reduction of saturated and trans fats in&#xD;
      both diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the HKD group will be advised to follow a calorie-restricted healthy&#xD;
      ketogenic diet (n=35), with a maximum of 50g net carbohydrate intake daily. Those in the&#xD;
      control group will be instructed to follow a calorie-restricted low fat diet (LFD) (n=35).&#xD;
      Calorie prescriptions for both diets were calculated based on the Schofield equation,&#xD;
      adjusted with a deficit of 500 kcal daily to promote weight loss. Participants will also be&#xD;
      recommended to use the Nutritionist Buddy (nBuddy) mobile application to facilitate&#xD;
      monitoring of diet intake, steps count and to aid in their adherence to the diet and physical&#xD;
      activity recommendations.&#xD;
