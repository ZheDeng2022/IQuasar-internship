  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a major public health problem associated with cognitive deficits, such as&#xD;
      short and long term memory, executive functioning, attention and speed of processing that are&#xD;
      amongst the strongest predictors of impaired functional outcome. In addition, schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients show reduced &quot;plasticity&quot;, defined as reduced learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-serine is a naturally occurring activator of the N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate&#xD;
      receptors (NMDAR) in the brain, and this project will assess the D-serine treatment over 16&#xD;
      weeks of a program designed to measure auditory plasticity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      D-Serine is a naturally occurring substance in the brain that activates the&#xD;
      N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR). This receptor is thought to be&#xD;
      important in both schizophrenia and plasticity (learning). My model proposes that problems&#xD;
      with NMDAR within the brain leads to impaired plasticity, which in turn leads to impaired&#xD;
      cognition. d-serine is an ideal NMDAR activator to study because it balances efficacy,&#xD;
      availability and safety. Most d-serine studies have used a low dose, but the evidence for&#xD;
      efficacy is even stronger for high dose d-serine, as will be tested in the current study.&#xD;
      There has only been limited summary of higher dose d-serine, which is another important&#xD;
      reason for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to testing a potentially viable treatment in schizophrenia, a positive result&#xD;
      would provide opportunities for use of D-serine in other populations (e.g. anxiety disorders&#xD;
      or dementia) and stimulate the pharmaceutical industry to utilize this methodology to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of novel NMDAR modulators, using d-serine as a &quot;gold-standard.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of this two part grant (R61-R33) study is to improve cognitive remediation&#xD;
      by augmenting with D-serine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recently completed the R61-phase, meeting our predetermined &quot;milestones. &quot; As predicted,&#xD;
      D-serine led to significant enhancement of auditory plasticity and electrophysiological&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the three-year R33-phase, we will conduct a study of D-serine of 60 schizophrenia&#xD;
      patients, assessing the effects of D-serine over 16 sessions of this program. Most&#xD;
      successful, cognitive remediation programs are limited by lengthy (30-50 hours) treatments.&#xD;
      Hypothesizing that adding D-serine will increase efficiency of cognitive remediation,&#xD;
      successful completion of the R33-phase is defined as significant improvement in global&#xD;
      cognition after 16 hours of treatment, and will serve as a pilot study to determine whether&#xD;
      future, definitive clinical trials are warranted.&#xD;
