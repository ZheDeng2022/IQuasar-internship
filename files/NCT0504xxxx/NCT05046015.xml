      The overall aims of this study are to compare the structure and function of dry to very dry&#xD;
      and cracked foot skin between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects and to evaluate the effects&#xD;
      of two cosmetic leave-on products on dry and fissured diabetic foot skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific issues are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are there any differences between the morphological and functional characteristics of dry to&#xD;
      very dry and cracked skin foot between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects? What are the&#xD;
      effects of a 4-week once daily application of an intensive care foot ointment (urea 10% foot&#xD;
      ointment) or foot lotion (10% Urea foot lotion) on the skin barrier and on clinical signs of&#xD;
      dryness and fissures?&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A long existing diabetes mellitus type II is often associated with a number of skin changes.&#xD;
      Xerosis Cutis is the most common skin alteration. The risk of diabetics of developing a foot&#xD;
      ulcer is estimated to be 15%. Very dry and cracked skin represents an additional risk factor,&#xD;
      so that adequate skin care is a widely recommended intervention in diabetic patients. But&#xD;
      there are only few studies investigating the skin barrier structure and function in diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Available study results seem to suggest, that for instance sebum content, stratum&#xD;
      corneum hydration, and pH are associated with Diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
