  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to increase uptake and adherence of LA-PrEP in TGD&#xD;
      populations in Texas. The central hypothesis is that strategies to increase uptake of LA-&#xD;
      PrEP that are patient centered and understand the needs of TGD people will improve uptake and&#xD;
      adherence. The objective of this observational study is to investigate barriers,&#xD;
      facilitators, and preferences regarding willingness and intention to use LA-PrEP in TGD&#xD;
      populations in Texas. Data from this study will support future research on patient centered&#xD;
      strategies for uptake and adherence of LA-PrEP in TGD populations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a biomedical HIV prevention strategy that is more than 90%&#xD;
      effective in preventing the transmission of HIV. Despite the promise of PrEP in eradicating&#xD;
      HIV, uptake has been slow in transgender and gender diverse (TGD) individuals with only 3% of&#xD;
      TGD individuals using PrEP. While awareness is a key factor related to PrEP uptake, TGD&#xD;
      experience numerous contextual and structural barriers, including discrimination and&#xD;
      mistreatment by medical providers, lack of availability and access (e.g., insurance,&#xD;
      transportation, time), and broad distrust of the healthcare system that affect intention to&#xD;
      use PrEP and reduce uptake. These barriers are further compounded by the social position of&#xD;
      TGD people on which they are further stratified based on their race, ethnicity, and&#xD;
      socioeconomic status. In addition to contextual and structural factors there are a number of&#xD;
      individual factors that limit uptake including fear of side effects, issues with adherence,&#xD;
      concerns related to stigma, and lack of trust in the medication's efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longer-acting PrEP (LA-PrEP) regimens include different delivery modalities (e.g..&#xD;
      injectable, oral, subdermal implant) with different dosing protocols (e.g. monthly versus&#xD;
      daily). There is potential for long-acting biomedical HIV prevention methods to address some&#xD;
      of these barriers experienced by TGD individuals. However, to be successful an understanding&#xD;
      of attitudes, norms, and other factors influencing LA-PrEP uptake and adherence is needed,&#xD;
      specifically among racial and ethnic minority TGD individuals, and their preferences for&#xD;
      LA-PrEP delivery. Developing patient-centered strategies for uptake and adherence, using&#xD;
      human centered design principles will support uptake and adherence of LA-PrEP in these TGD&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will achieve the study objective through the following aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Identify factors that influence uptake and adherence of LA- PrEP among TGD&#xD;
      individuals in Texas Activities: In collaboration with Transgender Education Network of Texas&#xD;
      (TENT) and TransFORWARD: Texas Transgender Health (co-Is), a PCORI funded project in Texas to&#xD;
      increase TGD patient-centered outcomes research and comparative effectiveness research&#xD;
      capacity in Texas, the research team will recruit 40 TGD individuals to participate in a&#xD;
      world café conversation to understand beliefs, attitudes, and preferences for LA-PrEP and&#xD;
      interview 20 other relevant key stakeholders (e.g., medical providers, AIDS Service&#xD;
      Organizations, TGD advocacy groups) to understand perceived barriers, facilitators, and needs&#xD;
      regarding uptake and adherence to LA-PrEP in TGD communities. Anticipated outcomes:&#xD;
      understanding of factors influencing uptake and adherence of LA-PrEP that will inform&#xD;
      development of data collection instruments and provide insight about factors affecting&#xD;
      potential LA-PrEP uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Understand factors influencing willingness and intention to use different&#xD;
      regimens of LA- PrEP among TGD individuals living in Texas. Activities: The investigators&#xD;
      will survey at least 500 TGD individuals from across the state about their attitudes,&#xD;
      community norms, barriers and preferences regarding different PrEP modalities and regimens to&#xD;
      better understand how these factors influence willingness and intention to use different&#xD;
      forms of LA-PrEP. Anticipated Outcomes: Identification of factors that promote willingness&#xD;
      and intention to use LA-PrEP.&#xD;
