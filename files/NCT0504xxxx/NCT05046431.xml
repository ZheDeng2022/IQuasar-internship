        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has PsA for at least 6 months prior to the first administration of the&#xD;
             study drug and meets classification criteria for PsA (CASPAR) at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has active PsA defined by the presence of ≥3 of 68 tender joint counts and&#xD;
             ≥3 of 66 swollen joint counts at Screening and Randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has active PsA at Screening despite previous DMARD or NSAID therapy. DMARD&#xD;

             psoriasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has previously received any other nonbiological DMARDs (apart from MTX),&#xD;

             first administration of the study drug; or has previously received leflunomide within&#xD;
             12 weeks (except at least 4 weeks prior to the first administration of the study drug,&#xD;
             the subject has documented completion of standard cholestyramine or activated charcoal&#xD;
             washout procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has received epidural, intra-articular, intramuscular, or intravenous (IV)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participant has received other therapeutic infectious agents within 8 weeks prior to&#xD;
             first dose or expected to receive other therapeutic infectious agents during the study&#xD;
