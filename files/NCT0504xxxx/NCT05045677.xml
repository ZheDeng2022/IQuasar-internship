  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Suicidality (ideation about taking one's life, suicide plans, and attempts) is a major public&#xD;
      health concern in Ontario and worldwide. Psychiatric inpatients with suicidality represent a&#xD;
      group that is high-risk for subsequent suicide. Current standard-care for suicidal&#xD;
      psychiatric inpatients focuses on containment of risk and indirect treatment of suicidality&#xD;
      by treating any underlying mental disorder. Though there is evidence that addressing&#xD;
      suicidality directly is more effective than an indirect approach, there are limited evidence&#xD;
      based treatments that target suicidality. Furthermore, there are few high-quality studies&#xD;
      that have included inpatients. Psychotherapeutic interventions are under-utilized for&#xD;
      inpatients and COVID-19 has further widened this gap given attempts by hospitals to reduce&#xD;
      face-to-face contact with patients. Digital psychotherapy interventions have the ability to&#xD;
      bridge this gap given their lower cost, ease of dissemination, acceptability by patients, and&#xD;
      effectiveness. To our knowledge, there are no studies that have assessed the feasibility,&#xD;
      acceptability and effectiveness of digital interventions for suicidal inpatients. Our study&#xD;
      is a feasibility trial of a previously studied digital Dialectical Behavioural Therapy&#xD;
      (d-DBT) skills intervention in suicidal psychiatric inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a two arm randomized parallel group-controlled trial, 6-10 day, flexible&#xD;
      timeline, randomized feasibility trial of a d-DBT skills intervention added to standard care&#xD;
      for patients admitted to psychiatric inpatient units with suicidality. There will be 20&#xD;
      patients who will receive the intervention in addition to standard care and 20 patients who&#xD;
      will receive standard care alone. There will also be a 4 week follow-up after discharge from&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted for psychiatric care at the Complex and Critical Care Units,&#xD;
      Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH), Toronto.&#xD;
