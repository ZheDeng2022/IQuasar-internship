  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Antegrade colonic enema (ACE) is a second intent treatment of severe constipation&#xD;
      and/or fecal incontinence following the failure of medical treatment. ACE is classically&#xD;
      administered through a percutaneous access to the caecum performed surgically according to&#xD;
      the Malone procedure (MP). Recently, a novel endoscopic approach named Percutaneous&#xD;
      Endoscopic Caecostomy (PEC) has been proposed to perform the percutaneous access to the&#xD;
      caecum. PEC has never been compared to the traditional MP in terms of postoperative quality&#xD;
      of life and functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of the study is to compare postoperative quality of life between MP and&#xD;
      PEC in patients treated with ACE for severe constipation and/or fecal incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: MP and PEC achieve similar quality of life outcomes. Methods: All patients from&#xD;
      two prospective databases who underwent MP or PEC for severe constipation and/or fecal&#xD;
      incontinence between 2006 and 2016 will be included. They will be contacted to answer&#xD;
      questionnaires about quality of life (GIQLI) and functional outcomes including constipation,&#xD;
      fecal incontinence and body image assessment (KESS, Wexner and BIQ scores respectively). The&#xD;
      main measured outcome will be GIQLI score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The results of this comparative study will determine if the endoscopic and the&#xD;
      surgical approaches are similar in terms of quality of life, or if one of them is better than&#xD;
      the other. This study will clarify the optimal protocol to perform a caecal percutaneous&#xD;
      access before ACE administration in patients suffering from severe constipation and/or fecal&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Hypothesis: MP and PEC achieve similar quality of life outcomes. Study design: All patients&#xD;
      from two prospective databases who underwent MP or PEC for severe constipation and/or fecal&#xD;
      incontinence between 2006 and 2016 will be included. They will be contacted by mail to answer&#xD;
      questionnaires about quality of life (GIQLI) and functional outcomes including constipation,&#xD;
      fecal incontinence and body image assessment (KESS, Wexner and BIQ scores respectively).&#xD;
      Patients who did not answer to the mail will be phoned. The collection of patients' answers&#xD;
      will be conducted over a 3 months period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Quality of life evaluated by the GIQLI score. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      measures: Functional outcomes including constipation severity (measured by the KESS score),&#xD;
      fecal incontinence severity (measured by the Wexner score), body image impairment (measured&#xD;
      by the BIQ score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The results of this comparative study will determine if the endoscopic and the&#xD;
      surgical approaches are similar in terms of quality of life, or if one of them is better than&#xD;
      the other. This study will clarify the optimal protocol to perform a caecal percutaneous&#xD;
      access before ACE administration in patients suffering from severe constipation and/or fecal&#xD;

    <description>Endoscopic procedure performed to obtain a percutaneous caecal access for the administration of antegrade colonic enemas. Briefly, a coloscopy is performed to reach the caecum. The cutaneous location of the caecostomy is determined by transillumination of the caecum. A caecopexy is performed with 3 anchors at the chosen location. A specific pig-tail catheter (Chait catheter) is placed percutaneously into the caecum in the center of the 3 anchors.</description>
