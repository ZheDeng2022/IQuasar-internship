  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a person becomes seriously ill health professionals treating them need to make decisions&#xD;
      quickly. They may have limited information about the person's medical history or about their&#xD;
      wishes about treatment. To help health care professionals decide what is the best treatment&#xD;
      for that person Emergency Care Treatment Plans can be used. These record what the person&#xD;
      would or would not want to happen in certain situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plans are usually written by the person's doctor after discussing it with them. One type&#xD;
      of plan, called ReSPECT (Recommended Summary Plan for Emergency Care and Treatment) is used&#xD;
      in many National Health Service hospitals in the UK. However, it might be better to write&#xD;
      these plans when the person is living at home before they are admitted to hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ReSPECT forms are now being used by GPs and other primary care staff in the UK. This project&#xD;
      plans to study the ReSPECT process in primary care to determine how, when, and why it is&#xD;
      used, and what effect it has on patient treatment and care. It will use a mixture of methods&#xD;
      for collecting information. The investigators will interview patients, their families, GPs&#xD;
      and care home managers to ask them about their experience of the ReSPECT process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To get a wider range of views, the investigators will also speak to groups of other health&#xD;
      professionals, patient organisations and faith leaders, and carry out national surveys of GPs&#xD;
      and the general public. The study will also look how at patient records to see how the&#xD;
      ResPECT process makes a difference to decisions about medical treatment when a person is&#xD;
      seriously ill. The information from these different methods will be brought together at a&#xD;
      stakeholder meeting and will be used to work out how the ReSPECT process can work best to&#xD;
      improve patient treatment and care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a mixed methods research project comprised of four work packages. The overall&#xD;
      theoretical framework within which the study will be analysed is Normalisation Process Theory&#xD;
      (NPT). The investigators wish to investigate to what extent ReSPECT is embedded in routine&#xD;
      primary care practice and how it is perceived and enacted by health professionals and&#xD;
      patients. NPT characterises a set of mechanisms (coherence, cognitive participation,&#xD;
      collective action and reflexive monitoring) that influence the embedding of new interventions&#xD;
      or processes into clinical practice. The investigators will ask how do clinicians, patients&#xD;
      and their families:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. conceptualise ReSPECT (coherence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. initiate or engage with the process (cognitive participation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. use the process and the documentation (collective action)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. evaluate it, and how does it change behaviour (reflexive monitoring)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package one This will take place in GP practices and care homes across three CCG areas&#xD;
      of England where ReSPECT has been implemented. The investigators will recruit 12 GP practices&#xD;
      across the three areas and two care homes associated with each practice. In each practice the&#xD;
      investigators will interview patients, the carers of patients who lack capacity, GPs and&#xD;
      other practice staff. The investigators will ask the practice to identify two care homes for&#xD;
      which they are the main practice and seek to interview the care home manager or a senior&#xD;
      member of staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient/carer interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit up to 48 patient/carers across all sites (12 practices)&#xD;
      equally from three groups, which are people:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. living in a care home&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. living at home, identified as nearing the end of their life (but not in the final stages&#xD;
           of a terminal illness)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. living at home, not identified as nearing the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their carers will be identified and invited by practice staff, or the care homes&#xD;
      where patients are resident. In each practice the investigators will seek to recruit patients&#xD;
      who have had a ReSPECT form completed in the previous six months, or for patients who lack&#xD;
      capacity their primary carer or the person who was involved in completion of the ReSPECT&#xD;
      form. Potential participants will be invited to take part in an interview, at which the&#xD;
      investigators will ask participants if they would agree to be contacted to take part in a&#xD;
      second interview 6 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first interview the investigators will ask participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What they understand about the ReSPECT process and form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Their views on the ReSPECT process, when they consider their ReSPECT form should be&#xD;
           reviewed and who should initiate this review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the ReSPECT process from when it was first considered or mentioned through&#xD;
           to completion of the form and any updating of the form&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thoughts and feelings the process engendered; whether the process changed how they&#xD;
           viewed themselves, their health/illness, and the prospect of their death; whether they&#xD;
           think it resulted in a change to the care, and treatments they received and how they&#xD;
           viewed these; their sense of trust in their clinicians and in the health service more&#xD;
           generally including whether they trust that the ReSPECT form will receive attention once&#xD;
           completed; how the ReSPECT process could be improved. The investigators will ask whether&#xD;
           COVID-19 has had any impact on their thinking about ReSPECT or advance care planning in&#xD;
           general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the follow up interview the investigators will ask participants about major changes to the&#xD;
      patient's life context and health/illness since the first interview, including further&#xD;
      experience of the ReSPECT process/review. If they have further experience with ReSPECT the&#xD;
      investigators will explore this in a similar way to the first interview and prompt for any&#xD;
      differences compared to the first interview. Where participants have experienced&#xD;
      illness/treatment events the investigators will explore their perception of any influence&#xD;
      during this event. With all participants the investigators will explore whether and how their&#xD;
      reflections on the ReSPECT process and its impact have changed and what influenced these&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GP interviews, conversations with practice staff, and care home interviews In each practice,&#xD;
      the investigators will interview the health professional who completed ReSPECT for patient&#xD;
      participants or the GP most closely involved in their care if the form was completed in&#xD;
      hospital. The investigators will carry out brief conversations with other members of the&#xD;
      practice team, for example practice nurses, practice manager, receptionist, asking them about&#xD;
      their awareness/use of ReSPECT, and how the process runs in the practice. The investigators&#xD;
      will invite the managers of care homes linked to participating practices to take part in an&#xD;
      interview about their general experience of ReSPECT and of how clinical decisions are made&#xD;
      for residents with a ReSPECT form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also collect pooled anonymous data on;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  practice population demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of ReSPECT forms recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for people with ReSPECT form: age; ethnicity; eFrailty index; type of residence&#xD;
           (care/nursing home or own home/family home) and where ReSPECT form completed (if&#xD;
           recorded).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will analyse interview data using Framework analysis to identify themes&#xD;
      that help us understand how and why implementation of ReSPECT varies, the enablers and&#xD;
      obstacles to its implementation, and specific ethical concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package two In this work package the investigators will engage the public and health&#xD;
      professionals in reflection and debate about the concept and use of Emergency Care Treatment&#xD;
      Plans in general and ReSPECT in particular. As the use of ECTPs relates to ethical issues and&#xD;
      death, the investigators will engage with representatives of all relevant faith communities.&#xD;
      Based on the findings of Work Package 1, the investigators will develop two questionnaire&#xD;
      surveys. One for the public, and one for primary and community health care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two research strands in this Work Package 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Focus groups/interviews&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surveys&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the public with an interest in health care will be recruited through patient&#xD;
      support groups and local community groups in each of the three areas in which the study takes&#xD;
      place. The investigators will purposively select participants from those people expressing an&#xD;
      interest to reflect the sociodemographic and ethnic profile of the community until at least&#xD;
      10 people are willing to participate. Health care professionals will be recruited through&#xD;
      local branches of professional organisations and social media. The investigators will select&#xD;
      to ensure diversity of professional background. Focus group members will be prompted to&#xD;
      discuss the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the benefits for patients, carers, the health service, and wider society of the&#xD;
           implementation of ReSPECT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What are the dis-benefits of ReSPECT?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What gets in the way of implementing ReSPECT in a way that optimises its use and value,&#xD;
           including access to forms and transfer between health and social care organisations?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  How can the dis-benefits of ReSPECT, and challenges to its use be mitigated?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews The investigators will interview six faith leaders from across the three study&#xD;
      areas selected to reflect a diverse range of faith perspectives. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to consider the same topics as the focus group participants and in addition the investigators&#xD;
      will explore how the values embedded in ReSPECT sit with key values of their faith and areas&#xD;
      were the faith's teaching supports the premise of ReSPECT or could cause challenges for&#xD;
      people following that faith. Data from focus groups and interviews will be analysed using&#xD;
      Framework analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys Public survey: The investigators will commission the National Centre for Social&#xD;
      Research to include questions in the annual British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA), to be&#xD;
      presented to 1000 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GP survey: The investigators will distribute the survey through a monthly online survey of UK&#xD;
      GPs. The investigators will refine the questions using think aloud interviews with a small&#xD;
      number of GPs and pilot the finalised questions with a sample of GPs prior to distribution.&#xD;
      The survey provides data on commissioned questions presented to a regionally representative&#xD;
      sample of 1000 GPs including partners, salaried non-principals and locums.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis The investigators will analyse associations between the survey outcomes and&#xD;
      covariates such as: age, gender, presence/type of chronic disease, functional status&#xD;
      (patients), time in practice and practice size (GPs). The most important outcome is the&#xD;
      binary outcome 'whether they would complete an emergency care treatment plan' (for themselves&#xD;
      if public survey and for their patients if GP survey) for which the investigators will fit a&#xD;
      logistic regression model. T.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package three In this work package the investigators will look at the quality of&#xD;
      completion of ReSPECT forms in primary care and identify to what extent treatment decisions&#xD;
      in an acute or emergency situation reflect the recommendations on a person's ReSPECT form.&#xD;
      The method will be a retrospective case analysis of ReSPECT forms and the relevant sections&#xD;
      of patients' records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the challenges to obtaining consent from sufficient patients or their carers to&#xD;
      achieve a sample that is not biased and includes patients who are likely to have a ReSPECT&#xD;
      form and experience an event where the ReSPECT recommendations would be crucial to guiding&#xD;
      treatment decisions, the investigators are seeking Confidentiality Advisory Group approval to&#xD;
      access the patient records without consent and to use anonymised records for the analysis.&#xD;
      The investigators will, through the practices or the relevant care home, write to all&#xD;
      patients (or their carers) who have had a ReSPECT form completed in the previous 12 months&#xD;
      with information about the study and provide an opportunity for them to opt out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ReSPECT form and print outs of the patient record since ReSPECT form completion including&#xD;
      hospital discharge letters and ED correspondence up to six months post ReSPECT completion&#xD;
      will be generated by the practice and transferred securely to the study team. All included&#xD;
      ReSPECT forms will be reviewed using the evaluation tool that the investigators have&#xD;
      developed in the recently completed study of ReSPECT in secondary care to assess quality of&#xD;
      completion of each section of the form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all included ReSPECT forms the relevant data (treatment recommendations including CPR&#xD;
      decision (Part 4 of the ReSPECT form) will be extracted from the form. The corresponding&#xD;
      medical record will be reviewed to identify the first hospital admission or significant&#xD;
      treatment event (defined as an acute episode requiring a medical treatment decision) since&#xD;
      ReSPECT form completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The record will be compared with the recommendations in section four of the corresponding&#xD;
      ReSPECT form to look for congruence. The primary analysis will be on congruence of free text&#xD;
      recommendations and clinical care. The investigators will fit a logistic regression model to&#xD;
      the binary primary outcome 'congruency or not between what is stated on the ReSPECT form and&#xD;
      what is actually implemented' with covariates such as: age, gender, place of residence,&#xD;
      health category and cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work package four In this work package the investigators will synthesis their findings from&#xD;
      the previous work packages and present the key findings at a stakeholder conference.&#xD;
