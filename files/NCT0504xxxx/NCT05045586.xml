  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microsurgical tunneling flap procedures using connective tissue grafts (CTG) are predictable&#xD;
      for treating teeth with gingival recessions. Cross-linked hyaluronic acid can be used in&#xD;
      conjunction with subepithelial palatal connective tissue grafts to improve postsurgical&#xD;
      results. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinically the use of tunnel technique with CTG&#xD;
      and cross-linked hyaluronic acid in addition to CTG alone for the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      gingival recessions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of multiple adjacent recession appears to be challenging for the clinician due&#xD;
      to large surgical field, variation in teeth position in the dental arch (prominent roots),&#xD;
      variation in recession size, thin phenotype and insufficient keratinized tissue in many&#xD;
      teeth. Surgical treatment of all multiple recession in one dental arch during one session&#xD;
      appears to be optimum. Surgical treatment time is longer, however patient doesn't need to&#xD;
      undergo multiple surgeries, pharmacological therapies and postsurgical instructions. Esthetic&#xD;
      concern seems to be one of the most common complaints from patients. Among utilized surgical&#xD;
      techniques tunneling flap procedures using connective tissue grafts (CTG) with or without&#xD;
      biologics such as an enamel matrix derivative (EMD) or hyaluronic acid (HA) provided the most&#xD;
      successful outcomes for the treatment. Cross-linked hyaluronic acid can be used in&#xD;
      conjunction with subepithelial palatal connective tissue grafts to improve postsurgical&#xD;
      results and improving healing process. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinically the&#xD;
      use of tunnel technique with CTG and cross-linked hyaluronic acid in addition to CTG alone&#xD;
      for the treatment of multiple gingival recessions.&#xD;

    <description>Procedure: A modified microsurgical tunnel technique by Zuhr et al. (2007). Initial sulcular incisions with a microsurgical blade are followed by a split-thickness buccal flap preparations using the tunneling knives. The preparation is extended into the mucosal tissue to gain sufficient flap mobility. The papillary regions are detached in their buccal aspects with the periosteum. The graft is inserted into the tunnel and stabilized with absorbable suspensory sutures. The buccal flap is advanced coronally and stabilized with non-absorbable suspensory sutures.</description>
