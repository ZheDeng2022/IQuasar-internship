      This study is design to prospectively investigate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 in the early diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The&#xD;
      specific objectives are the determination of pharmacokinetics, dosimetry, tolerance and tumor&#xD;
      detection rate of 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 in patient with PDAC. Neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR-1) is&#xD;
      the high affinity receptor of Neurotensin (NT), which was found abnormal expression in the&#xD;
      early stages of PDAC malignant cell transformation. 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 as a new NTR-1 targeted&#xD;
      probe was prepared and showed good uptake on PDAC cell line and animal studies. The study&#xD;
      intends to recruit 6 PDAC volunteers to participate in the experiment. Patients were&#xD;
      evaluated with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG). And then all patients underwent a&#xD;
      single-injection with 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3, dual-modality imaging protocol consisting of a&#xD;
      PET/CT and subsequent PET/MR scan. The follow-up period was followed up to assess safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

    <description>The presence of non-physiological uptake or uptake in a tissue structure can be considered pathological. The signal intensity of PET indicates the presence and density of NTR-1 in the tissue. The lesion intake is higher than the liver and is classified as clearly positive. The lesion and the surrounding normal tissue ROI, measure the SUV, and calculate the T/B ratio.</description>

    <description>In this study, all patients will receive one injection of 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3, a PET radiopharmaceutical selective for neurotensin receptor 1 (NTR-1). For the injection, subjects will receive a target dose of 2-4 MBq per kg of body weight as a bolus injection. 68Ga-DOTA-NT-20.3 injection will be followed by a 10 ml saline flush.</description>
