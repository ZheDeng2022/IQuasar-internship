  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to compare the incidence of postoperative residual curarisation (PORC) and&#xD;
      postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) in the SUG and NEO group by means of diaphragm&#xD;
      ultrasonography and LUS, so as to conclude whether SUG can outperform NEO in preventing&#xD;
      occurrence of PORC and PPCs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of postoperative residual curarisation (PORC) is about 2%-64% worldwide, which&#xD;
      may be an underling risk factor of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), causing many&#xD;
      undesirable effects on patients. Thus, reversal drugs of neuromuscular blocking agents&#xD;
      (NMBAs) such as neostigmine (NEO) and sugammadex (SUG) have been administrated, and SUG maybe&#xD;
      perform better in preventing PORC. Different supplementary methods to help identify PORC or&#xD;
      PPCs have also been reported, such as adductor of pollicis acceleromyography and lung&#xD;
      ultrasound (LUS). Recently, diaphragm ultrasonography has been used to evaluate PORC, as a&#xD;
      novel approach.In this prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, we will enroll&#xD;
      414 patients of American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III, aged over 60&#xD;
      years, who will be scheduled to undergo arthroplasty surgery under general anesthesia.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized into NEO and SUG group receiving neostigmine and sugammadex&#xD;
      as reversal drug respectively. The primary outcomes will be the incidence of PPCs in NEO and&#xD;
      SUG group respectively. The secondary outcome is the incidence of PORC in the two groups.We&#xD;
      hypothesize that: 1) the incidence of PPCs is lower after reversal with SUG than with NEO, 2)&#xD;
      using the method of diaphragm ultrasonography, the incidence PORC is lower after reversal&#xD;
      with SUG than with NEO, 3) the incidence of PPCs can be predicted by LUS and by evaluating&#xD;
      whether there is PORC through diaphragmatic ultrasound.&#xD;
