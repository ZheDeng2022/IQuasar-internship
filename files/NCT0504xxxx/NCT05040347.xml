      The aim of this study was to investigate whether NETs markers can enhance predict portal vein&#xD;
      tumor thrombosis in patients with live cirrhosis, so as to establish a novel predictor to&#xD;
      guide clinical decision-making.&#xD;

      Eighty-six patients with patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University&#xD;
      (China) from September 2020 to January 2021 were recruited for this study, including 14&#xD;
      patients with portal vein tumor thrombosis, 28 patients without portal vein tumor thrombosis&#xD;
      and 44 patients without hepatocellular carcinoma. NETs markers (Myeloperoxidase, Neutrophil&#xD;
      elastase, Citrate histone H3), and anti-β2 glycoprotein I were detected in plasma using&#xD;
      capture ELISA and specific ELISA kits. T-test was performed to analyze whether there was a&#xD;
      statistical difference between the two groups, and regression analysis was performed between&#xD;
      NETs markers and tissue factor and anti-β2 glycoprotein I to investigate whether there was a&#xD;
      correlation. This study without any intervention measures, will not cause harm.&#xD;
