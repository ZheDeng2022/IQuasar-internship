  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery for intensive care survivors is limited by ongoing problems with walking, strength,&#xD;
      fatigue, mental distress and cognitive morbidity known as 'Post Intensive Care Syndrome'.&#xD;
      There has been increasing interest in ways that clinicians can support patients in their post&#xD;
      ICU recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are undertaking a co design approach to informing the design of a recovery&#xD;
      pathway for patients who have been admitted to the intensive care to support them in their&#xD;
      return to home, family and working responsibilities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project will aim to involve ~ 20 past ICU patient/family members and ~20 health&#xD;
      professionals to participate in a co-design approach to examine the recovery needs and&#xD;
      resources that are required to support patients after leaving hospital. Using an experience&#xD;
      based co design methodology three 2-hour workshops will be run with the first workshop&#xD;
      involving patients/family members, the second involving healthcare professionals to&#xD;
      separately gain thoughts and perspectives, and then the final workshop which will be combined&#xD;
      to identify and problem solve priority resources and solutions.&#xD;
