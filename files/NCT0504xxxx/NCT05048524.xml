    <textblock>
      The role of neoadjuvant treatment in pancreatic adenocarcinoma is still under debate due to a&#xD;
      relative lack of robust data compared with other gastrointestinal cancers. According to 2020&#xD;
      NCCN guidelines, neoadjuvant is now the accepted approach for borderline resectable (BR)&#xD;
      disease, while upfront surgery is still the recommendation for resectable disease except in&#xD;
      cases with high risk features. Another important advantage of treatment with neoadjuvant&#xD;
      treatment is an increase in the proportion of patients who receive chemotherapy.&#xD;
      Traditionally, only patients with a good performance status and a good recovery after surgery&#xD;
      are treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. About 45% of patients do not receive adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy after resection due to poor performance status, postoperative morbidity, or&#xD;
      early progression of disease. A small cohort study using total neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX for&#xD;
      borderline resectable pancreatic cancer yielded a promising result but the tolerability of&#xD;
      FOLFIRINOX limited the use of this regimen in Asian population. In previous T1211 clinical&#xD;
      trial, the SLOG regimen showed comparable efficacy with a better safety profile in metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. This phase II trial will evaluate the feasibility of SLOG regimen in&#xD;
      patients with localized pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
