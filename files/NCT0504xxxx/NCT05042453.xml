  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, multi center cohort trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      hysteropexy using Splentis via the vaginal route in primary uterine prolapse&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women who undergo hysteropexy with Splentis via the vaginal route for primary uterine&#xD;
      prolapse will be evaluated regarding efficacy and safety in a long term follow-up of 60&#xD;
      months. The primary endpoint is composed of anatomical, subjective and re-treatment&#xD;
      components, whereas several secondary endpoints focusing on functional outcome including&#xD;
      overactive bladder symptoms, urinary incontinence, quality of life and sexual life will be&#xD;
      considered. Furthermore, a detailed report about adverse events will be included.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Cure of apical pelvic organ prolapse</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Cure of apical pelvic organ prolapse is defined according the current recommendations by Barber et al. and ICS/IUGA recommendations. Therefore, a combined endpoint using anatomical, subjective and necessity retreatment criteria are utilized.&#xD;
Primary endpoint is the number of patients achieving all criteria of the composite endpoint:&#xD;
leading edge of the apical vaginal wall at or above the hymen (C≤ 0)&#xD;
absence of a vaginal bulge symptom&#xD;
no need for retreatment of the apical prolapse by either pessary use or surgical intervention</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks 12, 24, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change of Quality of life and prolapse symptoms using the Prolapse-Quality of Life-Questionnaire in comparison between baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
The questionnaire is divided in nine domains which are analyzed separately. The results will be transformed into a scale between 0 - 100 according the questionnaires description. The higher the score, the higher the impact of prolapse symptoms and the lower the quality of life.</description>

    <description>Change of quality of life using the EQ-5L-5D in comparison between baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
It consists of a 5-item descriptive system as well as a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 to 100. It is conceptualized to assess deviation from health and hereby provide health related quality of life problems.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Urinary incontinence</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 12, 24, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change of urinary incontinence using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire- Urinary Incontinence Short From in comparison between baseline and follow-up&#xD;
The ICIQ-UI-SF includes four items with a sum score ranging between 0 and 21 points. The higher the score the higher the impact of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overactive Bladder</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 12, 24, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change of urinary incontinence using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire- Overactive bladder in comparison between baseline and follow-up&#xD;
The score of the ICIQ-OAB ranges from 0 to 16 points. The higher the sum score the higher the impact of symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 weeks and 12, 24, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change of sexual life using the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire- IUGA revised in comparison between baseline and follow-up.&#xD;
The result will be transformed into a scale between 0 - 100. The higher the score, the higher the impact of prolapse symptoms and the higher the impact on sexual life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain according Visual analogue scale of pain</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24-48 hours postoperatively, 6 weeks and 12, 24, 36, 60 months</time_frame>
    <description>Change of pain using the visual analogue scale of pain in comparison between baseline and follow-up&#xD;
The Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale is a visual analogue scale to assess subject pain.The answers will be transformed in a scale from 0 to 10 whereas 0 implicate no pain and 10 worst pain.</description>
