      The term &quot;refractory&quot; migraine describes a particularly aggressive form of the disease in&#xD;
      which the patient does not benefit from any of the preventive therapies with the various&#xD;
      classes of drugs available, including treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against&#xD;
      Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety, depressive symptoms, somatization, and pain hypersensitivity are significantly more&#xD;
      prevalent in refractory migraineurs than in non-refractory subjects who benefit from&#xD;
      preventive therapies, suggesting that these symptoms may contribute to treatment&#xD;
      refractoriness. Recently, in a preliminary study on the efficacy of a CGRP-targeting&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody in Chronic Migraine (CM) patients with at least 3 failures to previous&#xD;
      preventive treatments, the investigators showed a higher prevalence of psychological&#xD;
      disturbances in those who did respond to the monoclonal antibody compared with the&#xD;
      responders. These data, although preliminary, point to a more psychologically complicated&#xD;
      picture in non-responder patients compared with responders. To date, however, no&#xD;
      neurobiological evaluations are available to explain how psychological comorbidities may&#xD;
      contribute to treatment refractoriness. Isolated clinical evidence and growing pre-clinical&#xD;
      evidence suggests a role for the endocannabinoid system in migraine. Hence, the present study&#xD;
      aims to identify psychological and biological factors associated with refractory migraine.&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that patients presenting with psychological disorders may&#xD;
      bear an associated dysfunction of the endocannabinoid system, which makes them more resistant&#xD;
      to migraine preventive therapies, including monoclonal antibodies directed against CGRP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a common and highly disabling condition, representing the second-leading cause of&#xD;
      disability in the global ranking of most disabling diseases . In the majority of individuals,&#xD;
      the disease manifests as episodic (EM), with attacks recurring weekly or monthly. In a&#xD;
      smaller (2-3% of the general population), but still significant portion of patients, migraine&#xD;
      becomes chronic, i.e., occurring on at least 15 days per month (CM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that CM patients are characterized by the presence of multiple&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities compared with subjects with episodic migraine and healthy controls.&#xD;
      In recent years, it has also been shown that among the neurobiological systems involved in&#xD;
      the genesis and development of mental disorders, the endocannabinoid system (ES) appears to&#xD;
      play an active role. In particular, patients with these disorders are characterized, at the&#xD;
      level of peripheral cells, by a gene alteration of cannabinoid receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies reported the involvement of SE in immune responses, psychological processes,&#xD;
      transduction of neurobiological signals and pain, including migraine pain. Recently it has&#xD;
      been shown that the peripheral gene expression of enzymes involved in the metabolism of&#xD;
      anandamide (AEA) and 2-aciglycerol (2-AG), the two best known endocannabinoids, is altered in&#xD;
      migraine patients, but more markedly in the chronic subtype, suggesting a role for these&#xD;
      lipid molecules not only in the pathophysiology of the disease, but also in its exacerbation.&#xD;
      The role of CGRP in the pathophysiology of migraine has now been demonstrated, although the&#xD;
      mechanism of action at both peripheral and central levels and its possible interactions with&#xD;
      other pathways are not completely known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term &quot;refractory&quot; migraine describes a particularly aggressive form of the disease in&#xD;
      which the patient does not benefit from any of the preventive therapies with the various&#xD;
      classes of drugs available, including treatment with monoclonal antibodies directed against&#xD;
      CGRP (Consensus document of the European Headache Federation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anxiety, depressive symptoms, somatization, and pain hypersensitivity are significantly more&#xD;
      prevalent in refractory migraineurs than in non-refractory subjects who benefit from&#xD;
      preventive therapies, suggesting that these symptoms may contribute to treatment&#xD;
      refractoriness. Recently, in a preliminary study regarding the efficacy of monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody targeting CGRP in CM patients refractory to at least three preventive therapies,the&#xD;
      investigators showed a higher prevalence of personality disorders (77% vs 37%) in those who&#xD;
      were not responding to treatment at 1 year (non-responders: reduction in migraine days &lt;50%),&#xD;
      compared with those who were responding (responders: reduction in migraine days ≥50%).&#xD;
      Non-responders were also characterized by a higher prevalence of anxiety spectrum disorders&#xD;
      and more stressful events than responders. These data, although preliminary, point to a more&#xD;
      psychologically complicated picture in non-responder patients compared with responders. To&#xD;
      date, however, no neurobiological data are available to explain how psychological&#xD;
      comorbidities may contribute to treatment refractoriness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this frame, the present study aims to identify psychological and potential&#xD;
      biochemical/molecular factors associated with refractory migraine. The investigators'&#xD;
      hypothesis is that patients presenting with psychological disorders may bear an associated&#xD;
      dysfunction of the endocannabinoid system, which makes them more resistant to migraine&#xD;
      preventive therapies, including monoclonal antibodies directed against CGRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a screening phase of one month in which patients will complete a daily headache&#xD;
      diary in which they will note the occurrence, intensity and duration of attacks, as well as&#xD;
      the use of symptomatic drugs. At baseline patients will undergo the psychological and&#xD;
      biochemical/molecular evaluation. Subjects will then be treated with one of the three&#xD;
      commercially available monoclonal antibodies targeting CGRP and will continue to record the&#xD;
      characteristics of attacks and the use of symptomatic drugs in their headache diary.&#xD;
      Follow-up visits are foreseen after 3 and 6 months of treatment. At 6 months, patients will&#xD;
      be divided into 2 groups (responder or not responder to the treatment) depending on the&#xD;
      reduction of monthly migraine days in the previous 3 months (&gt;50% and &lt;50%, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients who failed to respond to the treatment will be considered refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychological evaluation: All patients will be evaluated by psychological interview and by&#xD;
      adopting the DSM-V criteria for personality disturbances, anxiety and mood disorders. All&#xD;
      patients will also be administered the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) the&#xD;
      Toronto Alexithymia Scale 20 (TAS-20), severity of dependence questionnaires (Severity&#xD;
      Dependence Scale - SDS - and Leeds Dependence Questionnaire - LDQ), questionnaires related to&#xD;
      Childhood trauma and Stressful life events.&#xD;
