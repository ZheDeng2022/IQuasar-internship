      A study of immunotherapy with expanded CB-NK cells in combination with cetuximab, to evaluate&#xD;
      activity against minimal residual disease in patients with colon cancer that have completed&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment but are positive for ctDNA&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase Ib clinical trial to evaluate the safety and activity of expanded CB-NK cells&#xD;
      in combination with cetuximab in patients with high-risk CRC who have completed adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy but are still positive for MRD (see Figure 5). A total of 15 patients with stage&#xD;
      II-III, and resected stage IV CRC and positivity for MRD will be enrolled. MRD is defined as&#xD;
      the lack of radiographically evident disease, in the presence of ctDNA matching the original&#xD;
      tumor mutations after adjuvant chemotherapy. The primary goal of the study is ctDNA clearance&#xD;
      from the blood in these patients. After completing SOC surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy,&#xD;
      patients will be tested for the persistence of blood ctDNA. Those who are ctDNA-positive will&#xD;
      repeat a computed tomography (CT) scan and if the imaging shows no radiological evidence of&#xD;
      disease, they will be eligible for the study screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the activity of the CB-NK infusion in combination with cetuximab in patients&#xD;
      with resected colorectal cancer and positivity for minimal residual disease&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the efficacy of the CB-NK infusion in combination with cetuximab in patients&#xD;
      with resected colorectal cancer and positivity for minimal residual disease&#xD;
