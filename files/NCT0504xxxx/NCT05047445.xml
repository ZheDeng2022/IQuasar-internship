  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objectives of this study are to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity&#xD;
      of the candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, COVIDITY, when administered using a needle-free&#xD;
      injection device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, two-arm Phase 1 study to determine the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 COVIDITY vaccine, when administered using a needle-free&#xD;
      injection device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVIDITY consists of two doses of the plasmid DNA vaccine SCOV1 (administered on Day 1 and&#xD;
      Day 29), followed by two doses of the plasmid DNA vaccine SCOV2 (not before Days 113 and 141&#xD;
      [doses 4 weeks apart]). A final end of study assessment will then be performed 6 weeks after&#xD;
      last dose of study vaccine (Day 183 [earliest]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCOV1 is expected to be active against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain and the B.1.1.7 (Alpha)&#xD;
      variant, and to a slightly lesser extent against the B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants.&#xD;
      SCOV2 is expected to boost the effects of SCOV1 while providing further enhanced protection&#xD;
      against the B.1.351 (Beta) and P.1 (Gamma) variants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose of SCOV1 or SCOV2 will be administered via needle-free injection, either&#xD;
      intradermally (0.2 mg doses; study Arm 1; PharmaJet Tropis® device) or intramuscularly (1.0&#xD;
      mg doses; study Arm 2; PharmaJet Stratis® device). Eligible injection sites include the outer&#xD;
      aspect of the upper left or right arm (medial deltoid muscle) or the left or right outer&#xD;
      thigh (lateralis muscle) for intradermal administration (Arm 1), and the outer aspect of the&#xD;
      upper left or right arm (medial deltoid muscle) for intramuscular administration (Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is expected to enrol 40 participants (20 per study arm) at one study centre in&#xD;
      South Africa. At least 15 participants in each arm should be negative for antibodies against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 upon entry into the study.&#xD;
