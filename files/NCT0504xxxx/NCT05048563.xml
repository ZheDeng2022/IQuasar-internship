  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thiola EC represents several modifications of Thiola that promise better, more efficacious&#xD;
      therapy of cystinuria. First, pill size has changed from 100 mg to 300 mg, meaning that&#xD;
      typical pill burden will be reduced from, on average, 10 pills per day to 3-5 pills per day.&#xD;
      This change will be welcomed by patients whose fluid intake and administration of potassium&#xD;
      citrate are daily impositions. Second, the preparation is now enteric-coated, formulated to&#xD;
      offer delayed release of active tiopronin. Lastly, Thiola EC can be taken with food which is&#xD;
      an improvement to the inconvenient dosing regimen of Thiola, which can only be taken one hour&#xD;
      before, or two hours after meals. These changes may affect compliance and side effect&#xD;
      profiles compared to those of Thiola. In combination with potassium citrate or other alkali&#xD;
      preparations, adverse GI effects are relatively common in actively-treated patients with&#xD;
      cystinuria. It is possible that GI side effects may be reduced by Thiola EC.&#xD;

    <measure>Wisconsin Stone Quality Of Life (WiSQoL) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The WiSQoL questionnaire is designed to understand the quality of life of patients with a history of kidney stones. There are 7 main questions that each have sub-questions. The questions are answered on a scale from 1 (very true / always or almost always) to 5 (not at all true / not at all, never). The total range of questions is 28-140; the lower the score, the worse the quality of life.</description>
