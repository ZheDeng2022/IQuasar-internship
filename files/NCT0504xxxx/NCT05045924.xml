  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 outbreak has exposed many strengths and weaknesses of delivering healthcare, and&#xD;
      we want to assess whether patients with advanced liver cirrhosis can be effectively monitored&#xD;
      at home, to limit hospital visits and thereby their infection risks. We also wish to show&#xD;
      that if they have new signs of clinical deterioration, that these can be picked up quickly&#xD;
      even in the community, and can result in early review or appropriate treatment. This study&#xD;
      has been funded by INNOVATE UK, who are seeking novel ways and technologies to improve health&#xD;
      during the pressures of the COVID pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking part in this study involves a consultation with the investigating doctor and being&#xD;
      shown how to use a phone-based App and the supplied CirrhoCare equipment (Withings Watch,&#xD;
      scales, and Blood Pressure cuff). Patients will be shown how to use the equipment for several&#xD;
      simple daily assessments, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart rate (ECG) readings via the supplied Withings Watch. This would take approximately 7-10&#xD;
      minutes to perform each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily weight, using a special weighing scale that also measures the amount of body water and&#xD;
      muscle percentages (takes 30 seconds to perform).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital blood pressure measurement, using the supplied cuff. This would take approximately 2&#xD;
      minutes to perform daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all the above measurements, that are entirely automated, the patient will be guided via&#xD;
      the mobile phone App with step-by-step video instructions. In addition, they will be given&#xD;
      printed instructions. Individuals will be asked to perform the measurements through daily&#xD;
      prompts built into the App, and be sent reminders, in case they forget. If they have&#xD;
      difficulties with any of the tasks, there is also an App based support system, where they can&#xD;
      send a message for the trial team to provide assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the measurements above, patients will be prompted to click on a memory testing&#xD;
      exercise of naming animals (termed - 'Stroop test'), which will be performed after the daily&#xD;
      morning measurements. This can take half a minute to up to four minutes to perform, depending&#xD;
      on an individual's memory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment will be supplied will enable daily monitoring for a maximum of 3 months in this&#xD;
      study. We will also be able to learn from the supplied watch, how much sleep and how much&#xD;
      daily exercise patients get, which will help us assess general physical well-being.&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients will be aksed to supply information on the amount of fluid and food&#xD;
      they have consumed via simple 'click' functions on the App (e.g. clicking next to the picture&#xD;
      denoting 4 glasses of water). Patients will be prompted to do this via smartphone and watch&#xD;
      every evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will seek patient feedback on using the App through a brief in-App based questionnaire,&#xD;
      after 4, 8 and 12 weeks of study. In addition, patients will fill in a quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaire before they start using the equipment, and then again after 4 weeks and 12&#xD;
      weeks. These brief questionnaires are through simple drop-down menus on the App and take less&#xD;
      than 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of 12 weeks, or if individuals leave the study earlier, all the equipment will be&#xD;
      returned to the investigating team, to analyse the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the data that we will collect from the digital tools described above, we will&#xD;
      also access routine blood tests performed when determined necessary by the liver doctors, as&#xD;
      part of the standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current Covid Pandemic has necessitated an unusual allocation of healthcare resources&#xD;
      which inevitably negatively impacts on resources available to care for patients with chronic&#xD;
      diseases including liver disease. This is most marked in those with acute 'decompensation' of&#xD;
      cirrhosis, namely the significant subset of patients who develop a rapid decline in liver&#xD;
      function and numerous complications including, fluid overload, confusion (encephalopathy),&#xD;
      kidney dysfunction and gastrointestinal bleeding.[Jalan et al, J Hepatol 2015; Moreau R et&#xD;
      al, Gastroenterology 2013] These patients normally require a regular clinical assessment&#xD;
      (every 1-2 weeks) and even when discharged following a recent admission to hospital, have&#xD;
      re-admission rates approaching 40% in 8 weeks.[Moranda et al, J Hepatol, 2013] The current&#xD;
      unmet need is to institute regular contact with the patient, to avoid further new&#xD;
      complications from cirrhosis developing and hospital admission, whilst also avoiding&#xD;
      nosocomial (health care setting related) infection with Covid 19 through standard outpatient,&#xD;
      scheduled contact. [Tapper EB et al, J Hepatol 2020]&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to provide a remote management system for cirrhosis care, which will include&#xD;
      remote acquisition of important vital signs such as heart rate, heart rate variability, blood&#xD;
      pressure, physical activity and sleep status (through wearable technology), weight, and&#xD;
      assessment of higher mental function (smartphone app based tools), all of which are key&#xD;
      metrics that are perturbed as cirrhosis decompensation ensues. By efficiently collating this&#xD;
      data and linking this to an effective clinical workflow stream based on a platform created&#xD;
      for smartphone and clinical user application interfaces, will facilitate improved&#xD;
      telemedicine 'consultations' by healthcare providers. This is a novel approach that in this&#xD;
      patient cohort, which will allow early detection of signs of complications and rapid triaging&#xD;
      of patients who need early direct clinical review, at a time when this is a limited resource.&#xD;
      Our solution will help prioritize care whilst limiting risk of COVID-19 infection exposure,&#xD;
      and also personalizing this to an individual patient's needs and disease, making this more&#xD;
      acceptable and convenient for patients. In the longer term, costs savings will arise through&#xD;
      more efficient and streamlined outpatient direct contacts, whilst all patients will receive&#xD;
      the priority and regular care input they need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single centre study at the Royal Free London trust. This is a tertiary liver unit&#xD;
      with significant experience in running clinical trials in decompensated cirrhosis. This pilot&#xD;
      study has already recruited 20 cirrhosis patients with a known history of decompensation and&#xD;
      20 contemporaneous controls. Potential participants were identified by the PI and/or clinical&#xD;
      fellows on the study log, using existing clinic lists and inpatient and discharge lists. The&#xD;
      individuals have been monitored using a wrist-watch wearable device, with associated smart&#xD;
      weighing scales and blood pressure cuff, along with a smartphone application (including&#xD;
      economic smartphone in those patients if not available), to facilitate home monitoring.&#xD;
      Currently an interim analysis is being performed on the data collected to assess safety and&#xD;
      engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine laboratory data was collected in the previous 7 days as part of standard clinical&#xD;
      assessment prior to recruitment. Data included liver and kidney function tests and full blood&#xD;
      count. The data is logged within the patient historical data on the Cirrhocare App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study specific procedures that the participant has undertaken at home were relayed in&#xD;
      person during a first study visit meeting, to ensure all the equipment was functional, had&#xD;
      been sync'd to work appropriately, and that the participant could operate both the wearables&#xD;
      and the Cirrhocare App. The Investigator also provided the participant (and any carer) with&#xD;
      written instructions but also a recorded User Guide video on the App. Following patient&#xD;
      consent, App set-up, and Cirrhocare Healthkit sync to the patient's (or study provided)&#xD;
      phone, and the subsequent patient education steps, the participant, under supervision,&#xD;
      performed the baseline App based tests detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the baseline Visit (Visit 1) listed above, the participants were educated with&#xD;
      regards to use of their Wearable devices, the use of the Cirrhocare App and the notifications&#xD;
      they should expect to receive, such as reminders for the daily measurements required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each day, Monday-Friday, between 9am-11am, participants were expected to perform the&#xD;
      following measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRV- as instructed at the baseline visit, and after a brief period of rest when sitting&#xD;
      still. This was performed on the Withings move ECG watch after a prompt within the App, which&#xD;
      captured their ECG and communicated this to a dedicated Cloud storing daily recordings. The&#xD;
      ECG capture was repeated as steps to record 5 minutes of total ECG readings, needed for&#xD;
      thorough evaluation of daily HRV. If the participant failed or was unable to complete the&#xD;
      task each day after being prompted by the App, they received reminder notifications on their&#xD;
      watch and phone to the need for this important data capture. If the participant was unwell&#xD;
      and hence felt unable to perform the test, they received a further prompt to enter any&#xD;
      symptoms to be communicated to the Investigator team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BP measurement- participants followed the App prompt to start BP recordings using the&#xD;
      supplied Withings cuff. They followed a guide (video clip on the App) that showed placement&#xD;
      of the BP cuff on the left arm and when to begin measurement. The recording of BP is&#xD;
      automatic through the App and the readings similar to HRV, stored on a Cloud after they are&#xD;
      integrated in the App.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight measurement - Following the above, the participant was prompted to assess their weight&#xD;
      on the supplied Withings scales. They weighed themselves applying bare feet to the scales and&#xD;
      with ideally limited loose-fitting clothing so as to standardize daily measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Well-being information: The participants were then prompted to enter their sense of&#xD;
      well-being, with drop-down menu prompts (tired, well, unwell, etc.) and the opportunity to&#xD;
      input specific symptoms and to request an additional contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the participants had completed the above tasks, they were then next prompted at 8pm to&#xD;
      record their daily food and fluid intake through drop-down menus as prompted by the App for&#xD;
      simplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant was also prompted after the morning measurements, to apply the Stroop Test&#xD;
      for encephalopathy as shown to them on visit 1. The App guides them through the completion of&#xD;
      the task, which involves naming animals, and then sends the information upon completion of&#xD;
      the task to the Cloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all measurements and the Stroop test, the participant received acknowledgement form the&#xD;
      App to confirm their data had been logged correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the tasks requiring direct participant engagement, the Withings Move watch&#xD;
      also recorded daily activity as steps, including whether this included vertical climb&#xD;
      (stairs) and also sleep patterns (day/night/REM sleep, etc.). This data was collected&#xD;
      automatically, which the participant is aware of at the time of consent and helps inform of&#xD;
      functional status as well as the development of signs of encephalopathy (i.e increased&#xD;
      daytime sleep or inactivity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on daily inputs form participants including measured data as well as food/fluid/sleep&#xD;
      and activity data, the physician investigator may have requested a phone call or prompt the&#xD;
      participant for further information. For example, if the participant reported new symptoms of&#xD;
      a cough or urinary symptoms and has a decrease in HRV or blood pressure, the physician may&#xD;
      have prompted the participant to check their temperature with a forehead strip thermometer&#xD;
      (also supplied to participants). Another such example might include a check on encephalopathy&#xD;
      based on reduced daytime activity or increased sleep or poor Stroop test performance,&#xD;
      prompting an additional tele consult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians also used the outputs that were collated by the App from each participant to gauge&#xD;
      the need for additional contact via text messages or phone in addition to the standard&#xD;
      scheduled visits, below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tele consults were routinely scheduled at week 4, and at week 8 (+/- 5 days), which would&#xD;
      historically have been face-to-face appointments pre-COVID 19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They included assessments of the patient's symptoms, state of encephalopathy (based on&#xD;
      conversation and animal naming tests), and assessment of diet and functional status. In&#xD;
      addition, routine scheduled blood tests were performed within the week prior to the telephone&#xD;
      clinic to inform changes in routine clinical care/treatment. These included, full blood&#xD;
      count, liver and kidney function tests, and prothrombin time/INR; C-reactive protein and&#xD;
      N-terminal BNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants also populated their usability questionnaire on the Cirrhocare App at the time&#xD;
      of these telephone contacts, and this information was added to any clinician entry on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life as discerned by questions during the consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 12 involved a face-to-face consultation to assess clinical status by history and&#xD;
      clinical examination (i.e. HE, assessment of ascites and oedema, Jaundice, etc) and general&#xD;
      symptoms as part of a routine clinical visit for such patients. Patient's HRV, heart rate, BP&#xD;
      and weight were re-assessed in the clinic and recorded as the study-end measured variables.&#xD;
      Patients were also sent for routine blood test after the appointment and this included; full&#xD;
      blood count, liver and kidney function tests, and prothrombin time/INR; C-reactive protein&#xD;
      and N-terminal BNP. The results from these routine bloods will be used for assessment of&#xD;
      their clinical scores at that time, to reflect their liver decompensation status, namely MELD&#xD;
      and EF-CLIF AD scores, as necessary for standard clinical assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this clinic appointment, a participant Cirrhocare App usability questionnaire was also&#xD;
      completed and also a quality-of-life questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient requires their routine liver cancer screening ultrasound in the 3-4 month time&#xD;
      period when they are participating in the study (done once every 6 months as standard), then&#xD;
      this too will be booked routinely. Similarly, most patients undergo routine endoscopic&#xD;
      examination for oesophageal varices every year if they have advanced disease. If their&#xD;
      screening endoscopy falls within the time frame of their study inclusion, then this too will&#xD;
      be booked in routinely. The data from these tests are not specifically required for the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As participants are monitored, it is foreseen that some will have events such as increased&#xD;
      hepatic encephalopathy (HE), or new infection, as these are expected events in any patient&#xD;
      with decompensated cirrhosis. If their monitoring suggests an event may be more likely by for&#xD;
      example, changes in activity status (onset of HE) or Increased heart rate and falling blood&#xD;
      pressure (potential sepsis), then the Investigator may elect to contact the participant for&#xD;
      more information and suggest some advice by an additional telephone call. The outcome of such&#xD;
      a contact might trigger a need for further blood tests or even hospital face-to-face&#xD;
      assessment, as indicated by the clinical need and individual patient circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This COVID-19 funded pilot study seeks to evaluate early assessment of usability and&#xD;
      feasibility of home monitoring in this advanced cirrhosis population. We are not planning to&#xD;
      have further study related visits after 3 months, though patient data on mortality at 3&#xD;
      months and 6 months will be captured for subsequent reporting purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last study visit at 12 weeks, patients will return to routine scheduled tele clinic&#xD;
      follow-up or face-to-face reviews based on clinical indications (e.g. requirement for ascites&#xD;
      drainage), at intervals of around 4-8 weeks.&#xD;
