    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a disorder of high blood glucose, that tends to get worse; over time, patients&#xD;
      need more and more drugs. This pattern is caused by overwork of the body's insulin-producing&#xD;
      β-cells, because patients' glucose levels are typically above normal; if the investigators&#xD;
      kept glucose levels normal - reducing β-cell work - the investigators might be able to keep&#xD;
      the disease from getting worse. This trial is aimed to show that adjusting the drugs to keep&#xD;
      glucose levels normal, can help to preserve β-cell function compared to usual diabetes care,&#xD;
      possibly reduce the tendency to develop the eye and kidney complications of diabetes, and&#xD;
      might also be more cost-effective than usual care.&#xD;

      I. RATIONALE AND SPECIFIC AIMS CHANGING THE NATURAL HISTORY OF TYPE 2 DIABETES - &quot;CHANGE&quot;&#xD;
      STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.A. RATIONALE The investigators will test the hypothesis that maintenance of normoglycemia&#xD;
      can prevent the typical worsening of hyperglycemia in early type 2 diabetes (DM) compared to&#xD;
      usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Progression of hyperglycemia is mediated by loss of β-cell function, which will be mitigated&#xD;
      by normalizing glucose levels, reducing the &quot;excitotoxicity&quot; leading to dedifferentiation and&#xD;
      apoptosis. When lifestyle change or Rx reduced progression from prediabetes (PreDM) to DM,&#xD;
      there was no &quot;catch-up&quot; after trials ended - cumulative DM remained less than in controls,&#xD;
      consistent with a change in the natural history. Reaching normal glucose is beneficial&#xD;
      regardless of the intervention: in the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), PreDM subjects who&#xD;
      achieved normal glucose levels only once, had 56% less DM in the DPP Outcomes Study [DPPOS] -&#xD;
      similar in lifestyle change, metformin, and control groups. But if treatment is begun too&#xD;
      late, even 10 kg weight loss may not lead to DM remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.B. FEATURES OF THE APPROACH - easy to translate into practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be novel: 1) Aim for normal glucose, instead of testing Rx or mechanisms [as&#xD;
      in STOP DIABETES, DPP, and RISE], since lowering glucose per se improves β-cell function. 2)&#xD;
      Start early in the natural history, instead of late [as in ACCORD, ADVANCE, and VADT],&#xD;
      allowing use of Rx with a low risk of hypoglycemia; severe hypoglycemia was unusual in&#xD;
      ORIGIN, where DM duration was only 5.5 years. 3) Target early DM instead of PreDM [DREAM,&#xD;
      DPP, ACT NOW, and STOP DIABETES], allowing use of Rx FDA approved for DM. 4) Accelerated&#xD;
      stepped intensification of Rx to keep glucose normal, vs. &lt; 10% reaching a normal OGTT 3&#xD;
      times in the DPP, only 15% reaching a normal OGTT with metformin over 2 years in RISE, and&#xD;
      lack of normalization in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.C. AIMS - assess effect size, β-cell function, retinopathy, nephropathy, CGM,&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: To ensure separation of treatment arms, the investigators will study DM expected to&#xD;
      progress. 126 adults will be randomized to ensure that 102 complete the study, allowing for&#xD;
      dropouts, 1/3 in each of 3 groups: (i) A1c 6.0-6.9%, no Rx; (ii) A1c 6.0-6.9%, on metformin;&#xD;
      (iii) A1c 7.0-7.4%, on metformin. All will have DM by OGTT + 1 hour OGTT glucose ≥155 mg/dl&#xD;
      to increase the risk of progression. After a 2-week run-in to establish tolerance to&#xD;
      metformin (if not on it already) and adherence to self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG),&#xD;
      all will have a lifestyle intervention [VA MOVE!, similar to the DPP], and HbA1c and 2 weeks&#xD;
      of continuous glucose monitoring (Abbott CGM) every 3 months. Randomization will be 1:1&#xD;
      within each group, to intensive Rx: adding Rx if SMBG levels are &gt; goal (&lt;100 mg/dl premeal&#xD;
      and &lt;130 postmeal) ≥3x/week 2 weeks in a row after ≥4 weeks of maximum tolerated dosage (MTD)&#xD;
      of Rx; metformin (if not on it already), + TZD pioglitazone, + GLP-1 RA semaglutide, + SGLT-2&#xD;
      empagliflozin, + glargine insulin; or control Rx: adding Rx in the same order, based on HbA1c&#xD;
      every 3 months; initial added Rx for HbA1c ≥7.0%, subsequent Rx for HbA1c ≥7.5% [similar to&#xD;
      use in GRADE and typical VA practice].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Over 2.5 years, plus a 3-month washout, the investigators will quantitate (i)&#xD;
      effect size - differences in HbA1c with intensive Rx vs. controls - from the Rx paradigm,&#xD;
      expected to be 5.2-5.6% vs. 6.5-7.4%, respectively; and (ii) β-cell function [in 3-hour OGTTs&#xD;
      with modeling as in RISE], since trends with intensive vs. control Rx post-washout may&#xD;
      indicate whether β-cell function is likely to be sustained, consistent with the conclusions&#xD;
      of the RISE Consortium. The investigators will also explore (iii) retinopathy (blinded&#xD;
      evaluation of fundus photographs); (iv) nephropathy (microalbuminuria and eGFR); (v) whether&#xD;
      CGM after ≥3 weeks of MTD could be substituted for SMBG in identifying need for&#xD;
      intensification, and (vi) cost-effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.D. HYPOTHESIZED CLINICAL IMPACT OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS AND KEEPING GLUCOSE NORMAL:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence from DM prevention and intervention studies allows us to predict that keeping&#xD;
      glucose normal will be safe - and longterm benefits will include reduced complications,&#xD;
      mortality, and costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a definitive trial demonstrates that keeping glucose normal sustains β-cell function, a&#xD;
      change in practice to include this model of intensive Rx should improve both health, and&#xD;
      healthcare system resource use and costs. The next step would be to plan a study of impact on&#xD;
      renal and retinal outcomes - since lifestyle interventions are now widespread, the Rx classes&#xD;
      used have a low risk of hypoglycemia and are going off patent, and this experience in&#xD;
      overcoming clinical inertia should facilitate implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. EXPERIMENTAL PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have a simple design; instead of mechanisms such as insulin action and&#xD;
      secretion, eligibility, screening, and interventions will be based only on glucose and HbA1c,&#xD;
      to facilitate translation to routine clinical practice. The goals are to (i) establish effect&#xD;
      size (differences in HbA1c), (ii) determine if β cell function can be sustained, and (iii)&#xD;
      explore retinopathy, nephropathy, cost effectiveness, and potential substitution of CGM for&#xD;
      SMBG, to help define the sample size for a subsequent multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. INTERVENTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.A. LIFESTYLE CHANGE SUPPORT - FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VA's &quot;MOVE!&quot; group lifestyle change program is modeled after the DPP, with similar goals&#xD;
      - 7% weight loss for those with BMI &gt;25, and &gt;150 minutes a week of exercise. Other&#xD;
      recommendations to PCPs will be per ADA DM guidelines, similar to the VADT - BP, lipid&#xD;
      control, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.B. CONTROL Rx - INTENSIFICATION BASED ON HbA1c LEVELS, DETERMINED EVERY 3 MONTHS (see&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV.C. INTENSIVE Rx - INTENSIFICATION BASED ON SMBG, DONE AN AVERAGE OF ONCE A DAY (see&#xD;
      below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON CLINICAL PRACTICE&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study (and a follow-up multicenter study) are aimed to change medical practice. If the&#xD;
      studies are positive as expected, screening to find early DM, and management aimed at normal&#xD;
      glucose, should become routine. Moreover, since hyperglycemia in usual care reaches HbA1c&#xD;
      levels much higher than in controls [insulin is frequently begun when HbA1c is &gt;9%], the&#xD;
      real-world difference from intensive Rx [HbA1c 5.2-5.6%] would be correspondingly greater,&#xD;
      with a greater impact on health, resource use, and costs. Years of lower glucose, through&#xD;
      &quot;legacy effects&quot;, should reduce DM complications and costs, particularly in high-risk groups&#xD;
      - with potential benefit to individuals, health care systems, and society.&#xD;
