           carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of SI-B001 monotherapy RP2D in phase I clinical&#xD;
           treatment of recurrent and metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
           (non-nasopharyngeal carcinoma).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2) Secondary purpose&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the immunogenicity of SI-B001. 3) Exploratory purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Explore biomarkers that predict efficacy, such as protein expression and/or gene&#xD;

    <description>SI-B001 was administered weekly by intravenous infusion（QW）. The 4-week cycle was maintained until disease progression or cessation due to intolerable toxicity or other reasons (e.g., withdrawal of informed consent or death). From C1D1, efficacy was evaluated every 8 weeks ±7 days in the first year and every 12 weeks ±7 days in the second year.</description>
