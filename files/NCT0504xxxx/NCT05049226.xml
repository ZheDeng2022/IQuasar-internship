      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, observer-blind Phase 2 study. A total of 1320&#xD;
      participants will be divided into 2 groups (660 each) receiving either full dose or half dose&#xD;
      of either AZ or PF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group is further stratified into 3 subgroups according to three interval duration in&#xD;
      term of days after second dose of SV for 60 to less than 90 days, 90 to less than120 days and&#xD;
      120 to 180 days. Each group will be randomized to receive either AZ or PF in 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to receive either full&#xD;
      dose or half dose of AZ or PF in 1:1 ratio as an IM injection in the deltoid muscle at Visit&#xD;
      1 (V1). Subjects will be follow-up for assessing immunity at day 28 (V3), day 60 (V4) and day&#xD;
      90 (V5) and for safety at day 7 (V2), day 28 (V3), day 60 (V4) and day 90 (V5). At least 50%&#xD;
      from each subgroup will be randomly selected to provide additional blood at baseline (V1, day&#xD;
      0) and day 28 (V3) to be used for assessment of T-cell-mediated immunity (CMI)&#xD;

      This study has been designed to assess immune response and safety of third dose vaccination&#xD;
      with AstraZeneca ChAdOx1AZD1222 vaccine or Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine among Thai&#xD;
      subjects who have received two doses of Sinovac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The types of vaccines provided by the government included 7.7 million doses of inactivated&#xD;
      vaccine manufactured by Sinovac and 6.5 million doses of AstraZeneca ChAdOx1 AZD1222 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the limited supplies of COVID vaccines in many regions of the world especially in LMIC&#xD;
      including Thailand and the evidences of waning immunity of especially inactivated vaccine&#xD;
      have raised the concerns whether third dose is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third dose that available now in Thailand are AstraZeneca ChAdOx1AZD1222 vaccine (AZ)/&#xD;
      Pfizer/BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine (PF) and whether this can be provided with half dose so that&#xD;
      the vaccination coverage is going to be higher in spite of limited vaccine supplies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A number of studies have proved that COVID-19 vaccines are effective at preventing people&#xD;
      from getting severe COVID-19 disease. However, the vaccines do not only reduce the chance of&#xD;
      infection, but they also help to mitigate disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Male and female adults aged equal or more than 20 years who received two&#xD;
      doses of Inactivated COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinovac (given at 21-28 days apart) at&#xD;
      different intervals of 60 to less than 90 days, 90 to less than120 days and 120 to 180 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, multi-center, randomized, observer-blind Phase 2 study, A total of 1320&#xD;
      participants will be divided into 2 groups (660 each) receiving either full dose or half dose&#xD;
      of either AZ or PF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group is further stratified into 3 subgroups according to three interval duration in&#xD;
      term of days after second dose of SV for 60-less than 90 days, 90-less than120 days and&#xD;
      120-180 days respectively. Subjects who fulfilled eligibility criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either full dose or half dose of AZ or PF in 1:1 ratio as an IM injection&#xD;
      in the deltoid muscle at Visit 1 (V1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be randomized based on dose given either full dose or half dose and&#xD;
      further stratify accordingly by Interactive web-based response system (IWRS). There will be&#xD;
      unblinded team which consists of pharmacist and nurse who will give injection. All the safety&#xD;
      assessment will be performed independently by clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be follow-up for assessing immunity at day 28 (V3), day 60 (V4) and day 90 (V5)&#xD;
      and for safety at day 7 (V2), day 28 (V3), day 60 (V4) and day 90 (V5).&#xD;

These personnel will not participate in the other aspects of the clinical trial, to help ensure the integrity of the blind at the site. Unblinded staff will retrieve a participant's randomization assignment after being informed by the PI or designee that a participant is eligible for randomization. They will prepare study vaccine (AZ or PF) with dose (full or half dose) based on the participant's randomization</masking_description>
