  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an interventional, open-label, single center, pilot study with historical controls to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of letermovir (LET) for the prevention of CMV infection and disease in&#xD;
      adult lung transplant recipients (LTRs) with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 30 patients with IPF listed for lung transplantation will be enrolled and 15&#xD;
      are expected to undergo lung transplantation during the study period and receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Patients who are CMV seropositive will receive letermovir for 6 months,&#xD;
      patients who are CMV seronegative and receive lungs from a CMV seropositive donor (CMV D+/R-)&#xD;
      will receive letermovir for 12 months. All patients will be followed for 12 weeks after&#xD;
      completion of letermovir for the occurrence of CMV infection or disease after prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historical controls will be LTRs for IPF from 2010-2019 who are CMV R+ or CMV D+/R- (donor&#xD;
      positive/recipient negative). CMV prophylaxis in the historical controls was with&#xD;
      valganciclovir for 6 months for CMV R+ and for 12 months for CMV D+/R-. Patients will be&#xD;
      matched for CMV serostatus, induction immunosuppression, age, and telomere length.&#xD;

If letermovir is co-administered with cyclosporine A, the dosage of letermovir will be decreased to 240 mg once daily.</description>

    <description>Participants who are CMV R+ will receive LET prophylaxis for 6 months, and participants who are CMV D+/R- will receive LET prophylaxis for 12 months. The duration of prophylaxis is per current standard of care. LET will be administered at a dose of 480 mg IV or oral once daily. IV administration will occur only for those patients unable to swallow tablets. If LET is co-administered with cyclosporin A (CsA), the dosage of LET should be decreased to 240 mg once daily. All patients will be followed for 12 weeks after completion of LET for the occurrence of CMV infection or disease after prophylaxis. Participants on this protocol will receive acyclovir 400 mg orally BID for the duration of LET therapy for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus prophylaxis.</description>
