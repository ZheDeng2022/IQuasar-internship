  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Taiwan, 183,254 newborns were born in 2018, with preterm births accounting for about&#xD;
      8-10%. The preterm infant required frequent medical treatment from birth to hospital&#xD;
      discharge, which is accompanied by a painful process that can cause unstable vital signs in&#xD;
      the short term and may affect their biological and psychological development in the long&#xD;
      term. Music therapy is a non-invasive and easily accessible intervention, can be used to&#xD;
      reduce the discomfort of painful stimulation during hospitalization of preterm infants. Music&#xD;
      therapies in this text are the mother's voice and lullabies.&#xD;

      This study was a quantitative study of a randomized controlled trial, designed by&#xD;
      experimental research method, and followed the principle of Allocation Concealment to conduct&#xD;
      a randomized assignment trial. Using G*Power 3.1 to estimate the number of samples, and the&#xD;
      statistical method chosen was Repeated measures ANOVA, the sample size is 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects were divided into four groups, all four groups were administered general routine&#xD;
      care, three experimental groups, and one control group, and the experimental group was a&#xD;
      repetitive segment of audio recording edited to 13 minutes. There were three interventions:&#xD;
      group A maternal voice reading children's books, group B lullaby, group C maternal voice&#xD;
      reading children's books combined with lullaby, and the control group was the routine care&#xD;
      group without any audio intervention. Physiological indicators, including heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and pain response assessed using the Neonatal Infant&#xD;
      Pain Scale (NIPS), were recorded 3 minutes before, during, 1st, 3rd, and 10 minutes after&#xD;
      heel lance puncture.&#xD;

For infants in the &quot;maternal voice group,&quot; mothers were recorded what they wanted to say to their baby and read an independently published children's book, &quot;Xiao Qi's yellow persimmon&quot; which describes how mothers with premature babies care for their infants. After reviewing the quality of the recordings, the maternal voice recordings were edited for 13 minutes using a sound organizer. Respiration, heart rate, oxygen saturation, and Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) were measured and recorded 3 minutes before, during, 1 minute, 3 minutes, and 10 minutes after the puncture.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Babies born alive before 37 weeks of pregnancy, and in the case of twins, the body&#xD;
             weight heavier babies will be the first to be admitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infants who were required to receive heel lance procedure every 8 hours after&#xD;
             physicians' diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those who can record the mother's voice and whose mother can read Chinese.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Abnormal ear appearance, chromosomal abnormalities, congenital or acquired infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Postnatal patients whose mothers are not in the postnatal ward, e.g., those who need&#xD;
             to be admitted to the intensive care unit due to their medical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients used high-frequency oscillatory ventilators, because the high-frequency&#xD;
             oscillatory ventilator gives 600 oscillatory breaths per minute and it is not possible&#xD;
             to evaluate whether the study subjects can effectively listen to the interventions&#xD;
             given, so they were excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Mothers who were unable to complete the recording because of emotional ups and downs&#xD;
             during the recording process.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Mothers who smoked, drank alcohol or used illegal drugs during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. the patients was diagnosed with Asphyxia of the newborn at birth&#xD;
&#xD;
