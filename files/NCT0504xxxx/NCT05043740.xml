      The study is an open-label, multicenter, and randomized study. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to demonstrate the effect of PCSK9 inhibitor on ACS patients with multivessel disease and&#xD;
      relatively low LDL-C levels or LDL-C levels lower than the recommended target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the rate of major adverse cardiac events (CV death, non-fatal&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina that requires admission into a hospital,&#xD;
      all coronary revascularization with either PCI or CABG occurring at least 30 days after&#xD;
      randomization, Non-fatal stroke) at 1 year. The secondary efficacy endpoints were individual&#xD;
      components of the major adverse cardiac events, all cause death, and the percent change in&#xD;
      LDL-C, Apo B, HDL-C, Lp(a) after treatment.&#xD;
