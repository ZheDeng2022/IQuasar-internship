  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry immersion (DI) is a ground-based model of prolonged conditions of simulated microgravity.&#xD;
      Dry immersion involves immersing the subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof&#xD;
      fabric. As a result, the immersed subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains&#xD;
      dry. Within a relatively short duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most&#xD;
      physiological effects of actual microgravity, including centralization of body fluids,&#xD;
      support unloading, and hypokinesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the physiological changes induced by 5 days of dry&#xD;
      immersion in the female organism. The main physiological systems will be explored before,&#xD;
      during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific tests and&#xD;
      measurements. The results will be analyzed by scientists specializing in each field in order&#xD;
      to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare its effects with those of the&#xD;
      bedrest model and those of spaceflight. The clinical (adverse effects, comfort of subjects)&#xD;
      and operational aspects are also part of the secondary objectives of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The space agencies are actively engaged in studying the physiological adaptation to space&#xD;
      environment through studies on board the International Space Station (ISS) but also on the&#xD;
      ground. Ground-based experiments simulating the effects of weightlessness are used to better&#xD;
      understand the mechanisms of physiological adaptation, design and validate the&#xD;
      countermeasures. Dry immersion (DI) is a ground-based model of prolonged conditions of&#xD;
      simulated microgravity, which has been mainly used in Russia. The past years however, the&#xD;
      model has been implemented as well in Europe and expertise in conducting DI studies has been&#xD;
      gained in particular in France where a few DI studies have been conducted in the MEDES Space&#xD;
      Clinic in Toulouse for CNES (French Space Agency). Dry immersion involves immersing the&#xD;
      subject in water covered with an elastic waterproof fabric. As a result, the immersed&#xD;
      subject, who is freely suspended in the water mass, remains dry. Within a relatively short&#xD;
      duration, the model can faithfully reproduce most physiological effects of actual&#xD;
      microgravity, including centralization of body fluids, support unloading, and hypokinesia.&#xD;
      Furthermore, physiological changes have been reported in the neuromuscular, skeletal and&#xD;
      sensorimotor systems, in fluid electrolyte regulation, in the cardiovascular system,&#xD;
      metabolism, blood and immunity, respiration, and thermoregulation. Dry immersion provides a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to study the physiological effects of the lack of a supporting structure&#xD;
      for the body (a phenomenon called 'supportlessness'). As such, dry immersion is proposed to&#xD;
      mimic actual spaceflight in terms of the monotonous environment, posture-motion limitations,&#xD;
      hemodynamic changes and hypokinetic effects, support unloading, and decreased proprioceptive&#xD;
      input. Immersion studies have so far only been conducted in men and a minority of studies&#xD;
      using the bedrest model have included women. Likewise, few studies conducted to date have&#xD;
      investigated gender differences in the astronaut population. The small number of female&#xD;
      astronauts may be part of the reason why scientific data are lacking to draw valid&#xD;
      conclusions about possible gender differences. However, if women currently constitute only&#xD;
      about 10% of astronauts, women are and will be more and more represented in crews. Women now&#xD;
      constitute 30% of American crews and NASA (US space agency) has announced gender parity for&#xD;
      crews on future lunar missions. It is therefore essential to study the physiological changes&#xD;
      induced by weightlessness in women, to compare them with those observed in men and to develop&#xD;
      efficient countermeasures for preventing them. The main physiological systems will be&#xD;
      explored before, during and after the 5 days of immersion through a battery of specific&#xD;
      standardized tests and measurements. The objective of the study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      physiological changes induced by 5 days of dry immersion in the female organism. The study&#xD;
      conditions such as patient recruitment, nutrition, data collection, data management,&#xD;
      reporting for adverse events are standardized. The results will be analyzed by scientists&#xD;
      specializing in each field in order to better understand the dry immersion model, to compare&#xD;
      its effects with those of the bedrest model and those of spaceflight. The clinical (adverse&#xD;
      effects, comfort of subjects) and operational aspects are also part of the secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty healthy female subjects will participate in the study. There is no published data on&#xD;
      dry immersion with female participation to help calculation the sample size. Moreover, female&#xD;
      spaceflight and bedrest data are scarce, and do not provide any insight into inter-individual&#xD;
      variability. This prolonged DI protocol in women is conceived as a pilot, descriptive,&#xD;
      explorative study, as well as an operational and methodological study. Power-based&#xD;
      calculation of the number of subjects is not directly applicable for such explorative&#xD;
      studies. However, based on effect sizes obtained with previous DI studies in men, a total of&#xD;
      20 subjects was deemed necessary for this study.&#xD;
