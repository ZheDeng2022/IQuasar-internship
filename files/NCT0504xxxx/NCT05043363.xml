  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The LumenEye scope and CHiP platform will be piloted in a number of clinical settings&#xD;
      including remote colorectal clinics. The rationale is to perform an initial pilot study to&#xD;
      determine the clinical utility of the LumenEye device for use in primary and secondary care&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypothesis is that digital rectoscopy is safe and acceptable to clinicians including&#xD;
      general practitioners and can significantly reduce the burden of endoscopy referral to and&#xD;
      within secondary care centres.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All clinicians performing investigations with the LumenEye will undergo training and quality&#xD;
      assurance assessment. The first 5 procedures will be performed with a proctor to ensure that&#xD;
      this is performed safely using appropriate PPE according to Public Health England&#xD;
      Recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study site will be based at Imperial College NHS trust which is a recognized&#xD;
      National Bowel Cancer Screening (NBCS) Centre of excellence. The Imperial endoscopy suite&#xD;
      performs over 10,000 endoscopic procedures each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled into the study will be asked to have a glycerine suppository prior to&#xD;
      the examination. They will be examined by the primary care physician in the clinic as per a&#xD;
      standard rigid sigmoidoscopy assessment. Physicians may take biopsies if required but only if&#xD;
      the physician feels this is warranted for clinical use. There is no requirement for research&#xD;
      specimens in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All doctors using the LumenEye will asked to record images showing standard anatomical&#xD;
      locations including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The rectosigmoid junction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Each rectal haustral fold&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Exit from the rectum. Videos will also be recorded for any pathology identified. Virtual&#xD;
           clinics will be coordinated by the CI and Co-Is. During these clinics, a secondary care&#xD;
           physician or surgeon will be available to discuss the case with the GP. These could be&#xD;
           performed in real time with the patient present during a live examination or they could&#xD;
           be performed retrospectively as part of a multidisciplinary team meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will be asked to provide qualitative feedback data with each use concerning device&#xD;
      performance. This will be in the form of a short questionnaire, split into technical&#xD;
      performance, views achieved, diagnostic yield, quality of the telemedicine interaction,&#xD;
      patient outcome (discharged or referred to formal endoscopy) and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient feedback will be requested through a validated questionnaire.. All clinicians&#xD;
      providing advice and guidance via CHiP will be asked to provide data on the quality of the&#xD;
      views, the stability of the platform and to provide information on the diagnosis. All data&#xD;
      pertaining to follow up colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy will be used as a comparator&#xD;
      group for a diagnostic sensitivity / specificity analysis.&#xD;
