      While regular exercise is known to prevent cardiovascular disorders, exercise might also&#xD;
      trigger acute cardiac events such as cardiac arrest. This study examines the incidence,&#xD;
      prognosis and outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) related to exercise in the&#xD;
      general population of Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective cohort study examins all OHCAs in the Danish Cardiac Arrest Registry from&#xD;
      2016 to 2019 in Denmark. OHCA related to exercise were identified in the nationwide&#xD;
      electronic database and coupled to the patient register. OHCA related to exercise was defined&#xD;
      as occurring during or up to one hour after exercise of moderate or vigorous intensity.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics are used together with an adjusted multivariate logistic regression&#xD;
      model to assess predefined factors of interest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Danish Emergency Medical System (EMS) introduced a nationwide registry of electronic&#xD;
      medical reports in 2016.(1) This report system allows electronic searches and thereby the&#xD;
      opportunity to identify subgroups of out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA). Thus, this novel&#xD;
      reporting enables the possibility to investigate new characteristics in OHCA related to&#xD;
      exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise and physical activity have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease,&#xD;
      in spite of this, exercise can be related to a transient increased risk of cardiac events&#xD;
      including sudden cardiac arrest.(2) Literature have reported low annual incidences of OHCA&#xD;
      related to exercise between 0.48 - 2.1 per 100.000 person-years. (3-7) With the proportion of&#xD;
      OHCA related to exercise of 0.3 - 7 % of all OHCA's (4,8,9). No standardized definition of&#xD;
      timeframe concerning OHCA related to exercise is established, but throughout the literature&#xD;
      onset of symptoms is defined to be during or up to one hour after exercise(4,5,10,11).&#xD;
      Overall survival rates among previous studies varies from 11 - 46.2 % (6,12), a 30-day&#xD;
      survival rate between 5.5 - 58 % (8,13) and a survival to discharge between 15.7 - 77 %&#xD;
      (4,5,9,10,14). Yet, data is assessed in different countries with different health care&#xD;
      systems, in different subgroups of age and lastly throughout different periods of time. This&#xD;
      suggests further investigations and cohesion to standardized reporting, advocating for the&#xD;
      Utstein Reporting Template. (15) Despite conflicting results regarding survival, there is&#xD;
      consensus that exercise related OHCA has a better prognosis compared to OHCA not related to&#xD;
      exercise. (4-6,8-10,16,17) Another consistent finding is younger age among patients suffering&#xD;
      from OHCA related to exercise compared to other OHCA's. (5,6,9,10,17)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The etiology is often classified as either of (presumed) cardiac etiology or of non-cardiac&#xD;
      etiology. (15) The Utstein Model suggests a method of which the pathogenesis is categorized&#xD;
      under either medical (presumed cardiac or unknown or other medical i.e., gastro-intestinal&#xD;
      bleed, anaphylaxis etc.) or traumatic cause, drug overdose, drowning, electrocution or&#xD;
      asphyxia (external). If more than one cause is potential, the most likely should be&#xD;
      noted.(18) In addition, it is suggested, that OHCA related to exercise often is caused by a&#xD;
      presumed cardiac etiology. (4,5,7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding and enhanced knowledge of the epidemiology of OHCA during exercise,&#xD;
      could be useful for appropriate handling of these situations, thus this study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report the national incidence of exercise related OHCA's among cases attended by the&#xD;
           Danish Medical Emergency System (EMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess survival defined as return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and 30-day&#xD;
           survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finally, to evaluate aspects associated with better outcome including localization,&#xD;
           observation of occurrence, bystander CPR, initial rhythm, use of defibrillator and&#xD;
           patient demographics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods This registry-based follow-up study includes data from patients in The&#xD;
      Danish Medical Service electronical registry over a 4-year period from 2016-2019 with OHCA&#xD;
      related to exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Data on OHCA's with attempted resuscitation in Denmark have been collected in the&#xD;
      electronic based Danish Medical Service reporting system since 2016. The registry covers&#xD;
      detailed data including the EMS report. The data consists of executive entries and advanced&#xD;
      text searches of prehospital charts in conjunction, augmenting the identification and&#xD;
      collecting all OHCA's in Denmark. All cases have been through an elaborate validation process&#xD;
      of which all identified events were read through manually. This was conducted by an external&#xD;
      verification team to corroborate high quality of data throughout the approximately 5200 cases&#xD;
      of OHCA in Denmark annually. Within this practice of verification, supplementary sources of&#xD;
      data have been linked to each individual case of OHCA; information of certain interest was&#xD;
      survival, localization, initiation of bystander CPR and actions from EMS personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of OHCA related to exercise This study evaluates OHCA related to exercise. All&#xD;
      cases of OHCA were assessed and coupled to the electronic prehospital medical record, which,&#xD;
      in context, facilitates advanced text searching in the complete electronic prehospital&#xD;
      medical reporting system. Hence did the external validation team mark all charts consisting&#xD;
      information about localization and type of exercise. All case descriptions in the prehospital&#xD;
      medical records of OHCA occurring at sporting facilities were reviewed. Regarding events&#xD;
      outside a sporting facility following terms were marked: Cases were categorized and&#xD;
      afterwards classified in 6 subgroups; Team sports (Soccer, Handball, Volleyball, Tennis and&#xD;
      Badminton), Fitness (Gymnastics, Aerobic, Cross Fit, Weight Lifting, Strength Training,&#xD;
      Dancing, Yoga, Pilates, Athletics), Running/Jogging (Marathon, Ironman, Triathlon, Running,&#xD;
      Jogging, Power walking, Roller-skating), Cycling (Cycling, Mountain Biking, Spinning), Water&#xD;
      Sports (Swimming, Sailing, Surfing, Kitesurfing, Rowing, Kayaking) and lastly Miscellaneous&#xD;
      (Bowling, Hunting, Golf, Equestrian sports) and their derivatives. (19,20) Furthermore time&#xD;
      of onset of symptoms were marked in relation to the activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of presumed causes Three individual raters will go through data to&#xD;
      independently identify presumed causes of OHCA related to exercise. This evaluation will&#xD;
      categorize cases as either presumed reversible or presumed non-reversible. Cases will be&#xD;
      assessed based on the Utstein model regarding etiology. Including presumed cardiac or unknown&#xD;
      or other medical, or traumatic cause, drug overdose, drowning, electrocution or asphyxia&#xD;
      (external) etiology supported by a free-text description. Any discrepancy or ambiguity will&#xD;
      be undertaken by third party members. Cases with lack of valuable information concerning&#xD;
      cause or if several conflicting causalities is present will be labelled as &quot;NA&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;Inconclusive&quot; respectively. Contingent on an obviously causality between chronical disease&#xD;
      and the presentation of the case and no plausible reversible causes, the case will be&#xD;
      labelled non-reversible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables included&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age: Age will be defined as the subject age at the time of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender: Gender will be stated as either male, female or undetermined derived from&#xD;
           personal identification numbers. Gender will be characterized based on EMS-charts, in&#xD;
           those cases without an identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial rhythm: The initial rhythm will be defined as the first rhythm observed by EMS&#xD;
           personnel, and categorized as either shockable, non-shockable (asystole), non-shockable&#xD;
           (other) or undetermined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etiology of cardiac arrest: Presumed causes will be stated as either presumed cardiac,&#xD;
           other medical cause, trauma, drug overdose, drowning, electrocution or hypoxemia&#xD;
           (external).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Location of Incidence: Location will be characterized as either; sport facilities, gym,&#xD;
           residential area, outdoors and nature, private home or other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observation of occurrence: Cardiac arrests will be defined as either unwitnessed,&#xD;
           bystander witnessed or EMS-witnessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardio-pulmonary-resuscitation (CPR): CPR will include bystander-initiated CPR and EMS&#xD;
           treatment with CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Defibrillation and use automatic external defibrillators (AEDs): Defibrillation will&#xD;
           include defibrillation by bystanders and/or EMS personnel. Use of AED's includes using&#xD;
           the device also in the case it did not deliver shocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EMS-response time: This will be defined as the time between a dispatcher receiving the&#xD;
           emergency call and the arrival of the first EMS-personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospitalization: Hospitalization will be considered as either; transported to hospital&#xD;
           or declared dead by EMS-personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Return-of-spontaneous-circulation (ROSC): ROSC will be classified as the achievement of&#xD;
           ROSC anytime between recognition of the event and termination (defined as either&#xD;
           hospital admission or declaration of death by EMS-personnel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  State at hospital admission: State of the case upon arrival at the hospital will be&#xD;
           defined as either ROSC or ongoing CPR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survival: Survival will be defined as ROSC at the time of hospital admission,&#xD;
           additionally 30-day survival will be included, this derived from data from the National&#xD;
           Patient Registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis All data will be pseudo-anonymized, and all analyses will be accomplished on an&#xD;
      aggregated nationwide level. Data is collected using the STrengthening the Reporting of&#xD;
      OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement. The objective of this study is to&#xD;
      clarify etiology, descriptive data and prehospital interventions of OHCA's related to&#xD;
      exercise. Secondary an update of the annual incidence and survival rate is carried out.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics includes the above-mentioned variables labelled with absolute numbers&#xD;
      and percentages. Comparative analyses will be carried out using non-parametric testing to&#xD;
      examine subgroups. Forward logistic regression analysis will be performed for multivariate&#xD;
      analysis. Odds ratio for survival will be calculated stratified by etiology, localization,&#xD;
      bystander and EMS-actions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data storage Data is stored on secure drive according to the regional instructions for safe&#xD;
      conduct of data management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations GDPR will be followed according to danish law and the study is&#xD;
      registered and approved at the Danish Data Protection Agency, capital region of Denmark&#xD;
      (reference 2007-58-0015, GEH-2014-019, I-suite 02737). Since it is a registry-based study, no&#xD;
      ethical approval is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives This study provides novel information regarding OHCA related to exercise; the&#xD;
      descriptive statistics provides relevant data based on a reviewed, high-quality database.&#xD;
      Furthermore, throughout analyses, a better understanding of the preceding circumstances and&#xD;
      etiology might contribute to improve handling this type of arrests. This, eventually through&#xD;
      the use of campaigns targeted laypersons and healthcare personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication The final results are targeted for publication in an international peer reviewed&#xD;
      journal. Participation as coauthors will be decided according to the Vancouver criteria or&#xD;
      acknowledged for providing access to data. All Danish regional EMS regions will receive this&#xD;
      manuscript prior to publication for eventual comments.&#xD;
