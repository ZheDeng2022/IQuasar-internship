      Introduction Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN1 (low grade), CIN2 (moderate grade), CIN3&#xD;
      (severe grade) defines cervical precancer lesions derived from the squamous epithelial cell&#xD;
      line. CIN2, represents a heterogenic phenotype expression of both CIN1-like and CIN3-like&#xD;
      evolving lesions with different risk of progression. The CIN2 diagnosis has low&#xD;
      reproducibility, and current diagnostic tools do not allow for risk-stratification of CIN2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk-profiling is important, to enable targeted management of women with CIN2 at first&#xD;
      incidence (surgery or active surveillance) and to avoid risk of over- or undertreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary studies show, that the novel tissue biomarker HPV E4 has potential to&#xD;
      discriminate CIN1-like (HPV E4 positive) from CIN3-like (HPV E4 negative) evolving CIN2&#xD;
      lesions, suggesting that the biomarker could be vauable for risk-stratification of CIN2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To examine the potential of the HPV E4 biomarker in predicting risk of CIN2 evolvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Design: Historical cohort study. Study population: N=500 women, 23-40&#xD;
      years of age with a record of incidental CIN2 diagnosis between [2000-2010] in the Danish&#xD;
      Pathology Data Bank at Aarhus University Hospital, Region of Central Denmark. All women are&#xD;
      defined as managed by active surveillance (i.e. no surgical treatment within 4 months after&#xD;
      first CIN2 diagnosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure: HPV E4 positive vs HPV E4 negative intraepithelial reaction. Outcome: Regression&#xD;
      (normal, CIN1) vs non-regression (CIN2, CIN3, cervical cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical model: Linear regression model (RR (95%CI)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives: HPV E4 may act as significant predictor for CIN2 evolvement, and reliable&#xD;
      marker for risk-assessment of CIN2. This will be valuable in the clinical management of women&#xD;
      with CIN2, enabling to discriminate women, who would most likely regress and could be manged&#xD;
      by active surveillance vs women in risk of progression or persistence, who could benefit of&#xD;
      immediate surgical treatment.&#xD;

      Introduction Persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) is a causative&#xD;
      source of cervical cancer [1]. Cervical intraepitehelial neoplasia CIN1 (low), CIN2&#xD;
      (moderate), CIN3 (severe) defines cervical precancer lesions evolved from the squamous&#xD;
      epithelium cell line [3]. CIN1 and CIN2 lesions are associated with lower progression rates&#xD;
      for cervical cancer than CIN3 [4]. CIN2 poses a major challenge clinically, due to the&#xD;
      heterogenic expression of both CIN1-like and CIN3-like evolving lesions, which current&#xD;
      diagnostic tools do not enable to stratify in risk of progression [5]. Risk-stratification of&#xD;
      CIN2 is highly important for clinical management of CIN2 and to avoid risk of over- or&#xD;
      undertreatment. Historically, CIN2 has been the threshold for surgical mangement (cone&#xD;
      excisional biopsy). However, since regressions rates of CIN2 lesions are high, and cone&#xD;
      excisional biopy is associated with reproductive harm, such as preterm birth, many countries&#xD;
      such as Denmark has adopted a more conservative approach in the management of young women&#xD;
      with CIN2 (i.e. active surveillance: colposcopy, cervical punch biopsies for every 4-6 monhts&#xD;
      up to two years follow-up without any surgical procedure) [6,7]. In the Central Region of&#xD;
      Denmark, active surveillance has been recommended for young women since 1995.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The p16 protein plays an important role as inhibitor in cellular regulation and&#xD;
      differentiation. p16 is a common surrogat marker for hrHPV E6/E7 oncogenic activity and&#xD;
      cellular transformation associated with cancer evolvement. The intrapeithelial expression&#xD;
      level of p16 is positively associated with grade of CIN lesion, and may be detected by the&#xD;
      p16INK4a immuno-histo-chemical biomarker [7, 8]. Although, the p16INK4a biomarker has added&#xD;
      value to diagnostics and grading of cervical precancer lesions, the biomarker is not robust&#xD;
      for risk-stratification of CIN2 [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies show, that the novel biomarker HPV E4 may potentially distinguish CIN2 in&#xD;
      CIN1-like vs CIN3-like resembling lesions. Suggesting that HPV E4 could be a potential&#xD;
      biomarker for risk-stratification of CIN2 [10-12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, knowledge is lacking on HPV E4 as predictor for CIN2 evolvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim To explore whether the HPV E4 biomarker can predict risk of CIN2 evolvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods Study design: Historical cohort study. Study population: N=500 women&#xD;
      23-40 years of age, with a record of CIN2 in the Danish Patological Data Bank [2000-2010], at&#xD;
      the Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital. All women are defined as managed by&#xD;
      active surveillance (i.e. colposcopy and cervical punch biopsies for every 4-6 months up to&#xD;
      two years follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection: Eligible women with a record of incidental CIN2 diagnosis will be identified in&#xD;
      the Danish Pathology Databank among all women with a record of CIN2 diagnosis during&#xD;
      2000-2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory analysis: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples will be compiled&#xD;
      from the archives, at the Department of Pathology, Aarhus University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FFPE blocks will be sectioned for morphology analysis (hematoxylin &amp; eosin (H&amp;E) and for&#xD;
      immuno-histo-chemistry analysis (IHC). We will apply the sandwich technique for the p16INK4a&#xD;
      and HPV E4 IHC analysis, using the CINtec® Histology Kit (Roche) and the SILgrade E4 assay&#xD;
      (LBP). Subsequently, the stained slides will be evaluated by an expert panel within&#xD;
      gynecological pathology (2 from Denmark, 1 from UK and 1 from the US respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure will be defined as expressing a HPV E4 positive (CIN1-like) vs HPV E4 negative&#xD;
      (CIN3-like) intraepithelial reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Linear regression model, effect measure; relative risk (RR) (95% CI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations: At a sample size of N=500 women, a statistical power of 89% is expected,&#xD;
      at the significance level 0.05 (alpha). Among women who progress or persist during&#xD;
      surveillance, a prevalence of 50% CIN2 HPV E4 positive lesions and 70% p16INK4a positive CIN2&#xD;
      lesions is expected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings and collaborators The project will be carried out at the Department of Gynecology&#xD;
      and Obstetrics at Gødstrup Hospital in close collaboration with the Department of Pathology,&#xD;
      Aarhus University Hospital including DDL Diagnostic Laboratory; University of Virginia;&#xD;
      University of Cambridge and University of Maryland School of Medicine.&#xD;

      University as required by Danish law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives Biomarkers reliable for risk-stratification of CIN2 lesions is important for&#xD;
      clinical counseling of women, this will enable a more specific and personalized follow-up&#xD;
      strategy to avoid risk of over- or undertreatment. As other countries are moving toward a&#xD;
      more conservative approach (active surveillance) with respect to management of young women&#xD;
      with CIN2 our results may be valauble in an international perspective as well.&#xD;
