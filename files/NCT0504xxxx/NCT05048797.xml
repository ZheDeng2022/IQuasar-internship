  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DESTINY-Lung04 will investigate the efficacy and safety of Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd)&#xD;
      versus Standard of Care (SoC) as first-line treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)&#xD;
      with HER2 Exon 19 or 20 mutations&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be those diagnosed with unresectable, locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic histologically documented non-squamous NSCLC with HER2 exons 19 or 20 mutations&#xD;
      and who are treatment-na√Øve for palliative intent systemic therapy for locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of trastuzumab deruxtecan as&#xD;
      first-line treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) as compared with Standard of Care&#xD;
      treatment (Investigator's choice of cisplatin or carboplatin + pembrolizumab + pemetrexed).&#xD;
      This study aims to see if trastuzumab deruxtecan allows patients to live longer without the&#xD;
      cancer getting worse or simply to live longer, compared to patients receiving standard of&#xD;
      care treatment. This study is also looking to see how the treatment and the cancer affects&#xD;
      patients' quality of life.&#xD;
