  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Identifying multiorgan sequalae and complications through high quality, prospective matched&#xD;
      controlled studies throughout the course of COVID-19 is important for the acute and long-term&#xD;
      management of patients and for health systems' planning. Further, it is key to understand the&#xD;
      link between acute illness and long term consequences particularly in those already living&#xD;
      with other comorbidities such as cardiovascular diseases or cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the clinical presentation of COVID-19 can resemble a variety of common respiratory&#xD;
      infections, describing the distribution of pathogens and the severity of clinical&#xD;
      presentation associated with COVID-like illnesses (CLI) infections is important to generate a&#xD;
      baseline clinical description by comparing potential long-term effects of PCR-confirmed&#xD;
      COVID-19 to those following other respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain a better understanding of the clinical burden on COVID-19 survivors we will undertake&#xD;
      a comparative evaluation within a cohort of PCR-confirmed individuals with COVID-19 vs. those&#xD;
      PCR-confirmed symptomatic individuals with other respiratory pathogens plus healthy&#xD;
      individuals from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will inform strategies to prevent long term consequences; inform clinical&#xD;
      management, interventional research, direct rehabilitation, and inform public health&#xD;
      management to reduce overall morbidity and improve outcomes of COVID-19.&#xD;

      This is an observational prospective matched cohort study to evaluate the post-acute&#xD;
      consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 symptomatic infection (case-positives) while having as&#xD;
      comparison groups (1) symptomatic controls (case-negatives) and (2) healthy controls, that&#xD;
      are healthy individuals recruited from the same community of the cases, but not arise from&#xD;
      the same household. After pre-screening of COVID-19 symptoms at the hospital and other&#xD;
      satellite health centers, consenting/assenting patients of 16 years of age and above with all&#xD;
      range of PCR-confirmed Covid-19 disease severity -from mild to severely ill hospitalized&#xD;
      patients- will be recruited and matched to other Non-SARS-CoV-2 PCR-determined patients and&#xD;
      to healthy community controls. Then, they will be followed up for 12 months (13 months after&#xD;
      screening) to determine the occurrence of admissions, any outpatient encounter, symptoms (new&#xD;
      or persistent) and concomitant use of medication after 28 days of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At recruitment, respiratory samples are collected for respiratory infections diagnosis. Also,&#xD;
      blood samples are collected to generate baseline data on potential biomarkers associated to&#xD;
      occurrence of investigated outcomes. This will include biochemistry (including inflammatory&#xD;
      markers) and hematology as well as SARS-CoV-2 serology (IgG) which will also be taken at the&#xD;
      end of follow up to rule out infection during the course of the follow up. Though, the&#xD;
      serology testing won't be done along each recruitment but in batches during the study period.&#xD;
      Clinical (symptoms and diagnosis), socioeconomic, demographic, household conditions, health&#xD;
      seeking behavior and medical history information will be gathered.&#xD;
