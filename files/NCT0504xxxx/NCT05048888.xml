  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Symphony IL-6 is a device that quantitates human IL-6 by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      (FEIA) from whole-blood specimens. Use of Symphony IL- 6 removes the need for plasma&#xD;
      separation before testing. Symphony IL-6 comprises two components, the Symphony Fluorescence&#xD;
      Immunoanalyzer and the Symphony IL-6 Cartridge. Whole blood is added to the cartridge and&#xD;
      then up to six cartridges can be inserted into the immunoanalyzer. After 20 minutes a readout&#xD;
      and printout are given with a quantitative IL-6 concentration. The used cartridges are fully&#xD;
      enclosed and can be easily disposed of in general hospital bio-waste. Given the nature of&#xD;
      this device and its portability, there is potential for future deployment as a point-of-care&#xD;
      (POC) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to establish a reference range for Symphony IL-6 in a cohort&#xD;
      of apparently healthy individuals.&#xD;

        We will enroll approximately 120 apparently healthy individuals, split approximately&#xD;
        between males and females, and covering an age range from approximately 18 to 85 years of&#xD;
        age at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, or from satellite facilities&#xD;
        associated with the medical center. Subjects must meet all eligibility criteria to be in&#xD;
        enrolled in the study. Whole blood specimens will be prospectively collected and tested&#xD;
        using the Symphony IL-6 system.&#xD;
