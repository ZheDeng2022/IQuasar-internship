      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remibrutinib (LOU064) in&#xD;
      adult Japanese chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) participants inadequately controlled by&#xD;
      second generation H1-antihistamines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 multi-center, open-label, single arm study investigating the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and efficacy of remibrutinib in participants with CSU inadequately controlled by&#xD;
      second generation H1-antihistamines. Inadequate control of CSU by second generation&#xD;
      H1-antihistamines is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The presence of itch and hives for ≥ 6 consecutive weeks prior to screening despite the&#xD;
           use of second generation H1-antihistamines during this time period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) score (range 0-42) ≥ 16, Itch Severity Score (ISS7)&#xD;
           score (range 0-21) ≥ 6 and Hives Severity Score (HSS7) score (range 0-21) ≥ 6 during the&#xD;
           7 days prior to baseline (Day 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three periods, the total study duration is up to 60 weeks: screening&#xD;
      period of up to 4 weeks, open-label treatment period of 52 weeks, and a treatment free&#xD;
      follow-up period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
