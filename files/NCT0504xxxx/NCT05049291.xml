  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning allows people to have their wishes taken into account even in the&#xD;
      advanced stages of the persons' condition and at the end of life when the person may be&#xD;
      unable to communicate. However, a recent review found an absence of high-quality guidelines&#xD;
      for advanced care planning in dementia care. Since few evidence-based resources exist, the&#xD;
      investigators propose a study to generate, refine, and pilot test an education information&#xD;
      sheet designed to promote advanced care planning among families of persons with dementia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To determine the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of an education&#xD;
      information sheet to promote advance care planning among family members of persons with&#xD;
      advanced dementia in long-term services and support facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introducing an education information sheet containing prognosis and outcomes will be&#xD;
      feasible, acceptable, and increase self-efficacy and do-not-hospitalize decision preferences&#xD;
      among family members of persons with advanced dementia.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of Information Sheet among Study Population</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility of the information sheet is defined as the consent rate of family members who are offered enrollment. This will be calculatd as a percent of family members (number of enrolled participants/number of eligible participants offered enrollment)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptibility of Decision Aid Tool</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Acceptability using an adapted tool (https://decisionaid.ohri.ca/eval_accept.html) which measures the ratings of comprehensibility of the information sheet among participants in the intervention group. Responses are reported descriptively in terms of proportions responding positively or negatively on each criteria.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Measures self-confidence or belief in one's abilities in decision making, including shared decision making. Eleven responses are measured on a 0-4 likert scale and a final summed scale is convereted to a 0-100 range (scores are summed, dividied by 11, then multiplied by 25). A score of zero means low self efficiacy and score of 100 means extremely high self efficacy.</description>
