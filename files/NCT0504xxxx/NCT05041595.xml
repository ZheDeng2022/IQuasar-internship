  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to obtain whole blood from subjects with an established diagnosis of&#xD;
      early Borrelisois expressing with EM rash. Whole blood will also be obtained from subjects&#xD;
      without EM rash but with signs and symptoms consistent with suspicion of acute Borreliosis&#xD;
      and under medical examination for Lyme disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, whole blood will be obtained from apparently healthy subjects residing in areas&#xD;
      endemic to Lyme disease and apparently healthy subjects residing in areas non-endemic to Lyme&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whole blood will be collection and transferred to additional tubes for further processing and&#xD;
      aliquotting. Serum and plasma will be harvested and tested, at a later date, in a clinical&#xD;
      performance study with an investigational Lyme assay. This study will be coordinated by the&#xD;
      Sponsor.&#xD;
