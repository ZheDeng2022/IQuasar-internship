  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare visual outcomes, contrast sensitivity, glare occurrence, incidence of posterior&#xD;
      capsule opacification (PCO) and subjective satisfaction in patients implanted with trifocal,&#xD;
      accommodating and monofocal lens in long term period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of cataract surgery is to remove lens opacity and restore vision. Nowadays most of&#xD;
      the patients wanted to be spectacle independent. The desire of visual acuity for all&#xD;
      distances increases the popularity of multifocal and trifocal lenses. As these type of lenses&#xD;
      are mostly based on diffractive structure, there could be occurrence of unwanted optical&#xD;
      phenomena and lower contrast sensitivity. The effort is to produce intraocular lens (IOL)&#xD;
      with good vision for all distances without these unwanted effects. Increasing daily task for&#xD;
      intermediate distance led to the new category of IOLs- EDOF( extended depth of focus) IOLS,&#xD;
      which are based mostly on diffractive profiles too, but should have less optical phenomena&#xD;
      occurrence. To completely remove glare, halo and retain standard good contrast sensitivity&#xD;
      enhance monofocal lenses were invented, mostly based on spherical aberrations, but not&#xD;
      achieving as good intermediate vision as multifocal or EDOF lenses do. Accommodating lenses&#xD;
      should provide better intermediate distance without unwanted optical effects on vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is retro-prospective, comparing 3 different lenses in long-term period. First&#xD;
      group includes patients with trifocal lens allowing patients to see for all distances, second&#xD;
      group includes patients with implanted accommodating lens which allows good distance and&#xD;
      better intermediate distance than monofocal. Third group include patients with standard&#xD;
      monofocal lens. Preoperative data were collected retrospectively and one prospective visit&#xD;
      was scheduled in period 36- 48 months after the surgery. Study is conducted in 2 eye centers-&#xD;
      one in Slovakia Trenčín, one in Prague, Czech Republic. The study was approved by the Ethic&#xD;
      committee of faculty hospital Hradec Kralove (202103 P08). and will enrolled up 40 patients&#xD;
      in each category.&#xD;
