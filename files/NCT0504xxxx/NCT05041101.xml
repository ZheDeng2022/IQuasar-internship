  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial tests the safety and side effects of grapiprant and eribulin and&#xD;
      whether they work to shrink tumors in patients with inflammatory breast cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Grapiprant is an anti-inflammatory drug that&#xD;
      may prevent tumor growth. Eribulin may block tumor cell growth by stopping tumor cell&#xD;
      division. Giving grapiprant and eribulin together may help to control the disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and efficacy of grapiprant and eribulin combination treatment for&#xD;
      the patient with metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (mIBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine objective response rate (ORR), % of the patients who achieve complete&#xD;
      response (CR) or partial response (PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the time to progression (TTP) of the proposed treatment. III. To determine&#xD;
      the duration of response of the proposed treatment. (Phase 2 only) IV. To determine the time&#xD;
      to first response of the proposed treatment. (Phase 2 only) V. To determine progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) of the proposed treatment. VI. To determine the overall survival (OS) of the&#xD;
      proposed treatment. VII. To investigate the predictive biomarker of the proposed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the changes in the tumor microenvironment after the proposed treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive grapiprant orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day 1-21 and eribulin mesylate&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then yearly for up&#xD;
      to 5 years.&#xD;
