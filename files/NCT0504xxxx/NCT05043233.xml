      At present, there are still few observational studies on Graves' disease in China, and there&#xD;
      are few research reports in this regard. In order to further carry out high-quality&#xD;
      observational follow-up research on Graves' disease hyperthyroidism, including establishing&#xD;
      standard diagnosis and treatment procedures, providing data support for the establishment of&#xD;
      research protocols such as sample size and follow-up time estimation, this study was&#xD;
      conducted at Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine. The&#xD;
      endocrinology clinic carried out the registration follow-up study of Graves' disease.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' disease is the main cause of clinically hyperthyroidism, accounting for about 75% to&#xD;
      80%, and it occurs in women of childbearing age. Clinical manifestations include: high&#xD;
      eating, weight loss, sweating, palpitations, emotional excitement and other high metabolism&#xD;
      Syndrome. Some patients may have manifestations such as infiltrating exophthalmos and&#xD;
      pretibial mucinous edema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graves' disease is an organ-specific autoimmune disease characterized by the production of a&#xD;
      specific antibody TRAb against thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR). TRAb can mimic&#xD;
      the role of thyroid stimulating hormone, combined with TSHR, stimulating TRAb can cause&#xD;
      continuous activation of cAMP, resulting in increased production and release of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone. Excessive thyroid hormones in the circulation act on body tissues to cause&#xD;
      hypermetabolism and goiter. The pathogenesis of Graves' disease is currently unclear. The&#xD;
      three major factors of genetics, environment and immunity are involved in the onset of&#xD;
      Graves' disease. There is no doubt that the immune factor is an important factor in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of Graves' disease hyperthyroidism. Studies have shown that CD4+ T cells play an&#xD;
      important role in Graves disease. CD4+ T lymphocytes can accept antigens presented by antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells, secrete cytokines and assist B lymphocytes to differentiate into plasma&#xD;
      cells and produce antibodies. CD4+T accounts for about 40% to 60% of peripheral T cells and&#xD;
      can be differentiated into various T cell subsets such as Th1, Th2, Th17, Th22, Th9 and Treg&#xD;
      cells. Treg cells are regulatory T cells, mainly involved in the negative regulation of&#xD;
      inflammation. Recent researches suggest that the decrease in Treg cell number or loss of&#xD;
      function is related to the pathogenesis of various autoimmune diseases. The investigators'&#xD;
      previous study showed that the proportion of Treg cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cell&#xD;
      of patients with initial Graves' disease was significantly lower than that of healthy&#xD;
      controls, and it was negatively correlated with TRAb levels. At the same time, studies have&#xD;
      shown that in the early stage of Graves' disease, the number of pDC cells as the main antigen&#xD;
      presenting cells has increased. In vitro studies have confirmed that pDC secretes IFN-α to&#xD;
      induce differentiation of naive T cells and interferes with the normal immunosuppression of&#xD;
      Treg cells. Function, induce apoptosis of Treg cells. Therefore, the weakened&#xD;
      immunosuppressive effect of Treg cells also plays a role in the pathogenesis of Graves'&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graves' disease is an autoimmune disease, but the current treatments for Graves' disease:&#xD;
      antithyroid drugs, radioactive 131I, surgery, but there is no treatment method through direct&#xD;
      immune modulation. Surgery and radioactive 131I treatment achieve rapid cure by removing or&#xD;
      damaging the thyroid gland. Surgery is invasive treatment. There are neurovascular injury and&#xD;
      anesthesia complications. Most patients with secondary thyroid dysfunction after radioactive&#xD;
      131I treatment require oral L-T4 for life.Compared with the other two methods, antithyroid&#xD;
      drug treatment has the advantages of non-invasiveness, convenience, and ease of acceptance by&#xD;
      patients, but it has the problems of long treatment duration, low remission rate, and easy&#xD;
      recurrence. It also has the induction of agranulocytosis, liver function damage, and rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are still few observational follow-up studies on Graves' disease in China, and&#xD;
      there are few research reports in this regard.&#xD;

    <description>Graves' disease was diagnosed based on clinical symptoms and laboratory findings. The clinical symptoms included heat intolerance, fatigue, increased appetite, increased sweating, weight loss, muscle weakness, tremors, and diffusely enlarged thyroid glands. The laboratory results included increased serum concentrations of free thyroxine (FT4) and/ or free triiodothyronine (FT3), decreased basal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and TRAb positivity. All participants in this study would be treated with anti-thyroid drugs(MMI: methimazole) according to the 2016 ATA guildline.</description>
