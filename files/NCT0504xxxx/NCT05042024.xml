      The aim of the study was to investigate whether oral administration of L-arginine or&#xD;
      L-ornithine could modulate local representation density and ratio of macrophages in&#xD;
      periodontitis-affected gingiva by using immunohistochemical detection of CD68+ and CD163+&#xD;
      macrophages in biopsies of the gingiva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis tested was that L-arginine and L-ornithine have no influences on CD68+&#xD;
      and CD163+ macrophages densities when supplementing the treatment of periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods. 75 individuals with a diagnosis of generalized periodontitis at stages&#xD;
      II-III and grade B (38 women and 37 men, 51% and 49%, respectively) were included in the&#xD;
      study. Periodontitis was diagnosed by using the criteria of the Classification of Periodontal&#xD;
      and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions 2017. 25 patients received scaling and root planing&#xD;
      only; 25 patients additionally received L-arginine, and 25 - L-ornithine, according to&#xD;
      instructions available in Ukraine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the immunohistochemical study of paraffin-embedded sections, the gingival biopsy was&#xD;
      taken from 5 selected patients per group before treatment and after 1 month. CD68+ (cluster&#xD;
      of differentiation 68 positive) and CD163+ cells served as a morphological equivalent of M1,&#xD;
      M2 macrophages subpopulations, and their densities were calculated per 10000 μm2. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed by adequate power methods.&#xD;

      Study design The present work was the original research study. 75 individuals with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of generalized periodontitis at stages II-III and grade B (38 women and 37 men, 51%&#xD;
      and 49%, respectively) were included in the study. Periodontitis was diagnosed by using the&#xD;
      criteria of the Classification of Periodontal and Peri-Implant Diseases and Conditions 2017.&#xD;
      Stage II of periodontitis was diagnosed in the presence of 3 to 4 mm interdental CAL at the&#xD;
      site of greatest loss, 4 to maximum 5 mm PPD, the radiographic bone loss at the root coronal&#xD;
      third, and no tooth loss due to periodontitis. Stage III was diagnosed in the presence of ≥5&#xD;
      mm interdental CAL, the radiographic bone loss extending to the middle or apical third of the&#xD;
      root, ≤4 teeth loss due to periodontitis. In all cases, periodontitis had a generalized&#xD;
      pattern (&gt;30% of teeth involved) and grade B as patterns of the progression, based on&#xD;
      indirect evidence (radiographic bone loss expressed as a percentage of root length divided by&#xD;
      the age of the subject was from 0.25 to 1.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were grouped by stratified randomization into three groups: the SRP Group (patients&#xD;
      received scaling and root planing as a full-mouth procedure, n=25); the Arg Group (patients&#xD;
      received oral L-arginine aspartate (Yuria-Pharm, Ukraine) at a dose of 1 g t.i.d. for 10 days&#xD;
      after SRP, n=25); and the Orn Group (patients received oral L-ornithine aspartate (Farmak,&#xD;
      Ukraine) at a dose of 3 g t.i.d. for 15 days after SRP, n=25). We used arginine and ornithine&#xD;
      according to instructions for these medicines available for use in Ukraine. During the study,&#xD;
      all patients were on a stable diet, without changing their rations and regiments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, gender and age were recorded, and periodontal parameters such as&#xD;
      periodontal pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL) and bleeding on probing (BoP)&#xD;
      measurements were taken from six periodontal sites on all teeth (except for the third molars)&#xD;
      by a single calibrated examiner using a manual periodontal probe (dental explorer tool&#xD;
      labeled 0106.DT06.CP10, Den Tag, Italy). PPD and CAL were measured to the nearest 1 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were clinically examined before treatment and after 1 month ± 5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of gingival tissue samples For the precise immunohistochemical study, the gingival&#xD;
      biopsy of approximately 3x3 mm was excised under local anesthesia before treatment and 1&#xD;
      month later in 5 selected patients per group. Biopsies were obtained in the same time-points,&#xD;
      from a single site displaying the deepest pocket around suitable dental and periodontal&#xD;
      procedures. Removal of these tissue biopsies did not interfere with the initial treatment&#xD;
      plan or influence upon the expected clinical outcomes. After collection, biopsies were fixed&#xD;
      in a 4% formalin solution for 24 hr of fixation, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunohistochemistry and antibodies Paraffin sections, 2-3 μm in thickness were&#xD;
      deparaffinized and dehydrated. Heat-induced epitope retrieval in citrate buffer, power of&#xD;
      hydrogen (pH) 6, was performed by successive heating the slides in the microwave oven, then&#xD;
      allowed to cool, rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), incubated with blocked reagent,&#xD;
      rinsed, and incubated with mouse monoclonal CD68 antibodies (1:30, clone PG-M1, Diagnostic&#xD;
      BioSystems, The Hague, The Netherlands) or anti-CD163 (1:100, clone 10D6, Diagnostic&#xD;
      BioSystems, The Hague, The Netherlands). Then sections were stained with the 2-steps&#xD;
      Mouse/Rabbit PolyVue Plus™ HRP/DAB Detection System (Diagnostic BioSystems, The Hague, The&#xD;
      Netherlands), and counterstained with Mayer's haemalaun. PBS was used as a negative control,&#xD;
      the lymph node tissue - as a positive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining CD68+ and CD163+ macrophages (Mφs) were estimated&#xD;
      by counting the number of the cells by light microscope ×400 in intensive infiltrative areas,&#xD;
      5 regions from each slice were selected, and all 5 counts were taken for statistics. We&#xD;
      counted immunopositive Mφs in the areas of cell infiltration, since they are directly related&#xD;
      to inflammation. The number of cells per 10 000 μm2 was calculated as immunopositive cell&#xD;
      density. Photos were obtained using the light microscope Axio Lab.A1 (Carl Zeiss, Göttingen,&#xD;
      Germany) (×400).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Small sample size was justified by the expectation of a high effect&#xD;
      size, unknown null distribution, and compensated with adequate power non parametric&#xD;
      statistics. Precise sample size calculation was not performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Means of PPD and CAL were calculated for sites with PD&gt;4mm (affected sites). Statistical&#xD;
      analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 5 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) by&#xD;
      means of descriptive statistics, chi-square test, one-way ANOVA and nonparametric ANOVA tests&#xD;
      for multiple comparisons: Friedman - for dependent variables, Kruskal-Wallis test - for&#xD;
      independent variables, with post-hoc analyzing. For descriptive statistics of cells numbers,&#xD;
      the percentile ranges were also used because of non-normal distributions. The CD68+/CD163+&#xD;
      ratio was assessed by inter-group t-tests comparisons and Spearman correlation checking. P&#xD;
      values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant in all of the analyses.&#xD;
