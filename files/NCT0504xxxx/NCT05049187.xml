  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Early in the covid-19 pandemic, it was unclear whether and how individuals and&#xD;
      populations would develop protective and enduring immunity against SARS-CoV-2, either after&#xD;
      infection or vaccination. It is still not clear what role might immune cellular responses&#xD;
      play in the development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection and what are the implications for&#xD;
      vaccines? As T cells recognise and respond to viral antigens they produce many protective&#xD;
      reactions and effector molecules. One such molecule is the cytokine interferon Î³, secreted by&#xD;
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and their memory cells. This can be measured means of documenting&#xD;
      specific T cell responses to viral antigens. Published studies offered a strong evidence that&#xD;
      T cell immune responses are sustained, even in the face of declining or undetectable&#xD;
      antibodies, implying that some immunity persists. The evidence from new studies, interim&#xD;
      results from phase III vaccine trials, and previous data from phase I and phase II trials&#xD;
      support the notion that memory T cell responses to the vaccines, along with B cell antibody&#xD;
      responses, should provide good and possibly enduring immunity to SARS-Cov-2. We propose to&#xD;
      describe and characterize the humoral, innate and long-term adaptive immune responses and the&#xD;
      neutralization potential generated by COVID-19 vaccination (Covaxin, Covishield) among&#xD;
      healthcare and frontline workers.&#xD;

      Study objectives i. To estimate the neutralizing antibodies titre against SARS CoV-2 by&#xD;
      vaccine type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. To estimate the proportion of vaccine recipients developing effective antibody response&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG, IgM, and total IgE and IgA antibodies pre- and post-COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination on day zero, day 28, month 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 by vaccine type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. To identify and characterize the immune biomarkers for long term innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune response by vaccine type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. To estimate the ratio of immune biomarker levels between pre- and post- COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccination at days 28, month 2, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 by vaccine type&#xD;
