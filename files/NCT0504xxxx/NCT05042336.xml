  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The effectiveness and safety of carmelizumab/lenvatinib combined with TACE in patients with&#xD;
      borderline resectable hepatocellular carcinoma remain unknown. This subject is an open,&#xD;
      single-arm, randomized, single-center, and phase Ib/II study according to simon's two phase&#xD;
      design. In the phase Ib trial, the groups of patients were divided according to the frequency&#xD;
      of camrelizumab: camrelizumab (q3w) plus lenvatinib and TACE group, certolizumab (q2w) plus&#xD;
      lenvatinib and TACE group. In the phase II trial, the enrolled patients received&#xD;
      camrelizumab/lenvatinib combined with TACE treatment (a relatively safer treatment plan based&#xD;
      on phase Ib), and the first imaging efficacy evaluation was performed at 6-8 weeks for&#xD;
      evaluation of surgical resection. If surgical resection is not possible, it is necessary to&#xD;
      evaluate whether to continue TACE treatment. Afterwards, the imaging efficacy evaluation&#xD;
      (RECISTv1.1) will be carried out every 6-8 weeks to evaluate whether to operate and determine&#xD;
      the best operation time. If surgery is possible, choose to continue the treatment with&#xD;
      camrelizumab and/or TACE according to the patient's condition after the operation until the&#xD;
      disease progresses or intolerable toxicity, and the drug should be discontinued up to 2&#xD;
      years. Imaging examinations will be performed every 2-3 months within six months after the&#xD;
      operation, and imaging examinations will be performed every 3-6 months after six months.&#xD;
      Safety is based on physical examination, laboratory examination, drug-related adverse events,&#xD;
      surgery-related adverse events, and serious adverse events. To explore the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of camrelizumab/lenvatinib combined with TACE in patients with borderline resectable&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, and to screen the predictive indicators of the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of the combined regimen.&#xD;
