  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing interventions including improving communication and self-care to improve readmission&#xD;
      of patients undergoing high risk colorectal surgery involving new ileostomy formation has&#xD;
      shown limited results. Our proposal is to deploy a wearable solution that predicts&#xD;
      physiological perturbation with continuous remote patient monitoring and advanced machine&#xD;
      learning algorithms which will be connected to structured, cascading, escalation pathways and&#xD;
      care coordination involving home health nurses, colorectal and ostomy nurses, and colorectal&#xD;
      surgeons, and has the potential to transform surgical management in the post-discharge&#xD;
      period, where patients are the most vulnerable for readmission. This feasibility study will&#xD;
      contribute to the understanding of post-discharge continuous remote monitoring of ileostomy&#xD;
      patients, promote patient self-care, and has the potential of improving patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal surgery is a high-risk surgery that results in significant morbidity, and health&#xD;
      care utilization in the form of readmission. Ileostomy creation is a significant risk factor&#xD;
      in colorectal surgery rehospitalization. Effective continuous remote patient monitoring&#xD;
      (CRPM) can reduce readmissions, but it has only been realized in select heart failure&#xD;
      populations via invasive monitoring. We will focus on colorectal CRPM in the elective, new&#xD;
      ileostomy population through a structured cascading and escalating alert system. In this&#xD;
      feasibility study, we will use a wearable biosensor and collect ambulatory physiological data&#xD;
      that are analyzed by machine learning algorithms, to generate personalized alerts of&#xD;
      physiological perturbation in colorectal surgery patients in the post-discharge period.&#xD;
      Alerts from this algorithm may be cascaded with other patient status data to inform&#xD;
      management by the home health team via a structured protocol built into the electronic health&#xD;
      record (EHR). The escalation pathway will engage home health nurses, colorectal care team&#xD;
      nurses, ostomy nurses, and colorectal surgeons. We will conduct surveys and semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews with patients, and semi-structured interviews with providers, which will be used&#xD;
      to evaluate the perceptions, acceptance, and experience of this CRPM solution.&#xD;
