  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An accurate identification of individuals at ultra-high risk (UHR) based on psychometric&#xD;
      tools to prospectively identify psychosis as early as possible is required for indicated&#xD;
      preventive intervention. The diagnostic comparability of several psychometric tools is&#xD;
      unknown. To address the psychometric comparability of the CAARMS, SIPS and BSABS for subjects&#xD;
      who are the immediate family and three-generation blood kinship of patients with&#xD;
      schizophrenia. To verify the viability and reliability of the three instruments for these&#xD;
      subjects. subjects who all are immediate family and three-generation blood kinship of&#xD;
      patients with schizophreniawere interviewed. All the subjects were assessed for a UHR state&#xD;
      by three psychometric tools including CAARMS, SIPS and BSABS. The psychometric diagnosis&#xD;
      results including at risk of psychosis (UHR+), not at risk of psychosis (UHR-), and&#xD;
      Psychosis. Demographic and clinical characteristics interviewed by these three instruments&#xD;
      were also measured. The inter-rater agreement was assessed for evaluation of the coherence of&#xD;
      the three scales. Transition rates of CAARMS, SIPS and BSABS for UCH+ subjects within 2 years&#xD;
      were also recorded.There is good diagnostic agreement between the CAARMS, SIPS and BSABS&#xD;
      towards identification of UHR subjects who are immediate family and three-generation blood&#xD;
      kinship of patients with schizophrenia. Also, these three instruments are reliable and valid&#xD;
      for assessing and detecting at risk mental states in these subjects.&#xD;
