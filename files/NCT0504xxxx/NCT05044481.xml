    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of the third molars in oral health-related&#xD;
      quality of life, before and after surgical removal using a validated and frequently used in&#xD;
      international investigations instrument (OHIP-14).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study that evaluates the oral health-related quality of life through&#xD;
      the application of the self-administered OHIP-14 before and after the surgical removal of&#xD;
      third molars. The inclusion criteria were adults' patients older than 18 years, referred for&#xD;
      oral surgery. Patients with chronic diseases and acute pericoronitis were excluded. The&#xD;
      assessment was performed at three times: pre-surgical planning 1 day before surgery (T0), 10&#xD;
      days (T1) and 2 - 3 months after surgery (T2)&#xD;

    <measure>changes in oral health related quality of life after orthognathic surgery assessed with Short form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline to 10 days and 2 - 3 months after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Short form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) was applied at 3 times: baseline, one week before surgery (T1), 10 days after surgery (T2) and 2 - 3 months after surgery (T3).&#xD;
A paired t-test was used to assess the mean (SD) changes in patients undergoing orthognathic surgery. The magnitude of the change was evaluated calculating the standardized response mean (SRM).&#xD;
The Short Form Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14) is an instrument for assessment oral health-related quality of life.&#xD;
