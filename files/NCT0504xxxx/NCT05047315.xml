      Stool4TB aims to evaluate an innovative stool-based qPCR diagnostic platform (with the&#xD;
      capacity to become a POC diagnostic tool) in the high TB and HIV burden settings of&#xD;
      Mozambique, Eswatini and Uganda, under the hypothesis that it will narrow the extremely large&#xD;
      TB case detection gap by improving TB confirmation rates in children and people living with&#xD;
      HIV (PLHIV).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among children&#xD;
      and people living with HIV (PLHIV). Despite significant progress in TB diagnostics,&#xD;
      improvement of childhood TB diagnosis continues to be a major challenge and is a key pillar&#xD;
      of the WHO &quot;End TB Strategy&quot;. TB laboratory confirmation is particularly challenging in&#xD;
      children and PLHIV given the difficulty in obtaining sputum samples, and the pauci-bacillary&#xD;
      nature of disease. In consequence, bacteriological confirmation of pulmonary TB in young&#xD;
      children and immunosuppressed PLHIV remains disappointingly low. Inability to&#xD;
      bacteriologically confirm TB, results in both i) under diagnosis which leads to worse&#xD;
      outcomes including increased mortality and ii) over or under diagnosis, and poor resource&#xD;
      allocation. Given the limitations of currently available sputum-based diagnostic tests in&#xD;
      these vulnerable populations, there is a need to develop new tools and identify easy to&#xD;
      collect non-respiratory specimens which, combined, could improve bacteriological&#xD;
      confirmation. Preliminary data suggest that a new platform, an innovative stool&#xD;
      homogenization and DNA isolation method, adds value to existing sputum-based diagnostics by&#xD;
      increasing the rates of bacteriological confirmation, and could also be useful as a&#xD;
      monitoring tool for treatment response. This platform has the potential to be adapted to a&#xD;
      point of care (POC) diagnostic and thus easily implemented in resource-constrained basic&#xD;
      health care centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this project is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the stool&#xD;
      bead-based real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) platform for TB diagnosis in children and PLHIV.&#xD;
      This will be evaluated in the high TB and HIV burden settings of Mozambique, Eswatini and&#xD;
      Uganda, under the hypothesis that it will narrow the large TB case detection gap by improving&#xD;
      TB confirmation rates in children and PLHIV, while proving feasible and acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a stool-based real-time quantitative PCR for detecting&#xD;
      DNA of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB qPCR), compared to a composite reference standard&#xD;
      (sputum and stool Xpert Ultra, sputum culture and urine TB-LAM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the stool-based Mtb qPCR to individual sputum and&#xD;
           stool Xpert Ultra, urine LAM, sputum smear and sputum culture (MGIT) results using a&#xD;
           consensus clinical case definition as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the usefulness of the quantitative stool-based MTB qPCR platform as a tool to&#xD;
           monitor treatment response for children and PLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To create a biorepository of well characterized pediatric samples at each of the study&#xD;
           sites to support the future development and evaluation of novel biomarker research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: This is a prospective diagnostic evaluation study with a nested longitudinal&#xD;
      cohort evaluation. During a 30-month recruitment period, people with presumptive TB will&#xD;
      consecutively enroll being part of two study groups: Children less than 8 years of age,&#xD;
      irrespective of HIV status (N=1295) and adults living with HIV, irrespective of immunological&#xD;
      status (N=650). Sixty extra people will take part as healthy (asymptomatic) controls. After&#xD;
      clinical, radiological and bacteriological evaluation, TB cases will be treated according to&#xD;
      national guidelines. Participants diagnosed with TB will be followed up for 6 months since&#xD;
      treatment initiation in order to assess treatment response and outcomes. A clinical case&#xD;
      definition will be established as a reference standard and defined as any participant in whom&#xD;
      a decision is made to start ATT (TB cases will be classified as confirmed or unconfirmed).&#xD;
      Specifically, children will be classified into 3 distinct pediatric endpoint categories&#xD;
      (confirmed TB, unconfirmed TB and Unlikely TB) based on bacteriological, radiological and&#xD;
      clinical criteria, following international consensus guidelines.&#xD;

        TB cases within two study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children less than 8 years of age (irrespective of HIV status)&#xD;
