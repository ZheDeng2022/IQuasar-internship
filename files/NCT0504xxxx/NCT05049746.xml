    <textblock>
      This study collects information and identifies decision making needs for older adult women&#xD;
      with stage I-III breast cancer considering neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy. Using this&#xD;
      information, a decision support tool is then developed to provide patients and physicians&#xD;
      with tailored information regarding the risks and benefits of chemotherapy and values&#xD;
      clarification to support high-quality, shared decision. Subsequently, the decision support&#xD;
      tool will be tested amongst older patients with early-stage breast cancer and health care&#xD;
      providers navigating the decision process around chemotherapy, and further refined through an&#xD;
      iterative process.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize and describe the informational needs and preferences in older adult women&#xD;
      who intend on receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy for stage I-III breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Conduct semi-structured interviews with women who have completed the treatment decision&#xD;
      process to collect informational needs and elicit decision-making needs and preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Utilize validated data collection instruments to assess the shared decision-making&#xD;
      process and health literacy needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop a decision support tool for use by patients and healthcare providers to guide&#xD;
      the chemotherapy decision-making process in older women (&gt;= 65) with early-stage breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. To conduct cognitive testing of the decision tool. IIb. To conduct a field test of the&#xD;
      decision tool in order to demonstrate feasibility and acceptability in real-world clinical&#xD;
      settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo interviews and complete questionnaires over 1-2 hours. Patients and&#xD;
      physicians also participate in a discussion and complete shared decision-making questionnaire&#xD;
      over 15-30 minutes. Subsequently, a decision support tool will be developed consistent with&#xD;
      standards for content development and evaluation from the International Patient Decision Aid&#xD;
      Standards (IPDAS) Collaboration and implemented through an iterative process of design,&#xD;
      development and evaluation to engage end users in its development. Once developed, field&#xD;
      testing of the decision tool will be conducted to demonstrate feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      in real-world clinical setting, followed by pilot testing to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      decision support tool.&#xD;
