        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is male or female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has histologically or cytologically confirmed breast cancer diagnosis (HR+/HER2-&#xD;
             breast cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a diagnosis of locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to curative&#xD;
             radiation or surgical cure or of metastatic breast cancer (i.e., advanced breast&#xD;
             cancer [ABC]); diagnosis may be de novo (initial diagnosis at ABC stage) or recurrent&#xD;
             from earlier-stage disease (initial diagnosis of earlier-stage disease with subsequent&#xD;
             progression to advanced disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has initiated a required first-line therapy of interest: Palbociclib plus AI as&#xD;
             first-line therapy for ABC between September 1, 2016, and July 31, 2020, or AI&#xD;
             monotherapy as first-line therapy for ABC between January 1, 2010,, and July 31, 2020&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Was aged 18 years or older at the time of diagnosis of ABC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is living or deceased at the time of record abstraction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a complete medical record, covering treatment for ABC, including any transfer&#xD;
             record from other facilities (if applicable) that is available to the abstractor for&#xD;
             data abstraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's first treatment after ABC diagnosis was chemotherapy (including&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has evidence of other active malignant neoplasms within 3 years (except&#xD;
             nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ) prior to diagnosis of ABC; patients&#xD;
             diagnosed with second primary cancer after ABC diagnosis will not be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has evidence of prior treatment with any CDK4/6 inhibitor (i.e.&#xD;
             palbociclib, abemaciclib, ribociclib) in the early-stage breast cancer setting or&#xD;
             treatment with abemaciclib or ribociclib in the ABC setting&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient has participated in a clinical trial related to treatment of ABC&#xD;
             (including after first-line therapy [i.e., palbociclib plus AI or AI monotherapy])&#xD;
