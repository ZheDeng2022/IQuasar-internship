  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endovascular coiling has become a strategy of choice of intracranial aneurysms due to its&#xD;
      minimally invasiveness. However, there has few prospective randomized controlled studies on&#xD;
      the comparison of therapeutic effect between endovascular coiling and microsurgical clipping,&#xD;
      especially the latter via keyhole approaches, which has been widely used in recent years.&#xD;
      Based on the data of a single center, a randomized controlled study was conducted on patients&#xD;
      with ruptured anterior circulation aneurysms suitable for both endovascular and extravascular&#xD;
      treatment, including endovascular coiling, microsurgical clipping via conventional craniotomy&#xD;
      and keyhole approaches, in order to compare the efficacy of the above strategies and provide&#xD;
      more objective basis for treatment selection for operators.&#xD;

      Consecutive patients of a single center will be screened. If spontaneous subarachnoid&#xD;
      hemorrhage (SAH) is confirmed by head computed tomography (CT), a diagnostic CT angiography&#xD;
      (CTA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) will be carried out emergently. A patients&#xD;
      harbored a single intracranial aneurysm of anterior circulation that resulted in SAH will be&#xD;
      concerned. Based on the assessment of condition, the patient will enrolled into this study&#xD;
      without indication of decompressive craniectomy. The enrolled patients will be divided&#xD;
      randomly into 3 groups, who experienced endovascular coiling, microsurgical clipping via&#xD;
      conventional craniotomy and via keyhole approaches. All of these treatment will be conducted&#xD;
      by a same senior neurosurgeon. CTA or DSA were followed up regularly. The occlusion rate,&#xD;
      operative period, hospitalization duration and cost, surgical complications were compared and&#xD;
      analyzed.&#xD;
