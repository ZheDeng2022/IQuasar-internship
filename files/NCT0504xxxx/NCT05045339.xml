  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro-behavioral disorder associated with repetitive&#xD;
      movements. The role of physical therapist towards an autistic child is most neglected one.&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this study was to see the effectiveness of different ball&#xD;
      exercise on stereotypic behavior of children with ASD. Different ball exercises were&#xD;
      implemented for 2 months, 3 sessions per week and every session consist of 35 minutes.&#xD;

    <description>Repetitive behavior scale revised (RBS-R) was used to rate stereotypic behaviors in children with ASD. It is a 43 items questionnaire that is placed under six subscales. Stereotyped behavior subscale, self-injurious behavior subscale, compulsive behavior subscale, ritualistic behavior subscale, sameness behavior subscale and restricted behavior subscale are the six subscales of RBS-R. Each subscale has different characteristics which are classified as 0 (behavior is not present at all), 1 (behavior is mildly present), 2 (behavior is moderately present) and 3 (behavior is severe). Moreover, each behavior was also rated that how much this behavior occurs, cause interruption in activity and how much child become agitated when he was interrupted.</description>
