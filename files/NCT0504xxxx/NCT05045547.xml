  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will conduct pragmatic operational research in rural communities served by&#xD;
      approximately 12 health centres and 120 village malaria workers in Battambang/Pailin, western&#xD;
      Cambodia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an integration of activities with the South and Southeast Asian Community-based&#xD;
      Trials Network (SEACTN) that is ongoing in Lao PDR and Bangladesh. The SEACTN study aims to&#xD;
      identify the most relevant ways in which village health worker roles can be expanded to&#xD;
      include management of community febrile illness. A number of SEACTN activities will also be&#xD;
      conducted in Cambodia alongside this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this project, the study team will test specific examples of expanded roles of VMWs&#xD;
      including testing for other causes of fever in people who are malaria negative and assessing&#xD;
      the feasibility of diagnostics other than malaria RDTs at health centres. Quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative data will be collected to determine acceptability, a mixed-methods approach will&#xD;
      be used for the assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quantitative method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with febrile illness attending village malaria workers will be tested by novel&#xD;
      rapid diagnostic tests (Dengue and CRP rapid test) in addition to a standard malaria test.&#xD;
      Village malaria workers (VMWs)/ mobile malaria workers (MMWs) will be trained to conduct a&#xD;
      package of activities ((i) hygiene and sanitation; (ii) disease surveillance; (iii) EPI and&#xD;
      ANC support; (iv) management of mild common illnesses that they will carry out alongside&#xD;
      their usual role of testing (RDTs) and treating malaria. If possible, within a week of&#xD;
      conducting a novel RDT, a well-being follow up will be undertaken by the VMW, either via&#xD;
      telephone or face-to-face. For the primary outcomes, the study team will report numbers and&#xD;
      proportions of training modules passed, malaria tests performed, new diagnostic tests&#xD;
      performed correctly, algorithms followed correctly, number of consultations, coverage&#xD;
      estimates, and the study team will use the national malaria information system to provide a&#xD;
      comparison in activity levels compared to other areas of Cambodia. The study team will record&#xD;
      the incidence and aetiology of febrile illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Qualitative method&#xD;
&#xD;
      A set of interviews/discussions with health centre staffs and local stakeholders will be&#xD;
      conducted to refine the intervention design and implementation strategy. To this end, the&#xD;
      interviews will elicit the views and experience of local stakeholders on (1) health care&#xD;
      needs and gaps in local communities, (2) views and past experiences concerning the&#xD;
      implementation of the VMW programme, with a focus on challenges and good practices around the&#xD;
      use of RDTs, and (3) their views about suitable methods and strategies to expand the current&#xD;
      VMW programme considering the new technologies available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from the study will highlight to the wider scientific community the benefits and&#xD;
      challenges of expanding the roles of VMW/MMWs.&#xD;
