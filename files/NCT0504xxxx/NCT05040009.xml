      The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) has identified Egypt as the ninth leading country&#xD;
      in the world for the number of patients with T2D. The prevalence of T2D in Egypt was almost&#xD;
      tripled over the last 2 decades. This sharp rise could be attributed to either an increased&#xD;
      pattern of the traditional risk factors for T2D such as obesity and physical inactivity and&#xD;
      change in eating pattern or other risk factors unique to Egypt .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of non-traumatic lower extremity&#xD;
      amputations in the industrialized world, may cause death or physical and psychical&#xD;
      disability, has a great impact on quality of life, and represents a high cost for society ( .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The term diabetic foot encompasses any lesion in the feet: infection, ulcer, and destruction&#xD;
      of deep tissues occurring as the result of diabetes and its complications .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of symptoms in a person with diabetes does not exclude foot disease; they may&#xD;
      have asymptomatic neuropathy, peripheral artery disease, pre-ulcerative signs, or even an&#xD;
      ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every diabetic patient will be subjected to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Therapeutic history: Antidiabetic drugs (type, duration), other medications for obesity,&#xD;
           hypertension and dyslipidemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Complete physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The following work up;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Knowledge questionnaire developed by Hasnain and colleagues and the Nottingham&#xD;
                Assessment of Functional Foot Care (NAFFC) .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Screening for diabetic foot .&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fundus examination&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The following investigations: Alb/cre ration, HBA1c, lipid profile, blood urea,&#xD;
                serum creatinine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abdominal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ankle brachial index (ABI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Integrated foot care program will be applied to moderate and high-risk patients for&#xD;
           diabetic foot with follow up after 6-12 months vs conventional education&#xD;
