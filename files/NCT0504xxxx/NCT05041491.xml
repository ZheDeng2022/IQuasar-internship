  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Newly released guidelines recommend increased physical activity (PA) and reduced sedentary&#xD;
      behaviors (SB) to improve glycemia and prevent the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2D). Typically, 30-60 min bouts of PA are advocated per day. Although this approach&#xD;
      increases PA, it does not decrease the length of the sedentary periods through the day. This&#xD;
      is important because recent epidemiological data suggest that frequently interrupting&#xD;
      sedentary time improves glucose control even in people who achieve the recommended levels of&#xD;
      PA. Preliminary experimental data suggest that breaking up prolonged sedentary time by&#xD;
      performing multiple short bouts (5 min) of PA throughout the day, may improve glycemia more&#xD;
      than performing a single continuous bout of PA, and thereby potentially be a novel strategy&#xD;
      to prevent T2D. The improvement in glycemia was observed even when the total amount of PA and&#xD;
      total energy expenditure were matched, suggesting that how and when PA is performed over the&#xD;
      day may matter more than how much PA is done. However, important gaps in knowledge remain&#xD;
      including: (1) whether similar benefits on glucose control would be observed in adults with&#xD;
      prediabetes, a clinically relevant population that is at high risk of developing T2D; (2)&#xD;
      whether these effects are sustained or diluted over time, and (3) what are the mechanistic&#xD;
      underpinnings. To address these gaps, the investigators propose to measure the acute and&#xD;
      chronic effects of PA breaks on glucose control and the underlying mechanisms in individuals&#xD;
      at risk of developing T2D. Sedentary men and women with overweight or obesity and prediabetes&#xD;
      (n=66, 50% F) will be randomized to either an intervention designed to interrupt SB with&#xD;
      5-min bouts of brisk walking performed hourly for 9 hours/day, 5 days/week (BREAK) or a&#xD;
      control condition consisting of 45-min of brisk walking performed as a single daily&#xD;
      continuous bout, 5 days/week (ONE). The two 3-months interventions will be matched for total&#xD;
      active time.&#xD;

EGP will be computed as RaT-RaE. Nonoxidative glucose disposal (NOGD) will be calculated by subtracting total carbohydrate oxidation from (RdT + RdE).
