  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of weighted blankets has been studied in the adult population but there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence to determine their benefit among a pediatric population, specifically oncology&#xD;
      pediatric patients. Pediatric oncology patients routinely experience anxiety during therapy&#xD;
      and as cure rates increase, attention has progressively turned to treating psychosocial&#xD;
      aspects of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A randomized 2x2 cross-over design will be utilized for this study. The study team will&#xD;
      randomize participants to one of two sequences: 1) weighted blanket first then usual care or&#xD;
      2) usual care first then weighted blanket. The cross-over design allows the researchers to&#xD;
      compare both within and between group differences. The advantages of the cross-over design&#xD;
      allow minimize potential confounding bias as patients will serve as their own controls as&#xD;
      well as potential for adequate power with smaller patient enrollment. As this study is&#xD;
      conducted during chemotherapy treatments, the 30-day period in between patient treatments&#xD;
      will be considered the washout period. This timeframe between chemotherapy infusions was&#xD;
      chosen to try to capture patients in a similar state of baseline anxiety. This helps to&#xD;
      provide adjustments to variability but should not limit accrual based on the number of&#xD;
      patients that get chemotherapy within a 30-day period.&#xD;

    <measure>Children's Anxiety Meter-State (CAM-S) assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The CAM-S is completed by showing the child a picture of a mercury thermometer and asking the child to &quot;Pretend that all of your worried or nervous feelings are in the very bottom down here (point to scale). If you are a little bit worried or nervous, the feelings might come up just a little bit (move finger up). If you are very, very worried, or nervous, the feelings might come up just a little bit (move finger up to the top). Put a line showing how much worry or nervousness you feel right now.&quot; This scale is from measured from 1-10. Higher values indicate higher anxiety. The CAM-S will be administered during the following times: prior to infusion start, thirty minutes into the treatment or end of the treatment if &lt;30 minutes and end of the treatment (see Figure 1).</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Generic Core Scales (Peds QL 4.0)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Peds QL 4.0 is a 23-item questionnaire and is broken up into four sections: physical functioning (8 items), emotional functioning (5 items), social functioning (5 items), and school functioning (5 items). These questions are aimed to measure health-related quality of life in children and adolescents who are healthy and those with acute or chronic health conditions (Varni, Burwinkle, Seid &amp; Skarr, 2003). We will utilize the parent-proxy questionnaires with responses measured on a 5-point response scale: 0 = never a problem; 1= almost never a problem; 2 = sometimes a problem; 3 = often a problem; 4 = almost always a problem. The scale is recoded and summarized to have a score ranging from 0 to 100 where higher values indicate higher quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Weighted Blanket Use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>Prior to discharge, a trained infusion nurse or a member of the weighed blanket research team will ask participants/families to classify if the participant used the blanket 0-20%, 20-40%, 40-60%, 60-80%, or 80-100% of their total infusion time.</description>
