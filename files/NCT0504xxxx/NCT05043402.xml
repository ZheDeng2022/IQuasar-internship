      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, 2-stage, multicenter study of navicixizumab with&#xD;
      or without paclitaxel compared with paclitaxel monotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant advanced epithelial ovarian cancer and specific biomarkers, as measured by&#xD;
      the proprietary and validated Xerna™ TME Panel biomarker assay. Eligible patients must have&#xD;
      received at least 2 prior regimens but not more than 5 prior regimens, including treatment&#xD;
      with a monoclonal antibody angiogenesis inhibitor (e.g., bevacizumab), must be considered&#xD;
      platinum-resistant, and must be considered appropriate to receive single-agent paclitaxel&#xD;
      chemotherapy as a next line of therapy. All patients must be willing and able to provide a&#xD;
      formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) archive or core tumor sample collected during&#xD;
      screening for classification as B+ or B- biomarker status based on RNA expression data from&#xD;
      the Xerna™ TME Panel biomarker assay. The co-primary efficacy endpoints are ORR by RECIST&#xD;
      v1.1 and PFS (as assessed by blinded independent radiological review [BIRR]) analyzed at&#xD;
      different timepoints. Analysis of the ORR primary efficacy endpoints will occur at the end of&#xD;
      Stage 1 and at the end of Stage 2; the PFS primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed at the&#xD;
      end of Stage 2.&#xD;

      Stage 1 and at the end of Stage 2; the PFS primary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed at the&#xD;
      end of Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be stratified by Xerna™ TME Panel status and region and randomized to the&#xD;
      following treatment arms according to the corresponding study stage randomization ratios.&#xD;
      Enrollment will proceed from Stage 1 to Stage 2 without interruption:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 treatment arms (4:4:1 randomization):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination navicixizumab + paclitaxel: navicixizumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (Q2W)&#xD;
           of a 28-day cycle (i.e., on Days 1 and 15); paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a&#xD;
           28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel monotherapy: paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Navicixizumab monotherapy: navicixizumab 3 mg/kg Q2W of a 28-day cycle (i.e., on Days 1&#xD;
           and 15)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Stage 2 treatment arms (2:2:3 randomization):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Combination navicixizumab + paclitaxel: navicixizumab 3 mg/kg Q2W of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
           (i.e., on Days 1 and 15); paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Paclitaxel monotherapy: paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Navicixizumab monotherapy: navicixizumab 3 mg/kg Q2W of a 28-day cycle (i.e., on Days 1&#xD;
           and 15) Within each treatment arm, patients will be stratified to a B+ or B- cohort&#xD;
           based on their Xerna™ TME Panel biomarker assay results during screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in both stages will have radiologic tumor assessments every 8 weeks (±1 week),&#xD;
      regardless of treatment delays, until objective disease progression, initiation of subsequent&#xD;
      anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, death, or end of study, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
      All patients will continue to receive study treatment until progressive disease (PD) per&#xD;
      RECIST v1.1 (as assessed by the investigator), the development of unacceptable toxicity,&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent, or another protocol-defined discontinuation criteria is met, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first, or until the sponsor terminates the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment decisions (i.e., whether to continue or discontinue the study medication) should&#xD;
      not be made based on CA-125 levels. Progression during protocol treatment cannot be declared&#xD;
      on the basis of CA 125 alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who discontinue study treatment for any reason will be followed for survival at&#xD;
      3-month intervals until death or withdrawal of consent, whichever occurs first. Survival&#xD;
      follow-up will continue for 12 months after the last patient is enrolled or approximately 75%&#xD;
      of the population has died, whichever is later.&#xD;
