  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The lack of ADAMTS13 is the only biological marker that is specific for aTTP diagnosis8 and&#xD;
      the assessment of ADAMTS13 is of clinical importance because it is essential for the rapid&#xD;
      differential diagnosis between aTTP and other TMA. Furthermore, monitoring of ADAMTS13&#xD;
      activity is useful to ensure biological remission (ADAMTS13 levels &gt; 10%) as well as&#xD;
      predicting relapses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high mortality rate of aTTP, treatment should be started as soon as the disease is&#xD;
      suspected, sometimes even before confirmation with the ADAMTS13 test results. This situation&#xD;
      may lead to misdiagnose some patients and leave them without the appropriate treatment. In&#xD;
      conclusion, ADAMTS13 activity assay is crucial for an early diagnosis and optimal management&#xD;
      of acute aTTP and any delay in ADAMTS13 results will have a negative impact on the diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment and prognosis of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently 2 techniques available for the ADAMTS13 activity determination, the&#xD;
      fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the Technozym chromogenic enzyme-linked&#xD;
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both are considered reference methods but they require&#xD;
      considerable skill because they are highly manual and this increases the risk of error.&#xD;
      Furthermore, these methods are time-consuming, not widely available and, in case of the ELISA&#xD;
      method, it requires a new calibration at each run. The inter-laboratory variability is also a&#xD;
      challenge and therefore a validation and/or interpretation method could be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new and first fully automated HemosIL AcuStar ADAMTS13 Activity assay&#xD;
      (Instrumentation Laboratory, Bedford, Massachusetts, United States) has been developed.&#xD;
      HemosIL AcuStar ADAMTS13 Activity assay is a two steps chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA)&#xD;
      with an analytical time of 33 minutes for the quantitative measurement of ADAMTS13 activity&#xD;
      in human-citrated plasma on the ACL AcuStar analyser. The immunoassay uses the GST-VWF73&#xD;
      substrate in combination with magnetic particles for rapid separation and chemiluminescence&#xD;
      technology detection. The ADAMTS13 present in the plasma sample cleavages the GST-VWF73&#xD;
      substrate and the detection of the generated fragments is based upon an isoluminol-labelled&#xD;
      monoclonal antibody that specifically reacts with the cleaved peptide. The emitted light is&#xD;
      proportional to the ADAMTS13 activity in the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new ADAMTS13 assay method has been compared with the other two available techniques in&#xD;
      two different studies. First, Favresse et al. published the results of the comparison between&#xD;
      Technozym activity ELISA assay and the new HemosIL AcuStar chemiluminescent assay. On the&#xD;
      other hand, Valsecchi et al. have recently published the results of validation of this new&#xD;
      technique in comparison with ELISA and FRETS in 176 samples. Both studies conclude that the&#xD;
      new chemiluminescent ADAMTS13 activity assay showed a good correlation and excellent clinical&#xD;
      performance for the diagnosis of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency with the FRETS-VWF73 assay and a&#xD;
      commercial ELISA when considering only ADAMTS13 activity values below 10% (the&#xD;
      internationally accepted cut-off for a diagnosis of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency typical of&#xD;
      aTTP). Finally, Stratmann et al. have just published another study comparing the HemosIL&#xD;
      AcuStar chemiluminescent assay with two commercially available ADAMTS13 assay kits using 24&#xD;
      paired test samples derived from 10 consecutively recruited patients13 and their results&#xD;
      corroborate the previously published data suggesting that the AcuStar assay could be a&#xD;
      valuable and accurate tool for ADAMTS13 activity testing and aTTP diagnostic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, a unique opportunity to validate this new technique is generated, both&#xD;
      retrospectively with our already available data from frozen samples and also in the context&#xD;
      of a large prospective study. This will be the first study worldwide testing HemosIL AcuStar&#xD;
      method in real clinical practice aTTP population (Spanish and Portuguese aTTP populations)&#xD;
      with the aim to standardize the diagnosis and follow-up methodology for the disease.&#xD;
