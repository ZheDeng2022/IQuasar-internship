  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current evidence suggests that cigarette smoke increases disease progression in people with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis (PwMS) and worsen their symptoms. 70% of PwMS report sleep disturbances&#xD;
      that negatively affects their quality of life. Cigarette smoke has been found to be&#xD;
      associated with sleep disturbances in healthy adult smokers, but this relationship is unknown&#xD;
      in PwMS. Also, those who smoke cigarettes have less physical endurance resulting in&#xD;
      undesirable effects on physical activity. Also, current evidence suggests that genes play a&#xD;
      major role in smoking behavior and that certain genetic differences greatly affects nicotine&#xD;
      dependence. To our knowledge, this was never explored before among PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the association between cigarette smoke, sleep quality, and&#xD;
      physical activity in PwMS. Another aim is to explore the genetic susceptibility of people&#xD;
      with MS to cigarette smoke, specifically to nicotine dependence&#xD;

      Prevalence of Cigarette Smoke in Jordan&#xD;
&#xD;
      29% of the adult population in Jordan are smokers, making it the highest rate in the middle&#xD;
      east. According to the 2017 WHO report, smoking prevalence is increasing in the eastern&#xD;
      Mediterranean region, in which Jordan is the leading country across the middle east with the&#xD;
      worst ratings in cigarette smoke. Another recent study in 2019 conducted by the Jordanian&#xD;
      government in collaboration with the WHO, showed that eight out of ten men in Jordan&#xD;
      regularly smoke nicotine and consume around 23 cigarettes per day. Therefore, the percentage&#xD;
      of Jordanian men who smoke increased up to 66% and 17% for Jordanian women, making these&#xD;
      rates dangerously high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Cigarette Smoke&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cigarette smoke accounts for six million deaths annually worldwide and is a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity, increasing the risk of developing cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pulmonary&#xD;
      infections. Cigarette smoke has been found to be associated with sleep disturbances in&#xD;
      healthy adult smokers. In addition, those who smoke cigarettes have less physical endurance&#xD;
      and performance, decreased muscle strength and flexibility affecting their overall physical&#xD;
      fitness and health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nicotine in cigarette smoke may disrupt sleep quality through several mechanisms. The release&#xD;
      of neurotransmitters that disrupts the normal sleep-wake cycle such as dopamine and&#xD;
      serotonin, disruption in the circadian rhythms that may develop chronic conditions such as&#xD;
      depression, and craving nicotine during the night due to nicotine dependence may all disrupts&#xD;
      a cigarette smoker night of sleep. Carbon monoxide and other toxins found in cigarette smoke&#xD;
      affects the binding of oxygen to red blood cells affecting the delivery of oxygen to active&#xD;
      muscles, heart, and lungs which might explain the low physical fitness level of smokers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Quality in Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the destruction of&#xD;
      myelin in the central nervous system. People with MS often present with a variety of symptoms&#xD;
      including sleep disturbances that affects around 70 % of these individuals. Sleep disorders&#xD;
      such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia are also commonly seen among this population.&#xD;
      Poor sleep quality affect people with MS daily physical function, and may worsen other&#xD;
      symptoms such as depression, pain, and fatigue. Sleep disturbances in MS may be due to&#xD;
      primary factors that result from lesions in brain areas controlling sleep/wake cycles, or&#xD;
      secondary factors which are due to medication side-effects or symptoms that accompany MS such&#xD;
      as pain, fatigue, depression, and bowl and bladder problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smoking and Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research in the area of cigarette smoke and MS suggests that smoking increases the risk of&#xD;
      developing MS, increase the number of relapses and disease severity among people with MS,&#xD;
      fasten their transfer into more progressive forms, reduce the effectiveness of their&#xD;
      disease-modifying therapies, and worsen symptoms such as pain, motor deficits, and cognitive&#xD;
      impairments. It is suggested that cigarette smoke alter the immune response and induce&#xD;
      inflammatory changes in people with MS which might explain the host of negative effects it&#xD;
      has on MS disease status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetics and Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current evidence suggests that genes play a major role in smoking behavior and that certain&#xD;
      genetic differences greatly affects nicotine dependence among healthy individuals. These&#xD;
      genes can ultimately affect how an individual initiate and quit smoking. There is also&#xD;
      evidence that showed specific genes are associated with an increased risk of developing&#xD;
      smoking related diseases such as cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it would be interesting&#xD;
      to explore genetic predisposition to nicotine dependence among PwMS. Understanding the effect&#xD;
      of genes on cigarette smoke behavior will greatly influence the decision making on effective&#xD;
      smoking cessation treatments in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      As current evidence from the healthy smoking population suggests those who smoke cigarettes&#xD;
      have more sleep disturbances compared to non-smokers, people with MS who smoke cigarettes may&#xD;
      have poorer sleep quality and higher risk of developing sleep disorders such as obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea. In addition, being physical inactive negatively influence the rehabilitation&#xD;
      process of people with MS. It affects their participation in therapy and can result in&#xD;
      deconditioning of their muscles and joints worsening their symptoms. It can also affect other&#xD;
      quality of life indices including their social interpersonal relationships and employment&#xD;
      rates. Despite the evidence on the effects of cigarette smoke in people with MS, to our&#xD;
      knowledge, no previous study has explored the relationship between smoking status, sleep&#xD;
      quality, and physical activity in people with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the high prevalence of cigarette smoke in Jordan and its negative effects on the&#xD;
      overall well-being of individuals specially people with MS, It is crucial to explore its&#xD;
      relationship with common symptoms among a sample of Jordanian people with MS. Another area of&#xD;
      this project that the researchers are interested to explore is the genetic susceptibility of&#xD;
      people with MS to cigarette smoke, specifically to nicotine dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this has been studied before in health smokers, no previous study has explored this&#xD;
      among people with MS. Understanding the role genes play on smoking behavior among PwMS will&#xD;
      guide future large scale studies to further explore this relationship and eventually provide&#xD;
      guidance to smoking cessation programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers of this project believe that findings from this study will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Shed the light on a major public health problem and its association with health-related&#xD;
           outcomes in PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increase awareness on the negative effects of cigarette smoke among PwMS, health-care&#xD;
           providers, and researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Increase awareness on the importance of physical activity among PwMS as well as health&#xD;
           care providers to promote physical activity among their clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Shed the light on the important effect of the genomic material on the behaviors of&#xD;
           adults which will influence cigarette smoke treatment and prevention options&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Provide the base for future studies to explore management options such as smoking&#xD;
           cessation programs and physical activity for the aim to improve sleep quality in PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Generate recommendations among health care providers to promote sleep health among PwMS&#xD;
           and policy makers to enforce stricter regulations on promoting, using, and selling&#xD;
           cigarettes in Jordan and the World.&#xD;
