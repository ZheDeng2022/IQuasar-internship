      Currently, there is limited multi-center data on endoscopic surgery outcomes in western&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of these measurement would help the investigators compare them to conventional&#xD;
      treatment modalities within current tertiary facilities; and consequently help the&#xD;
      investigators identify appropriate treatment techniques and improve clinical management of&#xD;
      patients at Rutgers RWJMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this retrospective registry study is to assess long term data on efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and clinical outcome of Endoscopic Surgery within the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our tertiary-care institution performs clinically-indicated various Endoscopic Surgery&#xD;
      procedures gastrointestinal indications in more than 800-1000 patients annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study investigators would collect data on a large sample size of subjects undergoing&#xD;
      various endoscopic resection procedures such as POEM (Peroral Endoscopic Myotomy), EMR&#xD;
      (Endoscopic Mucosal Resection), ESD (Endoscopic submucosal dissection), STER (Submucosal&#xD;
      tunneling endoscopic resection), NOTES (Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery), TIF&#xD;
      (Transoral Incisionless Fundoplication), Endoscopic Fistula Closure, Endoscopic Suturing,&#xD;
      Capsule Endoscopy and EFTR (Endoscopic full-thickness resection). Clinical metrics will be&#xD;
      collected including procedure times, length of follow-up, specific tumor characteristics,&#xD;
      resection method, pathology results, procedural complications, additional therapy required,&#xD;
      and disease-free survival time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various endoscopic surgical procedures are less invasive than traditional surgery, have fewer&#xD;
      side effects and provide better efficacy. Moreover, they can be available to patients who are&#xD;
      ineligible for surgery or who have refused more aggressive surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They improve quality of life and extend survival duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic surgery procedures can be an appropriate approach in many gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorders including early neoplasms, challenging adenomas or sub-epithelial lesions that&#xD;
      requires the resection of the superficial layers, mucosa and submucosa, or full thickness&#xD;
      resection of the tract wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is limited multi-center data on endoscopic surgery outcomes in western&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of these measurement would help the investigators compare them to conventional&#xD;
      treatment modalities within current tertiary facilities; and consequently help the&#xD;
      investigators identify appropriate treatment techniques and improve clinical management of&#xD;
      patients at Rutgers RWJMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this retrospective registry study is to assess long term data on efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and clinical outcome of Endoscopic Surgery within the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
