      Primary Objectives To investigate the relationship between dynamic MRI, brain tumor perfusion&#xD;
      (DSC) and permeability (DCE), and dynamic 18F-FAZA PET uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives To investigate the relationship between tumors with greater hypoxia&#xD;
      defined by qBOLD and 18F-FAZA PET and pathological features including proportionate necrosis,&#xD;
      Ki-67 and IDH mutation status&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the correlation between the hypoxic tumor region delineated using 18F-FAZA PET&#xD;
      and qBOLD&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Glioma Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult (&gt; 18 years old) patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent high grade glioma&#xD;
             with newly confirmed pathology (within 1 month)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No contraindications to MRI with gadolinium contrast or 18F-FAZA PET&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cervical Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult (&gt;18 years old) female with newly diagnosed cervical cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Receiving surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No contraindication to MRI with gadolinium contrast or 18F-FAZA PET&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Glioma Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior nephrectomy or planned nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior brain radiation within 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the&#xD;
             effects of 18F-FAZA in pregnancy are not known. A urine or serum pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be performed before enrollment after informed consent is obtained. The pregnancy test&#xD;
             is part of SOC before imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactation should be suspended for at least two days following the administration of&#xD;
             18F-FAZA to the mother, because of the unknown but potential risk for adverse events&#xD;
             in nursing infants secondary to administration of the radionuclide to a lactating&#xD;
             woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with contraindications to the use of 18F-FAZA including confirmed allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a BMI which precludes their&#xD;
             entry into the bore of the PET-MRI scanner, because the findings will probably be&#xD;
             compromised in image quality with PET-MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating&#xD;
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with&#xD;
             study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cervical Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior nephrectomy or planned nephrectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the&#xD;
             effects of 18F-FAZA in pregnancy are not known. A urine or serum pregnancy test will&#xD;
             be performed before enrollment after informed consent is obtained. The pregnancy test&#xD;
             is part of SOC before imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lactation should be suspended for at least two days following the administration of&#xD;
             18F-FAZA to the mother, because of the unknown but potential risk for adverse events&#xD;
             in nursing infants secondary to administration of the radionuclide to a lactating&#xD;
             woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with contraindications to the use of 18F-FAZA including confirmed allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a body weight of 400 pounds or more, or a BMI which precludes their&#xD;
             entry into the bore of the PET-MRI scanner, because the findings will probably be&#xD;
             compromised in image quality with PET-MRI and MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any additional medical condition, serious concurrent illness, or other extenuating&#xD;
             circumstance that, in the opinion of the investigator may significantly interfere with&#xD;
             study compliance.&#xD;
