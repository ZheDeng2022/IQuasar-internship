    <textblock>
      AntiCov-220 prevents and treats before, during, and after infection with SARS-Cov-2. The&#xD;
      composition is fractionally extracted from herbs, using flavonoids, isoflavonoids, and&#xD;
      pregnenolone in combination with ascorbic acid as the key compounds in preventing and killing&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2; increase antibodies and protect cells; supplementing precursors to help the body&#xD;
      strengthen antibodies and reduce the risk of infection; destroy spike protein, toxic protein,&#xD;
      help prevent blood clots causing stroke; restore the physiological function of cells after&#xD;
      virus infection; helps the body to stabilize the amount of cortisol in the blood as well as&#xD;
      stabilize the production of specific antibodies. The composition participates in&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and cells protecting process, bringing blood cortisol, B-lymphocytes, Cyfra&#xD;
      21-1, WBC, CRP, fever, dyspnea, and other signs of respiratory tract inflammation to a normal&#xD;
      state and normal limit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      AntiCov-220 can eliminate COVID-19 and its variants at a very early stage when they have not&#xD;
      had enough time to multiply and cause disease. AntiCov-220 contains precursors, flavonoids,&#xD;
      special enzymes responsible for protecting human cell membranes and destroying cell membranes&#xD;
      of some viruses, especially, COVID-19 cannot replicate in the presence of AntiCov-220 in the&#xD;
      body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AntiCov-220 contains precursors of cortisol. As the investigators know, cortisol has a cell&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, blood pressure regulation, blood sugar regulation, energy booster, and&#xD;
      anti-stress role. It provides precursors to help direct and balance the amount of cortisol in&#xD;
      the body that has been imbalanced before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AntiCov-220 contains flavonoids and Isoflavonoids that are cytoprotective antioxidants,&#xD;
      clinically proven to destroy SARS-CoV-2, HBV, HIV, HCV, viruses, reduce complications after&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection, prevent neurological sequelae, stroke, cardiovascular sequelae,&#xD;
      respiratory sequelae, ...&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-inflammatory, stress-reducing, cell-protective, anti-viral, and immunosuppressive&#xD;
      process are performed by an in vivo method that has proven its effectiveness more than ten&#xD;
      years ago. AntiCov-220 is an innovative product that can fight against COVID-19 and its&#xD;
      variants in the current epidemic situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AntiCov-220 is committed to protecting the community of people infected with HBV, HIV, HCV,&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 against the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic and its mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AntiCov-220 easy to implement, highly effective, and helps reduce public health costs, which&#xD;
      is essential in protecting human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AntiCov-220 can be used alongside with current standard treatment regimens prescribed by the&#xD;
      World Health Organization.&#xD;
