  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal aims to determine whether an adjunctive Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention&#xD;
      (MBRP) treatment program improves Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) adherence and reduces&#xD;
      drug-use among opioid use disorder (OUD) patients. The broad long-term objectives of this&#xD;
      project are to investigate how integrative pharmacological and behavioral treatments improve&#xD;
      OUD treatment outcomes. Participants for this study will include 200 patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (OUD), that are enrolled in a 60-day residential addiction treatment&#xD;
      program and prescribed MAT for OUD. Participants will be randomly assigned to a MBRP&#xD;
      behavioral treatment condition or a non-MBRP treatment-as-usual (TAU) control condition as&#xD;
      part of their treatment within the residential addiction treatment program. All participants&#xD;
      will be monitored for three-months following their discharge from the program to test the&#xD;
      hypotheses that MBRP participants, relative to TAU participants, will (1) demonstrate greater&#xD;
      MAT adherence following discharge, and (2) evidence reduced drug-use following discharge.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medically detoxified OUD patients enrolling into a 60-day residential program will be&#xD;
      randomized to either MAT Treatment-As-Usual (TAU; n=100) or TAU+MBRP (MBRP; n=100) as part of&#xD;
      their residential treatment and followed for 3-months post-discharge to assess MAT adherence&#xD;
      and drug-use. All participants (n=200) will participate in residential TAU (i.e., MAT,&#xD;
      supportive group therapy), will be scheduled monthly MAT appointments per discharge treatment&#xD;
      procedures, and will complete assessments at baseline, post- treatment, and 1-, 2-, and&#xD;
      3-month follow-ups. Study Aims include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1 (PRIMARY): Compare impact of TAU versus TAU+MBRP on medication adherence and drug-use&#xD;
      outcomes. Hypotheses: Relative to TAU, TAU+MBRP participants will demonstrate a) greater MAT&#xD;
      adherence measured at follow-up timepoints, and b) reduced drug-use (i.e., self-report, urine&#xD;
      drug-screens [UDS]) measured at discharge and follow-up timepoints. AIM 2: Determine whether&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of TAU+MBRP on outcome are mediated by improvements in opioid craving&#xD;
      and dispositional mindfulness. Hypotheses: TAU+MBRP participants will report greater&#xD;
      improvements in distress tolerance and mindfulness, relative to TAU, which will mediate&#xD;
      treatment outcomes (i.e., MAT adherence, reduced drug use and positive-UDS). EXPLORATORY AIM&#xD;
      3: Determine effects of baseline factors on treatment outcomes. Hypotheses: More severe&#xD;
      trauma exposure (i.e., increased number of traumas) and greater posttraumatic stress symptom&#xD;
      severity will result in poorer treatment adherence (i.e., reduced MAT follow-up appointments)&#xD;
      and worse drug-use outcomes (i.e., increased self-reported drug use, positive-urine&#xD;
      drug-screens) throughout each the follow-up assessments among TAU participants but not among&#xD;
      MBRP participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Overview: In an randomized controlled trial design, patients enrolling into a&#xD;
      residential addiction treatment center will be randomized to TAU (i.e., MAT, supportive group&#xD;
      therapy) or TAU+MBRP with comparisons being made between MBRP (n=100) and treatment-as-usual&#xD;
      (TAU; n=100) on assessment measures collected at baseline, prior to residential discharge,&#xD;
      and at 1, 2, and 3-month follow-up time points. To address AIM 1 (TAU+MBRP, Adherence and&#xD;
      Drug-Use): participants will be randomly assigned to receive TAU or MBRP+TAU, during their&#xD;
      residence within an inpatient treatment setting and will complete assessments at enrollment,&#xD;
      prior to discharge, and at 1, 2, and 3-months follow-up to assess MAT adherence and drug-use.&#xD;
      Comparisons, on assessment measures collected at follow-up, will be made between treatment&#xD;
      conditions to determine if MBRP+TAU results in greater number MAT adherence, fewer positive&#xD;
      UDS, reduced drug-craving, and increased mindfulness. AIM 2 (MBRP Mechanisms of Change): Will&#xD;
      determine whether the beneficial effects of MBRP on treatment outcome (i.e., MAT adherence,&#xD;
      drug-use) are mediated by increases in mindfulness and distress tolerance. AIM 3 (Predictors&#xD;
      of MAT Adherence): will examine the extent to which prior trauma-exposure and PTSD symptom&#xD;
      severity moderates MAT adherence and drug-use outcomes, among TAU participants (but not MBRP&#xD;
      participants), following discharge from residential treatment.&#xD;
