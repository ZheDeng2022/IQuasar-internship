    <textblock>
      Aim To evaluate the impact of an integrated Family Planning-Maternal,Newborn and Child Health&#xD;
      service delivery model to increase coverage of MCM in a rural Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain an understanding of the cultural and health service delivery contexts to inform&#xD;
           a socio-culturally appropriate and acceptable intervention package scalable in rural&#xD;
           Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To implement the intervention package at health facilities and outreach communities&#xD;
           through existing public and private sector resources&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the impact and level of effectiveness of interventions on the uptake MCM&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and quantify the drivers of improved uptake of voluntary methods of FP&#xD;
           especially MCM&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions focusing on community outreach programs and interpersonal communications&#xD;
      increase social acceptance of FP methods. However, home based counseling alone is not&#xD;
      sufficient for the uptake and continuation of FP methods and developing linkages with health&#xD;
      facilities and maintaining privacy at a health facility and being more culturally and&#xD;
      religiously acceptable is also important. With this in mind, efforts have been made involving&#xD;
      facility and community level health care providers for provision of MNCH services as the&#xD;
      primary mandate of National Maternal Newborn and Child Health program. However, there are&#xD;
      still deficiencies at inter and intra facility level, for example; a lack of coordination&#xD;
      among departments such as Paediatrics and Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics, lack of management level&#xD;
      coordination with front line providers, lack of equipment and logistics management manifested&#xD;
      as imbalance demand and supply and lack of overall governing bodies . Thus, overarching&#xD;
      interventions covering service delivery platforms at facility and community levels&#xD;
      necessitates the integration and scaling up of FP and MNCH services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The theoretical underpinning of behavior change will be based on the Theoretical Domain&#xD;
      Framework (TDF) v2.0. The TDF will be applied to provide an in-depth exploration and&#xD;
      understanding of factors on the demand and supply side and their interaction with and&#xD;
      influences on FP uptake. This project aims to implement a complex intervention (see figure 2)&#xD;
      within health facilities and their catchment communities. This complex intervention includes&#xD;
      a series of strategies involving community engagement by extensive community mobilization,&#xD;
      availability of trained staff and sustainable supply of commodities with the required&#xD;
      recording and reporting system. Continuous process monitoring and quality assurance will help&#xD;
      to replicate the success and address possible barriers during implementation of the&#xD;
      intervention. The mechanism of action built on the TDF adopts domains and constructs&#xD;
      including, knowledge, skills, beliefs and intentions. Furthermore, the TDF provides a&#xD;
      detailed understanding of complex behaviour thus will be used to evaluate the impact of&#xD;
      complex interventions/ strategies.&#xD;
