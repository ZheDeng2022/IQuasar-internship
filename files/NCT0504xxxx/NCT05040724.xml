  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The action of ivermectin in vitro on the viral replication of SARS-CoV-2 was demonstrated and&#xD;
      published by an Australian team in June 2020. On the other hand, the doses to be administered&#xD;
      in vivo to reach the concentrations described in vitro would lead to toxicities especially&#xD;
      neurological, in treated patients, . However, some trials and studies, such as the ICON3&#xD;
      study, demonstrate the clinical efficacy of ivermectin administered at lower doses (200 µg /&#xD;
      kg) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ivermectin in the early stages of the disease has not yet been studied. The&#xD;
      administration of the maximum authorized dose (MA) of ivermectin could at least slow down the&#xD;
      replication of the virus in vivo before the inflammatory phase of COVID-19, and reduce the&#xD;
      duration of symptoms as well as the risk of hospitalization of patients, especially in&#xD;
      critical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other studies conducted so far on COVID-19, IVERCoV will target the &quot;viral&quot; phase of&#xD;
      the disease by screening patients in the city. In addition, home visits (symptom recording&#xD;
      +/- PCR) will make it easier to monitor patients during the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial in two parallel groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a control group: with administration of a placebo in addition to the usual treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  an experimental group: treated with ivermectin 400 µg / kg in addition to the usual&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint: negation of the RT-PCR test on nasopharyngeal samples of SARS-CoV-2 on&#xD;
      D3 of taking Ivermectin compared to the control group (placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evolution of symptoms from D0 to D28,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SARS-CoV-2 viral load negativation kinetics measured on D0, D3, D7, D14 after treatment&#xD;
           by ivermectin,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparison of the number of RT-PCR amplification cycles (Ct: Cycle threshold) in each&#xD;
           group,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients having recourse to home oxygen therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients hospitalized and / or requiring oxygen therapy,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of patients admitted to intensive care,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
           200 patients will be enrolled: 100 patients for each randomization group.&#xD;
