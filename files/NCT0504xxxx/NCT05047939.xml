  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, single-blinded study is designed to compare the recovery&#xD;
      profile between propofol-based total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and remimazolam-based TIVA&#xD;
      in patients undergoing thyroidectomy. In the remimazolam group, its antagonist, flumazenil,&#xD;
      is administered at the end of surgery. We hypothesize that remimazolam-based TIVA antagonized&#xD;
      by flumazenil can significantly shorten the time from the end of anesthetic administration to&#xD;
      eye-opening compared to propofol-based TIVA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult patients undergoing elective thyroidectomy are randomly allocated to receive&#xD;
      propofol-based TIVA (n=35) or remimazolam-based TIVA (n=35). The recovery profile including&#xD;
      the time from the end of anesthetic administration to eye-opening, the time from the end of&#xD;
      anesthetic administration to extubation, hemodynamic stability, stability of anesthetic&#xD;
      depth, duration of post-anesthetic care stay, the incidence of postoperative nausea and&#xD;
      vomiting during the first 24 hours, and the quality of recover 24 hours after surgery using&#xD;
      the quality of recovery-15 was assessed by an investigator. The primary outcome is the time&#xD;
      from the end of anesthetic administration to eye-opening.&#xD;
