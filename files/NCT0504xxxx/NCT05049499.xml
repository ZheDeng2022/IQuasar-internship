    <textblock>
      The proposed longitudinal project aims to understand parental influences on children's sleep&#xD;
      and will investigate the effect of sleep-related parental factors - (1) parents' value of&#xD;
      their children's sleep relative to other activities, (2) parental involvement in setting&#xD;
      children's sleep habits and enforcing good sleep hygiene, and (3) parent's own sleep habits -&#xD;
      on school-age children's sleep, mental health, socio-emotional resilience, and&#xD;
      academic/cognitive performance. It will also investigate the impact of social economic status&#xD;
      on these sleep -related parental factors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parents can influence their children's sleep in various ways. However, existing studies on&#xD;
      parental factors of school-aged children's sleep have seldom moved beyond sleep hygiene and&#xD;
      the relationships between parent and child's sleep patterns. A potential factor that has been&#xD;
      overlooked is parents' value of their children's sleep - whether they value their children's&#xD;
      sleep and prioritise it over other activities, e.g. studying or watching TV. Another variable&#xD;
      to consider is the social economic status (SES) of the household, which can influence these&#xD;
      parental factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed longitudinal project will investigate the impact of SES on several sleep-related&#xD;
      parental factors and the effects these parental factors have on children's sleep, mental&#xD;
      health, socio-emotional resilience, and academic/cognitive performance. The project will&#xD;
      involve school-age children in Singapore (baseline age: 7-12 years) at two time points, time&#xD;
      1 (T1) and time 2 (T2), one year apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each timepoint, children's sleep will be assessed with actigraphy for 1 school week. This&#xD;
      will be followed by a lab visit during which sleep-related parental factors, as well as the&#xD;
      children's sleep, academic and cognitive performance, socio-emotional resilience, and mental&#xD;
      health will be assessed. Lab visits will be scheduled at the end of the school week in the&#xD;
      morning and early afternoon so that neurobehavioural functions can be captured during typical&#xD;
      school hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesise that parents from low SES households will value their child's sleep&#xD;
      less, and therefore, allow their child to trade a larger amount of sleep for other&#xD;
      activities. Parents from low SES households will also enforce good sleep hygiene less, and&#xD;
      sleep less themselves. Children from low SES households will thus have shorter sleep&#xD;
      duration, more sleep disturbance, poorer mental health, poorer socio-emotional resilience,&#xD;
      and poorer academic and cognitive performance.&#xD;
