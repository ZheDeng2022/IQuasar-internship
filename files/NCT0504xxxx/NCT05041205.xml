    <textblock>
      This study is designed to observe human consuming effect of a beauty drink powder and&#xD;
      combined use with a cosmetic apparatus. It is a randomized, double-blind, and placebo-control&#xD;
      study. The target enrollment of subjects is 160 and 4 arms are included, a placebo control,&#xD;
      drink powder alone, cosmetic apparatus alone, and drink powder plus cosmetic apparatus.&#xD;
      Effects on skin dullness, skin tone unevenness, skin dryness, skin elasticity, wrinkle and&#xD;
      fine line are evaluated. Both objective and subjective methods are used for efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation. Data are collected at baseline, week 4, week 8, and week 12 after treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, objective parameters are measured by the instruments as following: VisioScan&#xD;
      VC20 is used for skin roughness and wrinkle assessment, chromameter CR-400 is used to assess&#xD;
      skin color, skin gloss is assessed by Glossymeter, skin hydration is assessed by Corneometer,&#xD;
      TEWL is assessed by Vapometer, and skin elasticity is assessed by Cutometer. VISIA-CR and&#xD;
      VISIA-7 are used in skin radiation and wrinkle visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment is performed by expert visual grading on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin evenness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin radiance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin elasticity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin smoothness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin firmness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin moisture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Skin plumpness&#xD;
