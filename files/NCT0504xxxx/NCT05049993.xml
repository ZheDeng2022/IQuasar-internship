  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this multi-center study is to collect medium and long-term data on the&#xD;
      related clinical complications and functional outcomes of the Pyrocarbon Humeral Head to&#xD;
      demonstrate safety and performance, in subjects from the Pyrocarbon IDE Study cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected from this study will support post-market surveillance and MDR requirements as&#xD;
      well provide the basis for peer-reviewed publications on mid- and long-term product&#xD;
      performance and safety (five to ten years post-op).&#xD;

    <description>The EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D) questionnaire is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of quality of life. It is cognitively simple, takes only a few minutes to complete, and provides a simple descriptive profile as well as a single index value for quality of life that can be used in the clinical and economic evaluation of health care. The EQ-5D consists of a descriptive system which comprises 5 dimensions (mobility, self care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression), and a visual analog scale which measures the respondent's self-rated health on a 0-100 scale.</description>
