      Potential subjects will be identified from the customer base of a relevant clinic. If a&#xD;
      potential participant may fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria, he/she will be contacted&#xD;
      by a Co-Investigator (CI) via telephone. During the telephone call the CI will verify if they&#xD;
      are interested in participating in a study and will initiate the enrollment procedure. If&#xD;
      interest is expressed at this point they will answer some screening questions and if the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria is met the subject is offered to enroll by getting a study invite&#xD;
      through ProofPilot, the EDS, and an appointment to come in for initial fitting will be set&#xD;
      up. Questions relating to the duration of the study, number of clinical visits required, and&#xD;
      the investigational device will be answered at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this the subject will log into ProofPilot online and go through the e-ICF, if&#xD;
      signed, the subject will answer a profile questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next step will be an appointment, subject comes into their clinic and gets the&#xD;
      investigational device. In some cases, the subject will get the liner shipped to their home&#xD;
      address. This will only be done upon subjects request due to long distance from clinic. And&#xD;
      only for very confident prosthetic users which are used to handle a new liner by themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risk of participating in the investigation will be explained to the subject at this&#xD;
      point. The CIs will communicate to the study monitors the number of users that have been&#xD;
      identified that meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are willing to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the clinical visit the subjects will only be fitted to the Iceform investigational&#xD;
      liner. Profile and relevant contact information will already have been collected via the EDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then receive a prompt monthly, either via email, SMS or smartphone&#xD;
      notification, to fill in the EDS questionnaire, and perform any tasks as applicable. If a&#xD;
      subject reports a failure he/she will be instructed to stop using the liner, the remaining&#xD;
      gift cards will be delivered and their participation ends. Otherwise, participation will end&#xD;
      at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject gets to keep the investigational device at the end of the study, therefore there&#xD;
      is no need for an additional visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that report a failure of the TPE material may be contacted by the Coordinating&#xD;
      Investigator or CI if the root cause of the failure cannot be confidently determined from the&#xD;
      data collected with the EDS system.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the durability of the investigational device over its intended use lifetime (i.e. warranty period), specifically relating to any defect in the TPE material. Additionally, to gather information on the rate of side-effects, i.e. skin rashes, sores, etc.&#xD;
Secondary objectives relate to gather information on how amputees use the liner, specifically:&#xD;
Intensity of use (days/week and hours/day)&#xD;
Alternation; i.e. switching every other day between liners&#xD;
Use of personal hygiene or cosmetic products&#xD;
The following performance and safety aspects are to be verified:&#xD;
• The ICEFORM line of devices are durable over their intended use lifetime.</description>
