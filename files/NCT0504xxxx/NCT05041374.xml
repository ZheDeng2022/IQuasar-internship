    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ongoing and future research projects that study gastrointestinal diseases depend on access to&#xD;
      biological samples and clinical data. Researchers want to study people who are seen and&#xD;
      treated for these diseases. This may help them assess and treat these diseases better in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect data and samples from people being seen and/or treated for gastrointestinal&#xD;
      problems at NIH, to use in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults aged 18 and older who have known or suspected gastrointestinal disorders or need&#xD;
      screening, treatment, or follow-up per current medical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a physical exam. Their medical records will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be seen by doctors based on the ailment they have. Their condition will be&#xD;
      treated just like it would at a doctor s office. But the data and samples collected will be&#xD;
      used for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may give blood, urine, and/or stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants have an endoscopy or colonoscopy as part of their standard care and samples&#xD;
      are taken, they may be asked to give their leftover samples to NIH. Or, they may be asked to&#xD;
      have extra samples taken for NIH to use. These samples may include gastric acid and/or tissue&#xD;
      from the lining of the stomach or intestines. If samples are not taken as part of their&#xD;
      standard care, they may be asked to have samples taken for NIH to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be stored at NIH. The data systems are password protected. Samples will be coded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in the study for as long as they agree to be seen for their&#xD;
      disease....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with suspected or established acute or chronic gastrointestinal diseases or who&#xD;
      require clinical screening for gastrointestinal diseases are provided standard clinical care&#xD;
      for their condition. Data and samples obtained during regular clinical care will be retained&#xD;
      for future research in gastrointestinal diseases. Recommendations for other treatment options&#xD;
      outside of the NIH will be discussed with study patients and may be discussed with their&#xD;
      primary or referring physicians.&#xD;
