  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Despite remarkable progress, pediatric anesthesia-related mortality remains 2 to&#xD;
      30 times higher than in adults. Non-technical skills rather than a lack of expertise were&#xD;
      identified to be the main cause of errors in medicine, particularly in emergency situations.&#xD;
      As a consequence, interactive computer-based sessions and high-fidelity simulation have been&#xD;
      progressively integrated into pediatric training programs. The setup of a suitable simulation&#xD;
      center, however, is expensive and requires space, logistical support and manpower. Virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR) is a technological innovation that has been increasingly integrated into&#xD;
      clinical practice and medical training. Comparing to the mannequin-based simulation,&#xD;
      theoretical advantages of VR are the inherent highly immersive quality, the independent&#xD;
      participation with no need of other participants, the ease of multiple repetitions, the lack&#xD;
      of time or space constrains, and the reduced costs. Non-technical and operational skills&#xD;
      appear to improve significantly after VR training. To date, information on the efficacy of VR&#xD;
      in the anesthesia training are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The primary aim will be to compare the improvement of non-technical skills after&#xD;
      one simulation session between VR and high-fidelity mannequin simulation (HFS). Secondary&#xD;
      aims will be to compare the overall anesthesia resident non-technical skills performance&#xD;
      between VR and HFS, and to determine confidence in the simulation training of each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. This is a prospective, randomized, non-inferiority study. Eighteen residents in&#xD;
      anesthesia (R1-R5) will be enrolled. Participants of each year will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      be involved in either a VR or a HFS training. The scenario will be the same for both VR and&#xD;
      HFS groups. Within two weeks after the training session, all participants will undergo a&#xD;
      different, mannequin-based HFS scenario.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each simulation, resident performance will be assessed using the Anaesthetists'&#xD;
      Non-Technical Skills scale and the Ottawa Crisis Resource Management Global Rating Scale.&#xD;
      Evaluators will also perform a summary evaluation with the Managing Emergencies in Pediatric&#xD;
      Anesthesia Global Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resident's satisfaction will be measured with a post-assessment trainee survey scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance. Should the virtual reality demonstrate to be as efficient as mannequin-based&#xD;
      simulation, it will be integrated into the residency curriculum and used for resident&#xD;
      training and medical education in institutions that have limited access to a simulation&#xD;
      center.&#xD;

    <description>This is a prospective, randomized, non-inferiority study. VR will be compared to HFS, which will be considered the a priori gold standard for residents simulation training.&#xD;
The study will be divided into two phases. In the pre-test phase, participants will be randomly allocated to receive either a VR or HFS scenario (scenario 1, see below). In the post-test phase, all participants (regardless the initial grouping) will undergo a HFS scenario (scenario 2, see below).&#xD;
All scenarios have been chosen from critical events published by the Society of Pediatric Anesthesia48 and adult sources49.&#xD;
The study will be conducted at the McGill University Health Center - Research Institute (MUHC-RI).</description>
