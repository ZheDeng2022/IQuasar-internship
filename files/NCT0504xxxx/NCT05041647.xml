  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single-site study is a pilot, three-armed, double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) that will determine the feasibility of a definitive RCT investigating&#xD;
      the use of cannabis oil as a treatment for insomnia in individuals with MDD. The study will&#xD;
      also determine whether standard THC with higher CBD vs lower CBD has a differential impact on&#xD;
      insomnia. The study will also analyze other important objective parameters of sleep including&#xD;
      total sleep time and sleep efficiency from actigraphy data. Polysomnography data will also be&#xD;
      analyzed. In addition, standardized, validated instruments will be used to collect data on&#xD;
      severity of depressive symptoms, cognitive functioning biological rhythm disruption, daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), healthcare resource utilization, work&#xD;
      productivity and activity impairment, as well as other side effects, in order to better&#xD;
      understand the potential impact of the use of cannabis oil on these important health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a three-arm, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study&#xD;
      population will include 60 males and females, ages 19 and older, who report chronic problems&#xD;
      with insomnia at least three times per week for at least three months and have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      co-morbid MDD. Eligible participants will complete a urine screen for drugs of abuse&#xD;
      including opioids, cannabis, benzodiazepines and amphetamines before treatment randomization.&#xD;
      Participants with a positive screen for any of these drugs of abuse will be excluded from the&#xD;
      study. If the drug screen is negative, the principal investigator will assess patient health&#xD;
      history and perform a physical examination. All study participants must be able to fully&#xD;
      understand the study procedures and must sign a research ethics board (REB)-approved informed&#xD;
      consent before study entry. A neuropsychological battery will be used to assess cognitive&#xD;
      function in the domains of attention, verbal memory, psychomotor functioning, and executive&#xD;
      functioning at baseline and at the end of the 4-week treatment in order to examine possible&#xD;
      cognitive benefits or side effects from the treatment. These cognitive domains were chosen&#xD;
      because these domains are known to be negatively affected by chronic insomnia and by cannabis&#xD;
      use (Broyd et al., 2016). Patients will also complete a series of clinician-rated and&#xD;
      self-reported questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 4-week treatment period, participants will be instructed to start treatment with a&#xD;
      single, dose of oil at bedtime. Each dose will have either 50 mg/ml CBD and 2 mg/ml THC (High&#xD;
      CBD arm; MLP-001) or 10 mg/ml CBD and 2 mg/ml THC (Low CBD arm; MLP-002). Non-responding&#xD;
      study participants will add 1 additional dose to their respective treatment after 2 weeks if&#xD;
      a higher dosage is needed based on an Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) reduction of &gt;8 points&#xD;
      and tolerability (side effects). Responding participants will continue with 1 dose of their&#xD;
      treatment after 2 weeks. This dose range is based on previous studies showing that the&#xD;
      effective dosage of THC to improve sleep ranged, on average, between 5 and 15 mg daily&#xD;
      (Babson et al., 2017; Gates et al., 2014; Kuhathasan et al., 2019).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 19 or above (A minimal age of 19 was chosen in order to align with the cannabis&#xD;
             legalization rules of the Province of Ontario, where the research participants will be&#xD;
             recruited from: https://www.ontario.ca/page/cannabis-legalization#section-1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of MDD according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5) 37&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of Insomnia Disorder according to the Duke Structured Interview for Sleep&#xD;
             Disorders 38 Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) 39 score of &lt;10, indicating severity&#xD;
             of mild-to-no depression (This criterion is important because a proper diagnosis of&#xD;
             current co-morbid insomnia disorder cannot be accurately ascertained during acute&#xD;
             major depressive episodes)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participant must be willing and able to complete self-reported assessments, including&#xD;
             having sufficient fluency in English&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must be willing to wear a wrist-worn actiwatch device&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Participants may be using psychotropic medications for treatment of depression, except&#xD;
             benzodiazepines or any other sleep aids, as long as the dosage remains the same from a&#xD;
             minimum of 2 months prior to study enrolment until the end of the study (This&#xD;
             criterion is important because many individuals with MDD use antidepressant agents and&#xD;
             this criterion would make the results more generalizable and useful in real life&#xD;
             clinical practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Lifetime diagnosis of Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder or any other psychotic disorder,&#xD;
             as well as current or recent (last 6 months) Alcohol or Substance Use Disorder&#xD;
             according to the SCID-5&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Individuals with current diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder,&#xD;
             Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or Eating Disorder will&#xD;
             be excluded because these psychiatric disorders are associated with sleep disturbance;&#xD;
             however, because of the high rates of co-morbid psychiatric conditions in MDD&#xD;
             lifetime/past diagnosis will be allowed in order for the results to be generalizable&#xD;
             and useful in real life clinical practice&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current use of benzodiazepines or any other sleep aids&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Positive screening for drugs of abuse including but not limited to opioids, cannabis,&#xD;
             benzodiazepines, cocaine, and/or amphetamines (except prescribed stimulants for&#xD;
             comorbid ADHD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Presence of any sleep disorder other than insomnia that is considered the primary&#xD;
             diagnosis, determined by the Duke Structured Interview for Sleep Disorders (e.g. Sleep&#xD;
             Apnea, Limb Movement Disorder, or Circadian Rhythm Disorders)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Presence of unstable medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnancy or breastfeeding (female participants will need to agree to use an&#xD;
             acceptable contraceptive method during the study because of potential unknown&#xD;
             teratogenic effects of cannabinoids&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Allergy to cannabis or any components of the cannabis treatment (including terpenes)&#xD;
