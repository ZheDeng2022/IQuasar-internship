  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is the most common cause of lung destruction, contributing to&#xD;
      coinfections development, and Aspergillosis spp. is one of the most important. Diagnosis of&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) in PTB patients is difficult due to similarity of&#xD;
      clinical and radiological data, especially in resource-constrained settings. Differentiation&#xD;
      of PTB patients with singling out a group with a higher Aspergillus IgG level during the&#xD;
      initial examination will help physicians to orient to further examination of CPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: to determine the prevalence of aspergillosis in Koch's bacillus-positive and&#xD;
      Koch's bacillus-negative PTB patients and antifungal resistance of Aspergillus species&#xD;
      isolates in Central Asia countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) complicates treated pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), with&#xD;
      high 5-year mortality. PTB affected an estimated 10.4 million people in 2016. Just 57% of PTB&#xD;
      cases reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) were bacteriologically confirmed. CPA&#xD;
      both complicates and mimics treated PTB. The prevalence of CPA in patients with treated TB&#xD;
      and the contribution of misdiagnosed CPA to PTB prevalence estimates are unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mycological analysis of sputum for Aspergillus is often negative in CPA. Detection of&#xD;
      Aspergillus IgG is one of the main analysis in CPA diagnosis, but until recently had been&#xD;
      inadequately validated for use in this context. Both tests are infrequently available in&#xD;
      areas of high PTB prevalence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antifungal therapy improves survival. But, survival rates vary significantly among published&#xD;
      studies. Reported survival rates are 58%-93% at 1 year of follow-up, 17.5%-85% at 5 years of&#xD;
      follow-up, and 30%-50% at 10 years of follow-up. In a selected group of patients with CPA,&#xD;
      weekly subcutaneous injections of IFNÎ³ has been shown to improve disease control and also&#xD;
      helps with bacterial clearance. Several factors have been reported to affect mortality,&#xD;
      including by underlying pulmonary disease, advanced age, NTM infection, quality of life&#xD;
      scores, and serum albumin levels. No data on the prevalence of CPA among patients with PTB&#xD;
      and resistance of Aspergillus spp. to antifungal drugs in Uzbekistan and neighboring&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to determine the prevalence of aspergillosis in Koch's&#xD;
      bacillus-positive and Koch's bacillus-negative PTB patients and antifungal resistance of&#xD;
      Aspergillus species isolates in Central Asia countries.&#xD;
