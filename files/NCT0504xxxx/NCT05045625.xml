  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate safety and efficacy of a new spinal cord&#xD;
      stimulation paddle electrode which is able to target the dorsal horns, dorsal nerve roots,&#xD;
      and dorsal columns. The research electrode (&quot;Study Electrode&quot;) is designed to answer basic&#xD;
      physiological clinical research questions. It may inform future device therapy development,&#xD;
      but the Study Electrode is not a product that will be marketed or sold. The Investigators&#xD;
      believe the protocol is a Non-Significant Risk study answering basic physiological research&#xD;
      questions, which may be performed under hospital IRB approval.&#xD;

    <description>The HD Study Electrode is an array of 8 columns of stimulation contacts arranged in 8 rows with a low-volume electrode body. This array of stimulation electrodes contact patterns of bi-poles and tri-poles may be applied to the spinal cord for assessment of dermatomal selective stimulation patterns.</description>
