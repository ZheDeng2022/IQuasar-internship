  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized controlled trial comparing a smartphone-delivered savoring&#xD;
      intervention (SkillJoy) for Generalized Anxiety Disorder to an active treatment control.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current study seeks to determine if the positivity intervention SkillJoy, a&#xD;
      smartphone-based, ecological momentary intervention (EMI), can reduce worry and generalized&#xD;
      anxiety disorder (GAD) symptoms, increase positive emotion and wellbeing, improve&#xD;
      reinforcement and probabilistic learning, increase savoring and reduce kill-joy thinking, and&#xD;
      decrease avoidance of negative emotional shifts relative to an active treatment control in a&#xD;
      GAD sample. Skills for generating positive emotion may reduce symptoms and increase&#xD;
      well-being for those with GAD. To test this approach, participants with GAD were randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either a savoring treatment or a self-monitoring control.The savoring treatment&#xD;
      consisted of an ecological momentary intervention (EMI) for learning and practicing savoring&#xD;
      skills-SkillJoy. SkillJoy prompted participants to attend to positive aspects of the present&#xD;
      moment, plan and engage in enjoyable activities, record and reflect on positive experiences,&#xD;
      note events that turned out well, and look forward to positive events. The active&#xD;
      self-monitoring control EMI consisted of similar activities, but they all omitted savoring&#xD;
      practices. These activities included attending to any current thoughts and feelings, planning&#xD;
      everyday activities, remembering and recording daily events, and anticipating important&#xD;
      events. Both EMIs were delivered by apps on participants' smartphones for seven days with&#xD;
      30th day follow-up. Secondarily, the current study will assess differences between those with&#xD;
      GAD and non-anxious controls on a computerized probabilistic reinforcement learning task and&#xD;
      baseline savoring questionnaires.&#xD;
