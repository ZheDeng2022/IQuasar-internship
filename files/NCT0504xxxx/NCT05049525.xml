    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, phase II, proof of concept&#xD;
      study will randomize 68 subjects at 2 to 4 clinical sites in Canada. Following signature of&#xD;
      informed consent, subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      receive either itraconazole and terbinafine, or matching placebos. During the first 4 weeks&#xD;
      subjects will receive itraconazole 200 mg twice daily or matching placebo, followed by&#xD;
      itraconazole 200 mg twice daily and terbinafine 250 mg twice daily or matching placebos for&#xD;
      the remaining 16 weeks. The 2 drugs will be administered orally.&#xD;
