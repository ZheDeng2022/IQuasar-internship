  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies in children and adolescents with Attention-Deficit-Hyperactivity-Disorder (ADHD) have&#xD;
      shown that physical exercise can improve the core symptoms of ADHD; inattention and&#xD;
      hyperactivity. For adults, the evidence is deficient and there is a great need to investigate&#xD;
      whether adults have the same effect on ADHD symptoms of physical exercise, as children and&#xD;
      young people have. Adults with ADHD often have a sedentary lifestyle and suffer from obesity&#xD;
      and have sleep problems. In a normal population, these problems have been shown to be&#xD;
      affectable with physical exercise. START (Support in Activity, Movement and Exercise) is a&#xD;
      randomized controlled intervention study where physical exercise is given for 12 weeks, with&#xD;
      or without cognitive support. The effect is measured with rating scales as well as cognitive&#xD;
      and physical tests. The purpose is to investigate whether START works as a treatment for ADHD&#xD;
      in terms of ADHD symptoms and disability, and what impact the intervention has on mental&#xD;
      health, physical condition and activity level, body awareness and everyday functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures are registered within 3 weeks before and after the end of treatment, after 6&#xD;
      months and 12 months. The randomization takes place in three groups; physical exercise (i),&#xD;
      physical exercise and extra cognitive support (ii), and control group on waiting list (iii).&#xD;
