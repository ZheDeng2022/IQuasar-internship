  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pressure reactivity index (PRx) has emerged as a surrogate method for the continuous&#xD;
      bedside estimation of global cerebral autoregulation and a significant predictor of&#xD;
      unfavorable outcome. However, calculations require continuous, high-resolution monitoring and&#xD;
      are currently limited to specialized ICU with dedicated software. To overcome this problem,&#xD;
      new indices calculated using one-minute average data, instead of 10 seconds average data as&#xD;
      performed by the PRx, has been proposed. The study aims to test some indexes appropriately&#xD;
      modified to adapt to the scarcity of output data generated by standard hospital systems by&#xD;
      analyzing the effectiveness of the Ultra Low-frequency Pressure Reactivity index (UL-PRx&#xD;
      sampled at ~0.0033 Hz, about 5 minutes period) to evaluate association with outcome. The&#xD;
      results indicate that sampling at ultra-low frequency might be of enough resolution to derive&#xD;
      information about the state of cerebrovascular autoregulation and outcome of TBI patients.&#xD;
      Indexes significantly associated with outcome, as UL-PRx, open new research fields between&#xD;
      static and dynamic autoregulation, expanding the possibilities of investigation in TBI.&#xD;

        TBI patients admitted to ICU of the ASST Papa Giovanni XXIII requiring ICP monitoring&#xD;
        during the study period (January 2013 - December 2019). It is estimated that medical&#xD;
        records from approximately 210 TBI subjects requiring ICP monitoring will be reviewed. The&#xD;
        final number of subjects to be included will be determined based on available medical&#xD;
        records obtained within the timeframe of the estimated duration of the study.&#xD;
