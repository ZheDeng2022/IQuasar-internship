      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a clinical entity that can be defined as back pain with&#xD;
      duration of more than 12 weeks. Chronic low back pain is associated with restriction in daily&#xD;
      physical activities that ultimately leads to disuse atrophy of muscles. Moreover, weak and&#xD;
      atrophied muscles around the lumbar spine cause immense immobility and recurring low back&#xD;
      pain in these patients. The objective of this study will be to determine the effect of retro&#xD;
      walking on pain, physical function and flexibility in chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized controlled trial and will be conducted in physiotherapy&#xD;
      department in DHQ hospital Nankana Sahib. The study will be completed in time duration of six&#xD;
      months after the approval of synopsis and consecutive sampling technique will be used. 40&#xD;
      subjects will be divided in two groups. Group A will follow retro walking and conventional&#xD;
      treatment while group B will follow only conventional treatment. Data will be collected by&#xD;
      all participants before 1st session after 6th session and at the end of 12th session by using&#xD;
      NPRS, MODI, sit and reach test and Modified schobber's test. Data will be analyzed by&#xD;
      SPSS-25.&#xD;

      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a clinical entity that can be defined as back pain with&#xD;
      duration of more than 12 weeks. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that 50% of the general&#xD;
      population experiences CLBP and around 70% have encountered at least one occurrence of it&#xD;
      during their lifetime.Chronic low back pain is associated with restriction in daily physical&#xD;
      activities that ultimately leads to disuse atrophy of muscles.Moreover, weak and atrophied&#xD;
      muscles around the lumbar spine cause immense immobility and recurring low back pain in these&#xD;
      patients The prevalence of low back pain increases peak between 35-55 years of age.Low back&#xD;
      pain is caused by a degenerated or damaged facet joint or sacroiliac joint with soft tissue&#xD;
      injury on the trunk or by lumbar instability from weakened muscle strength.Lumbar instability&#xD;
      restricts muscle strength, endurance, flexibility, and active range of motion (AROM). In&#xD;
      particular, patients with Chronic low back pain (CLBP) persisting for more than 6 months&#xD;
      restrict trunk movement to minimize pain in the lumbosacral area or leg, which aggravates the&#xD;
      level of lumbar muscle weakness in paraspinal muscles and the multifidus.These changes&#xD;
      increase lumbar instability and raise the recurrence of low back pain. Patients with CLBP&#xD;
      suffer from deteriorated physical functions and production activities due to weakened muscle&#xD;
      strength in the lumbar region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2015 Yun Ha Park et al, conducted a study to confirm the effect of various forms of&#xD;
      walking on health related physical fitness, lumbar muscle strength, range of motion and the&#xD;
      pain index. Forty females were divided into 4 groups: walking forward (n=10), walking&#xD;
      backward (n=10), walking forward &amp; backward (n=10), and control group (n=10). All&#xD;
      participants in walking groups walked 50 min/day and 3 days/week during 10 weeks. The results&#xD;
      of study concluded that walking forward, walking backward, and walking forward &amp; backward&#xD;
      caused significant changes in health related physical fitness, lumbar muscle strength, ROM&#xD;
      and pain. Especially the group of walking backward showed low figures in pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study conducted by Kim SH et al, in 2016 twenty five unilateral exercise athlete were&#xD;
      included. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of backward walking on&#xD;
      isokinetic muscular function, low back pain index and lumbo sacral angle in unilateral&#xD;
      exercise athletes. Backward walking was performed with a frequency of three times a week by&#xD;
      60 minutes at a time for 10 weeks. Comparison of related variables before and after backward&#xD;
      walking was verified. This study concluded that backward walking improves muscle strength of&#xD;
      the lumbar vertebra and reduces the lumbosacral angle and appeared to reduce the pain of the&#xD;
      lumbar vertebra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an experimental study conducted by Manisha Rathi et al in 2017, 30 women having mechanical&#xD;
      low back pain were divided in 2 groups Group A and Group B. Group A underwent core&#xD;
      strengthening exercises and hot pack for 10 min, and Group B underwent same protocol along&#xD;
      with Retro-walking for 10 min, the protocol was given for 4 weeks, outcome measures were NPRS&#xD;
      at rest and activity and core strength. Results showed that there was significant reduction&#xD;
      in NPRS at rest and activity in both the groups but group B showed more reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2018 Ansari B et al, conducted an experimental study to investigate the electromyographic&#xD;
      activity of lumbar multifidus (MF) and erector spinae (ES) muscle during forward walking (FW)&#xD;
      and backward walking (BW) in participants with and without chronic low back pain (CLBP). 25&#xD;
      health and 25 chronic low back pain patients was included. Study concluded that BW leads to&#xD;
      greater activation of the paraspinal muscles. Along with global extensor (ES), activity of&#xD;
      core extensor (MF) is also higher during BW than FW in both healthy participants and CLBP&#xD;
      patients. BW is a more favorable aerobic activity to enhance lumbar para spinal recruitment.&#xD;
      These findings may have important clinical implications in the rehabilitation of CLBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study conducted by Ansari S et al, in 2020 thirty athletes with low back pain were&#xD;
      randomly assigned in two groups. One group was given conventional treatment and other was&#xD;
      given retro walking and conventional treatment. . Pain, flexion range of motion, balance, and&#xD;
      muscle fatigability were examined before and after 4 weeks of the intervention. Study&#xD;
      concluded that retro walking when added to conventional exercises may be helpful in reducing&#xD;
      chronic mechanical LBP and improving dynamic balance but has no additional effect in&#xD;
      improving the flexion range of motion and reducing muscle fatigability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The literature has proved the significant effects of retro walking on pain, balance, and&#xD;
      range of motion in athletes, but its effects on physical function, pain and flexibility of&#xD;
      hamstrings and flexibility of lumbar spine in chronic non- specific low back pain in general&#xD;
      population are still needed to be investigated further. The objective of current study will&#xD;
      be to determine the effects of retro walking on pain, physical function and flexibility in&#xD;
      chronic non-specific low back pain.&#xD;

    <measure>MODIFIED SCHOBER TEST</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is commonly used assessment methods for lumbar flexion ROM. To perform this test, the examiner puts his thumbs on the inferior margin of the subject's PSIS. An ink mark is drawn along the midline of the lumbar spine horizontal to the PSIS (lower landmark). While the examiner holds the tape firmly against the subject's skin, he marks a second line 15 cm above the original one (higher landmark). Then the subject is asked to do an active anterior flexion of the trunk without increasing the pain. The new distance between the lower and higher landmarks is then measured. The subject returns to the neutral position. The difference in the initial distance between the skin markings in the neutral position and the new measurements made in the flexion position is used to indicate the amount of lumbar flexion. Measurements are recorded to the nearest mm</description>
