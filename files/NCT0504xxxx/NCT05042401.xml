  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHR-1703 is a monoclonal antibody under development for severe asthma. This study is the&#xD;
      first study in patients with asthma. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics ，pharmacodynamics and immunogenic characteristics of multiple&#xD;

             limited to short-acting beta-2 receptor agonists (SABA) or short-acting cholinergic&#xD;
             receptor antagonists (SAMA) inhaled on demand.&#xD;

             bronchodilators was ≥45% (the examination time was between 6:00 a.m. and 12:00 a.m.),&#xD;
             and the short-acting bronchodilators were stopped for at least 4 hours before the&#xD;
             examination;&#xD;

             health risks, and are expected to be in stable health status during the study period&#xD;

             they will only be enrolled if the investigator assesses that the abnormality does not&#xD;
             interfere with the study and does not pose an additional health risk. For abnormal&#xD;
             laboratory tests with clinical significance, if there are clear and reasonable&#xD;
             reasons, retest can be conducted within one week, and the retest results can be used&#xD;
