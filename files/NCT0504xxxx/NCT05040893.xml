  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the benefits and feasibility of physiotherapy in&#xD;
      the recovery of ongoing symptoms after COVID-19 illness. Long COVID Syndrome (Long COVID) is&#xD;
      defined by persistent symptoms (including breathlessness, chest pain and fatigue) after&#xD;
      COVID-19 illness that continue for more than 12 weeks and cannot be explained by another&#xD;
      diagnosis. The goal of this project is to explore physiotherapy as treatment for patients&#xD;
      suffering from Long COVID.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The global pandemic caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 [COVID-19] has&#xD;
      resulted in catastrophic loss of life and significant morbidity in survivors. It is now&#xD;
      recognized that a significant number of patients have symptoms lasting for weeks to months&#xD;
      after initial infection, a clinical entity termed &quot;Long COVID&quot;. For many patients, this has&#xD;
      led to an unexpectedly long recovery and has negatively impacted health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL). Persisting breathlessness, fatigue and exercise limitation were among the most&#xD;
      common patient-reported symptoms after COVID-19 infection, affecting approximately 50% of&#xD;
      individuals. Given the heterogeneity in the causes of breathlessness post-COVID, there are no&#xD;
      specific medications that can be broadly recommended to alleviate dyspnea among these&#xD;
      patients. Breathing retraining, combined with supervised exercise, improves QOL and exercise&#xD;
      capacity among patients with various chronic lung diseases and is an important potential&#xD;
      strategy that could reduce dyspnea and regain physical function among those with Long COVID.&#xD;
      The benefits of physiotherapy are recognized in hospitalized, and critically ill patients,&#xD;
      and physiotherapy interventions have been studied among hospitalized patients with acute&#xD;
      COVID-19 pneumonia. Physiotherapy may also play an instrumental role in the recovery of&#xD;
      ambulatory patients with Long COVID, but few data currently exist.&#xD;

    <measure>Feasibility (patient recruitment and retention rate)</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be determined by recruitment of 12 participants within 3 months, retention of &gt;70% of participants and mean completion of &gt;70% of all supervised physiotherapy sessions.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life (QOL)</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-VAS will be used to measure QOL. The EQ-VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine and 'The worst health you can imagine. The EQ-VAS is the main patient-reported outcome of interest and has an MCID of 8. In addition, the EQ-5D-5L will be used to measure QOL across five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Respondents select the level which most closely matches their health state (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems or extreme problems). The choices made within each domain relate to a 1-digit number. Combining these digits results in a 5-digit number, which will be converted into a utility weight.</description>

    <measure>Self-reported functional status</measure>
    <time_frame>120 days</time_frame>
    <description>The Post-COVID Functional Scale (PCFS) will be used to measure participant self-reported functional impairment. It covers the full spectrum of functional outcomes, and focuses on limitations in usual activities in five scale grades (0 - 4). Grade 0 reflects the absence of any functional limitation, and upward of grade 1, symptoms, pain or anxiety are present to an increasing degree. Grade 4 reflects severe functional limitations.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS Self-efficacy for Managing Chronic Conditions item bank will be used to measure self-efficacy to manage symptoms and self-efficacy to manage daily activities in both cases, the 4-item short forms). Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale (1=never; 2=rarely; 3=sometimes; 4=often; and 5=always) with higher scores indicating greater severity of depression.</description>
