      Background: Active Warm up is one of the best and commonly used techniques in athletes that&#xD;
      can induce special type of cardiovascular and metabolic changes that can bring the prominent&#xD;
      change in running performance. Warm up prepares the body to withstand the high intensity&#xD;
      exercises and improves the athletic performance and reduce the risk of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objectives of study are to compare two types of warm up resistance and&#xD;
      plyometric warm up in recreational athletes to improve running performance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Warm up is initial practices before starting exercise with usual concept to enhance the&#xD;
      overall performance generally known as warm up. Often prior to initiate specific sport it is&#xD;
      recommended to do cardiovascular warm like stretching for at least 10 to 20 minutes. As&#xD;
      believed by and proven to many sport coaches that warm up decline the risk of musculoskeletal&#xD;
      injuries, improve player performance in particular sport by helps to upgrade body&#xD;
      temperature, excel the muscle potential, decrease muscle stiffness as well as resistance,&#xD;
      regulate muscle contractile units, increase heart rate and blood flow toward muscles,&#xD;
      increase oxygen saturation, improve and regulate neuro-muscular electrical signals to achieve&#xD;
      best outcome in competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of Warm Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different types of warm up like active, passive and mixed regimes are generally recommended&#xD;
      previous to any sport, different researches and studies have been conducted to seek the&#xD;
      effects of various warm up protocols and their impact on athletes performance. Stretching,&#xD;
      treadmill walking, plyometric exercises are frequently directed for warm up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plyometric warmup are heavy strength regimes may include works out like jumping, additionally&#xD;
      called plyometric works out, ordinarily used to expand strength through the&#xD;
      stretch-shortening cycle (SSC). This sort of preparing is a profoundly successful&#xD;
      neuromuscular boost, with the benefit of requiring low physical space, time and it also&#xD;
      require less training equipment to finish the training sittings. Present moment plyometric&#xD;
      programs positively affect endurance running execution or running economy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training improvement can improve running mechanics. Improved biomechanical&#xD;
      efficiency and improved joint activation and coordination of leg muscles may enable a&#xD;
      reduction in relative workload. Improved Running Mechanisms Combining neuromuscular&#xD;
      efficiency and strength can reduce oxygen consumption and thus improve running economy and&#xD;
      ultimately performance Indeed, the combination of HRT and plyometric training may facilitate&#xD;
      further improvements in the running economy through the accumulation of adaptations&#xD;
      previously observed when any type of training is run alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously investigated the effects of short term resistance training program and plyometric&#xD;
      training on fitness performance in boys aged 12 to 15 years and concluded that plyometric&#xD;
      training improved the running velocity. A study effect of plyometric training on running&#xD;
      performance and vertical jumping in prepubertal boys it stated that plyometric training&#xD;
      programme causes higher muscle tension compared to resistance training and energy is more&#xD;
      stored and released during muscle shortening for this reason plyometric training is widely&#xD;
      recommended for improving the running economy. A study was done on The Impact of Resistance&#xD;
      Training on Distance Running Performance concluded that the running economy improved up to 8%&#xD;
      with the help of resistance training programme but it improves the running performance in&#xD;
      only trained runners. Even a small improvement in running economy could have a large impact&#xD;
      on distance running performance, particularly in longer events, such as marathons or&#xD;
      ultra-marathon. A study Effects of plyometric training on endurance and explosive strength&#xD;
      performance in competitive middle- and long-distance runners.&#xD;

    <measure>Incremental Test. (Time of Exhaustion)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>Initial velocity will be 7 km h/1 and increased by 1 km h/1every 3 min up to 10 km h/1. The gradient of the motorized treadmill will be set at 1% to simulate the air resistance that athletes experience on an outdoor track. During the incremental test, at 10 km h/1, the gradient will be increased by 2.5% every 2 min until exhaustion. total distance and the time of exhaustion was noted.</description>

    <measure>Modified Borg Scale (Rate of Perceived Exertion)</measure>
    <time_frame>day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The Borg rating of perceived exertion (RPE) scale developed by Swedish researcher Gunnar Borg is a tool for measuring an individual's effort and exertion, breathlessness and fatigue during physical work and so is highly relevant for occupational health and safety practice. In its simplest terms, it provides a measure of how hard it feels that the body is working based on the phys¬ical sensations that the subject experiences. the scale ranges from 0-10 with 0 at no exertion and 10 at maximum exertion.</description>

Please mark an &quot;X&quot; on the number line which describes your global fatigue with 0 being worst and 10 being normal.</description>

    <time_frame>day 2</time_frame>
    <description>The main objective of the Yo Y o test is to measure the ability to repeatedly perform intense exercise including the potential to rapidly recover from such exercise. During the Yo Yo test, participants perform repeated 2 × 20-m runs at progressively increasing speed, intermitted by 10-s periods of active recovery (2 × 5 m). The test is performed until total exhaustion of the participant is reached.</description>
