  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in nine Canadian men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer (PC) in their lifetime.&#xD;
      Although all treatment options can be effective in controlling the disease, treatment side&#xD;
      effects such as problems with erections and controlling the bladder can significantly affect&#xD;
      men's quality of life. Many men with PC say they do not get relevant information and&#xD;
      emotional support, and experience gaps in care when dealing with these difficult issues.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that cancer patient navigation improves access to care and&#xD;
      support, and reduces healthcare costs. We developed True North Peer Navigation - a peer&#xD;
      navigation program for men with PC and a peer navigator training course. Men are matched&#xD;
      online with a trained peer navigator who provides practical information and emotional support&#xD;
      through the cancer journey. A pilot evaluation showed that it is highly acceptable to&#xD;
      patients and peer navigators, and improves patient quality of life, social support and&#xD;
      ability to manage their health. In this study, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of the True North Peer Navigation program in cancer centres in Ontario, British Columbia and&#xD;
      Nova Scotia. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive True North Peer Navigation or an&#xD;
      active wait list control consisting of usual care with access to information on the True&#xD;
      North Peer Navigation website. We will evaluate the effect of the True North Peer Navigation&#xD;
      program on patient outcomes such as their ability to take a more active role in their health,&#xD;
      quality of life, social support and use of health care services. In addition, we will&#xD;
      evaluate how True North Peer Navigation was implemented, the experiences patients and peer&#xD;
      navigators, the factors that make it easier or harder for people to deliver the program to&#xD;
      patients in different settings, as well as the cost of delivering the program, which will&#xD;
      help us learn how to spread the program across the country.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Prostate cancer (PC) is a highly prevalent condition affecting 1 in 9 Canadian&#xD;
      men. While the 5-year survival rate for PC is 93%, treatment-related side effects, such as&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction and urinary incontinence, can significantly affect quality of life. Men&#xD;
      with PC lack access to relevant information and emotional support, and report gaps in&#xD;
      supportive care when dealing with these difficult issues. Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      cancer patient navigation improves the timeliness of care and support, and reduces healthcare&#xD;
      costs. Engaging volunteer cancer survivors as navigators is less costly, provides peer&#xD;
      support, and benefits the navigator by improving their psychosocial health. We developed True&#xD;
      North Peer Navigation - an evidence-based peer navigation program for men with PC and a&#xD;
      competency-based peer navigator training course. Men are matched online with a trained peer&#xD;
      navigator who assesses needs and barriers to care, provides practical, informational, and&#xD;
      emotional support, and empowers them to take a proactive role in their health. A pilot study&#xD;
      showed True North Peer Navigation is highly acceptable to patients and peer navigators, and&#xD;
      associated with improvements in quality of life, social support and patient activation to&#xD;
      manage health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This project aims to advance knowledge on the effectiveness and implementation of a&#xD;
      web-based peer navigation program for men after treatment for PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the effect of True North Peer Navigation on patient outcomes in men with&#xD;
           PC; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the delivery of True North Peer Navigation in terms of fidelity, cost, and&#xD;
           the experiences of patients and peer navigators, and to identify barriers and&#xD;
           facilitators to its implementation in oncology settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Guided by the SPOR Patient Engagement Framework, we will conduct a type-1 hybrid&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation study at cancer centres in Ontario, British Columbia and Nova&#xD;
      Scotia. For objective 1, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of True North Peer Navigation compared to an active wait list control on patient&#xD;
      activation (primary) and needs, quality of life, anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence,&#xD;
      social support, and access to services (secondary). Two hundred and forty patients (n=120 per&#xD;
      arm) with PC will be recruited after treatment. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline (T0),&#xD;
      3-months (T1) and 6-months (T2). Objective 2 will involve a mixed-method process evaluation&#xD;
      to investigate implementation fidelity, patient and navigator experiences, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of True North Peer Navigation, and to assess implementation barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators with stakeholders informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation&#xD;
      Research and the Theoretical Domains Framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: True North Peer Navigation is an innovative solution to an important service&#xD;
      gap in the lives of men with PC. This study has the potential to generate important evidence&#xD;
      and strategies to support the implementation of peer navigation programs to improve the&#xD;
      health outcomes of men with PC in Canada.&#xD;
