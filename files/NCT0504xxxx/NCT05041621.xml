    <textblock>
      McGill artificial pancreas lab has developed a learning algorithm using a reinforcement&#xD;
      learning approach to adjust basal and bolus recommendations for high-fat meals and exercise&#xD;
      management for individuals with type 1 diabetes on multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy.&#xD;
      The reinforcement learning algorithm is integrated with a mobile application that gathers&#xD;
      insulin, meal information (carbs (if applicable) and high-fat content), mealtime glucose&#xD;
      value, glucose trend at mealtime, and type and timing of postprandial exercise.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a reinforcement learning&#xD;
      algorithm to adjust basal and bolus recommendations for high-fat meals and postprandial&#xD;
      exercise management. The investigators hypothesize that the reinforcement learning algorithm&#xD;
      will be safe, and participants will get the benefit of improved glucose outcomes and improved&#xD;
      patient satisfaction from the start to the end of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (aged ≥18) will undergo multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy for 4 months&#xD;
      using a freestyle Libre glucose sensor (Abbott Diabetes Care) and a mobile data collection&#xD;
      application integrated with the reinforcement learning algorithm.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Sensor augmented MDI therapy plus mobile application</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will use the mobile application to calculate their basal dose and to calculate their meal bolus dose by entering their glucose value, carbs (if applicable), fat composition (high fat or not), and type and timing of postprandial exercises. Participants will receive their dosing parameters weekly upon adjustments made by the reinforcement learning algorithm. Participants will be contacted by telephone on Weeks 1, 3, 5, and 7 in case of any technical difficulties or questions.&#xD;
All participants will be asked to complete the:&#xD;
(i) Diabetes treatment satisfaction questionnaire (DTSQ) and hypoglycemia fear survey-II (HFS-II) at baseline, halfway through the intervention, and post-intervention.&#xD;
(ii) mHealth usability questionnaire (MAUQ) at post-intervention.</description>
