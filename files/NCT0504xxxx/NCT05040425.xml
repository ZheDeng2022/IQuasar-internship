  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a randomized, double-arm, parallel-group, open-label controlled study&#xD;
      that aims to evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine on head and neck cancer&#xD;
      patients with oral mucositis toxicities and quality of life during radiotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      200 head and neck cancer patients who were scheduled for radiotherapy are randomly assigned&#xD;
      at a 1:1 ratio to two arms: control group and those treated with Zi-Yin-Liang-Ge-San&#xD;
      containing Rx. Scutellariae, Rx. Glycyrrhizae, Hb. Dendrobii, Rx. Ophiopogonis, and Hb.&#xD;
      Menthae Haplocalycis from day 1 of radiotherapy. The study lasted at least 6 weeks and the&#xD;
      clinical benefit was determined by onset, gradation of mucositis (Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
      for Adverse Events v5.0), oral pain (visual analysis scale) for each week during RT.&#xD;
      Nutritional status, EORTC Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) and head and neck&#xD;
      module (QLQ-H&amp;N35), Body Constitution Questionnaire (BCQ), and electrical body conductivity&#xD;
      were evaluated before and after radiotherapy. Patient-Reported Outcomes version of Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE), serious adverse events, blood and&#xD;
      biochemical analysis will be recorded to evaluate the safety.&#xD;

    <description>Zi-Yin-Liang-Ge-San is composed of five herb ingredients, namely Rx. Scutellariae (Huang Qin), Rx. Glycyrrhizae (Gan Cao), Hb. Dendrobii (Shi Hu), Rx. Ophiopogonis (Mai Men Dong), and Hb. Menthae Haplocalycis (Bo He). It is orally administrated trice daily from the first day to the end of RT in the treatment group, aiming to prevent and manage the OM. ZYLGS is manufactured as a concentrated herbal extract, constituted 4 g per packet, and origin from pharmaceutical companies in Taiwan with good manufacturing practice (GMP).</description>
