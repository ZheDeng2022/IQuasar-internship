      Gastrointestinal diseases may cause intestinal failure (IF) requiring long term parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition (PN) which is, most of the time, performed at home (HPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      However such conditions represent a great burden for the parents and the family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The birth of a child with such disease changes the life of the entire family including life&#xD;
      style, leisures, social relationships and professional activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These condition obligate to change the personal and familial organization according to the&#xD;
      course of the disease. The PN treatment which was seen as life saving when first started&#xD;
      might become a burden altogether physically and psychologically for the child and his/her&#xD;
      family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Necker-Enfants Malades hospital developed home PN in the early eighties as an alternative&#xD;
      to very long hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, there are 7 expert centers for HPN in France. The Necker HPN program is the oldest&#xD;
      and the largest looking after i a third of the 400 children on HPN in France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our organization is based on a specializednursing team together with medical doctors&#xD;
      specialized in pediatric clinical nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nursing team is also a teaching team for training the parents for daily PN care. The HPN&#xD;
      team works in collaboration with professional partners: pharmacists, dieticians,&#xD;
      psychologists, occupational therapistsand speech specialists as well as with social workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of our clinical activities have been published in international peer review journals.&#xD;
      However those publications reported only clinical data in terms of diagnosis, prognosis,&#xD;
      mortality, morbidity and growth.There was any data on family quality of life (QOL) and on&#xD;
      life style changes (LSC). In other words, by reporting only on medical aspects, there was any&#xD;
      analyze on familial, psychosocial and professional impact of long term HPN.&#xD;
