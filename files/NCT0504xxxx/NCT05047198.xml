      This study compares two arms - the current standard of care catheter ablation for Ventricular&#xD;
      Tachycardia compared to stereotactic radiotherapy to non-invasively ablate ventricular&#xD;
      tachycardia using a novel non-invasive ECG based body surface mapping technology. This allows&#xD;
      investigators to identify ventricular tachycardia circuits to target for subsequent radio&#xD;
      ablation. To summarize, the current standard of care invasive catheter ablation to the&#xD;
      non-invasive radio ablation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently patients suffering Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) are offered drugs, such as&#xD;
      Amiodarone, Implantable cardioverter defibrillatorf (ICD) implant and catheter ablation.&#xD;
      Although effective drugs have side effects, ICD shocks are painful and catheter ablation is&#xD;
      arduous for patients at high risk of complications. Catheter ablation is currently the gold&#xD;
      standard treatment for recurrent VT despite anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter ablation (CA) was initially developed in the 1980s following the successful&#xD;
      treatment of VT by surgical resection of myocardial scarring in structural heart disease.&#xD;
      After thorough clinical evaluation and medical stabilization, imaging is performed to&#xD;
      identify culprit areas for ablation and to stratify risk of intervention. Pre procedural&#xD;
      imaging in patients with ICDs in situ involves Echocardiography, Computerized Tomography (CT)&#xD;
      scanning and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging in order to assess cardiac function,&#xD;
      ischemia, inflammation and scarring. If necessary mechanical circulatory support, Left&#xD;
      Ventricular Assist Devices (LVAD) and/ or Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) can be&#xD;
      used to sustain cardiac output during VT induction and mapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiofrequency (RF) energy delivered via catheter to the arrhythmogenic target results in&#xD;
      local resistive heating and is performed under sedation or anesthesia using multiple&#xD;
      catheters placed in the heart while the patient is anticoagulated. Conventional approaches&#xD;
      involve advancing multiple catheters via Femoral veins and/or arteries under a combination of&#xD;
      fluoroscopic, ultrasound and electroanatomic guidance. Ablation targets include an&#xD;
      arrhythmogenic focus or the critical isthmus of the VT circuit and/ or substrate identified&#xD;
      on preprocedural imaging or low voltage areas, &quot;scar&quot;, identified during endocardial mapping.&#xD;
      CA procedures for VT are often long, averaging 5 hours duration reported in clinical trials,&#xD;
      with prolonged procedures being associated with adverse outcomes and 30 day complication&#xD;
      rates, including death, of 7- 13%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulnerable patients requiring circulatory support or at high risk of recurrence and death&#xD;
      following catheter ablation can be identified pre-operatively. Of all patients undergoing CA&#xD;
      for VT, more than a third are &quot;high risk&quot; with a one year risk of death of &gt;20%. Patients&#xD;
      older than 65 with prior catheter ablation and recurrent VT with impaired left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction ≤35% have 90 day VT recurrence rates of 30% and mortality of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with comorbidities such as Diabetes or COPD and those presenting in VT storm are&#xD;
      also at high risk of hemodynamic compromise and death following Catheter Ablation. Without&#xD;
      prophylactic LVAD placement, patients at high risk of haemodynamic instability (PAINESD score&#xD;
      ≥ 15) suffer 30% death at thirty days with 41% VT recurrence post CA. It is these &quot;high risk&quot;&#xD;
      patients that we believe will benefit from a non-invasive RA approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing a non-invasive Radio-Ablation (RA) procedure for VT similarly require&#xD;
      medical stabilization and multimodal imaging prior to treatment. Instead of an invasive&#xD;
      catheter-based electrophysiology study (EPS) and ablation, a non-invasive EPS (NIPS) is&#xD;
      performed under light sedation using ECGi mapping. This short procedure, averaging 40&#xD;
      minutes, requiring only the placement of an IV cannula for light sedation, uses the ICD to&#xD;
      stimulate VT which is mapped in real time using the CardioInsight ECGi mapping system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multimodal imaging data is digitally fused and then combined with the ECGi data to&#xD;
      identify the VT circuit(s) and to target the arrhythmogenic tissue for radio-ablation. This&#xD;
      analogue process is performed off- line by a committee of Cardiac Imaging and EP&#xD;
      Cardiologists and a Radiation Oncologist. Once the target(s) are identified, the treatment&#xD;
      plan is sent to Medical Physics for alignment on a 4D planning CT performed with breath&#xD;
      holding in the radiotherapy suite. Final treatment targets are reviewed by the local treating&#xD;
      team and discussed with our collaborators in St Louis. Thereafter the patient is booked for a&#xD;
      15 minute out-patient radiotherapy treatment performed on a standard linear accelerator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photon radiotherapy, as commonly used in cancer therapeutics across Canada, is guided using a&#xD;
      cone beam onto the cardiac target(s). A single fraction of 25 Gy is delivered painlessly over&#xD;
      15 minutes. Although minor side effects have been reported, serious adverse events are rare&#xD;
      and no ICD related issues have been described. No deleterious effects on cardiac function&#xD;
      (LVEF) have been observed although approximately (5/65? TBC) patients have required a two&#xD;
      week course of oral glucocorticoid therapy for symptomatic inflammation such as pericarditis&#xD;
      or pneumonitis post RA25. All patients are treated with Rivaroxaban 20 mg po as prophylaxis&#xD;
      against thromboembolism for thirty days post RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioablation is a novel procedure and long-term outcomes remain unknown. Reduction in VT is&#xD;
      reported to be 85-92% up to 6 months post RA and in the ENCORE -VT study 17 of 19 patients&#xD;
      were free from ICD shocks at 6 months. In the only prospective study of RA for VT, patients&#xD;
      reported an improvement in quality of life in 5 of 9 domains remaining unchanged in 4. Long&#xD;
      term safety data continue to be collected but cardiac irradiation &lt;40 Gy has been&#xD;
      historically associated with an approximate 1% excess mortality over years to decades in&#xD;
      those receiving treatment for breast or lung cancer. This is in the context of a total&#xD;
      mortality of 28% over 24 months of follow up in those undergoing CA for recurrent VT in&#xD;
      Canada.&#xD;
