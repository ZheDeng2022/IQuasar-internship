  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial comparing immediate endoscopic necrosectomy vs. step-up endoscopic&#xD;
      interventions in patients with necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with necrotizing pancreatitis, there has been a recent shift away from surgical&#xD;
      debridement (surgical necrosectomy) towards minimally invasive endoscopic treatment.&#xD;
      Endoscopic management involves the creation of a fistula (tract) between the gastric or&#xD;
      duodenal wall and the necrotic collection, under the guidance of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)&#xD;
      with subsequent placement of a stent. In addition, performing endoscopic necrosectomy, which&#xD;
      involves extraction of necrotic material under direct endoscopic visualization has increased&#xD;
      rates of treatment success to greater than 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However to date, there are currently scant data on the optimal timing of endoscopic&#xD;
      necrosectomy. The aim of this randomized trial is therefore to compare the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      between patients undergoing immediate endoscopic necrosectomy compared to step-up endoscopic&#xD;
      interventions in patients undergoing endoscopic therapy for necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;
