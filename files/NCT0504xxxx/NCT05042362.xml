  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat women who have hot flashes after women have&#xD;
      been through the menopause. Hot flashes are caused by the hormonal changes that happen when a&#xD;
      woman's body has been through the menopause. Menopause is when women stop having a menstrual&#xD;
      cycle, also called a period. During the menopause, the ovaries increasingly produce less sex&#xD;
      hormones as a result of the natural ageing process and related hormonal adjustments. The&#xD;
      decline in hormone production can lead to various symptoms which, in some cases, can have a&#xD;
      very adverse effect on a menopausal woman's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment, elinzanetant, was developed to treat symptoms caused by hormonal&#xD;
      changes. It works by blocking a protein called neurokinin from sending signals to other parts&#xD;
      of the body, which is thought to play a role in starting hot flashes. There are treatments&#xD;
      for hot flashes in women who have been through the menopause, but may cause medical problems&#xD;
      for some people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers will learn how well elinzanetant works compared to a placebo&#xD;
      in women who have been through the menopause and have hot flashes. A placebo looks like a&#xD;
      treatment but does not have any medicine in it. To compare these study treatments, the&#xD;
      doctors will ask the participants to record information about the participants' hot flashes&#xD;
      in an electronic diary. The researchers will study the number of hot flashes the participants&#xD;
      have and how severe the hot flashes are. The researchers will look at the results from before&#xD;
      treatment, after 4 weeks, and after 12 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in this study will take two capsules of either elinzanetant or the placebo&#xD;
      once a day. The participants who take elinzanetant will take it for 26 weeks. The&#xD;
      participants who take the placebo will take it for 12 weeks and then take elinzanetant for&#xD;
      the next 14 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the participants will visit the site approximately 9 times and perform 1&#xD;
      visit by phone. Each participant will be in the study for approximately 36 weeks. The&#xD;
      treatment duration will be 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  record information about the participants' hot flashes in an electronic diary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  answer questions about the participants' symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      The doctors will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  check the participants' health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  take blood samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ask the participants questions about what medicines the participants are taking and if&#xD;
           the participants are having adverse events An adverse event is any medical problem that&#xD;
           a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse events that happen&#xD;
           in studies, even if doctors do not think the adverse events might be related to the&#xD;
           study treatments.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS SD SF 8b includes 8 items assessing sleep disturbance over the past 7 days. Items assess sleep quality, sleep depth and restoration associated with sleep, perceived difficulties with getting to sleep or staying asleep and perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep. Participants respond to the items on a 5-point scale from not at all, never or very poor to very much, always or very good. Four of the items are scored reversely. Total scores range from 8 to 40, with higher scores indicating greater severity of sleep disturbance.</description>

    <description>The MENQOL questionnaire is comprised of 29 items assessing the presence of menopausal symptoms and the impact of menopause on health-related quality of life over the past week. The items assess four domains of symptoms and functioning: VMS, psychosocial functioning, physical functioning, and sexual functioning. For each item, the participant indicates if they have experienced the symptom (yes/no). If participants select yes, participants rate how bothered they were by the symptom using a six-point verbal descriptor scale, with response options ranging from 0 'not at all bothered' to 6 'extremely bothered'. Based on the individual responses, item scores, domain scores, and a total MENQOL score are calculated. Each score ranges from 1-8, higher scores indicate greater bother.</description>

Each item is a list of four statements arranged in increasing levels of severity about a particular symptom of depression. Items use a 4-point verbal response scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (extreme form of each symptom); specific response options are tailored to the aspect of depression being measured in each item. A total score ranging from 0 to 63 is calculated with scores of 0-13 indicating mild minimal range, 14 - 19 mild depression, 20 - 28 indicating moderate and 29 - 63 severe depression (higher score = greater depression).</description>
