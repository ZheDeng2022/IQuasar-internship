      A Phase II Study of Nivolumab with Ipilimumab and Cabozantinib in Patients with Untreated&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of the combination of nivolumab&#xD;
      with ipilimumab and cabozantinib in patients with untreated brain metastases from RCC until&#xD;
      disease progression or intolerable toxicities or patient withdrawal. We will accrue a total&#xD;
      of 40 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with nivolumab (3mg/kg) and ipilimumab (1mg/kg) IV every 3 weeks for&#xD;
      4 doses and cabozantinib 40mg daily, then nivolumab 480mg IV Q 4 weeks and cabozantinib 40mg&#xD;
      daily until progression or intolerable toxicities and patient's withdrawal. A lead-in group&#xD;
      of 6 patients will be closely monitored for DLT, if stopping criteria (&gt;3 patients develop&#xD;
      DLTs) is met then treatment will be switched to Nivolumab plus Cabozantinib.&#xD;
