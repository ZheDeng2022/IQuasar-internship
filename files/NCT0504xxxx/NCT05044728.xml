  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest malignant solid tumor (mainly lung and esophageal cancer) is a common malignant tumor&#xD;
      that seriously threatens the health of residents in China. Its morbidity and mortality rank&#xD;
      first, sixth, first, and fourth among all malignant tumors respectively. The treatment effect&#xD;
      is not satisfactory, and the overall 5-year survival rate after surgery alone is about&#xD;
      20%-35%. Recent studies have shown that neoadjuvant therapy combined with surgery in the&#xD;
      treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer and lung cancer can significantly improve the&#xD;
      efficacy compared with surgery alone. The results of multiple international and multi-center&#xD;
      neoadjuvant immunotherapy showed that this new model of combined immunoadjuvant immunotherapy&#xD;
      brought a breakthrough point for the treatment of malignant solid tumors of the chest.&#xD;
      However, its safety and target benefit groups are still the biggest problems, and there is a&#xD;
      large room for improvement. To develop the optimal treatment strategy, it is necessary to&#xD;
      further clarify the immunomodulatory mechanisms of neoadjuvant CTIO, explore and develop new&#xD;
      evaluation methods and prognostic biomarkers for the selection of targeted benefit patients,&#xD;
      and the evaluation of efficacy. This is a key scientific issue in the current neoadjuvant&#xD;
      CTIO treatment mode for thoracic malignant solid tumors, mainly lung and esophageal squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, which urgently needs to solve its safety and select the benefit population.&#xD;

      As a major participant in cellular immunity, CD8-positive T cells are considered to be the&#xD;
      main anti-tumor immune effector cells. In addition to producing specific immune responses to&#xD;
      viruses and other infections, their functional subsets are closely related to the occurrence&#xD;
      and development of major human diseases. Therefore, we have reason to believe that the&#xD;
      combination of dynamic monitoring of host immune background and traditional clinical&#xD;
      evaluation can effectively clarify the immune background of patients with lung cancer and&#xD;
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and provide new ideas and methods for the selection of&#xD;
      appropriate immunotherapy regimen and prognosis evaluation. However, the research in this&#xD;
      field is still in its infancy.&#xD;
