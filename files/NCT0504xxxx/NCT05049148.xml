  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Platelets are primarily known for their central role in primary hemostasis. However, they are&#xD;
      increasingly recognized for their participation in various non-hemostatic processes, such as&#xD;
      cancer progression and clinical expression. Experimental and clinical data indicate that the&#xD;
      involvement of platelets in the pathophysiology of cancer goes far beyond the realm of&#xD;
      cancer-associated thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several experimental studies have shown that platelets can promote the metastatic process by&#xD;
      various mechanisms. However, while it has been shown in vitro that direct contact with&#xD;
      platelets initiates tumor cells for metastasis, it remains unclear whether such contacts&#xD;
      occur in solid tumors. In addition to their ability to promote metastasis, platelets have&#xD;
      been shown to stimulate angiogenesis and play a crucial role in lymphangiogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that blood vessels, lymphatics and immune cells are major components of the tumor&#xD;
      ecosystem, our hypothesis is that platelets contribute to the development and / or regulation&#xD;
      of the tumor microenvironment. This is because platelets stabilize tumor blood vessels by&#xD;
      permanently repairing vascular damage caused by immune cells infiltrating tumors. Targeting&#xD;
      platelets destabilizes tumor vessels, causing intra-tumor hemorrhage, which allows&#xD;
      intra-tumor accumulation of intravenously administered anti-tumor drugs such as paclitaxel&#xD;
      and improves their efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also reported the role of platelets in several pathogenic mechanisms of cancer:&#xD;
      thrombocytosis is a paraneoplastic syndrome which suggests a poor prognosis in patients with&#xD;
      solid tumors; a negative correlation between the platelet count and the response to&#xD;
      chemotherapy has been reported in several types of cancer; histological analyzes of&#xD;
      esophageal cancer suggested a possible association between the presence of platelets in the&#xD;
      tumor stroma and the level of tumor lymphangiogenesis and lymphovascular invasion; finally, a&#xD;
      recent study reported the expression of one of the main targets of immunotherapies, PD-L1, on&#xD;
      the platelets of patients suffering from different types of solid cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these data support our hypothesis that platelets are components and / or regulators of&#xD;
      the tumor microenvironment and therefore potential targets for the improvement of anti-tumor&#xD;
      therapies. In this context, the objectives of our project are to determine whether platelets&#xD;
      are components of the microenvironment of tumors of the central nervous system, and to study&#xD;
      the possible correlations between the intratumoral presence of platelets and the evolution of&#xD;
      patients with central nervous system tumors&#xD;
