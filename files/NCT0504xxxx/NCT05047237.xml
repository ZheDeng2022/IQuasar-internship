  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to explore whether a pharmacist-led diabetes management&#xD;
      program can help optimize diabetes care for older adults. Participation in this study will&#xD;
      involve meeting with a pharmacist who works with subjects' doctors, getting some routine&#xD;
      bloodwork typical for people with diabetes, and potentially adjusting the subject's diabetes&#xD;
      medications to reach American Diabetes Association guidelines. This study aims to bring older&#xD;
      adults with diabetes whose measurements and medications are different from the guidelines of&#xD;
      the American Diabetes Association into guidelines-based ranges.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic pilot study assessing the feasibility and acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary impact of a pharmacist-led care pathway to align patient care with guidelines for&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) management in frail older adults, leveraging existing&#xD;
      resources and pathways of care led by Clinical Prescribing Pharmacists. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will be identified from the Electronic Health Record (EHR). Research staff will then approach&#xD;
      the primary care physicians for identified patients to confirm that patients are appropriate&#xD;
      for the intervention, as determined by the primary care physician (PCP). Patients will then&#xD;
      be contacted both by letter and phone call, and invited to participate in the pharmacist-led&#xD;
      pathway. Telephonic informed consent will be obtained. Outcomes for all participants will be&#xD;
      accessed passively via the EHR. The study team hypothesizes that patients who go through the&#xD;
      pharmacist-led primary care intervention will be more likely to have guideline-concordant&#xD;
      medical therapy as compared with an EHR-based control group. Also, the study team believes&#xD;
      that the intervention will reach at least 50% of those referred by their physicians to&#xD;
      participate, the median number of outpatient visits will be three or less, and that the&#xD;
      intervention will require a total of &lt;3 hours for pharmacists and patients across the 3-month&#xD;
      intervention period. In addition, the study team expects patients, physicians, and&#xD;
      pharmacists will report the intervention is feasible, acceptable, appropriate, and&#xD;
      high-value. Lastly, the study team believes that the intervention group will have a lower&#xD;
      mortality than the comparison group.&#xD;
