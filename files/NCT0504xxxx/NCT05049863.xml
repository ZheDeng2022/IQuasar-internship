  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and allopurinol to&#xD;
      chemotherapy in patients with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) will be safely tolerated&#xD;
      and improve outcomes, as measured by response rate and progression-free survival in patients&#xD;
      compared to other single agent chemotherapy drugs used in historical controls.&#xD;

    <description>ORR is defined as the proportion of patients achieving a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1&#xD;
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10 mm. Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.&#xD;
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Use of MMF during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of first trimester&#xD;

             of CYP3A4. Strong CYP3A4 inducers should be discontinued for at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
             starting irinotecan therapy. Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be discontinued at least&#xD;
