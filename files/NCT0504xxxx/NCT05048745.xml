    <textblock>
      COVID-19 infection is a global pandemic that locked down hospitals and made patients fear to&#xD;
      consult for medical health problems especially acute abdominal pain. Subsequently,&#xD;
      complicated appendicitis namely appendicular abscess in increasing. The best treatment of an&#xD;
      appendicular abscess is percutaneous drainage while no studies are dealing with recurrent&#xD;
      appendicitis in cases without interval appendectomy during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study&#xD;
      aimed to evaluate recurrent appendicitis after successful drainage of appendicular abscess&#xD;
      without interval appendectomy during COVID.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort study conducted in the surgical emergency units of University Hospitals&#xD;
      between 15th March 2020 to 15th August 2020 on 316 patients admitted during the study period&#xD;
      with the clinical diagnosis of a successful drained appendicular abscess. (Open or&#xD;
      radiological).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19) was first discovered in Wuhan in China at&#xD;
      the end of 2019 then at the beginning of 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) announced&#xD;
      COVID-19 as a global pandemic [1]. Because the virus is highly infectious, hospitals all over&#xD;
      the world became overloaded by COVID-19 infected patients, and a state of emergency is&#xD;
      announced and the population was advised to stay at home. Moreover, people were afraid to&#xD;
      become infected by the virus and hence there is marked reductions in consultation of medical&#xD;
      advice even the acute abdominal cases. [2-3] Acute appendicitis is the commonest cause of&#xD;
      acute abdomen in all ages with an incidence risk of 7%-8% worldwide [4]. Complicated&#xD;
      appendicitis represents nearly4%-25% of cases [5]. Appendicular abscess formation occurs in&#xD;
      2-7% of patients with perforated appendicitis [6]. Delay in medical consultation is a leading&#xD;
      cause for developing complicated appendicitis [5]. In patients with an appendicular abscess,&#xD;
      a non-operative treatment, with ultrasonography of computerized tomography (CT) guided&#xD;
      drainage and antibiotic treatment is starting initially and then interval appendectomy is&#xD;
      performed later. This approach lowers the peri- and postoperative complications [7-10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons preferring interval appendectomy have a concept that the incidence of recurrence of&#xD;
      appendicitis is high and by performing interval appendectomy the underlying pathology like&#xD;
      Crohn's disease or malignancy cannot be missed and dealt with in time [11]. Others have&#xD;
      opposed this concept as the reported incidence of recurrent appendicitis is ranges from 3.4%&#xD;
      to 25.5%, with the greatest risk during the first 3 months after the initial episode [12-13].&#xD;
      The aim was evaluating recurrence appendicitis (the true incidence, rate, severity , and risk&#xD;
      factors) in patients treated without interval appendectomy in cases following successful&#xD;
      drainage of appendicular abscess during the pandemic of COVID-19. Previous studies handled&#xD;
      recurrent appendicitis but non-complicated patients, however, Up to our knowledge, no study&#xD;
      handled the actual recurrence rates severity, and risk factors in non-operative treatment of&#xD;
      complicated appendicitis with abscess during the COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Material and Methods: 3.1 Study design and setting: Prospective cohort study conducted in&#xD;
      the surgical emergency units of University Hospitals between 15th March 2020 to 15th August&#xD;
      2020 on 316 patients admitted during the study period with the clinical diagnosis of a&#xD;
      successful drained appendicular abscess. (Open or radiological). This study is compliant with&#xD;
      the STROCSS criteria [14].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Patient selection: Inclusion criteria included age &gt;16 years, both sex and successful&#xD;
      drained appendicular abscess while exclusion criteria included patients 16â‰¤ years,&#xD;
      generalized peritonitis, pregnancy, cases suspected of cancer caecum, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease, failure or difficult initial drainage e.g. pelvic abscess, appendectomy performed at&#xD;
      the time of drainage, non-cooperative patients for regular follow up and abscess less than 3&#xD;
      cm if showed improvement of clinical and radiological signs within 3 days of antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Types of outcome measures: The outcomes were incidence, severity, and risk factors of&#xD;
      recurrence appendicitis in patients without interval appendectomy (clinical or radiological&#xD;
      at any time point during follow up period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Outcomes measurement: The diagnosis of the appendicular abscess was based on presentation&#xD;
      with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, fever, palpable or suspicion of a mass with&#xD;
      tenderness. The presence of abscess was confirmed in all patients by ultrasound (US) or&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) scan. Morbidity and mortality were evaluated by Dindo and Clavien&#xD;
      classification [15]. Successful drainage was detected by the absence of symptoms and&#xD;
      normalization of laboratory and radiological investigation (WBCs and sonar). Recurrent&#xD;
      appendicitis was diagnosed if recurrent abdominal pain was associated with tenderness/&#xD;
      rebound tenderness with or without fever. The severity of recurrent appendicitis is measured&#xD;
      by a score [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.5 Procedure: appendectomy was performed either by open approach (77.1% of cases) or&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach in the remaining cases. Steps of operations were according to ordinary&#xD;
      steps described in the previous study [17]. All appendixes were examined histologically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.6 discharge and follow up parameters Following successful drainage of appendicular abscess,&#xD;
      Patients were discharged from the hospital when normalization of white blood cell count&#xD;
      (below 12,000 cells/mm3), absent fever, no abdominal pain nor tenderness, and ability to&#xD;
      tolerate oral intake. Patients were typically discharged on oral antibiotics for a week in&#xD;
      the form of third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole. Those discharged from the&#xD;
      hospital were followed up in an outpatient department monthly for the first three months, and&#xD;
      once every three months for the following nine months. During the outpatient interviews, all&#xD;
      patients were clinically examined. Colonoscopy and CT were performed routinely on patients&#xD;
      above the age of 40years. Patients with recurrent symptoms of appendicitis were offered&#xD;
      appendectomy. The patients not attending the outpatient visit were also contacted by&#xD;
      telephone or e-mail to obtain information on their status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study evaluated recurrent appendicitis(incidence, rate, severity and risk factors) after&#xD;
      successful drainage of appendicular abscess without interval appendectomy during one year&#xD;
      follow up in the era of COVID-19 when there is a global tendency for postponing non-emergent&#xD;
      surgeries. One of these cases was interval appendectomy following drainage of an appendicular&#xD;
      abscess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although previous studies handled recurrent appendicitis following successful drainage of an&#xD;
      appendicular abscess but these studies were performed before the era of COVID-19, while,&#xD;
      other studies faced recurrent appendicitis in the era of COVID-19 with non-operative&#xD;
      treatment but in non-complicated appendicitis. Yet, no studies faced recurrent appendicitis&#xD;
      following complicated appendicitis drainage in the era of COVID-19. Based on our results, we&#xD;
      found that recurrent appendicitis occurred in 30.4% of cases underwent successful drainage of&#xD;
      appendicular abscess during 1 year follow up during COVID-19, and 43.7% of them, recurrence&#xD;
      occurred within the first 3 months after drainage and 56.3% of them showed recurrence after 3&#xD;
      month up to 1 year. Incidence of recurrent appendicitis is high in our results and this is&#xD;
      attributed to the fact that COVID-19 induces vasculitis and thrombotic occlusion of the&#xD;
      appendicular artery. Furthermore, COVID-19 causes hyperplasia of lymphoid tissue in the wall&#xD;
      of the appendix causing an obstruction. Kaplan-Meier curve (Fig 2) confirmed that the rate of&#xD;
      recurrent appendicitis is 13.3% in the first 3 months; then, later, the rate of recurrent&#xD;
      appendicitis increased reaching up to 30% at one year follow up. So, we recommend performing&#xD;
      interval appendectomy that will prevent recurrent appendicitis in 56.3% of cases of recurrent&#xD;
      appendicitis and prevent the high rate of recurrent appendicitis after 3rd month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of recurrent appendicitis varies between studies that may be as low as 8.9% [7] and&#xD;
      13% in a recent study published just before COVID-emergency [18] up to 27% in a third&#xD;
      study[19]. Our study showed a higher recurrence rate (30.4%) that was most probably due to&#xD;
      infection with covid-19. A study by Lai et al., [11] stated that the rate of appendicitis&#xD;
      recurrence after conservative treatment was 25.5%; most recurred within 6 months after&#xD;
      discharge (83.3%). The benefit of preventing recurrence is less than 16% if interval&#xD;
      appendectomy is performed 6 weeks after discharge and less than 10% if it is done 12 weeks&#xD;
      later. Another prospective study revealed that inÂ¬terval appendectomy done at 6 and 12 weeks&#xD;
      had preventÂ¬ed 10.6% and 6.7% of recurrent appendicitis respectively [20] which means that in&#xD;
      89.4% and 93.3% the interval apÂ¬pendectomy done was unnecessary. Our study showed that&#xD;
      interval appendectomy could prevent 56.3% of recurrent appendicitis after 3 months (which is&#xD;
      higher than the previous study). Infection with COVID-19 is the probable cause of a high&#xD;
      incidence of recurrent appendicitis after 3 months. Before conducting our study, we thought&#xD;
      that recurrent appendicitis during COVID-19 would be greater in severity. This thought was&#xD;
      logical due to vasculitis and lymphoid hyperplasia, but the opposite result we found. We&#xD;
      found that although the incidence of recurrent appendicitis is high, however, most cases were&#xD;
      low in severity (63.5% grade I).Other studies agreed with this results in that severity of&#xD;
      appendicitis is less in covid-19 [21-22]. We failed to explain this finding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our centers, laparoscopic appendectomy is the method of choice in treating acute&#xD;
      appendicitis. However, during the era of covid-19; this trend was changed in our hospitals&#xD;
      for fear of aerosol-induced transmission of covid-19 infection. most cases of recurrent&#xD;
      appendicitis(77.1%) operated by open appendectomy. this attitude was approved by many studies&#xD;
      [23-27] While another study [28] did not approve this consent and confirmed that the risks of&#xD;
      laparoscopy are less than its benefits. Subsequently, our result showed that intraoperative&#xD;
      complications occurred in 7.3% of cases mostly bleeding cystic artery while postoperative&#xD;
      complications occurred in 15.6% of cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During covid-19, it is of profound importantance to detect risk factors and predictors of&#xD;
      recurrent appendicitis during follow-up period. These patients are at great risk and interval&#xD;
      appendectomy is intended for those patients. These predictors are older age (ASA III),&#xD;
      abscess size &gt; 3cm, and diabetes mellitus. Older age patients are susceptible to covid-19&#xD;
      infection due to decreased immunity especially if associated with other co-morbidities as D.M&#xD;
      and hypertension. Older age is associated with atherosclerosis of the appendicular artery and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis developed earlier in diabetic patients. A study that faced risk factors for&#xD;
      recurrent appendicitis [13] stated that by using Cox regression, sex had a slight influence&#xD;
      on recurrent appendicitis (hazard ratio males vs. females=0.52, 95% CI, 0.27- 0.99, P=.05).&#xD;
      Age, Charlson comorbidity index, type of appendicitis, or percutaneous abscess drainage did&#xD;
      not influence recurrence.&#xD;
