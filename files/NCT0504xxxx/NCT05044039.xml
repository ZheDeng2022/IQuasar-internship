  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR T-cell) therapy produces impressive response&#xD;
      rates in heavily pre-treated patients, early loss of response remains a barrier. One&#xD;
      potential mechanism of relapse is limited CAR T-cell persistence. Pre-clinical research shows&#xD;
      that PI3K inhibition represents an intriguing mechanism for increasing CAR T-cell persistence&#xD;
      that is easily reversible and CAR T-cell agnostic. The investigators hypothesize that PI3K&#xD;
      inhibition with duvelisib would be safe, may provide effective prophylaxis against cytokine&#xD;
      release syndrome (CRS), and may enhance the persistence and efficacy of CAR T-cells in the&#xD;
      treatment of hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
