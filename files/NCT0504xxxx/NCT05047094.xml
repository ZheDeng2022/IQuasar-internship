    <textblock>
      A unique combinational treatment for cancer employing intratumoral diffusing alpha radiation&#xD;
      emitter device with check point inhibitor for recurrent unresectable or metastatic Head and&#xD;
      Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, open-label, one arm, single center two-stage adaptive trial&#xD;
      designed to stop for either futility or efficacy after the first stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This approach will combine Diffusing Alpha Radiation Emitters seeds implantation along with&#xD;
      standard treatment of Pembrolizumab for patients with recurrent unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (mHNSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DaRT seeds will be implanted in the target lesion and removed 15-22 days after&#xD;
      implantation. Concurrently, patient will receive standard treatment of Pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease evaluation will be assessed by a radiological imaging every 6 weeks starting at day&#xD;
      42 after the DaRT insertion procedure.&#xD;
