    <textblock>
      This study aims to estimate the levels of pain and discomfort associated with the en-masse&#xD;
      retraction of the six upper anterior teeth and assisted by either conventional or flapless&#xD;
      corticotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-four adult patients exhibiting class ÐŸ division 1 malocclusion will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated to either the conventional corticotomy group or the flapless corticotomy group, and&#xD;
      they will be treated by extraction of maxillary first premolars with applying mini-screws&#xD;
      between maxillary second premolar and first molar as temporary skeletal anchorage devices&#xD;
      (TSADs). The levels of pain and discomfort will be rated after 24 hours of corticotomy (T1),&#xD;
      four days (T2), seven days (T3), 14 days (T4) and after 28 days of corticotomy, by asking the&#xD;
      patients to fill in a questionnaire for assessing levels of pain and discomfort.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing the treatment duration is one of the most important difficulties facing the&#xD;
      orthodontist. Several therapeutic procedures accompanying orthodontic treatment have been&#xD;
      introduced in order to reduce the treatment duration and the most important one is the&#xD;
      corticotomy. Although traditional corticotomy proved to be effective in accelerating&#xD;
      different types of tooth movement, it is considered aggressive in nature. Hence, there is an&#xD;
      interest to develop minimally invasive surgical techniques. These techniques include the&#xD;
      flapless corticotomy using the piezosurgery device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In flapless corticotomy group, vertical soft-tissue incisions will be made on the buccal and&#xD;
      palatal gingiva. One incision will be made between the roots of the six upper anterior teeth,&#xD;
      and two incisions will be made between the upper canines and second premolars. The incisions&#xD;
      will be 5 mm long and started 4 mm apical to the interdental papilla. Then a piezosurgery&#xD;
      knife will be inserted to perform the cortical alveolar incisions with 3-mm in-depth and 8-mm&#xD;
      in length. No suturing will be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In traditional corticotomy group, a full-thickness mucoperiosteal flap will be elevated,&#xD;
      extended from the distal side of the second premolar on the right side to the same position&#xD;
      on the left side without performing any vertical releasing incisions. The full-thickness flap&#xD;
      will be extended 3 mm above the root apices, from the buccal and palatal sides. Then, one&#xD;
      vertical incision between the roots of upper anterior teeth and two vertical incisions in the&#xD;
      site of first premolar extraction will be made by the piezosurgery knife. The vertical&#xD;
      incisions will be connected by a horizontal incision using the piezosurgery knives. The&#xD;
      vertical incisions will be 3 mm in depth, starting 2-3 mm apical to the alveolar crest, and&#xD;
      extending 3 mm beyond the root apices. The interrupted technique of suturing will be done&#xD;
      using a non-absorbent 3-0 black silk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The levels of pain and discomfort will be rated after 24 hours of corticotomy (T1), four days&#xD;
      (T2), seven days (T3), 14 days (T4) and after 28 days of corticotomy, by asking the patients&#xD;
      to fill in a questionnaire based on the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and patient's responses&#xD;
      will be obtained regarding their feelings of pain, discomfort, swelling, mastication and&#xD;
      swallowing difficulties, jaw movement restriction, satisfaction and recommend the procedure&#xD;
      to a friend.&#xD;
