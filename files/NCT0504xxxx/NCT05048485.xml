  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this research are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the burden of intestinal parasitic infections among persons living with pulmonary&#xD;
           tuberculosis (TB)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether intestinal parasitic infections alter TB treatment outcomes, including speed of&#xD;
           sputum clearance and treatment outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the impact of malnutrition on speed of sputum clearance and TB treatment outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whether nutritional supplementation improves speed of sputum clearance and treatment&#xD;
           outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the researchers will investigate how intestinal parasites impact the&#xD;
      nutritional status of TB patients before the start of nutritional supplementation and how&#xD;
      they alter the trajectory of weight gain in those receiving supplementation by analyzing&#xD;
      results from 2 cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEOPARD Cohort 1-&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control-Enroll TB cases, screen for undernutrition, obtain stool for intestinal parasite&#xD;
           screening by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and assess them for treatment outcomes and&#xD;
           weight gain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TB LION (Learning Impact of Nutrition) - Enroll TB cases, provide nutritional&#xD;
           supplementation for 6 months (as part of existing TB LION study), screen for&#xD;
           undernutrition, obtain stool for intestinal parasite screening by PCR, and assess them&#xD;
           for treatment outcomes and weight gain&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEOPARD Cohort 2 -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enroll TB cases, screen for undernutrition, obtain stool for internal parasite screening&#xD;
           by PCR, and assess them for treatment outcomes and weight gain.&#xD;

    <description>BMI will be calculated as weight/height in kg/m2. The height of participants will be measured by study team members at a home visit . Height will be measured to the nearest 0.5 cm with a stadiometer (or knee height, ulnar length or arm span [demispan] for those persons unable to stand fully erect). Body weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg. Low BMIs &lt;18.5 are associated with malnutrition.</description>

      Blood, sputum and stool samples will be collected and some samples will be retained for&#xD;
      future testing. The PaxGene tubes will be collected and stored for future analysis to study&#xD;
      RNA sequences for transcriptional differences between persons with TB with and without&#xD;
      intestinal infections. Plasma samples and analysis of analytes will be analyzed to&#xD;
      investigate further the immunologic mechanisms and to assess how these responses are&#xD;
      modulated over time by treatment of parasites and by feeding individuals. Serum samples will&#xD;
      be retained for future analysis of micronutrients and assessment of the immune response.&#xD;
      Stool samples will be frozen for future microbiome analysis. Sputum samples obtained for the&#xD;
      study will be assessed for differentially culturable TB variants.&#xD;
