      INTRODUCTION: Chronic low back pain (CLBD) is one of the major public health problems in the&#xD;
      world. Given the complexity of the situation, complementary and alternative practices such as&#xD;
      pain neuroscience education (PNE), clinical hypnosis (HC) and osteopathic manipulative&#xD;
      treatment (OMT) are options for we manage these patients. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study&#xD;
      will be to evaluate the effects of OMT associated with PNE through HC on pain and disability&#xD;
      in patients with CLBP compared to PNE and HC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study design will be&#xD;
      a randomized clinical trial and 40 adults diagnosed with chronic low back pain will be&#xD;
      recruited. Subjects will be randomized in two groups: the first group (G1) will be submitted&#xD;
      to the PNE based on information from the book &quot;Explain Pain&quot; with hypnotic suggestions. Group&#xD;
      2 (G2) will receive PNE following the book &quot;Explain Pain&quot; with hypnotic suggestions&#xD;
      associated with OMT. Volunteers will be evaluated by a blind researcher the interventions&#xD;
      performed in the allocation of groups. The evaluation moments will be pre-intervention and&#xD;
      immediately after the end of the last intervention for G1 and G2. Volunteers continued to be&#xD;
      evaluated 4 weeks after completion of the protocols. Pain will be evaluated as the main&#xD;
      outcome, being evaluated by the numerical pain scale. Pain will also be assessed by the&#xD;
      pressure threshold using a pressure algometer device (Fnd-50, PIAB 50-n, Italy) in the lumbar&#xD;
      region. Still as the main outcome, disability will be assessed using the Oswestry Disability&#xD;
      Questionnaire. As secondary outcomes, the patient's global impression of improvement, central&#xD;
      sensitization, biopsychosocial factors will be evaluated. The patient's global impression of&#xD;
      improvement will be assessed using the Percentage of Improvement Scale with a score of -5 to&#xD;
      +5; the Central Sensitization will be assessed using the Central Sensitization Questionnaire&#xD;
      and the biopsychosocial factors using the Start Beck Toll questionnaire. In addition, the&#xD;
      behavior of the autonomic nervous system will be evaluated through the Heart Rate Variability&#xD;
      (HRV), which will be analyzed through linear methods, in the domains of time and frequency,&#xD;
      and by geometric indices. The researcher/evaluator will be blinded to the allocation of&#xD;
      intervention groups. Given the nature of the study, it is impossible to blind the&#xD;
      researcher/therapist and volunteers.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A simple randomized sequence will be created through the website www.randomization.com by a collaborator external to the researchers directly involved in the research. After the initial assessment, the researcher will access the randomization envelope and the participant will be allocated to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. The allocation will be hidden using opaque envelopes, sealed, and identified by number. The researcher/evaluator will be blinded to the allocation of intervention groups. Given the nature of the study, it is impossible to blind the researcher/therapist and volunteers</masking_description>
