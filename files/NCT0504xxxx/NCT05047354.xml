      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is a genetic disorder. It can cause birth defects and&#xD;
      developmental delays. There is no cure for SLOS or other inherited diseases related to&#xD;
      cholesterol production or storage. The data gained in this study may help researchers find&#xD;
      ways to measure how well future treatments work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about SLOS and related disorders and how these diseases affect participants and&#xD;
      relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People of any age who have or are suspected to have SLOS or another inherited disease related&#xD;
      to cholesterol production or storage. Relatives are also needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits every 6 to 12 months. They will have a physical exam. They will&#xD;
      fill out a survey about their medical and behavioral history. They may have an eye exam. They&#xD;
      may have a neurodevelopmental assessment. They may have a hearing test. Their outer and&#xD;
      middle ears may be examined. Their ability to speak, understand speech, eat, and swallow may&#xD;
      be assessed. They may get X-rays while they chew and swallow. Their functional ability and&#xD;
      needs for adaptive devices or braces may be assessed. They may have a lumbar puncture.&#xD;
      Photographs may be taken of their face and body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who cannot visit the NIH and relatives will have a virtual visit once a year.&#xD;
      They will talk about their medical history and symptoms. They give blood, urine, and skin&#xD;
      samples at a lab near their home. They will fill out a survey about their medical and&#xD;
      behavioral history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last for several years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive inborn error of metabolism&#xD;
      secondary to cholesterol synthesis abnormalities that usually manifests with a combination of&#xD;
      typical dysmorphology and intellectual disability. It is caused by homozygosity for&#xD;
      pathological variants of DHCR7, whose protein product catalyzes the conversion of&#xD;
      7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) to cholesterol. This results in deficiency of cholesterol and&#xD;
      build up of 7-DHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease frequency is estimated to be 1/40,000. There is a wide phenotypic spectrum from a&#xD;
      severe neonatal lethal disease to more recent descriptions of individuals who were found to&#xD;
      have normal intelligence with lifespan into adulthood. Since the identification of SLOS as an&#xD;
      inborn error of cholesterol synthesis other dysmorphology syndromes have been shown to be due&#xD;
      to an error of cholesterol biosynthesis. This protocol will support our ongoing efforts to&#xD;
      understand the pathological mechanisms underlying inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis and&#xD;
      to utilize that knowledge to develop and test potential therapeutic interventions. This&#xD;
      protocol will support an active translational research program into SLOS and other inborn&#xD;
      errors of cholesterol synthesis.&#xD;
