  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic valve disease (AVD) is the most common and age-related mortality in elderly patients&#xD;
      with valvular heart disease (VHD). Although transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has&#xD;
      been recommended at a higher level in foreign guidelines, there are still many high-risk and&#xD;
      severe elderly patients with VHD who have not received effective treatment because of many&#xD;
      complications and untimely medical treatment. Different from Europe and the United States,&#xD;
      the majority of patients with bicuspid aortic valve are in China, and the calcification is&#xD;
      more serious. The current clinical evaluation system and treatment guidelines can not be&#xD;
      effectively applied to the high-risk and complex elderly patients. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators should train and set up a valvular heart disease team, explore the technical&#xD;
      difficulties of TAVR treatment in such patients, establish emergency TAVR operation&#xD;
      mechanism, build a clinical evaluation system for high-risk and complex elderly patients with&#xD;
      aortic valve disease in China, evaluate the curative effect periodically and further optimize&#xD;
      the treatment strategy, so as to improve the quality of life and the meaning of life cycle of&#xD;
      elderly patients with VHD in China Great significance.&#xD;
