  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous thiazolidinediones (TZDs) have issued various safety concerns including weight gain,&#xD;
      bladder cancer, and congestive heart failure (CHF). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of lobeglitazone, a novel TZD in patients with type 2 diabetes in real world.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lobeglitazone have clinical trials conducted in Korean type 2 diabetics patients for 6 months&#xD;
      to up to 12 months, and the results of study on the efficacy and safety of lobeglitazone are&#xD;
      relatively limited. In pre-marketing clinical trials, a controlled group of patients is&#xD;
      enrolled to minimize other possible effects in determining the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, in real clinical practice, unexpectable safety information that has not been&#xD;
      discovered at the pre-marketing stage may accur because it is more extensively and longer&#xD;
      administered to a variety of patients who may have various underlying conditions and&#xD;
      diseases. Therefore, there should be an ongoing assessment of safety information in real&#xD;
      world. There have been the safety concerns of TZD, such as congestive heart failure (CHF),&#xD;
      fractures, bladder cancer (long-term use), edema, and weight gain. Previous study has&#xD;
      reported that lobeglitazone has better safety on bladder cancers and bone fractures than&#xD;
      other TZDs, but currently, there is a lack of large-scaled, long-term safety and efficacy&#xD;
      data of lobeglitazone in Korean real practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-interventional, multi-centered, retrospective and observational study and aimed&#xD;
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lobeglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes in real&#xD;
      world.&#xD;
