    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate whether treatment with melatonin has an&#xD;
      alleviating effect on Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) symptoms. Secondarily, the&#xD;
      effect of the treatment on bowel movements, other patient reported symptoms, quality of life,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, motilin levels, and microscopic changes in rectal&#xD;
      mucosa will be investigated.&#xD;

      This trial which will be conducted in two phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the study will be conducted as an internal feasibility test. Three patients&#xD;
      with major LARS will be included. Patients will be recruited from the Department of Surgery,&#xD;
      Zealand University Hospital. These patients will not be randomized nor blinded. They will&#xD;
      receive a 4-week treatment with 25 mg melatonin and will undergo the same questionnaires and&#xD;
      tests before and after treatment as in the randomized clinical trial. The preliminary results&#xD;
      from the internal feasibility test will allow us to assess potential difficulties related to&#xD;
      the administration or design, which then will be able to be corrected before the&#xD;
      randomization part is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second part of the will be conducted as a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      crossover study and will be testing whether treatment with melatonin has an alleviating&#xD;
      effect on Low Anterior Resection Syndrome (LARS) symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive 4 weeks of treatment with melatonin, followed by a 4&#xD;
      week wash out period, and then 4 weeks of treatment with placebo (M-P) or 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment with placebo, followed by a 4 week wash out period, and then 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      with melatonin (P-M). Both participants and investigators will be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be given questionnaires before and after each treatment period to assess&#xD;
      outcomes. Blood samples and rectal biopsies will be taken after each treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP) is a self-administered questionnaire. Patients are asked to specify one or two symptoms that concern them the most. Subsequently they evaluate the severity on a 7-point Likert scale. The second part of the questionnaire uses the same scale to assess whether the symptom limits or prevent any daily activity, and also to rate general well-being. Follow-up questionnaires address the original issues completed in the initial form. Symptom 1, symptom 2, activity, and wellbeing each have a separate score between 0 and 6 with 0 indicating &quot;as good as it could be&quot; and 6 &quot;as bad as it could be&quot;. An overall score is calculated by taking the average of item scores.</description>
