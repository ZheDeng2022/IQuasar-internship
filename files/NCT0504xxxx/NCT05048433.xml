      The purpose of this study is to develop an implementation strategy to improve the use and&#xD;
      sustainment of active learning in elementary schools and to conduct a feasibility study to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of the developed implementation strategy on the implementation and&#xD;
      effectiveness of active learning.&#xD;

    <description>Direct observation will be conducted by trained staff throughout the study.Fidelity quality is indicated based on the student response. This is determined by the approximate percent of students in the class who are participating in active learning averaged across the active learning sessions used.

    <description>The experimental arm includes using a multifaceted implementation strategy to support the use of active learning approaches. The strategy will consist of a series of skills-based staff trainings, identifying program champions to help lead efforts within the school, establishing an audit and feedback system to monitor the use of active learning, and a reinforcement system to recognize staff who are successfully implementing.</description>
