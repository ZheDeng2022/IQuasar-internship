  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Elective open-heart surgery involves physical and psychological strain for the person&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. Family plays a significant part in care before and after surgery, and the&#xD;
      family has care-needs of their own. Health services need to address the family-caregiver&#xD;
      burden as an essential aspect of care. Different methods aiming at stress reduction and&#xD;
      involvement of patients and family members in care exist. The evidence is conflicting&#xD;
      concerning which way is the most effective. Health-promoting conversations is an intervention&#xD;
      model promoting family well-being and alleviation of illness and illness-related suffering&#xD;
      for the whole family.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families´ in the intervention group in this trial will, before and after one family member's&#xD;
      elective open-heart surgery, participate in Health-promoting conversations. Health-promoting&#xD;
      conversation is an intervention model based on the Family Systems Nursing theory. The person&#xD;
      undergoing surgery decides which family members should be asked to participate in 1-3&#xD;
      conversations whit a family nurse. Effects on postoperative recovery, health-related quality&#xD;
      of life, stress, and patient and family involvement in care will be evaluated with patient-&#xD;
      and family reported outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to evaluate Health-promoting conversations effect on family wellbeing, functioning&#xD;
      and involvement in care. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
      (World-Medical-Association, 2008). The Swedish National Committee on Health Research Ethics&#xD;
      reviewed and accepted the study in march 2020 (nr 2019-06315)&#xD;
