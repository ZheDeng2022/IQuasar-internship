    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, open-label, single-arm, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of dupilumab subcutaneous (SC) injection monotherapy in Japanese participants aged 18&#xD;
      or older with CRSwNP that is not adequately controlled with existing therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study period (per participant):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period (2 to 4 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention Period (up to 52 weeks±3 days)&#xD;

    <measure>Proportion of participants with nasal polyp score (NPS) improvement from baseline ≥1 at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>NPS is the sum of the right and left nostrils, ranging from 0 (no polyps) to 8 (large polyps causing complete obstruction).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 24 in bilateral NPS</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>NPS is the sum of the right and left nostrils, ranging from 0 (no polyps) to 8 (large polyps causing complete obstruction).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 24 in in nasal congestion/obstruction (NC) symptom severity score using the CRSwNP nasal symptom diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The nasal congestion/obstruction scores are scored from 0 ('No symptoms') to 3 ('Severe symptoms').</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 24 in opacification of sinuses assessed by computerized tomography (CT) scan using the Lund Mackay (LMK) score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>LMK total score is based on assessment of the CT scan findings for each sinus area. The extent of opacification is rated between 0 (normal) to 24 (total opacification).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 24 in total symptom score (TSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The total symptom score (TSS) is a composite score (ranging between 0 and 9) consisting of the sum of the following symptoms assessed daily in the morning: nasal congestion/obstruction, decreased/loss of sense of smell, rhinorrhea (average of anterior/posterior nasal discharge).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 24 in loss of smell symptom severity score using the nasal symptom diary</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The loss of sense of smell symptom severity scores are scored from 0 ('No symptoms') to 3 ('Severe symptoms')</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to Week 24 in visual analogue scale (VAS) for rhinosinusitis</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS for rhinosinusitis ranges from 0 to 10 cm. Mild = VAS 0-3; Moderate = VAS &gt;3 to 7; Severe = VAS &gt;7 to 10.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
