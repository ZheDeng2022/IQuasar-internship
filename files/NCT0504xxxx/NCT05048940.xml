  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing solid organ transplantation randomly selected from those who have&#xD;
      received two doses of Spikevax (Moderna) vaccine, provided that a minimum of 8 weeks have&#xD;
      elapsed from the second dose to the time of the start of the trial. It is planned to include&#xD;
      386 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to evaluate the immunogenicity of reimmunization against&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 in patients undergoing solid organ transplantation with heterologous&#xD;
      revaccination, testing whether in patients who received two doses of Spikevax Moderna vaccine&#xD;
      there is a significant increase at 28 days in their antibody titers against SARS-CoV-2 after&#xD;
      receiving a dose of Janssen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the efficacy of reimmunization against SARS-CoV-2 in subjects undergoing&#xD;
           solid organ transplantation, in terms of incidence of infection and severity of COVID-19&#xD;
           after revaccination in the transplanted patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To gain insight into the humoral and cellular immune response conferred by the&#xD;
           sequential combination of both homologous and heterologous vaccination over one year, as&#xD;
           well as its duration in subjects undergoing solid organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the safety of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 in subjects undergoing solid organ&#xD;
           transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the potential existence of differences in humoral (Anti S Ac) and cellular&#xD;
           immune response depending on the immunosuppression regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the occurrence of side effects, including rejection and anti-HLA and DSA&#xD;
           antibodies after revaccination.&#xD;
