    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether the treatment intervention, tofacitinib:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impacts photosensitivity following ultraviolet light B (UVB) exposure in individuals&#xD;
           with systemic lupus and a history of cutaneous disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is associated with changes in cutaneous disease activity in individuals with systemic&#xD;
           lupus and a history of cutaneous disease after a 25-day regimen of tofacitinib&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is associated with changes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity in&#xD;
           individuals with systemic lupus and a history of cutaneous disease after a 25-day&#xD;
           regimen of tofacitinib, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is well tolerated in individuals with systemic lupus and a history of cutaneous disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays is a common trigger for increased disease activity (flare)&#xD;
      of both cutaneous lupus and systemic lupus. These flares can include rashes, fever, fatigue,&#xD;
      joint pain, and other symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical research study is to evaluate the impact of the study drug&#xD;
      (tofacitinib) on UV light-induced skin inflammation in systemic lupus patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total length of time involved for individuals who qualify for the study and decide to&#xD;
      participate is up to 40 days. Findings from the study will provide new information regarding&#xD;
      the mechanisms of photosensitivity in lupus and the potential ways to treat it. The new&#xD;
      information generated from this trial may lead to new therapies for Cutaneous Lupus&#xD;
      Erythematosus (CLE) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE).&#xD;

    <description>A measure of disease activity, the Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) is a validated, physician-based assessment tool used to measure cutaneous lupus severity. Severity is calculated based on disease activity (erythema and scale) and damage (dyspigmentation and scarring) for the cumulative areas of involved skin. Severity categories based on the CLASI activity score are as follows: mild (0-9), moderate (10-20), and severe (21-70).</description>

    <description>A measure of disease activity, the CLASI Damage Score is scored based on dyspigmentation and scarring. Evaluation of dyspigmentation and scarring is based on a table: rows represent anatomical areas and columns represent major clinical symptoms. The extent of involvement for each of the skin symptoms is documented for each anatomic area (dyspigmentation: 0=absent, 1=present; scarring: 0=absent, 1=scarring, 2=severely atrophic scarring or panniculitis).</description>
