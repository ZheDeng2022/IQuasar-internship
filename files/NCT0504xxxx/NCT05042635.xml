      The purpose of this study is to objectively and standardly evaluate the clinical efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of sequential treatment of psoriasis with traditional Chinese and Western medicine&#xD;
      through a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disease. The incidence of this disease is&#xD;
      increasing year by year, seriously affecting people's quality of life. Biologic agents have&#xD;
      the advantages of rapid and efficient treatment of moderate and severe psoriasis, but their&#xD;
      safety and recurrence are still seriously affect the application. Traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine treatment of psoriasis has the advantages of fewer adverse reactions, low recurrence&#xD;
      rate and improvement of patients' systemic symptoms while exerting the curative effect. The&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of psoriasis by combining traditional Chinese and Western medicine&#xD;
      has become the academic consensus. The sequential treatment of psoriasis with biological&#xD;
      agents combined with Traditional Chinese medicine has a better therapeutic effect than that&#xD;
      of single therapy. At present, the sequential treatment of psoriasis with targeted biological&#xD;
      agents combined with traditional Chinese medicine has not been reported in the literature,&#xD;
      and there is a lack of high-level clinical evidence to support it. Therefore, this project&#xD;
      aims to provide evidence support for the clinical efficacy and safety of sequential treatment&#xD;
      of psoriasis by traditional Chinese and Western medicine through a multi-center, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) score and recurrence assessment. Psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scores were assessed for all patients at each follow-up. Recurrence was defined as a 50% reduction in maximum PASI improvement from baseline at week 40.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Body surface area (BSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of BSA involved in psoriasis is estimated by fingerprinting, where the entire palm of the patient represents approximately 1% of the total BSA. The number of handprints on psoriasis skin in a body part is used to determine the extent to which the body part is affected by psoriasis (%).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)is scored on a 5-point scale, reflecting a global consideration of the erythema (E), infiltration (I),desquamation (D) across all psoriatic lesions. lt is calculated as follows: PGA score = (E +I+D) / 3 then the score needs to be rounded to the nearest whole number [PGA scale: Clear (0)-Very Severe (5)].</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life quality index(DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a participant-reported questionnaire used to measure the health-related quality of life (QOL) of adults suffering from a skin disease. Scores range from 0-30, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's quality of life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-reported quality of life (PRQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>PRQoL is used to assess the impact of psoriasis on individual social life. Scores range from 0-25, a higher score indicating a greater impact on a participant's social life.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Score (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used to measure lesion pruritus from 0 to 100 mm at eash visit (with 0 being no pruritis and 100 being maximum pruritis).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>CM symptom score</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 168 days after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The CM symptom score is used to assess changes in blood syndrome related symptoms during treatment.</description>
