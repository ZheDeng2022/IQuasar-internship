  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for individuals who have peritoneal mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of&#xD;
      your abdominal wall and organs (the peritoneum). Doctors leading the study would like to&#xD;
      determine the effects of treating this cancer with immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab - the two study drugs that will be used in this study) before and after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Doctors hope to learn if giving these two drugs before surgery will decrease the amount of&#xD;
      viable (live) cancer cells that remain at the time of surgery and whether it will delay the&#xD;
      time it could take for the cancer to regrow.&#xD;

    <measure>Peritoneal Carcinomatosis index (PCI) of Participants Who Taking Nivolumab Combined with Ipilimumab Before Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The effect of nivolumab and ipilimumab on participant's tumor as assessed by a peritoneal carcinomatosis index (PCI) score, a score determined based on the size of participant's tumor after abdominal surgery.&#xD;
The Peritoneal Cancer Index (PCI) scoring system is a diagnostic and prognostic tool. The PCI score is calculated by dividing the peritoneal (abdominal) cavity into 13 regions and assigning a score to each of the 13 regions. Each region receives a score of 0-3 based on the largest tumor size in each region. The total sum of all 13 regions is the PCI score. PCI scores can range from 0 to 39. Higher scores indicate more widespread and/or larger tumors in the peritoneal cavity.</description>

    <description>Individuals in this group will receive a combination of two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab and ipilimumab) before and after surgery to remove their cancer. There will also be a follow up period to determine how well the drugs and surgery worked to get rid of your cancer. Your overall participation in this study (including drug treatment, surgery and follow up visits) will last for roughly one and a half years. All eligible participant who enroll in the study will participate in this group.</description>
