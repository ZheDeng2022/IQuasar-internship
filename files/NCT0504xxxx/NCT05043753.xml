      The present trial intends to assess the diagnostic accuracy of symphysis fundal height (SFH)&#xD;
      as opposed to SFH combined with point of care ultrasound to measure the fetal abdominal&#xD;
      circumference (POC-US-AC) in identifying small and large for gestational age infants (SGA and&#xD;
      LGA infants) among low-risk pregnant women cared for by midwives after 35 weeks' gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low risk pregnancies will be evaluated at 35-38, 40, 41, and 41+ weeks' gestation by midwives&#xD;
      trained in SFH measurement and POC-US. Formal obstetric US performed by a perinatologist (i.e&#xD;
      high risk obstetrician) will be performed in case SFH and/or POC-US suspect fetal growth or&#xD;
      amniotic fluid abnormalities. Prenatal evaluations will be compared to actual birthweights.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Birthweight below the 10th (small for gestational age or SGA) or above the 90th (large for&#xD;
      gestational age or LGA) percentile for gestational age has been associated with adverse&#xD;
      maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes. As birthweight reflects intrauterine development,&#xD;
      accurate identification of abnormal fetal growth would allow obstetric providers to prevent&#xD;
      adverse outcomes and mitigate complications associated with abnormal development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symphysis fundal height (SFH) measured in centimeters after 24 weeks of gestation is&#xD;
      recommended as the standard of care to screen for fetal growth abnormalities among low-risk&#xD;
      pregnancies. This method is low-cost, and easy to perform, but there is a lack of evidence&#xD;
      supporting its effectiveness due to its poor sensitivity. Ultrasonography, the technique&#xD;
      utilized to identify fetal growth abnormalities, is a costly procedure which involves the use&#xD;
      of advanced equipment and providers, to perform and review the ultrasound, as well as a full&#xD;
      examination with multiple measurements and images. Despite a few encouraging reports,&#xD;
      insufficient evidence supports routine 3rd trimester ultrasound in low- risk pregnancies to&#xD;
      improve detection of abnormal fetal growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sonographic measurement of the abdominal circumference (AC) in the fetus was shown to be the&#xD;
      single most useful indicator of fetal growth. Measurement of AC does not require extensive&#xD;
      training, long time to acquire, or expensive ultrasound machines. It can be easily performed&#xD;
      in the office by midwives who are specifically trained in obtaining the measurement.&#xD;
      Therefore, we intended to evaluate if the use of bedside point of care ultrasound (POC-US) by&#xD;
      midwives to evaluate fetal AC during routine antenatal visits in low-risk pregnancies would&#xD;
      increase the accuracy of SFH in identifying fetuses with birthweight &lt; 10th or &gt; 90th, when&#xD;
      compared to SFH alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, investigator sponsored, two arms randomized controlled trial. Patients&#xD;
      who satisfy all inclusion criteria, have no exclusion criteria, and have signed the written&#xD;
      informed consent will be randomly assigned to screening of fetal growth abnormalities during&#xD;
      routine antenatal appointments held by midwives according to SFH or SFH + POC-US-AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low risk pregnant women are interviewed by a midwife at 35-38 weeks' gestation, who also&#xD;
      reviews their medical and obstetrical history, prenatal labs and the ultrasound reports to&#xD;
      discriminate between high and low-risk pregnancies. Patients who satisfy all inclusion&#xD;
      criteria and do not have any exclusion criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      different approaches to identify fetal growth abnormalities and predict abnormal birthweight,&#xD;
      after signing the written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening test in the control group: Symphysis fundal height measurement. Fundal height is&#xD;
      measured by trained midwives at each scheduled antenatal appointment from the pubis symphysis&#xD;
      to the top of the uterine fundus, using a paper measuring tape in centimeters. Size greater&#xD;
      than dates is suspected if the measurement is above the 90th gestational age specific&#xD;
      percentile according to the Intergrowth 21 SFH references (Papageorghiu 2016). Similarly,&#xD;
      size less than dates is recorded if the measurement is below the 10th percentile for age&#xD;
      according to the Intergrowth 21 SFH references (Papageorghiu 2016). Formal obstetric&#xD;
      ultrasound is requested if the SFH is &gt; 90th percentile, if it is &lt; 10th , or if it drops 50&#xD;
      growth centiles in two subsequent evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening test in the intervention group: Symphysis fundal height measurement + point of care&#xD;
      ultrasound. After assessing SFH at each clinical encounter, the midwife will perform a POC-US&#xD;
      to measure the fetal AC and evaluate the quantity of amniotic fluid. A positive screen for&#xD;
      fetal growth restriction (indicative of a potential SGA infant) consists in a measured AC&#xD;
      less than the 10th percentile for gestational age according to the standards defined by&#xD;
      Nicolini et al in 1986 on an Italian population; instead, a positive screen for macrosomia&#xD;
      (suggestive of a potential LGA infant) is an AC greater than the 90th percentile for&#xD;
      gestational age according to the references set by Nicolini et al in 1996. Formal obstetric&#xD;
      ultrasound is requested if the AC is &gt; 90th percentile, if it is &lt; 10th, or if it drops 50&#xD;
      growth centiles in two subsequent evaluations. Amniotic fluid volume will be evaluated&#xD;
      determining the deepest vertical pocket (DVP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A formal US is requested in case uterine size is measured as ≤ than the 10th or ≥ than the&#xD;
      90th percentile for gestational age according to Intergrowth 21, when POC - US reveals AC &lt;&#xD;
      10th percentile, AC &gt; 90th percentile according to Nicolini et al, in case DVP &lt; 2 x 1 cm, or&#xD;
      DVP &gt; 8 x 1 cm, or also if SFH or AC drop &gt; 50 percentiles comparing two subsequent&#xD;
      evaluations. Patients randomized to SFH + POC-US will have a formal US if either technique&#xD;
      suspects abnormal fetal growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formal US requested due to an abnormal screening test will be distinguished from scans&#xD;
      ordered due to other indications, such as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, or cholestasis&#xD;
      of pregnancy diagnosed after enrollment. Hadlock' s references will be used to estimate fetal&#xD;
      weight, and therefore to define FGR (i.e estimated fetal weight or AC &lt; 10th percentile) as&#xD;
      well as macrosomia (i.e estimated fetal weight or AC &gt; 90th percentile).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prenatal evaluation of fetal growth will be compared to the birthweight percentile according&#xD;
      to the INeS neonatal charts (Bertino 2010) to identify SGA, LGA and AGA (appropriate for&#xD;
      gestational age) infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial evaluation low risk pregnancies are scheduled for antenatal appointments&#xD;
      with a midwife at 40, 41 and 41+ weeks' gestation. All patients will have a POC-US by a&#xD;
      midwife at 41, and 41+ weeks' gestation to screen for amniotic fluid abnormalities associated&#xD;
      with protracted pregnancy, independently of the randomization arm. A midwife will perform SFH&#xD;
      or SFH + POCT-US (according to randomization) at enrolment (35-38 weeks' gestation) and at 40&#xD;
      weeks. As sonographic assessment of fetal growth should not be performed more frequently than&#xD;
      every 2 weeks due to the error associated with measurements; POC-US will only evaluate&#xD;
      amniotic fluid volume at 41 and 41+3 weeks' gestation (unless the patient has missed a&#xD;
      previous appointment), even among women randomized to SFH + POC-US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the most accurate approach to identify prenatally&#xD;
      those pregnancies that will result in SGA or LGA infants. Prenatal evaluation consists in a&#xD;
      universal screening test for fetal growth abnormalities (either SFH or SFH + POC US) followed&#xD;
      by a confirmatory test (formal obstetric US) performed only when the initial screening test&#xD;
      is positive. Fetal growth or amniotic fluid abnormalities are diagnosed in utero if confirmed&#xD;
      by a formal obstetric ultrasound, and not when only suspected by a screening test; in fact,&#xD;
      the study seeks to evaluate what is the most accurate combination of screening and&#xD;
      confirmatory tests, and not the effectiveness of the screening test alone.&#xD;

    <description>Midwives perform a POC-US to measure the fetal abdominal circumference (AC) and evaluate the quantity of amniotic fluid.&#xD;
In order to identify the appropriate sonographic plane the following markers need to be identified on POC-US&#xD;
Fluid filled fetal stomach on the left.&#xD;
Umbilical vein&#xD;
Umbilical portion of left portal vein within liver, as it meets the &quot;pars transversa&quot; (horizontal portion of left portal vein) seen as a right sided &quot; L &quot; or &quot; C &quot; shape.&#xD;
Fetal spine seen in cross section Amniotic fluid volume will be evaluated determining the deepest vertical pocket (DVP). Measurement is performed by assessing a pocket of maximal depth of amniotic fluid free of umbilical cord and fetal parts. The transducer is held perpendicularly to the patient's abdomen. The absence of a pocket measuring at least 2 cm in depth and 1 cm in width is indicative of oligohydramnios, while detection of a pocket measuring 8 cm or larger is suggestive of polyhydramnios (ACOG bulletin 175, 2016).</description>
