  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will develop and validate a platform for quantitative assessment of antiviral&#xD;
      effects in low-risk patients with high viral burdens and uncomplicated COVID-19. In this&#xD;
      randomised open label, controlled, group sequential adaptive platform trial, we will assess&#xD;
      the performance of three distinct types of intervention relative to control (no treatment):&#xD;
&#xD;
      A: potentially effective repurposed antiviral drugs;&#xD;
&#xD;
      B: Positive control: we will initially include the REGN-COV2 (monoclonal antibody cocktail);&#xD;
      and later:&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: any future small molecule drugs that pass phase 1 testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLATCOV study is funded by ACT-Accelerator Therapeutics Partnership through the Wellcome&#xD;
      Trust. The grant reference number is 223195/Z/21/Z&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The platform trial will assess drugs with potential SARS-CoV-2 antiviral activity of three&#xD;
      general types:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Repurposed potential antiviral drugs (initially from: hydroxychloroquine, ivermectin,&#xD;
      lopinavir-ritonavir, miglustat, remdesivir, nitazoxanide, nebulised unfractionated heparin&#xD;
      (UFH), favipiravir)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repurposed drugs are already recommended in some countries. Showing that they do not have a&#xD;
      significant antiviral activity is as important as showing that they do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Positive control: monoclonal antibody initially&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monoclonal antibodies are vulnerable to viral escape mutations. Tracking their performance&#xD;
      over time is important to characterise the impact and inform the therapeutics of mutant&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 strains. Monoclonal antibodies are expensive and cannot be produced at large scale&#xD;
      currently, but this may change in the near future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Novel small molecule drugs that have gone through phase 1 testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each site will include a negative control arm consisting of patients not receiving any study&#xD;
      drug except for antipyretics- paracetamol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At any given time in the study, it is possible that not all intervention arms are available.&#xD;
      Randomisation ratios will be uniform across all available treatment arms of type A and B and&#xD;
      the control arm in each site. Once interventions of type C (novel drugs) are added to the&#xD;
      platform, response adaptive randomisation will apply (&quot;pick the winner&quot;).&#xD;
