      The purpose of this study is to see whether avoiding preventative radiation to the groin in&#xD;
      patients with normal sentinel node biopsy and PET-CT, is at least as effective treating&#xD;
      cancer as giving preventative radiation to the groin for patients with anal canal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also want to know if avoiding radiation to the groin will cause fewer side&#xD;
      effects and better quality of life&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) with concurrent 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin-C (5FU/MMC) combination is the&#xD;
      treatment of choice for non-metastatic locally advanced anal squamous cell carcinoma (ASCC).&#xD;
      While, locally advanced AC treatment involves elective inguinal lymph node irradiation along&#xD;
      with concurrent chemotherapy with significant improvement of locoregional control and&#xD;
      colostomy free survival, many oncologists believe that routine, elective irradiation of&#xD;
      bilateral inguinal areas of patients with limited disease (T1-T3) without lymph node&#xD;
      involvement may be overtreatment and the larger radiation target that includes entire pelvis&#xD;
      and bilateral inguinal region causes significant acute and late toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SLNB is the standard procedure currently used for breast cancer staging. The most significant&#xD;
      observation was that when the SLN is negative, no further ALND or adjuvant axillary radiation&#xD;
      is need for those patients. The SLNB had shown a better diagnostic accuracy (31% vs.25%) and&#xD;
      higher sensitivity (85% vs.75%) than FDG-PET imaging to detect inguinal lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis. Given better diagnostic accuracy and high sensitivity of SLNB, this technique&#xD;
      could be used precisely to define target population who could be spared of prophylactic&#xD;
      inguinal irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients with early clinical stage node negative anal&#xD;
      cancer (T1-T3N0) have low risk of subclinical inguinal lymph node involvement that can be&#xD;
      detected by a combination of PET imaging and SLNB. Hence, any early stage AC patients with&#xD;
      node negative disease confirmed by PET imaging and SLNB have relatively low risk of nodal&#xD;
      failure and so inguinal radiation could be avoided. This approach would limit over treatment&#xD;
      of early stage patients, reduce acute and late toxicities. This will be tested in a phase II&#xD;
      study with close follow up of study patients so that inguinal relapse if any occur will be&#xD;
      salvaged successfully. If this treatment approach is successful, it could be practice&#xD;
      changing with improvement of H-QOL of patient.&#xD;
