  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose&#xD;
      study to assess the PK, safety, and tolerability of SYN-020 oral delayed release capsules&#xD;
      (SYN 020) in healthy adults. At least 1 exploratory PD endpoint will also be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Randomization to treatment will be stratified by sex, with equal numbers of males and females&#xD;
      receiving each treatment in each cohort. Up to 5 ascending-dose cohorts of 8 subjects each&#xD;
      will be enrolled, and all cohorts will be conducted as planned or until the safety data do&#xD;
      not support further escalation. SYN-020 (or placebo) will be administered every 12 hours for&#xD;
      14 consecutive days at escalating doses of 5, 15, 45, and 75 mg in Cohorts 1 through 4, and&#xD;
      at a dose not to exceed 75 mg in Cohort 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be screened within 28 days before admission to the clinical research unit&#xD;
      (CRU). For each cohort, eligible subjects will be admitted to the CRU on Day -1, and subjects&#xD;
      who remain eligible will receive the first dose of study drug in the morning (AM) of Day 1.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive study drug every 12 hours for 14 consecutive days. No restriction in&#xD;
      food or fluids is required around dosing for any dose other than the AM dose on Days 1 and&#xD;
      14. Subjects will also fast overnight before blood samples are collected for clinical&#xD;
      laboratory and/or PD tests on Days 2, 6, 8, 10, 14, and at the follow-up visit on Day 35. A&#xD;
      standard Western diet appropriate for a Phase 1 study will be provided at approximately the&#xD;
      same times each day during confinement, with each cohort receiving the same meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be discharged from the CRU after the End of Study (EOS) procedures are&#xD;
      completed in the AM on Day 15 and will return to the CRU for a follow-up visit on Day 35.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PK assessment, blood samples (primarily on Days 1 and 14) and feces (pre-dose and over&#xD;
      selected 48 hour time intervals) will be collected for analysis of SYN 020 concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PD assessment, blood will be collected and analyzed (or stored for future analysis) for&#xD;
      at least 1 of the exploratory endpoints. Fecal samples for PD assessment will be taken from&#xD;
      the feces collected for PK assessment. These investigations will explore potential biomarkers&#xD;
      for future SYN 020 indications and will be strictly and directly related to the pharmacology&#xD;
      of SYN 020. While gastrointestinal microbiome/metabolome analyses include genotyping of the&#xD;
      gut bacteria, no human genotyping will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored throughout the study. Safety assessments will&#xD;
      include clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12-lead ECGs, physical examinations,&#xD;
      monitoring for AEs, and ADA testing. Adverse event data will be collected from the time of&#xD;
      informed consent through the follow-up visit at Day 35 or until the AE resolves or becomes&#xD;
      stable.&#xD;
