  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      YH004 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to 4-1BB, and acts as an&#xD;
      agonist against 4-1BB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first in human study of YH004 is designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
      and/or the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of YH004, both as a single agent (monotherapy)&#xD;
      and in combination with a fixed dose of anti-PD-1 antibody (Toripalimab) in the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors and relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin Lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, FIH Phase 1 study, utilizing an accelerated&#xD;
      dose escalation followed by a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation algorithm to identify the MTD&#xD;
      and/or RP2D of YH004 as a single agent (monotherapy) and in combination with Toripalimab. The&#xD;
      first stage of the study is the dose escalation phase (i.e., Phase 1a). The second stage of&#xD;
      the study is the dose expansion phase (i.e., Phase 1b). During the study, dose&#xD;
      interruption(s) and/or delay(s) may be implemented based on toxicity. Dose modifications are&#xD;
      permitted following protocol guidelines. Intra-patient dose escalations will be allowed for&#xD;
      the early dose cohorts (single-patient dose groups) in Phase 1a. Patients will be considered&#xD;
      evaluable for safety and tolerability if they receive at least one dose of YH004 or&#xD;
      Toripalimab at the specified cohort dose. Patients in all parts of the trial will remain on&#xD;
      therapy until confirmed disease progression or for 1 year, whichever occurs first. However,&#xD;
      patients who are clinically unstable will discontinue following the initial assessment of&#xD;
      disease progression.&#xD;
