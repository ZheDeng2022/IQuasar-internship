&#xD;
          -  Female participants of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
             Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current bilateral tubal&#xD;

             bilateral salpingectomy, or post-menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the&#xD;
             participant:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has practiced effective contraception for 1 month prior to study intervention&#xD;
                  administration, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Has a negative pregnancy test on the day of study intervention administration,&#xD;
                  and&#xD;
&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any clinical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might pose additional&#xD;
             risk to the participant due to participation in the study or might confound post-study&#xD;
             intervention administration safety assessments (e.g., tattoos overlying either study&#xD;
             intervention administration site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component&#xD;
             of the study interventions, including a known history of severe allergic reaction&#xD;
             (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of any of the study vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of Guillain-Barré syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any history of myocarditis or pericarditis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute or chronic clinically significant pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic or renal&#xD;
             functional abnormality, as determined by medical history or physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on&#xD;
             medical history and physical examination (no laboratory testing required).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hypersensitivity to latex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For HZ/su and mRNA-1273 booster cohort: history of Herpes Zoster.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior/concomitant therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug, vaccine or medical device)&#xD;
             other than the study intervention(s) during the period beginning 30 days before the&#xD;
             first dose of study intervention(s) (Day -29 to Day 1), or their planned use during&#xD;
             the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol&#xD;
             in the period starting 30 days before first dose and ending 30 days after the last&#xD;
             dose of study intervention administration. However, for HZ/su and mRNA-1273 booster&#xD;
             cohort: licensed pneumococcal vaccines and non-replicating vaccines (i.e., inactivated&#xD;
             and subunit vaccines, including inactivated and subunit influenza vaccines, with or&#xD;
             without adjuvant for seasonal or pandemic flu) may be administered up until 8 days&#xD;
             prior to dose 1 of HZ/su and/or dose 2 of HZ/su and/or at least 14 days after any dose&#xD;
             of HZ/su. For Flu D-QIV and mRNA-1273 booster cohort: licensed pneumococcal vaccines&#xD;
             and non-replicating vaccines (i.e., inactivated and subunit vaccines, other than&#xD;
             influenza vaccines) may be administered up until 8 days prior to dose 1 of Flu D-QIV&#xD;
             and/or at least 30 days after any dose of Flu D-QIV. For time interval between other&#xD;
             routine vaccines with mRNA-1273 booster dose (administered in the study), local&#xD;
             guidelines must be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In case emergency mass vaccination for an unforeseen public health threat (e.g., a&#xD;
        pandemic) is organized by public health authorities outside the routine immunization&#xD;
        program, the time period described above can be reduced if necessary for that mass&#xD;
        vaccination vaccine, provided this vaccine is licensed and used according to its Product&#xD;
        Information.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study&#xD;
             period (e.g., infliximab).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products or plasma derivatives&#xD;
             during the period starting 3 months before the first dose of study intervention(s) up&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior planned or chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of&#xD;
             immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during the period starting 3 months&#xD;
             prior to the first vaccine. For corticosteroids, this will mean more than 14 days in&#xD;
             total of prednisone ≥20 mg/day or equivalent is not allowed. Inhaled, intra-articular&#xD;
             and topical steroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For HZ/su and mRNA-1273 booster cohort: Previous vaccination against Herpes Zoster&#xD;
             with the exception of receipt of live attenuated HZ vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Flu D-QIV and mRNA-1273 booster cohort: Administration of a seasonal influenza&#xD;
             vaccine during the 6 months preceding entry into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior administration of an investigational or licensed coronavirus (SARS-CoV,&#xD;
             MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2) vaccine except for mRNA-1273 vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any contraindication to the study intervention(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Prior/concurrent clinical study experience&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Planning to or concurrently participating in another clinical study (including current /&#xD;
        planned simultaneous participation in another interventional study to prevent or treat&#xD;
        COVID-19), at any time during the study period, in which the participant has been or will&#xD;
        be exposed to an investigational or a non-investigational vaccine / product (drug or&#xD;
        medical device).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Other exclusions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating female.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive&#xD;
             precautions within 2 months following last study vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Indications of drug abuse or excess alcohol use as deemed by investigator to&#xD;
             potentially confound safety assessments or render participant unable or unlikely to&#xD;
             adhere to protocol requirements.&#xD;
