  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is abnormal narrowing of the main blood vessel to the&#xD;
      kidney transplant and has historically been considered a surgical complication. In heart&#xD;
      transplantation, it has long been recognised that rejection can cause narrowing of the&#xD;
      heart's blood vessels, and that this complication is the leading cause of heart transplant&#xD;
      failure. It is reasonable to assume that this process may also occur in kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, which could contribute to premature transplant failure. However, in kidney&#xD;
      transplantation it is also likely that other factors, such as surgical factors, traditional&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors and immunological factors, contribute to the development of TRAS.&#xD;
      Given that the disease processes that cause TRAS are not fully understood, at present there&#xD;
      is no consensus among kidney doctors on the best means of treating patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      TRAS. The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the involvement of these different&#xD;
      processes in the development of TRAS, and investigate the optimal way to diagnose and manage&#xD;
      TRAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is no standard recommendation for how to treat patients with TRAS. This is&#xD;
      partly due to the fact that patients with TRAS may have a broad array of symptoms: Some may&#xD;
      have no symptoms, other may have problems with high blood pressure or fluid accumulation, and&#xD;
      others may have severe transplant dysfunction. In most transplant centres, patient TRAS and&#xD;
      severe symptoms will undergo IADSA and a stent will be placed to open the narrowing. However,&#xD;
      it is not clear how best to manage patients with TRAS who have mild to moderate symptoms. We&#xD;
      propose to recruit 36 such patients to a clinical study and split them into two groups: One&#xD;
      group to undergo IADSA with possible stent placement, and one group to be closely observed.&#xD;
      We will then compare transplant function, and other outcomes, after one year between the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
