    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to stimulate the circuits in the spinal cord that are directly&#xD;
      responsible for hemodynamic control to restore hemodynamic stability in participants with&#xD;
      chronic cervical or high-thoracic spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective of this study is&#xD;
      to provide preliminary safety and efficacy measures on the ability of the hemodynamic&#xD;
      Targeted Epidural Spinal Stimulation (TESS) to ensure the long-term management of hemodynamic&#xD;
      instability and reduce the incidence and severity of orthostatic hypotension and autonomic&#xD;
      dysreflexia episodes in individuals with chronic cervical or high-thoracic spinal cord&#xD;
      injury. In addition, the long-term safety and efficacy of TESS on cardiovascular health,&#xD;
      respiratory function, and quality of life in participants with chronic spinal cord injury&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Clinical management of chronic hemodynamic instability is currently limited to long-acting&#xD;
      pressor agents and anti-hypertensives. These drugs have significant limitations as they&#xD;
      require roughly one hour to become active and exert prolonged influences on the&#xD;
      cardiovascular system. This slow timescale contrasts with the hemodynamic instability&#xD;
      experienced by people with spinal cord injury, which occurs most commonly over just a few&#xD;
      minutes, and tends to cease abruptly. This study will investigate a new therapy for managing&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability in individuals with spinal cord injury: Targeted Epidural Spinal&#xD;
      Stimulation (TESS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, the investigators propose to stimulate the circuits in the spinal cord that are&#xD;
      directly responsible for hemodynamic control to restore hemodynamic stability in participants&#xD;
      with chronic cervical or high-thoracic spinal cord injury. The ultimate objective of this&#xD;
      feasibility study is to provide preliminary safety and efficacy measures on the ability of&#xD;
      the hemodynamic TESS to ensure the long-term management of hemodynamic instability and reduce&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of orthostatic hypotension and autonomic dysreflexia episodes in&#xD;
      humans with chronic cervical or high-thoracic spinal cord injury. In addition, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of TESS on cardiovascular&#xD;
      health, respiratory function, spasticity, trunk stability, sleep and quality of life in&#xD;
      participants with chronic spinal cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HEMO Trial will implant 4 participants with chronic (&gt;12 months) spinal cord injury&#xD;
      located between C3 and T6 who have confirmed severe orthostatic hypotension and autonomic&#xD;
      dysreflexia. Enrolled participants will undergo baseline assessments, after which they will&#xD;
      be implanted with the investigational system. Participants will then proceed to one month of&#xD;
      an intensive device configuration protocol to configure the TESS settings of their&#xD;
      investigational device to regain hemodynamic stability. After the intensive device&#xD;
      configuration phase, daily supervised at-home hemodynamic TESS will be conducted for two&#xD;
      weeks. Thereafter, and up to 25 weeks post-implant, participants will conduct supported&#xD;
      at-home sessions as well as regular laboratory visits during a long-term at-home hemodynamic&#xD;
      TESS phase. Finally, participants will undergo additional testing during a configuration of&#xD;
      additional TESS programs phase. During this phase TESS configurations for hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability, respiratory function, trunk stability and spasticity will be tested. Several&#xD;
      clinical evaluations are planned to evaluate participants' hemodynamic and neurological&#xD;
      status, cardiovascular functional status, respiratory function, trunk stability, and quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
