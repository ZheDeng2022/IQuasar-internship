    <textblock>
      This randomized, double blinded, sham-control trial aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of a novel focused power ultrasound mediated inferior perirenal adipose tissue modification&#xD;
      therapy for essential hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increase of visceral fat is closely related to the occurrence of hypertension, and it is&#xD;
      one of the main independent risk factors of hypertension. Visceral fat has been recognized as&#xD;
      an important endocrine organ, and a variety of factors secreted by visceral fat lead to an&#xD;
      increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Peri-renal fat is a special type of visceral fat&#xD;
      which is different from other type of visceral fat in histology, physiology, and functions.&#xD;
      The positon of peri-renal fat is more stable than other visceral fat, which might be&#xD;
      influenced by breath or body position changes.Studies have found that perirenal fat is an&#xD;
      early predictor of ASCVD, and its accumulation is closely related to the occurrence and&#xD;
      development of ASCVD.Therefore, the reduction or modification of visceral fat,especially&#xD;
      peri-renal fat , has a sufficient scientific basis for the treatment of hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous experiments, this novel focused power ultrasound can rapidly and efficiently&#xD;
      promote the perirenal adipse tissue fibrosis and control the blood pressure in the model of&#xD;
      swine. Moreover, we performed a single arm, small sample study to investigate the feasibility&#xD;
      of the novel focused power ultrasound to modify the inferior perirenal adipose tissue in&#xD;
      human volunteers, showing that this kind of method was feasible and safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel focused power&#xD;
      ultrasound mediated inferior perirenal adipose tissue modification therapy for essential&#xD;
      hypertension.&#xD;
