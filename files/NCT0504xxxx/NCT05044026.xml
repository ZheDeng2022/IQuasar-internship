  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, two-arm, non-interventional study of JAKAVI® (Ruxolitinib) in patients&#xD;
      with myelofibrosis&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this NIS is to gather data from the daily clinical practice of the&#xD;
      Jakavi®-treatment in a broad patient population. In order to evaluate the direct effect of&#xD;
      Jakavi®, only JAK inhibitor naive patients will be documented in the first study arm;&#xD;
      patients pretreated with JAK inhibitors will be documented in the second study arm to&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term efficacy of Jakavi® in this subpopulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The documentation of all patients is carried out prospectively and begins after the baseline&#xD;
      visit. The medical decision on which therapeutic and diagnostic measures to take is made&#xD;
      solely by the responsible physician. The observational period per patient is 36 months. The&#xD;
      visit schedule after the baseline visit is set by the responsible physician according to&#xD;
      standard clinical care, the clinical condition of the respective patients and the SmPC.&#xD;

    <description>The ECOG performance status is a scale used to assess how a patient's disease is progressing, assess how the disease affects the daily living abilities of the patient, and determine appropriate treatment and prognosis.&#xD;
The grade ranges from 0 (fully active, able to carry on all pre-disease performance without restriction) to 5 (dead).</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 12, month 24 and month 36</time_frame>
    <description>The MPN-SAF questionnaire contains important questions that cover MF-specific symptoms whose analysis is part of the standard of care. It includes disease related symptoms each scored from 0 (absent) to 10 (worst imaginable). Total Scores range from 0-100, with higher scores indicating a greater number of symptoms and severity.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline month 6, month 12, month 24 and month 36</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire consists of questions measuring physical function, physical role limitation, pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role limitations, and mental health status. The scores that can be obtained from the scale vary between 0 and 100 and the increase in the scores indicates that the quality of life is high.</description>
