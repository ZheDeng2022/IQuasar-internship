    <textblock>
      A first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of KZR-261 designed to assess the&#xD;
      safety and tolerability, preliminary anti-tumor activity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of&#xD;
      KZR-261, as well as identify the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The study comprises a Part&#xD;
      1 (Dose Escalation) and a Part 2 (Dose Expansion) in solid organ tumors (melanoma/uveal&#xD;
      melanoma, mesothelioma, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and &quot;all-tumors&quot;).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, Phase 1 study of KZR-261, Study KZR-261-101,&#xD;
      will be conducted in two parts (dose escalation and dose expansion) to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of KZR-261 in subjects with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies for&#xD;
      whom no therapeutics are available that can confer a reasonable likelihood of clinical&#xD;
      benefit. The 5 tumor cohorts in the dose expansion part include advanced malignant:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  melanoma/uveal melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  castrate-resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;all-tumors&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 (Dose Escalation) and Part 2 (Dose Expansion) comprise a 4-week Screening Period, a&#xD;
      Treatment Period lasting approximately 24 weeks, 4-6-week Safety Follow-up, and a 12-month&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-up Period (after last dose of study treatment), for a total study duration&#xD;
      of approximately 20 months.&#xD;

The initial dose cohort of the Dose Escalation will receive 1.8 mg/m2 of KZR-261. Subjects will receive 3 doses in a 28-day cycle.&#xD;
___________________________________________&#xD;
Part 2 (Dose Expansion)&#xD;
Following safety review of all Dose Escalation cohorts and determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD), KZR-261 will be evaluated for safety and preliminary efficacy in 4 tumor-specific cohorts and 1 all-tumor cohort to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

melanoma (including uveal melanoma)&#xD;
colorectal cancer&#xD;

             subject's first dose of KZR-261.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy within 14 days of before administration of the subject's first dose&#xD;
             of KZR-261.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgical procedure within 28 days before administration of the subject's first&#xD;
             dose of KZR-261.&#xD;
