      This Phase 1 study will be a multicenter, single agent, dose escalation and dose expansion&#xD;
      study conducted in patients with advanced late stage cancer (pancreatic or gastric including&#xD;
      esophageal junction cancers) for which the investigator determines there to be no other&#xD;
      standard of care or higher priority therapies available. All patients must have failed&#xD;
      standard first or later lines of systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design overview is presented below. The study will consist of 2 parts, Part A and&#xD;
      Part B. Part A will explore once every 3 weeks (Q3W) dosing per standard 3+3 dose escalation&#xD;
      design. Upon attaining a RP2D, Part B will commence in 2 groups, in approximately 15 patients&#xD;
      with advanced pancreatic cancer and 15 patients with advanced gastric including gastric&#xD;
      esophageal junction cancers. Part B will seek to confirm the RP2D and will also seek early&#xD;
      signals of efficacy in the selected cancer patient populations.&#xD;
