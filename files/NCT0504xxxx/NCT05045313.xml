  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a three-part, single-center, open-label phase I clinical study to characterize the&#xD;
      DDIs potential of DBPR108 with Warfarin sodium, Digoxin, or Probenecid in healthy subjects.&#xD;
      This study also aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DBPR108 in the presence of&#xD;
      Warfarin sodium, Digoxin, or Probenecid.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      DBPR108 is a potent dipeptidylpeptidase-4 inhibitor. This study will be run in three parts to&#xD;
      characterize the DDIs potential of DBPR108 with the expected concomitant drugs (Warfarin&#xD;
      sodium, Digoxin, Probenecid) in Healthy Subjects. Each part of this study consists of a&#xD;
      screening period (Day -14 to Day -1), a baseline period (Day -1), a treatment period, and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit period. Approximately 14 subjects will be enrolled in each part of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
