      The study investigators are conducting foundational pharmacokinetic (PK) and qualitative&#xD;
      studies, among 15-24 years old (inclusive) adolescent girls and young women living with HIV&#xD;
      (AGYWLHIV) already on oral antiretroviral therapy (ART) and virally suppressed, leading up to&#xD;
      a hybrid type I effectiveness-implementation trial randomizing individual AGYWLHIV to receive&#xD;
      long-acting (LA) injectable cabotegravir/rilpivirine vs. standard of care within one of&#xD;
      Kenya's largest HIV treatment programs. The PK and qualitative studies will investigate&#xD;
      potential issues arising from co-delivery and guide delivery of the&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial. The PK and qualitative studies will largely be conducted&#xD;
      with a sentinel cohort of AGYWLHIV. Learning from this early LA ART use, the investigators&#xD;
      will refine the procedures in the LA ART hybrid trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Long-acting (LA) antiretroviral therapy (ART), such as injectable cabotegravir and&#xD;
      rilpivirine, has been receiving global clinical approvals and has the potential to address&#xD;
      barriers to ART and improve patient adherence and persistence to treatment. LA ART regimens&#xD;
      can potentially also increase options for patients and providers to individualize treatment&#xD;
      plans, provide a powerful treatment option for those experiencing adherence issues related&#xD;
      oral treatment options, and may ease the burden of health systems in RLS. Another major&#xD;
      threat to AGYW's health is unintended pregnancies and AGYWLHIV also face unique challenges in&#xD;
      uptake and continuation of LA contraceptives. Use of LA ART may foster synergy in usage of LA&#xD;
      contraceptives among AGYWLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposed research study has three main components: 1) a prospective, non-randomized,&#xD;
      parallel-group pharmacokinetic (PK) study among a sentinel cohort of five distinct groups of&#xD;
      AGYW, and will leverage existing control groups (Aim 1a); 2) a qualitative study that will&#xD;
      conduct individual interviews with four different subgroups of AGYWLHIV from the sentinel&#xD;
      cohort from the PK study, as well as focus group discussions with providers, policy makers,&#xD;
      and other stakeholders for health systems readiness for wider scale-up (Aim 1b); and 3) an&#xD;
      open-label, mixed methods, 48-week type I hybrid trial randomizing AGYW with viral&#xD;
      suppression on their current ART regimen to switch to 1:1 cabotegravir/ rilpivirine&#xD;
      (intervention arm) vs. continue their oral ART regimen (Aim 2a), with a component also&#xD;
      evaluating implementation outcomes of acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity (Aim 2b). The&#xD;
      proposed study will be conducted in HIV treatment facilities in western Kenya within the&#xD;
      regional Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide foundational data for future studies and implementation plans related&#xD;
      to addressing barriers and will critically inform follow-up studies of LA ART in other&#xD;
      priority subpopulations. Providing an array of method options for both HIV treatment and&#xD;
      pregnancy prevention has the potential to revolutionize personal decision-making and improve&#xD;
      long-term outcomes for AGYWLHIV. Our real-world experiences of co-delivery will also inform&#xD;
      future considerations for co-formulations of antiretrovirals and contraceptives for both HIV&#xD;
      treatment and prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is the following: 1) at the client level, the use of LA ART or&#xD;
      contraceptives will foster long-term thinking for health, forging a convergence of the use of&#xD;
      the two when applicable; and 2) at the program/provider level, leveraging existing LA&#xD;
      contraceptive delivery platform will make LA ART highly acceptable, feasible, and deliverable&#xD;
      with high fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall objective in this study is to conduct the foundational PK and qualitative studies&#xD;
      first as a lead in to the hybrid trial. Guided by Proctor et al.'s implementation outcomes&#xD;
      framework, the hybrid trial will also focus on acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity.&#xD;
      These implementation outcomes are proximal indicators of implementation processes and&#xD;
      intermediate outcomes, which ultimately predict implementation success. Demonstrating&#xD;
      successful implementation outcomes will then inform wider-scale implementation of LA ART,&#xD;
      when service and client outcomes can be fully realized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PK and qualitative studies will investigate potential issues arising from co-delivery and&#xD;
      guide delivery of the effectiveness-implementation trial. The PK (Aim 1a) and qualitative&#xD;
      (Aim 1b) studies will largely be conducted with a sentinel cohort of AGYWLHIV in parallel to&#xD;
      each other. Learning from this early LA ART use, the investigators will refine our procedures&#xD;
      in the LA ART hybrid trial (Aim 2). For all possible outcomes/scenarios of Aim 1, the&#xD;
      investigators still anticipate conducting a robust trial in Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, our specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To collect foundational data to better inform design of an&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: To determine if combined cabotegravir/rilpivirine injectable use has bidirectional&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions with injectable (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA]) or&#xD;
      implantable (etonogestrel or levonorgestrel) contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: To qualitatively explore points of convergence and divergence, preferences and&#xD;
      values, and health systems readiness around wider-scale co-delivery of LA ART and&#xD;
      contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To evaluate the impact of clinic-provided, co-delivery of LA ART and contraceptives&#xD;
      among AGYWLHIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a: To evaluate the impact on effectiveness outcomes of HIV treatment (viral suppression&#xD;
      and adherence/persistence) and contraception (uptake and continuation rates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2b: To evaluate the impact on implementation outcomes of acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
      fidelity.&#xD;
