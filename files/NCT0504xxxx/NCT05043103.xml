  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study is designed to collect data on the use of the drug Lecigon® in daily&#xD;
      clinical practice. The study is organised and funded by a pharmaceutical company called&#xD;
      Britannia Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Britannia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lecigon® is prescribed by physicians in advanced Parkinson's disease when patients suffer&#xD;
      from uncontrollable fluctuations in mobility, so-called motor fluctuations, which cannot be&#xD;
      adjusted well with oral treatment, i.e. medication for swallowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, data on the effect and possible side effects from everyday treatment with&#xD;
      Lecigon® will be collected and scientifically evaluated. The study is intended to supplement&#xD;
      the results of previous clinical studies with clinical data in routine medical care,&#xD;
      collected from approximately 300 patients.&#xD;

      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, non-interventional study, primary data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No visits or measurements will be made mandatory by the observational plan. The assignment of&#xD;
      patients to Lecigon® not decided in advance by the study's observational plan but falls&#xD;
      within current practice. Prescription of Lecigon® occurred before and independently of the&#xD;
      decision to include the patient in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participating centres will offer participation in the ELEGANCE study to all patients who&#xD;
      receive treatment with Lecigon® part of routine clinical practice. From patients, who&#xD;
      switched to treatment with Lecigon® prior to signing of informed consent, baseline data will&#xD;
      be collected retrospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned non-interventional study aims to collect real-world data on the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of Lecigon® as a therapy for advanced Parkinson´s Disease in routine care in Germany&#xD;
      and Austria. The study will be expanded to additional European countries as soon as marketing&#xD;
      authorisation in these countries and commercial stock will be available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term effectiveness of Lecigon®&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Long-term safety of Lecigon®&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient non-motor symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthcare resource utilisation by patients&#xD;
