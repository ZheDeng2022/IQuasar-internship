    <textblock>
      Current assessment of lower limb ischemia cannot reflect the location and degree of ischemia.&#xD;
      Tissue perfusion assessment was used in the diagnosis and treatment of lower limb ischemia in&#xD;
      this project, and the quantitative evaluation of ischemia degree was realized by using its&#xD;
      advantages of quantitative analysis and perfusion imaging.&#xD;

        The study was conducted in PAOD patients aged 35 to 80 years with clinical symptoms such as&#xD;
        claudication, resting pain, or ulceration, who were intended for endovascular treatment.&#xD;
        Computed tomographic angiography disclosed the occlusive lesion in their target lesion.&#xD;
        Subject with complex infrapopliteal lesions was excluded in order to reduce the influence&#xD;
        of other variables.&#xD;
