  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Choroideremia (CHM) is an inherited retinal disorder that causes progressive vision loss,&#xD;
      ultimately leading to complete blindness. The first symptom is generally night blindness,&#xD;
      although, to date, little is known about the extent, type, pattern, and progression of&#xD;
      dark-adapted visual function measures in CHM patients. We hypothesize that one of the key&#xD;
      events causing night blindness in CHM is deficiency in the chromophore of the rod visual&#xD;
      pigment, rhodopsin. We propose that this deficiency is at least in part due to inadequate&#xD;
      delivery of vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) to the photoreceptors (PRs) from the ailing retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium (RPE), characteristic of CHM. We hypothesize that increased availability&#xD;
      of vitamin A would potentiate its entry into the RPE-mediated visual cycle, ultimately&#xD;
      enabling delivery to the PRs. This would in turn allow rods to perform better by partially&#xD;
      overcoming the RPE damage and the impaired chromophore recycling that we postulate exists in&#xD;
      CHM. The goals of this proposal are: (1) to test the hypothesis that oral vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation can improve night time and peripheral vision in CHM patients, and (2) to&#xD;
      provide detailed characterization of dark-adapted visual function outcome measures to guide&#xD;
      interventional CHM trials.&#xD;
