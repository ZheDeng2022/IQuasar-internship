      The aim of this study is to 1. register possible changes to uteroplacental circulation in&#xD;
      relation to physical tests, 2. to register energy and nutritional intake, relationship&#xD;
      towards the body during pregnancy and during the early period after giving birth, 3. register&#xD;
      the experience of guidance given related to exercise, nutrition, and recovery, 4. register&#xD;
      elite athletes' experience of combining the role of being a mom and an elite athlete, and 5.&#xD;
      register attitudes and reactions from the support system when it comes to being an elite&#xD;
      athlete and being pregnant. Material and method: 30 pregnant female elite athletes and 30&#xD;
      moderately physically active pregnant women will be recruited for the completion of physical&#xD;
      testing and questionnaires and questionnaires only, respectively. 20 national team&#xD;
      leaders/coaches and 10 sponsors will be recruited for a semi-structured interview about&#xD;
      attitudes, reactions and guidance towards athletes who become pregnant and still wish to&#xD;
      continue their career as an athlete after pregnancy.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to 1. register possible changes to uteroplacental circulation in&#xD;
      relation to physical tests, 2. to register energy and nutritional intake, relationship&#xD;
      towards the body during pregnancy and during the early period after giving birth, 3. register&#xD;
      the experience of guidance given related to exercise, nutrition, and recovery, 4. register&#xD;
      elite athletes' experience of combining the role of being a mom and an elite athlete, and 5.&#xD;
      register attitudes and reactions from the support system when it comes to being an elite&#xD;
      athlete and being pregnant. Material and method: It is expected that we can include 30&#xD;
      pregnant female elite athletes for the physiological testing who also will complete the&#xD;
      questionnaires included in the study. In addition, 30 moderately physically active pregnant&#xD;
      women will be recruited for the completion of the questionnaires only. Both groups answer&#xD;
      questions related to exercise, pregnancy related issues, nutrition and their relationship&#xD;
      towards their body. To obtain enough participants, data collection will continue for five&#xD;
      years. During the same period, 20 national team leaders/coaches and 10 sponsors will be&#xD;
      recruited for a semi-structured interview. The physiological testing will be conducted during&#xD;
      the 23-29th week of pregnancy. The athletes will conduct a running test and resistance tests&#xD;
      in the lab. The following measures will be registered: pulsatility index (PI) and volume&#xD;
      blood flow in both uterine arteries, 2. the fetus' pulsatility index (PI) in the umbilical&#xD;
      cord artery and heart rate frequency, 3. body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and&#xD;
      saturation in the mother during rest and during physical exertion. Data on gestational&#xD;
      development and birth will be collected based on information given by the participant herself&#xD;
      and by birth records and health records. Coaches/leaders and sponsors will in their&#xD;
      interview, answer to questions related to attitudes, reactions and guidance of athletes who&#xD;
      become pregnant and still wish to continue their career as an athlete after pregnancy.&#xD;
