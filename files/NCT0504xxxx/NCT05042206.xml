  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is an open, single-center, phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      of allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell injection in patients with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to evaluate the safety for 12 months after administration of Cellgram-CKD 3&#xD;
      times in 10 patients with chronic kidney disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The screening test is performed after the clinical trial subject consents in writing to&#xD;
      participate in the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are registered in the clinical trial, and&#xD;
      Cellgram-CKD is injected intravenously by puncturing a vein with a needle. After injecting&#xD;
      Cellgram-CKD three times at an interval of 2 weeks (14 days), the subject visits the testing&#xD;
      institution at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months for safety evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, since the safety of Cellgram-CKD has not been established, proceed as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first 3 subjects who received the investigational product, if no adverse events of&#xD;
      Grade 3 or higher according to the NCI-CTCAE related to the investigational product occur 14&#xD;
      days after the 1st and 2nd administration, and 1 month after the 3rd administration, the&#xD;
      remaining subjects were sequentially treated. Register as a member and conduct clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an adverse event of Grade 3 or higher according to the NCI-CTCAE standard related to the&#xD;
      test drug occurs in two of the first three subjects, the clinical trial is terminated early.&#xD;
      is conducted by registering three additional test subjects in the same way as the first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If one or more of the three subjects develops a Grade 3 or higher adverse event related to&#xD;
      the investigational product, the clinical trial is terminated early, and the remaining&#xD;
      subjects are treated only if all three subjects do not have a Grade 3 or higher adverse&#xD;
      reaction related to the investigational product. Register to continue the clinical trial.&#xD;
