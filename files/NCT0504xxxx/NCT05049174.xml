    <textblock>
      A better understanding of how to incorporate effective smoking cessation into clinical&#xD;
      practice is requested. In this is prospective, multi-center, randomized, open, blinded&#xD;
      end-point trial, we assigned daily smokers hospitalized with an acute cardiac event 1:1 to an&#xD;
      in-hospital nurse-led smoking cessation intervention with direct referral to further&#xD;
      follow-up in the municipal healthy life-centres (intensive intervention) or to written&#xD;
      information about smoking cessation and the municipal program (low-threshold intervention) .&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the smoking cessation rates between the groups at 6 months&#xD;
      follow-up. Key secondary outcomes include a cost-effectiveness analysis of the intensive&#xD;
      intervention and cessation rates at 3- and 12-months follow-up, the proportion who used&#xD;
      varenicline or nicotine replacement therapy and the proportion who attended the healthy-life&#xD;
      center program between the two groups. Exploratory analyses include new knowledge about the&#xD;
      patient and system factors of importance for participation to healthy life-centers and for&#xD;
      changes in smoking behaviour.&#xD;
