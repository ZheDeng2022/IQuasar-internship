  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of avatrombopag in subjects with a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of primary ITP (≤6 months duration) over 26 weeks of treatment, and also evaluate&#xD;
      the incidence of ITP remission.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This phase 3b, multi-center, open-label study will enroll approximately 75 adult subjects&#xD;
      with a confirmed diagnoses of primary ITP (≤6 months duration) who have had a previous&#xD;
      response to a first line treatment. The study will consist of a 26-week treatment period to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of avatrombopag. Subjects with platelet counts ≥50×10⁹/L at&#xD;
      Week 26 may enter a dose-tapering period in which the dose of avatrombopag will be decreased&#xD;
      for up to 16 weeks until avatrombopag treatment is discontinued and the platelet count is&#xD;
      maintained ≥50×10⁹/L. Once avatrombopag treatment has been discontinued, the subjects will&#xD;
      enter a remission evaluation period of up to 24 weeks to evaluate whether they have entered a&#xD;
      state of remission.&#xD;
