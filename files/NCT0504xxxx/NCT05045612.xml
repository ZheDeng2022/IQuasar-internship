  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is one of the most urgent health threats of our time, and Norwegian&#xD;
      hospitals were required to reduce the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics with 30% by the end&#xD;
      of 2020. In the current proposal, the investigators aim to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in adult patients infected with respiratory&#xD;
      viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A general recommendation to treat all instances of community acquired pneumonia (CAP)&#xD;
      patients with antibiotics leads to significant antibiotic overtreatment. In 2008, the US Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration approved the first multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the&#xD;
      detection of multiple respiratory virus nucleic acids simultaneously. The wide availability&#xD;
      of such nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) for rapid viral detection together with chest&#xD;
      radiographs has the potential to define patients who can be managed without antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Akershus University Hospital is one of the largest hospitals in Norway, with a catchment area&#xD;
      of more than 550,000 people. In 2012 to 2013, the majority of patients admitted to Akershus&#xD;
      University Hospital with suspected CAP and a positive viral NAAT were treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics, a prescription pattern representing antibiotic overtreatment. The investigators&#xD;
      accordingly hypothesize that discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with&#xD;
      moderately severe disease and airway sample positive for respiratory viruses is safe and&#xD;
      non-inferior to continuation of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In patients with positive airway sample for respiratory viruses, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that discontinuation of antibiotic therapy is safe and non-inferior to&#xD;
      continuation of antibiotic therapy. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      early clinical response assessed at 120 hours after hospital admission, defined as survival&#xD;
      with symptom improvement without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy, will be similar&#xD;
      between patients who discontinue and continue antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that discontinuation of antibiotic therapy is associated with&#xD;
      similar mortality rates, duration of hospital admission and reduced number of defined daily&#xD;
      doses of antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to assess whether discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients with&#xD;
      positive airway sample for respiratory viruses is safe and associated with early clinical&#xD;
      response assessed at 120 hours after hospital admission that is comparable to patients who&#xD;
      continue antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to assess whether discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in patients&#xD;
      with positive airway sample for respiratory viruses is associated comparable (1) mortality&#xD;
      rates, (2) duration of hospital admission, (3) defined daily doses of antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives In patients with positive airway sample for respiratory viruses, assess&#xD;
      the impact of discontinuing antibiotic therapy on early clinical response quantified as&#xD;
      survival with symptom improvement without receipt of rescue antibacterial therapy. Early&#xD;
      clinical response is defined as improvement of one or more levels relative to baseline in two&#xD;
      or more symptoms of the investigator's assessment of symptoms of community-acquired bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia and no worsening of one or more levels in other symptoms.&#xD;
