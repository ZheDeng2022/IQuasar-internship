  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of cetuximab in treating patients with chordoma that&#xD;
      has spread from its original site of growth to distant anatomic sites and is not amenable to&#xD;
      surgical resection (advanced unresectable) or has spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
      (metastatic). Cetuximab may interfere with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene,&#xD;
      which may cause tumor cells to die.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the efficacy of cetuximab in patients with advanced (unresectable) or&#xD;
      metastatic, chordoma based on response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate response rate according to Choi criteria. II. To evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of cetuximab for chordoma patients. III. To evaluate the progression-free&#xD;
      survival (median, at 24 weeks, and 52 weeks) and to determine the overall survival (median).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the ratio of progression-free survival (PFS) on study compared to PFS from&#xD;
      prior treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the use of a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA)-certified anti-EGFR&#xD;
      immuno-stain (clone 31G7, Abnova) on pre-treatment chordoma tissue and determine if&#xD;
      quantitative/qualitative presence of EGFR expression is associated with any clinical&#xD;
      characteristics observed during the clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To perform a functional proteomic analysis of chordoma tumor samples prior to treatment&#xD;
      with cetuximab and on treatment with cetuximab to evaluate for potential biomarkers of&#xD;
      resistance and/or response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To perform genomic sequencing, including ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA), of chordoma tumor samples prior to treatment with cetuximab and on treatment with&#xD;
      cetuximab to evaluate for potential biomarkers of resistance and/or response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate CD16 FcgammaRIIIA status of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC's) from&#xD;
      peripheral blood of each patient at treatment initiation by flow cytometric gating&#xD;
      strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate quality of life for adult (&gt;= 12 years) chordoma patients on this study using&#xD;
      the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure assessing&#xD;
      the severity of symptoms and the interference with daily living as a result of these&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 60-120 minutes once weekly (QW) in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and every 3 months&#xD;
      for up to 24 months.&#xD;
