    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to describe the prevalence of and risk factors to&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy in a representative cohort of diabetes patients and to investigate&#xD;
      pathophysiological conditions in those patients with neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will yield substantial new knowledge about the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy&#xD;
      in type 1 and type 2 DM persons, new risk factors to neuropathy and the association to other&#xD;
      diabetic complications. Findings related to the study may facilitate new treatment regimens&#xD;
      prompting a better neuropathy treatment with reduced incidence of diabetic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First patients at SDCC will be screened for diabetic neuropathy (Study 1.1) with an extended&#xD;
      neuropathy screening program as an addition to the routine neuropathy screening at SDCC. 1000&#xD;
      patients with type 1 DM and 1000 patients with type 2 DM will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This screening study is a prerequisite for the further study of study participants in&#xD;
      substudies investigating associations between diabetic neuropathy and diabetic complications&#xD;
      as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several patients with diabetes have undiagnosed neuropathy and associated diabetic&#xD;
      complications. We hypothesize that diabetic neuropathy is underdiagnosed at SDCC and can be&#xD;
      diagnosed with targeted screening with new and traditional measuring techniques. In addition,&#xD;
      several patients may have complications related to neuropathy, including foot complications,&#xD;
      and dysregulation of glucose metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of a screening study (study 1.1) and two substudies (1.2 and 1.3 ). Study&#xD;
      1.1 is a cross-sectional study describing the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy based on&#xD;
      questionnaire data and objective measures as described below and associated diabetic&#xD;
      complications including foot complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to explore the prevalence of diabatic neuropathy in patients with type 1&#xD;
      and type 2 DM at SDCC and secondarily to explore associations between diabetic neuropathy and&#xD;
      complications, as described in the respective sections below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The substudy 1.2 is an observational single center cohort study with the aim of investigating&#xD;
      associations between neuropathy diagnosed with new devices for measurement of neuropathy and&#xD;
      foot complications in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The substudy 1.3 is an observational single center cohort study investigating the association&#xD;
      between CAN and glycemic variability in patients with type 1 diabetes.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  the above-mentioned forms of neuropathy and possible risk factors for neuropathy such as&#xD;
           HbA1c, urine albumin-creatinine-ratio, incidences of severe hypoglycaemia and&#xD;
           ketoacidosis, BMI, vitamin B12, levels of SpO2 and quantitative measures of diabetic&#xD;
           neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the above-mentioned forms of neuropathy questionnaire data on mental health and&#xD;
           wellbeing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      •Study participants will be followed-up in national patient registries for mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity at approximately 5, 10 and 15 years after examination and association studies to&#xD;
      study outcomes and future disease and cause of death will be made Study Design: A&#xD;
      cross-sectional study describing the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy based on questionnaire&#xD;
      data and objective measures and their association to prevalent diabetic complications&#xD;
      including. The duration of inclusion of participants in the study is estimated to be 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data: Medication status, DM status, diagnoses of other diseases, diabetic&#xD;
      complications, height, weight, retinopathy status, body mass index (BMI), smoking status,&#xD;
      alcohol status Data collection and examinations: detailed description on &quot;Groups and&#xD;
      Interventions&quot; Blood sugar Will be measured by capillary blood glucose measures of finger&#xD;
      prick blood sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All questionnaires are validated and in Danish. Compass 31, Michigan Neuropathy Screening&#xD;
      (MNSI), DN4, Patient Assessment of Gastrointestinal Disorders Symptom Severity Index&#xD;
      (PAGI-SYM), The gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), The World Health Organization-&#xD;
      Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), Participant Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Pedersen-Bjergaard&#xD;
      questionnaire, Gold questionnaire and others, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), IIEF, FSFIF,&#xD;
      DistressScale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants will be recruited at two SDCC outpatient clinics: at Niels Steensens&#xD;
      vej 4, 2860 Gentofte, Denmark and Gentofte Hospitalsvej 1, st. tv., 2900 Hellerup, Denmark.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical approval Before study initiation the study will be approved by the regional ethical&#xD;
      committee and by the Danish data protection agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines from Danish data protection guidelines be followed throughout the process. All&#xD;
      patient data will be stored and treated in accordance with regulation 2016/679 from the&#xD;
      European parliament on the protection of natural patients with regard to the processing of&#xD;
      personal data and on the free movement of such data, dated 27 April 2016(27), and the Danish&#xD;
      amendment to regulation 2016/679(28).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The associations between determinants and outcome measures will be estimated by&#xD;
      using complete-case regression models adjusting for relevant confounders including age, sex&#xD;
      and diabetes duration. Logistic regression analyses will be used for binary outcomes. Linear&#xD;
      regression analyses will be used for continuous outcomes. Outcome variables will be&#xD;
      log-transformed using the natural logarithm to meet model assumptions of the distribution of&#xD;
      the model residuals if necessary. Interactions between sex and all determinants will be&#xD;
      investigated in all models to investigate possible sex interactions differences. A level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size estimation: as this is a prevalence study a power calculation is not possible. As&#xD;
      the aim is to describe neuropathy prevalence in a representative sample of patients, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to assessed 50% of the patient population at SDCC by consecutively&#xD;
      examining all patients at their yearly status examination. The investigators aim to examine&#xD;
      2000 participants in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1.2 Diabetic neuropathy and foot complications Objective The overall objective of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the association between diabetic neuropathy diagnosed with&#xD;
      established and novel measuring techniques and foot complications Aims Primary aim •To&#xD;
      describe the association between neuropathy diagnosed by novel point-of-care screening tools&#xD;
      and foot complications in age and gender matched type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients at SDCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      •To compare the prevalence of foot complications in participants with neuropathy diagnosed by&#xD;
      novel point-of-care screening tools and traditional point-of-care screening tools, in age and&#xD;
      gender matched type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients at SDCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 participants older than 39 years of age with type 1 or type 2 diabetes at SDCC will be&#xD;
      included in this study. The participants included must be diagnosed with peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy in the screening study. 150 participants with neuropathy diagnosed with novel&#xD;
      assessment methods will be age and gender matched with 150 participants with neuropathy&#xD;
      diagnosed with traditional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Results from neuropathy examinations and questionnaires are already sampled in study&#xD;
      1.1 and will be incorporated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine foot examination, which include&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination for foot ulcers, infection, cellosites, nail deformities, edema,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of Charcot foot, walk, footwear&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expanded foot examination, which include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment for deformities (Hallux valgus, hallux rigidus, pes planus, pes cavus, low&#xD;
           forefoot, hammertoes, valgus/varus hindfod. Wide-ranging forefoot)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examination of the foot length and with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 clinical photos with iphone (loaded and unloaded to Sundhedsplatformen) for clinical&#xD;
           documentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of insoles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The associations between determinants and outcome measures will be estimated by&#xD;
      using complete-case regression models adjusting for relevant confounders including age, sex&#xD;
      and diabetes duration. Logistic regression analyses will be used for binary outcomes. Linear&#xD;
      regression analyses will be used for continuous outcomes. Outcome variables will be&#xD;
      log-transformed using the natural logarithm to meet model assumptions of the distribution of&#xD;
      the model residuals if necessary. Interactions between sex and all determinants will be&#xD;
      investigated in all models to investigate possible sex interactions differences. A level of&#xD;
      significance of 5% will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Sample size&#xD;
      estimation: as this is an exploratory study with no prior similar studies performed a power&#xD;
      calculation is not possible. The investigators assess that comparing 150 participants&#xD;
      diagnosed with novel assessment methods with 150 age and gender matched participants with&#xD;
      neuropathy diagnosed with traditional methods will be sufficient to investigate differences&#xD;
      in foot complication prevalence between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudy 1.3 Cardiovascular autonomy neuropathy and glucose variability Objective The overall&#xD;
      objective of this study is to investigate if patients with type 1 diabetes and CAN have a&#xD;
      larger glucose variability compared to similar patients without CAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate differences in SD (standard deviation) in 30 participants with and&#xD;
           participants without CAN Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate differences in CV (Coefficient of Variation), time spent in&#xD;
           hyperglycaemia, time spent in hypoglycaemia, CONGA, MAGE in participants with and&#xD;
           without CAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate associations between continuous measures of CAN and indices of glucose&#xD;
           variability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association between CAN and hypoglycaemic unawareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the association between symptoms of CAN and glucose variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design 30 participants with type 1 diabetes with CAN will be enrolled and compare with&#xD;
      30 age and sex matched type 1 diabetes participants without CAN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If it is not possible to enroll enough study participants patients will be recruited by using&#xD;
      data from electronic patient records at SDCC containing data on 600 type 2 patients screened&#xD;
      for CAN between 2013-2014. Information about civil registration number, phone number,&#xD;
      address, diagnosis of type 1 diabetes, age, gender and historic data on CAN on outpatients at&#xD;
      Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen is provided by the treatment-responsible doctor and passed&#xD;
      on to the study investigator. This information is used for identifying possible participants&#xD;
      and recruitment. First contact will be a letter containing the written participant&#xD;
      information and the brochure: &quot;The participants rights as a participant in biomedical&#xD;
      research&quot;. In the letter, possible participants will be invited to the information meeting at&#xD;
      Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen. The letter contains telephone number and email for the&#xD;
      project-responsible doctor. Non-responders will be followed up by a telephone contact&#xD;
      approximately two weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation As mentioned the CAN diagnosis has be shown to trend toward a significant&#xD;
      association to CV by Nyiraty et al (39). With reference to that study the investigators&#xD;
      hypotie that a difference in SD of 0.2 mmol/L is detectable (and relevant) between CAN and&#xD;
      non-CAN patient. In this study the standard deviation of SD was approximately 0.2 mmol/L.&#xD;
      With 90% power and a two-sided significance level of 0.05 the sample size needed to detect&#xD;
      the abovementioned difference is 23 in each group - 46 participant in total. Taking a&#xD;
      drop-out ratio of 10% into account and given the inaccurate nature of this power calculation&#xD;
      the sample size of the study will be 30 participants in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prevalence of CAN at SDCC is 15 %. Thus, a screening of approximately 200 participants is&#xD;
      needed to obtain the target participant number. 60 participants in total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and measures Participants Type 1 diabetes participants will be recruited from the&#xD;
      screening (study 1.1.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods CAN will be assessed by Cardiovascular reflex tests and heart rate variability&#xD;
      indices (Vagus™ device).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glucose variability will be assessed by use of 10 days continuous glucose monitoring attached&#xD;
      to the skin of the participant with the Dexcom G6 sensor, transmitter and receiver. Several&#xD;
      glucose variability indices will be assessed e.g. CV, MAGE, CONGA, time spent in&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia, time spent in hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycemia unawareness will be assessed by the Pedersen-Bjergaard, the Gold questionnaire&#xD;
      and others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy testing with Vagustm device both resting heart rate&#xD;
           variability and cardiovascular reflex tests (20 minutes) (as described in study 1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insertion of continuous glucose monitor ( The Dexcom G6 Device) (15 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Participants for this study will be participants who have been screened in study&#xD;
      1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The associations between determinants and outcome measures will be estimated by&#xD;
      using regression models adjusting for relevant confounders including age, sex and diabetes&#xD;
      duration. Logistic regression analyses will be used for binary outcomes. Linear regression&#xD;
      analyses will be used for continuous outcomes. Outcome variables will be log-transformed&#xD;
      using the natural logarithm to meet model assumptions of the distribution of the model&#xD;
      residuals if necessary. Interactions between sex and all determinants will be investigated in&#xD;
      all models to investigate possible sex interactions differences. Analyses will be performed&#xD;
      using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).&#xD;

Glycemic variability and hypoglycemia duration will be calculated from CGM data. Glycemic variability will be assessed by standard deviation (SD) and Coefficient of Variance (CV). We define normo-glycemic range as sensor glucose between 4.0 and 10.0 mmol/L. Hypoglycemia will be defined in two ranges as SG ≤3.9 mmol/L or SG ≤3.0 mmol/L). An episode of hypoglycemia will be defined as at least 15 minutes with SG below 3.9 mmol/L or 3.0 mmol/L, respectively. CGM recordings with less than 72 hours of data will be excluded from analysis.</description>
