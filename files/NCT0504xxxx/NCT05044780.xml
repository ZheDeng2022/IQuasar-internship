      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has challenged the health systems worldwide. Many tools have been&#xD;
      developed in response to the pandemic, but there is no current way to quickly screen multiple&#xD;
      people for the disease. Research has shown that people with COVID-19 have higher levels of&#xD;
      some proteins involved in the immune response and inflammation. These proteins can be&#xD;
      detected in sweat using a special camera. Researchers want to see if analysis of sweat from&#xD;
      fingerprints could be used to detect COVID-19 infection in people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test a new technology to detect COVID-19 infection based on an analysis of sweat from&#xD;
      fingerprints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 18 and older who tested positive or negative for COVID-19 within the last 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the NIH Clinical Center for one day within 7 days from COVID-19&#xD;
      testing. The visit will last for 3 to 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who show symptoms for COVID-19 with a positive test will give blood samples to&#xD;
      correlate with the sweat markers. About 1/2 tablespoon of blood will be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For sweat markers, 10 fingers will be imaged by a camera using a touchless system. This will&#xD;
      be repeated 3 times. It will take about 15 minutes. Participants will use the device. They&#xD;
      will get instructions and watch a short video on how to use the device.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new COVID19 pandemic has challenged the health system worldwide. Massive testing contact&#xD;
      tracing and social distancing proved to be the most effective tools to fight the pandemic in&#xD;
      absence of an effective vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the effort to develop rapid diagnostic testing, we still don t have an available&#xD;
      large population screening modality. Hyperspectral analysis of sweat metabolites from&#xD;
      fingerprint has the potential to be a valid clinic strategy to detect COVID19 infected&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID19 infection has shown higher levels of inflammatory proteins like IL6, LDH, CRP, and&#xD;
      d-dimer which have been implicated with severe COVID-19 induced pneumonitis and coagulopathy.&#xD;
      These molecules can be detected as sweat metabolites and used as a biomarker for viral&#xD;
      infection detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify a pattern classifier to distinguish between COVID19 positive and COVID19 negative&#xD;
      human subjects by hyperspectral analysis of sweat metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals must all be &gt;=18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
      Must have standard of care molecular testing for COVID19 within 7 days from study enrollment.&#xD;
      Those individuals who tested positive will be enrolled in cohort 1 and those who tested&#xD;
      negative will be enrolled in cohort 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an exploratory multisite study to evaluate the use of biometric analysis of sweat&#xD;
      metabolites to detect COVID19 infection. Center for Cancer research (CCR), NCI will be the&#xD;
      coordinating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult subjects that have available testing for COVID-19 completed within 7 days from the&#xD;
      study enrollment are eligible for this study. The study will have two cohorts, cohort 1&#xD;
      (COVID19 positive), and cohort 2 (COVID19 negative). Fifty participants will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each cohort to receive additional COVID19 testing based on the hyperspectral analysis of&#xD;
      fingerprint sweat metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every participant will have all ten fingers imaged by the camera with a touchless system. The&#xD;
      ten fingers imaging will be repeated three times. This imaging will take about 15 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hyperspectral instruments will be used directly by the participants without any&#xD;
      additional human resources to carry out this data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data obtained by the digital analysis will be compared to the result of the standard&#xD;
      COVID19 test in use at the National Institute of Health and Inova Fairfax Medical Campus.&#xD;
