      This study evaluates a mood management and health and wellness smoking cessation intervention&#xD;
      for depressed pregnant smokers during and after birth. This study may help pregnant smokers&#xD;
      who are experiencing depression quit smoking and stay smoke-free after their babies are born.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Conduct qualitative group interviews with depressed pregnant smokers and depressed smokers&#xD;
      within the first 4 months of the postpartum period, to adapt and refine the delivery of&#xD;
      behavioral activation therapy (BA) and health and wellness education (HW) via smartphone&#xD;
      videoconferencing, a BA and HW smartphone application (app) including supportive smoking&#xD;
      cessation messages in the prenatal and postpartum periods. (Stage IA) II. Adapt BA and&#xD;
      smoking cessation counseling manuals, BA and HW app and content, and treatment integrity&#xD;
      rating scales for the prenatal and postpartum period. (Stage IA) III. Pilot test the&#xD;
      delivery, via smartphone videoconferencing, of a 10-week treatment course of BA and HW and&#xD;
      conduct process evaluation of technical issues in the use of smartphones, barriers to&#xD;
      participation and retention; completion of study assessments, and; adequacy of procedures for&#xD;
      addressing psychiatric emergencies. (Stage IA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Conduct a preliminary randomized trial with depressed pregnant smokers comparing BA to&#xD;
      HW to evaluate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIIa. Effect of BA on abstinence at 6 months postpartum. (Stage IB) IIIb. Effect of BA on&#xD;
      depression at 6 months postpartum. (Stage IB) IIIc. Feasibility of acceptance of the&#xD;
      smartphone delivery of BA and HW, and assessment components indicated by a) retention; b)&#xD;
      completion of prenatal and postpartum sessions; c) completion of study assessments, d)&#xD;
      strength of therapeutic alliance from both the participant and therapist perspective; e)&#xD;
      participant and therapist ratings on satisfaction questionnaire. (Stage IB) IIId. Feasibility&#xD;
      of study procedures as indicated by a) percentage of sessions interrupted by technical&#xD;
      difficulties, and; b) percentage of breath carbon monoxide samples collected remotely for&#xD;
      biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence at 6 months postpartum. (Stage IB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate change in hypothesized treatment mechanisms including positive affect, negative&#xD;
      affect, and cognitive function in relation to treatment effects on smoking and depression.&#xD;
      (Stage IB) II. Conduct qualitative interviews with women who completed and did not complete&#xD;
      postpartum treatment to assess a) barriers to completing treatment sessions; b) usefulness of&#xD;
      postpartum treatment; c) suggestions for decreasing barriers and improving treatment&#xD;
      acceptability, and; d) relevant experiences unexpected by participants and researchers.&#xD;
      (Stage IB)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 1 AND SECONDARY AIM 2: Participants participate in focus group over 60-90 minutes.&#xD;
      Participants who completed and dropped out of postpartum treatment also participate in a&#xD;
      focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 3: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (BA): Participants participate in smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes and BA&#xD;
      counseling sessions over 45 minutes once a week for 10 weeks to pilot test delivery via&#xD;
      smartphone videoconferencing and to conduct process evaluation of technical issues in use of&#xD;
      smartphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (HW): Participants participate in smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes and&#xD;
      health and wellness education counseling sessions over 45 minutes once a week for 10 weeks to&#xD;
      pilot test delivery via smartphone videoconferencing and to conduct process evaluation of&#xD;
      technical issues in use of smartphones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 4: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP III (BA): Participants participate in 8-14 smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes&#xD;
      and BA counseling sessions over 45 minutes every 2-3 weeks till the end of the pregnancy.&#xD;
      Following birth, participants also participate in 4 additional sessions within the first 6&#xD;
      weeks, then that last 4 evenly distributed across 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP IV (HW): Participants participate in 8-14 smoking cessation counseling over 15 minutes&#xD;
      and health and wellness education counseling sessions over 45 minutes every 2-3 weeks till&#xD;
      the end of the pregnancy. Following birth, participants also participate in 4 additional&#xD;
