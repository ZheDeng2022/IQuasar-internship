  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response study of&#xD;
      MLC1501 in patients with stroke. Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to&#xD;
      orally receive MLC1501 low-dose twice a day, MLC1501 high-dose twice a day, or matching&#xD;
      placebo for 24 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 540 patients will be included with approximately 180 participants randomized to&#xD;
      each treatment arm. Randomization will be performed centrally and stratified according to the&#xD;
      following factors at the time of randomization: NIHSS (8 to 12, 13 to 18), age (&lt;65 years,&#xD;
      â‰¥65 years) and received either intravenous or endovascular thrombolysis/thrombectomy (no,&#xD;
      yes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy clinical assessments will include mRS, FMA, ARAT, 10MWT, NIHSS, Barthel Index,&#xD;
      EQ-5D-5L, MoCA, PROMIS-10, and occurrence of recurrent vascular event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will undergo standard safety assessments including physical exam and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters, and be observed for adverse events for the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis will be&#xD;
      performed at specified intervals. The C-SSRS will be used to screen for suicidal ideation and&#xD;
      behavior. Blood samples will be collected and stored for future studies on circulating&#xD;
      compounds and pharmacokinetics.&#xD;

    <description>EQ5D-5L has 5 response levels: level 1 (no problems), 2 (slight), 3 (moderate), 4 (severe). Sometimes it is more convenient to dichotomies the levels into 'no problem's (level 1) and 'any problems' (level 2 to 5). In total, there are 3,125 possible unique health states defined by the EQ-5D-5L, with 11111 and 55555 representing the best and worst health states</description>

    <measure>Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System - Global Health</measure>
    <time_frame>12, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Global-10 is a 10-item patient-reported questionnaire in which the response options are presented as 5-point (as well as a single 11-point) rating scales. The results of the questions are used to calculate two summary scores: a Global Physical Health Score and a Global Mental Health score. These scores are then standardized to the general population, using the &quot;T-Score&quot;. The average &quot;T-Score&quot; for the United States population is 50 points, with a standard deviation of 10 points. Higher scores indicate a healthier patient.</description>

    <time_frame>4, 12, 24, 36 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>There are no specified clinical cutoffs for the C-SSRS due to the binary nature of the responses to items. When an item is endorsed, the clinician must pose follow-up inquiries to obtain additional information. The following can inform safety monitoring and treatment planning when patients endorse suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, or both:&#xD;
Suicidal ideation (Item endorsement: Yes; C-SSRS Categories 1-5)&#xD;
Suicidal behavior (Item endorsement: Yes; C-SSRS Categories 6-10)&#xD;
Suicidal ideation &amp; behavior (Item endorsement: Yes; C-SSRS Categories 1-10)</description>
