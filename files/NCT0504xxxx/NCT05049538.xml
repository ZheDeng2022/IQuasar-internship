  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to find out how well liquid biopsies work as a non-invasive alternative to&#xD;
      other methods of finding cancer cells (such as a tissue biopsy) in patients with high-risk&#xD;
      endometrial cancer. A liquid biopsy is a blood test that may be able to find cancer cells.&#xD;
      Collecting and storing samples of blood and tissue from patients with endometrial cancer to&#xD;
      study in the laboratory may help doctors learn how the cells in the blood may change during&#xD;
      treatment for uterine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare TP53, FBXW7, and other mutated gene variant allele frequencies (VAF) in serial&#xD;
      circulating cell free deoxyribonucleic acid (ccfDNA) samples obtained from patients with&#xD;
      high-risk endometrial cancer subtypes during the primary treatment course, which may include&#xD;
      pretreatment, post-surgical removal, post adjuvant treatment, and at time of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Compare the findings from the liquid biopsy mutational analysis to next generation&#xD;
      sequencing from the primary tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the presence of malignant cells in the vagina before and after minimally&#xD;
      invasive hysterectomy among patients with high-risk endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the immune profile and single cell ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequencing&#xD;
      (scRNAseq) profile of high-risk endometrial cancer subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Estimate time to progression (TTP), and investigate potential correlations between&#xD;
      mutated gene variant allele frequency (VAF) ccfDNA samples and progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Compare the efficacy of experimental ccfDNA assays to approved ccfDNA assay using the&#xD;
      same samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples for liquid biopsy during pre-treatment&#xD;
      consultation before hysterectomy, after hysterectomy but before starting any chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and at the end of last chemotherapy cycle. Patients also undergo collection of tissue samples&#xD;
      during hysterectomy. Patients may also undergo Pap smears before and after hysterectomy.&#xD;
