  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain after root canal treatment is an important problem that affects the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients. Common factors affecting the formation of pain after root canal treatment include&#xD;
      insufficient root canal shaping, irrigation solution extrusion, intracanal medicament&#xD;
      extrusion, hyperocclusion, missed canals, presence of pre-procedural pain, presence of&#xD;
      periapical pathology, and extrusion of apical debris . It has been reported that the file&#xD;
      systems and instrumentation technique used in root canal preparation affect apical extrusion,&#xD;
      which is the main cause of postoperative pain . It has been reported that single-file systems&#xD;
      introduced to the market to shorten root canal treatment time cause less postoperative pain&#xD;
      than multi-file systems. However, there are different opinions about the effect of reciprocal&#xD;
      and rotational file systems on postoperative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that coronal flaring during root canal shaping facilitates apical access&#xD;
      of instruments and irrigation solution. NiTi instruments generally tend to orient tissue&#xD;
      debris coronally, coronal shaping can create a reservoir for collecting debris accumulated in&#xD;
      the coronal portion of the root. Therefore, increasing the coronal space for debris reduces&#xD;
      the amount of apically removed extrusion. However, single file systems do not have a coronal&#xD;
      flaring file and canal preparation is completed with a single file. An increased amount of&#xD;
      apical extrusion may occur due to insufficient coronal shaping during canal preparation using&#xD;
      single-file systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the effect of the use of coronal flaring file together with rotational and&#xD;
      reciprocal single file systems on postoperative pain will be investigated, since there are&#xD;
      different results about the effects of rotational and reciprocal file systems on&#xD;
      postoperative pain, and although it has been reported that coronal flaring reduces apical&#xD;
      extrusion, there is no study that determines the effect on postoperative pain. Thus, it is&#xD;
      aimed to reduce the pain after root canal treatment and to have a more comfortable and&#xD;
      painless process after the procedure.&#xD;

      The study is planned to be conducted on a total of 80 patients aged between 18-45 who were&#xD;
      diagnosed and followed up in Van Yüzüncü Yıl University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of&#xD;
      Endodontics. Patients with no systemic disease, diagnosis of irreversible pulpitis, single&#xD;
      rooted and single canal lower premolar tooth will be included in the case group. Patients&#xD;
      with resorption and calcification in the roots of their teeth, incomplete root development,&#xD;
      pregnant and lactating patients, who have taken analgesics or anti-inflammatory drugs in the&#xD;
      last 12 hours and cannot use a rubber dam for root canal treatment will not be included in&#xD;
      the study. After obtaining informed consent from the patients, local anesthesia (Ultracain DS&#xD;
      Fort, Hoechst-Marian Roussel, Frankfurt, Germany) will be administer to the tooth for which&#xD;
      root canal treatment will be applied. Under the rubber dam isolation, the access cavity will&#xD;
      be opened with diamond burs. Working length will be determined using a #15 K file (Mani Inc,&#xD;
      Tochigi, Japan) and electronic apex locator (Propex Pixi, Dentsply Maillefer, Switzerland).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 4 groups according to the file systems to be used in root canal&#xD;
      treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Wave One Gold Group 2: One Flare + Wave One Gold Group 3: One Curve Group 4: One&#xD;
      Flare + One Curve&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the shaping process, 5.25% NaOCI and 17% EDTA will be used as irrigation solution.&#xD;
      NaviTip irrigation needle (30-G; Ultradent Products Inc, South Jordan, USA) will be used for&#xD;
      irrigation during shaping. After the root canal shaping is completed, the canals will be&#xD;
      rinsed with distilled water as a final irrigation and the root canals will be filled with&#xD;
      gutta percha and Adseal (Meta Biomed, Cheongju, North Korea) root canal sealer using the&#xD;
      single cone technique. Teeth will be restored with composite. Patients will be prescribed 400&#xD;
      mg of ibuprofen anti-inflammatory medication to use in case of severe pain. The pain levels&#xD;
      of the lines before and after the procedure will be evaluated with the VAS (Visual analogue&#xD;
      scale) pain scale. Patients will be given a 10 cm paper ruler to record their pain levels&#xD;
      over 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 1 week periods. Patients will be told how to score their&#xD;
      pain levels and will be asked to mark their pain levels on the given ruler at the specified&#xD;
      times. At the end of the 1-week period, the tables will be collected from the patients and&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be made and interpreted for the data.&#xD;
