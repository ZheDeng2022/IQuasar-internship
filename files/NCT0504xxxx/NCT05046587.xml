  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antidepressants are widely used to prevent suicidal risk. However, even though the use of&#xD;
      antidepressants has been associated with a 40-60% decrease in suicidal risk, they do not seem&#xD;
      to be sufficient and appropriate. Indeed recent studies have shown that patients with a&#xD;
      history of suicide attempt and/or with current suicidal ideation (SI) respond less well to&#xD;
      antidepressant treatments. This suggests that patients with depression with SI may be&#xD;
      different from those with depression without SI, thus requiring specific treatments for both&#xD;
      SI reduction and depressive remission. In other words, suicidal depression may be a specific&#xD;
      subtype of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to characterize the clinical phenotype of patients with suicidal depression&#xD;
      vs. those without suicidal depression, and to assess the occurrence of suicidal events at one&#xD;
      year in patients with suicidal depression vs. without suicidal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data having already been collected during the particpation of patients in various&#xD;
      clinical research studies of the department&#xD;
