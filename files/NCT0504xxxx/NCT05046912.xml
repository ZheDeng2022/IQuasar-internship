  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yoga and mindfulness are considered complementary and alternative healthcare options that&#xD;
      involve breathing techniques, relaxation, and bodily postures (yoga only). Research has shown&#xD;
      a positive effect of these on depression, quality of life, and other symptoms of psychosis.&#xD;
      As an 8-week pilot study, the goal is to offer yoga and/or mindfulness online and to explore&#xD;
      the effect on recovery and quality of life for people with psychosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis impacts about 3% of Canadians at any given time. People with psychosis can&#xD;
      experience a combination of positive (e.g., delusions; hallucinations), negative (e.g.,&#xD;
      amotivation; reduced social activity), or cognitive symptoms (e.g., poorer memory; executive&#xD;
      functioning). Positive symptoms are managed via antipsychotic medication and therapeutic&#xD;
      support; cognitive symptoms can be targeted via cognitive remediation therapy. For negative&#xD;
      symptoms, especially those idiopathic, there are still no effective care options. Yoga is a&#xD;
      complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) encompassing health modalities of Eastern&#xD;
      cultures, it involves breathing techniques, relaxation, and bodily postures. Research has&#xD;
      shown that yoga can improve levels of depression and quality of life, and even attenuate&#xD;
      negative symptoms. Given the extensive health care expenditures and unmet care needs for&#xD;
      negative symptoms, there is a growing need to consider CAMs, such as yoga, and accessibility&#xD;
      of CAMs via online methods. As a pioneering study, this proposed pilot study aims to explore&#xD;
      the effect of an 8-week (i.e., 8 sessions) online yoga program on recovery/outcome, with a&#xD;
      focus on negative symptoms, for people with psychosis. The investigators aim to recruit 24&#xD;
      people with psychosis and randomly assign them to either the yoga (n=12) or a mindfulness&#xD;
      group (n=12); mindfulness, in essence, is yoga without the physical aspect (i.e., poses). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that yoga will improve quality of life and attenuate symptom&#xD;
      severity, with a larger effect on negative symptoms, above the effect of mindfulness. A&#xD;
      nonclinical sample (n=12) will also be recruited to examine feasibility and for feedback&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
