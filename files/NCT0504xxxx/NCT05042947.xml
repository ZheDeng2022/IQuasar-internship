  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that postoperative inflammation can be relieved by clipping the wound, and&#xD;
      can reduce the bleeding rate and perforation rate.Scholars at home and abroad have proposed&#xD;
      the use of adhesives and circular surgical lines to clamp the wound.In 2019, Satoshi Abiko&#xD;
      and others proposed the use of double-loop clips technology to clamp the wound, and make&#xD;
      double-loop clips of appropriate length outside the body.Therefore, our study is a&#xD;
      prospective randomized controlled study to explore whether the double-loop clips technique is&#xD;
      safe and effective for larger wounds in daily clinical work.&#xD;
