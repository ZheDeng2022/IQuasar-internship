  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether virtual-reality-based inhibitory control trainings are more&#xD;
      effective than computerized trainings in reducing binge eating symptomatology. These&#xD;
      trainings are used to improve people's ability to resist their impulses towards highly&#xD;
      palatable foods (such as chips or cookies). These trainings also offer promise as a companion&#xD;
      to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, an often used and relatively effective therapeutic&#xD;
      methodology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low levels of inhibitory control (i.e., the ability to withhold a quick, automatic response)&#xD;
      is strongly linked with binge eating pathology. One of the most widely used and effective&#xD;
      treatments for binge eating leaves 40-60% of patients partially or fully symptomatic at&#xD;
      post-treatment. Researchers have begun to investigate the efficacy of computerized inhibitory&#xD;
      control trainings (ICTs), which are tasks in which participants are asked repeatedly withhold&#xD;
      a keypress responses to food stimuli. The intention of these trainings is to improve&#xD;
      inhibitory control and to, in turn, reduce dysregulated eating behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results for the efficacy of ICTs are promising, yet mixed. ICTs that are gamified (i.e.,&#xD;
      turned into a video game) using virtual reality technology have high potential to address the&#xD;
      barriers which may be limiting the efficacy of previous ICTs. The current study aims to&#xD;
      finalize development and test the feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the&#xD;
      first-ever virtual reality ICT (VR-ICT) for individuals with binge eating pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the study's aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim 1: Enhance features of a previously developed, VR-based ICT for binge eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim 2: Examine the feasibility and acceptability of the VR ICT training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim 3: Examine the efficacy of VR-ICT versus a non-VR ICT and ICT vs. sham training,&#xD;
      for reductions in binge eating from pre to post-treatment and at follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on previous research and data from a pilot study, the investigators hypothesize a) that&#xD;
      the VR ICT training program will be feasible and acceptable and b) that the VR-ICT and ICT&#xD;
      will produce superior reductions in binge eating from pre- to post-treatment and at&#xD;
      follow-up, as compared, respectively, with the non-VR ICT and the sham ICT.&#xD;
