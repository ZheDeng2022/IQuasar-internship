      This is an Open-Label Phase I/II Study of daily cabozantinib plus lanreotide every 4 w eeks&#xD;
      to treat advanced G1-2 gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (GEP-NET) patients who&#xD;
      failed to one line or more than one line of small molecule kinase inhibitor or&#xD;
      well-differentiated (W-D) G3 GEP-NET who failed to one line of small molecule kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor or chemotherapy. The primary objective of the study is to determine the maximal&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of cabozantinib of this combinational regimen in the phase I study and&#xD;
      the progression free survival in the phase II study. The secondary objectives are the&#xD;
      objective response rate, overall survival, toxicities and biomarker analysis of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive a combination of oral cabozantinib 40-60 mg/day and lanreotide&#xD;
      120mg deep subcutaneous injection (SC) in day 1 every 4 weeks. Four weeks is a cycle. The&#xD;
      patients will continue to receive this regimen till disease progression, intolerable adverse&#xD;
      events (after dose modification), death, or withdrawal by patients' or principle&#xD;
      investigator's decision.&#xD;
