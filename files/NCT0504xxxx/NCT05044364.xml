      The goal of the research and research is 18 weeks ≤ years of age, age ≤ 75 years of age,&#xD;
      males are not limited; thoughtful for patients who are not suitable for taking medications or&#xD;
      treating oral medications and need to quickly control blood sugar in emergency and&#xD;
      hypertension sub-emergency patients, who meet the following conditions One: ① Clinic systolic&#xD;
      pressure (SBP)&gt;180mmHg and/or clinic diastolic pressure (DBP)&gt;120mmHg, with or without target&#xD;
      organ damage; ②The degree of increase at the time of consultation did not reach SBP&gt;180mmHg&#xD;
      and or DBP&gt; Patients with 180mmHg and or DBP&gt;180mmHg but with indications of intravenous&#xD;
      infusion of menstrual blood. According to the inflation method specified in the test&#xD;
      protocol, clevidipine butyrate injection was infused for more urgent treatment to achieve&#xD;
      rapid, effective, and slow reduction of blood sugar to the target blood sugar to prevent or&#xD;
      start further organ damage.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with hypertensive emergency and hypertensive sub-emergency who are clinically diagnosed as unsuitable for oral antihypertensive treatment or oral antihypertensive treatment are ineffective, and require intravenous medication to quickly control their blood pressure. The qualified subjects will be randomly divided into groups according to the test protocol. The method of administration is to infuse clevidipine butyrate injection for emergency blood pressure reduction treatment to achieve rapid, effective and stable lowering of blood pressure to the target blood pressure, and prevent or reduce further damage to the target organ.</description>
