  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is a chronic disease that has seen a boom in research into its treatments,&#xD;
      improvements and effects in recent decades. These advances have also highlighted the need to&#xD;
      use physical exercise as a countermeasure to reduce the cardiotoxicity of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments. Patients need a correct daily individualisation of the exercise dose necessary to&#xD;
      produce the physiological, physical and psychological benefits. To this end, the present&#xD;
      study will use, in a novel way in this population, heart rate variability (HRV) as a measure&#xD;
      of training prescription. The primary objective of this randomised clinical trial is to&#xD;
      analyse the effects of a physical exercise programme planned according to daily HRV in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients after chemotherapy treatment. For this purpose, a 16-week intervention will&#xD;
      be carried out with 90 breast cancer patients distributed in 3 groups (control group,&#xD;
      conventional preprogrammed physical exercise training group and physical exercise group with&#xD;
      HRV daily programming). Cardiorespiratory capacity, strength, flexibility, agility, balance,&#xD;
      body composition, quality of life, fatigue, functionality, self-esteem, anxiety and&#xD;
      depression of patients before and after the intervention will be evaluated in order to&#xD;
      compare the effects of exercise and its programming.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The intervention of 16 weeks will include exercise programmes of 48 sessions conducted three&#xD;
      times per week for two of the three study groups. These groups will be: a group participating&#xD;
      in a conventional training programme, based on a preplanned intensity progression; and, a&#xD;
      group of participants involved in an exercise programme which will vary the exercise&#xD;
      intensity regarding patients' daily Heart Rate Variability. Each session will include a&#xD;
      warm-up, the main part of cardiovascular and strength training and a cool-down including&#xD;
      stretching exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the participants will be evaluated before and after the intervention measuring clinical,&#xD;
      physical and psychosocial assessments. The clinical variables will be evaluated in patients'&#xD;
      reference hospital and will involve medical history registers, cardiotoxicity variables,&#xD;
      blood analysis and inflammatory factors measures. Physical and psychosocial variables&#xD;
      measurement will be carried out in a sports centre and will include the assessment of: body&#xD;
      composition, heart rate variability, cardiorespiratory capacity, upper and lower extremities'&#xD;
      strength and flexibility, agility and balance, quality of life, fatigue, functionality, life&#xD;
      satisfaction, self-esteem, anxiety and depression, shoulder mobility perception,&#xD;
      kinesiophobia, physical activity level and exercise motivation.&#xD;

In addition, any clothing that may alter the results shall be removed. Once in this position, the air tube of the cuff shall be placed on the front of the upper arm in line with the middle finger and the blue arrow on the cuff.

    <description>To record cardiorespiratory fitness, maximum heart rate and patients' perception of exertion, the Bruce incremental submaximal test (modified) was performed on a treadmill. During the test, the patients will wear a chest strap for heart rate monitoring. Thus, following the protocol created by Bruce, the treadmill will start with a 0% incline and a speed of 1.7 m/h which will be maintained for the first 3 minutes. Every 3 minutes, both the speed and the incline will be increased until the participants decide that their fatigue is too great to continue. At the end of the test, the recovery heart rate is recorded 1 minute after stopping the test to assess the recovery rate. Subsequently, the maximum oxygen consumption of each patient (VO2max = 2.282* (time) + 8.545) will be calculated from the formula proposed by the creators.</description>

    <intervention_name>Physical exercise program</intervention_name>
    <description>The physical exercise programme will last 16 weeks where participants will do three weekly sessions of 60 minutes, approximately. In these training sessions, cardiovascular and strength components will be worked out, planned from moderate to high intensity in the TEG and unique high intensity in the HRVG. The training programme will be divided into three mesocycles from neuromuscular adaptation to reach, in last period, the highest loads and cardiovascular levels. Each session will include a warm-up, a main part and a cool-down with stretching and mobility exercises.&#xD;
The difference between the interventions of the HRVG and TEG will be in the planning of the intensity of the cardiovascular exercises and the weight to be lifted in the strength exercises. The first session of both programmes will have the same intensity but depending on how the heart rate variability of the HRVG patients reacts to, the weight and the intensity will be individualised each day.</description>
