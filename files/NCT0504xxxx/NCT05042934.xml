  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies best dose and side effects of lurbinectedin and how well it&#xD;
      works with or without irinotecan in treating patients with Ewing sarcoma that has come back&#xD;
      (relapsed) or is high risk and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic).&#xD;
      Lurbinectedin may decrease chemicals in the body related to Ewing sarcoma, and reducing these&#xD;
      chemicals may make the tumor cells more sensitive to irinotecan. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      irinotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet&#xD;
      known whether giving lurbinectedin with or without irinotecan may work better in treating&#xD;
      patients with Ewing sarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the time course of nuclear receptor subfamily 0 group B member 1 (NR0B1)&#xD;
      suppression, Werner syndrome RecQ like helicase (WRN) suppression, and S-phase blockade after&#xD;
      lurbinectedin (PM01183) administration in patients with Ewing sarcoma and Ewing's&#xD;
      Sarcoma-Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (EWS-FLI1) translocation. (Phase&#xD;
      IB) II. To determine whether similar NR0B1 suppression, and S-phase blockade after&#xD;
      lurbinectedin (PM01183) administration is seen in patients with Ewing sarcoma other EWSR1&#xD;
      translocations. (Phase IB) III. To determine the recommended dose (RD) of lurbinectedin&#xD;
      (PM01183) in combination with irinotecan every 3 weeks for patients with relapsed Ewing&#xD;
      sarcoma. (Phase IB) IV. To assess the activity of lurbinectedin in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      irinotecan in patients with relapsed Ewing sarcoma. (Phase II) V. To assess if the&#xD;
      suppression of NR0B1is extended after combining irinotecan with lurbinectedin. (Phase II) VI.&#xD;
      To assess the histological characteristics of patients with prolonged stable disease to&#xD;
      determine if they are true responders. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of lurbinectedin, followed by a phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive lurbinectedin intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also&#xD;
      undergo fine-needle aspiration on days 2-6 of cycle 1. Beginning in cycle 2, if the biopsy&#xD;
      shows suppression of NR0B1, then patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on the day of&#xD;
      maximum NR0B1 suppression on cycle 2. If the duration of NR0B1 suppression from lurbinectedin&#xD;
      alone exceeds 48 hours, or if the duration of NR0B1 suppression from lurbinectedin and&#xD;
      irinotecan exceeds 48 hours and is longer than that seen with lurbinectedin alone, then&#xD;
      patients may receive a second dose of irinotecan during the extended period of NR0B1&#xD;
      suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 2 months for&#xD;
      6 months, and then every 3 months for at least 2 years.&#xD;
