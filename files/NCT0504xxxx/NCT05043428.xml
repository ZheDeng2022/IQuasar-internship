  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of an online exercise and peer support intervention&#xD;
      for people living with COPD. In the framework of a randomized control trial, 24 adults with&#xD;
      COPD will be recruited to participate in the study and will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the control or intervention group. The control group will participate in an 8-week virtual&#xD;
      program based on the exercise component of a standard home-based pulmonary rehabilitation&#xD;
      program (one online consultation and 7 phone calls with a kinesiologist). The intervention&#xD;
      group will participate in a twice a week online intervention that includes an exercise&#xD;
      component based on individuals' activities of daily living and a peer support component where&#xD;
      individuals will be taught and encouraged to discuss behaviour change techniques that have&#xD;
      been shown to help support increased participation in physical activity and/or exercise. The&#xD;
      goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of the novel online exercise intervention and&#xD;
      whether the benefits are above other intervention options.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A convenience sample of adults living with COPD (N=24) will be recruited to participate in an 8-week online exercise intervention. The objective is to test a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) for individuals living with COPD and to determine whether the intervention can improve individuals' performance in activities of daily and social living.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Performance in activities of daily and social living</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Participant goal participation will be measured by improvement in initial goals set at the beginning of the study using the Canadian Occupation Performance Measures (COPM). Success will be determined by calculating individuals change score on their satisfaction with their performance in their target areas post-intervention. A change score of 2 on an item is said to represent significant change (Law et al., 2000). A change score of at least 2 on 50% of items (dependent on personal goals) for 70% of participants will be the indicator of success.</description>

    <measure>Timed &quot;Up &amp; Go&quot; test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This test measures the time it takes an individual to stand from a standard chair (approximately 46cm), walk 3 metres, walk back, and return to sit on the chair (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). The participant is timed from when the leave the seat to when they are seated again. A time of &gt;30 seconds is the cut-off for safe unsupervised participation (Podsiadlo &amp; Richardson, 1991). Anyone who gets a time &gt;30seconds will be informed that they cannot participate.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>1-minute sit-to-stand test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 1-minute sit-to-stand test is a measure of exercise capacity that has been validated with individuals living with COPD (Puhan et al., 2013). Individuals sit on a standard chair without arm rests, with their legs hip-width apart and about 90 degrees knee flexion and aligned and are asked to hold their hands stationary on their hips. Participants are then asked to stand and sit 1-2 times to familiar themselves with the movement. Then, for the duration of 1 minute, participants are asked to do as many repetitions as possible of the sit to stand, without using arms for support. The number of repetitions is recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Handgrip Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To measure handgrip strength, we will use a Hand Dynamometer that will be sent to participants. Individuals sit with their shoulders adducted, elbows flexed to 90˚ and forearms in a neutral position (Puhan et al., 2013). They are then asked to squeeze the handle as much as possible and read to the nearest kilogram where the needle stopped, which is then recorded. The best of six measurements is used as an indication of upper body strength.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Six-minute walk test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>To perform the six-minute walk test, participants walk along a track (or hallway) that is a minimum of 25 meters long (marked at each meter). Participants are instructed to walk at a comfortable pace for six minutes. Encouragement is given to each participant approximately every 30 seconds. At the of the test, the distance covered will be recorded. In addition, participants' heart rate will be measured using a Fitbit and participants' dyspnea score will be measured using the modified Borg scale (Kendrick et al., 2000). A lower score, or covering less distance during the six minutes, is indicative of worse physical endurance and function (Sciurba et al., 2003).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>3-minute step test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 8 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The 3-minute step test can be used to assess exertional dyspnea. Participants are instructed to step up and down a 20cm step at a constant pace for 3 minutes. Before the start of test, participants will practice the test at a rate of 16 steps per minute for one minute. These numbers were based on previous research that has used this test with individuals with COPD (Borel et al., 2016). The 3 Minute Step Test App will be used to deliver the stepping rate.&#xD;
The number of steps will be recorded (Beaumont et al., 2019) as well as heart rate (via Fitbit). Participants' dyspnea score will be measured using the modified Borg scale (Kendrick et al., 2000). Results are relative to the individual and therefore post-intervention testing must be performed at the pre-intervention pace.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to the intervention group will be asked to attend 16 online sessions (2 session/week). Each session will last one hour (total time: 16 hours. The exercise portion will be approximately 30 minutes of each session and led by a certified kinesiologist. These exercises are based on activities related to your daily life. As well, they will take part in peer support sessions. The peer support session will be approximately 30 minutes and be moderated by a behaviour change specialist who will also provide strategies to be active. In this peer support group, particpants will share and learn from other individuals living with COPD to help you stay active during and after the intervention. The online sessions will be video recorded to make sure that the program is delivered as designed.</description>

    <description>Those randomized to the control group will be asked to participate in an 8-week exercise program based on the exercise component of a standard home-based pulmonary rehabilitation program. During week 1 of the program, participants will receive a videocall via Microsoft Teams from the certified kinesiologist who will prescribe an exercise program, supervise the first exercise session, and provide a copy of Living Well with COPD, a list of strength exercises, and a home exercise diary. In weeks 2-8, participant exercises will be performed offline, on their own. Participants will be encouraged to engage in two or more exercise sessions per week, targeting both aerobic capacity and muscular strength, and document their exercise using a home diary. They will also receive a phone call once a week from the certified kinesiologist to discuss their exercise progress.</description>
