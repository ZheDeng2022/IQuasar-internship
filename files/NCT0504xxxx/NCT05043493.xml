  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with shoulder osteoarthritis are suffering from pain and disabilities which lead to&#xD;
      difficulties in life. The presence of platelet-rich plasma as regenerative therapy which&#xD;
      helps in healing of damaged tissues like ligaments and joint might be of great benefit in&#xD;
      managing such conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary and secondary osteoarthritis of the shoulder occurs due to destruction of the&#xD;
      articular surface of the humeral head and glenoid , Patient mainly presented with pain and&#xD;
      decreases in the range of motion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of shoulder osteoarthritis is often controversial and is typically based on the&#xD;
      patient's age, the severity of symptoms, and level of activity, radiographic findings, and&#xD;
      medical comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new era of management include regenerative therapy ,Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is one of&#xD;
      the regenerative therapy that prove its effect as injections of a concentration of a&#xD;
      patient's own platelets to accelerate the healing of injured tendons, ligaments, muscles and&#xD;
      joints.&#xD;

    <description>By using NUMERICAL PAIN SCALE patient will mention them pain score on scale from 1 to 10, where the pain score to be included in the study is 5 and more , we will measure pain score for each patient after 2 weeks from injection ,where decrease of the number from the initial recorded number before injection means improvement.</description>

    <time_frame>2 weeks after each injection</time_frame>
    <description>This out come will be evaluated by physiotherapist using a device called a goniometer. A goniometer is a metal or plastic handheld device with two arms. Numbers representing angular distance are on the device, The physiotherapist measures the initial angular distance before the injection, and after the injection by 2 weeks Normal range of active movement of the shoulder has been specified by the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons (AAOS) to be 180° for flexion and abduction and 90° for external rotation.</description>
