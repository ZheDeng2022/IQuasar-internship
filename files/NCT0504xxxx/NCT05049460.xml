  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to examine the effect of four sessions of theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (TBS) versus sham TMS on attentional bias for smoking and opioid cues versus neutral stimuli&#xD;
      in a population of patients with tobacco use disorder (TUD) with comorbid opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (OUD) that is stable and on treatment with buprenorphine. The investigators will also examine&#xD;
      the effect of TBS on craving for cigarettes as well as opioids. Participants will perform a&#xD;
      stress induction procedure that mirrors an optimum combination of cues that trigger tonic&#xD;
      craving in their environment while exposed to stress. All four sessions of TBS/sham TMS will&#xD;
      be performed on the same day, with each session lasting for approximately 10 minutes and&#xD;
      separated by 50 minute intervals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use disorder (TUD) is highly comorbid with opioid use disorder (OUD). Craving in TUD&#xD;
      as well as OUD is of two kinds - phasic and tonic. Phasic craving is present at baseline and&#xD;
      tonic craving is accentuated by environmental stimuli. A predominant mediator of tonic&#xD;
      craving is attentional bias (AB) for environmental stimuli related to either smoking or&#xD;
      opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is comprised of two days of participation. On the first day, participants will&#xD;
      perform two attentional bias (AB) paradigms - one to assess their baseline AB for smoking&#xD;
      cues versus neutral cues and another AB paradigm to assess baseline AB for opioid cues versus&#xD;
      neutral cues. Craving will be assessed using tobacco craving questionnaire and a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (for opioids), in the context of participants performing a stress induction&#xD;
      procedure (which will be a combination of the cold pressor test and PASAT). The investigators&#xD;
      will also acquire a baseline resting state fMRI in addition to MRPAGE structural T1 and T2W&#xD;
      sequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the second day, participants will receive either four sessions of TBS or sham TMS.&#xD;
      Targeting will be down using processed resting state brain scan. Each session of TBS or sham&#xD;
      TMS will last approximately 10 minutes. During each of the 50 minute intervals between&#xD;
      stimulation sessions, participants will perform AB paradigms for smoking and opioids. The&#xD;
      craving scale with stress induction will be performed twice - once before the sessions and&#xD;
      once after the four sessions of TBS/sham TMS. The investigators will also acquire resting&#xD;
      state scans after the four sessions of TBS/sham TMS.&#xD;
