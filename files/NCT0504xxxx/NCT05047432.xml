      This study is part of a larger PhD project. The aim of the overall project is to provide&#xD;
      evidence to help healthcare staff choose the best size tracheostomy breathing tube for&#xD;
      patients in intensive care. There are no clear guidelines on how to choose the size of&#xD;
      tracheostomy tubes currently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this part of the project is to compare methods of choosing the size tracheostomy&#xD;
      tube for patients. Four methods are based on easily recorded physical characteristics of the&#xD;
      participants (sex, height, Body Mass Index and shoulder width). A fifth method is based on&#xD;
      measurement of the windpipe (trachea). We will recruit patients and staff at the Royal Free&#xD;
      London NHS Foundation Trust. We will measure their height, weight and shoulder width, and&#xD;
      record their age and sex. We will use ultrasound to measure each participant's trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will calculate the recommended tube size using the five methods above. We will compare how&#xD;
      well the first four methods agree with the method based on measurements of the trachea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will inform healthcare staff how well the different ways of&#xD;
      choosing the size of tube relate to the fit of a tube in the trachea.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION This piece of research constitutes one of four workstreams in an NIHR&#xD;
           funded PhD programme of work. The overall aims of the PhD project are 1) to create&#xD;
           guidance for Health Care Professionals (HCPs) on how to select the right size&#xD;
           tracheostomy tube (TT) for patients in an intensive care unit (ICU), and 2) to identify&#xD;
           ways to best ensure that HCPs follow the guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This protocol is for Workstream 2. In this workstream we will calculate tube size&#xD;
           recommendations for each participant using five methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  four using sets of criteria that replicate current practice and relate to physical&#xD;
                characteristics (sex, shoulder width, height and Body Mass Index)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  a recommended set of criteria based on measurements of tracheal width&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will then calculate concordance (%) between tube size recommendations based on&#xD;
           tracheal measurements and those based on other physical characteristics. Secondary&#xD;
           analysis will determine strength of correlation between tracheal diameter and height,&#xD;
           shoulder width, age, sex, Body Mass Index and ethnicity. The findings will provide&#xD;
           evidence for clinicians on how the fit of a tracheostomy tube within the trachea may be&#xD;
           affected by the size-selection criteria used.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study in isolation is not intended to provide definitive clinical recommendations&#xD;
           regarding the selection of tracheostomy tube size, since this also requires knowledge of&#xD;
           1) the impact of tube size on airflow through and around tracheostomy tubes and 2) what&#xD;
           is important to patients in terms of functional effects of size of tube. These two&#xD;
           issues are the focus of other workstreams within the larger programme of work.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
           Tracheostomy tubes (TT) are breathing tubes that are surgically inserted through the&#xD;
           front of the neck. They can:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  allow easier breathing for patients with upper airway obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  provide access to the lungs to clear secretions&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  facilitate longer term use of artificial breathing machines (mechanical&#xD;
                ventilation, MV) by replacing breathing tubes that go through the mouth&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  help patients to be liberated from MV There are an estimated 12,000 tracheostomy&#xD;
                insertions a year in England and the majority of these occur in intensive care&#xD;
                units (ICUs). There are a number of widely used reference guidelines addressing the&#xD;
                general management of patients with a TT. These state that a clinician should&#xD;
                consider the size of the TT prior to insertion, but do not fully describe how to&#xD;
                select the correct size. In practice, methods of selecting tracheostomy tube vary&#xD;
                widely and decisions are often made on the basis of a patient's sex or perceived&#xD;
                size.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TTs that are the wrong size can cause physical and psychological harm. If the TT is too&#xD;
           small there is a risk of a leak around the tracheostomy cuff (a ring-shaped balloon&#xD;
           around the tube), leading to difficulty using MV, and aspiration of saliva or stomach&#xD;
           contents into the lungs. Over-inflation of TT cuff in an attempt to compensate for the&#xD;
           TT being too small can cause long-term damage to the trachea. If the TT is too big there&#xD;
           is risk of trauma to the skin around the hole in the neck and to the trachea, and a&#xD;
           patient is unlikely to be able to use a speaking valve to talk. In TTs that are too big&#xD;
           or small, the tip may abut the anterior or posterior tracheal wall, causing trauma and&#xD;
           difficulty breathing around or through it respectively. Any trauma to the tracheal wall&#xD;
           or insertion site can lead to narrowing of the airway called tracheal stenosis. The&#xD;
           consequences of this range from mild breathing difficulties through to complete blockage&#xD;
           of the airway. Treatment for tracheal stenosis ranges from balloon dilatation to major&#xD;
           reconstructive surgery and can cause a heavy burden to patients and the health services.&#xD;
           Good decision-making regarding size of TT may reduce the incidence of tracheal stenosis&#xD;
           and associated financial costs of treatment or increased levels of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If the TT is too big, a patient is unlikely to be able to talk. Not being able to talk&#xD;
           is highly stressful for patients on ICU. It can lead to treatment decisions being&#xD;
           delayed or made by others on behalf of the patient, and has been linked with increased&#xD;
           levels of anxiety and depression and the development of delirium and post-traumatic&#xD;
           stress disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
           There is mixed evidence to support correlation between anthropometrics and tracheal&#xD;
           dimensions. A few observational cohort studies have sought to establish normative data&#xD;
           for tracheal dimensions, some comparing these with sex, height, or weight. Evidence from&#xD;
           a paediatric study supports a correlation between height and tracheal dimensions in&#xD;
           children. The literature on adults is inconclusive. No studies to date have investigated&#xD;
           a potential correlation between shoulder width and tracheal diameter. Tracheal width in&#xD;
           men, like shoulder width, continues to grow beyond the point when full stature is&#xD;
           achieved, and has been proposed as a cause for a non-linear relationship between height&#xD;
           and tracheal width found in some studies. 'Patient size' is commonly used in&#xD;
           tracheostomy tube decisions. Height, shoulder width and BMI are used in this study as&#xD;
           surrogates for patient size.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ultrasound is increasingly being used to assess the airway and has shown strong&#xD;
           correlation with measurements taken from computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI). Ultrasound has the benefits over other measurement techniques of being&#xD;
           non-invasive, not requiring radiation exposure and being relatively inexpensive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. OBJECTIVES 3.1 Primary Objective To determine the concordance between a tracheal&#xD;
           diameter-based standard for selecting tracheostomy tube size and sets of criteria based&#xD;
           on sex, height, shoulder-width and BMI in an adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3.2 Secondary Objectives To estimate the association between tracheal width and standing&#xD;
           height, shoulder width, ethnicity, age, sex and other demographic characteristics in an&#xD;
           adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. STUDY DESIGN Type of Study: cross-sectional observational study Population: Adult&#xD;
           inpatients, outpatients and hospital staff at the Royal Free London NHS Foundation&#xD;
           Trust. Prisoners, patients and staff who are pregnant, those with severe deformity of&#xD;
           the spine and patients lacking mental capacity to consent will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Duration of enrolment: One appointment of 45-60 minutes. No follow-up required. Sample&#xD;
           size: a sample of 114 participants will provide 90% power to detect a concordance of 65%&#xD;
           (null hypothesis = 50%) between methods of selecting tracheostomy tube size, with a&#xD;
           1-sided significance level of 2.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Analysis: Analysis of concordance will be used to evaluate the level of&#xD;
           agreement between methods to select size of tracheal tube using 1. tracheal width as&#xD;
           measured using ultrasound 2. other physical characteristics (sex, height, shoulder&#xD;
           width, BMI) Concordance will be expressed as proportion (%) of agreement. Univariate and&#xD;
           multivariate linear regression analysis will be used to evaluate the association between&#xD;
           tracheal width and standing height, shoulder width, ethnicity, age, sex and other&#xD;
           demographic characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. STUDY SCHEDULE We will advertise the study via flyers, posters, staff communications and&#xD;
           word of mouth. Patients will be enrolled following screening and consent procedures&#xD;
           outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research appointment will last approximately 45 - 60 minutes and include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consent procedures including time for questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief interview and collection of demographic and clinical data&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hospital number - (for patients only)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Height&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  History of airway disease or surgery (including tracheostomy) or severe kyphosis of&#xD;
                the spine&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Major medical or surgical history will be recorded in order to provide context to&#xD;
                clinicians reading the findings and enable them to judge applicability to their&#xD;
                patient populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measurement of shoulder width&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasound measurement of the width of the trachea (windpipe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI will be calculated using height and weight&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following process measures will also be taken:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time taken to obtain measurements of the trachea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inter and intra-rater reliability for measurements of the trachea This information is of&#xD;
           interest in the wider PhD programme of work. It will be presented to the Clinical&#xD;
           Steering Committee as an indication of 1) how much time measuring the trachea would add&#xD;
           to a tracheostomy insertion procedure and 2) accuracy of measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No follow up is required after the initial research appointment. Participants may withdraw at&#xD;
      any point up until the end of the data collection appointment. They do not have to give a&#xD;
      reason for withdrawing and will be given assurance that their care (patients) or employment&#xD;
      (staff) will not be affected by withdrawing. Data already collected will be kept and&#xD;
      analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will end when data for 114 participants have been recorded and the results&#xD;
      described and analysed in the final study report.&#xD;
