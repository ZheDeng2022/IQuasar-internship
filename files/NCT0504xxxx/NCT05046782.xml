  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiparametric MRI of the prostate (mpMRI) plays an integral role in contemporary prostate&#xD;
      cancer management. It involves the acquisition of both anatomical sequences (T1- and&#xD;
      T2-weighted images) as well as 'functional' imaging sequences (diffusion weighted imaging&#xD;
      (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) imaging), the latter sequences being those which&#xD;
      image water diffusivity and tissue perfusion, respectively. Advantages of mpMRI include&#xD;
      ability to risk stratify patients prior to biopsy, enhanced detection of clinically&#xD;
      significant cancer and reduced diagnosis of insignificant cancers, the identification of&#xD;
      active surveillance candidates and improved local staging for subsequent surgical and&#xD;
      radiotherapy planning. However, there are ongoing challenges encountered with prostate mpMRI&#xD;
      in terms of patient acceptance, image acquisition technical challenges, interpretive&#xD;
      expertise and cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These challenges have motivated recent investigations employing tailored MRI protocols, i.e.&#xD;
      faster and less expensive MR exams that eliminate one or more aspects of current mpMRI&#xD;
      technique considered redundant, while retaining the essential imaging parameters needed for&#xD;
      equivalent diagnostic interpretation. Among these is non-contrast biparametric MRI, which&#xD;
      involves anatomic T2 weighted images along with diffusion weighted images (DWI) as the only&#xD;
      retained functional sequence. Both single center studies and meta analyses have demonstrated&#xD;
      no added value for DCE compared to the combination of T2WI and DWI, Overall cancer detection&#xD;
      rates have been found to be equivalent for bpMRI compared to mpMRI, independent of reader&#xD;
      experience, with comparable efficacy to guide cognitive targeted, MRI-targeted and MRI-US&#xD;
      fusion guided biopsy. Equivalence between bpMRI and mpMRI for cancer detection has also been&#xD;
      corroborated in two recently published meta analyses. Based upon our institution's experience&#xD;
      with prostate mpMRI, avoidance of gadolinium and DCE imaging would be associated with a 30&#xD;
      percent reduction in scan cost and 40 percent reduction in total time (i.e. scan time plus&#xD;
      patient preparatory time).&#xD;

      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study of men presenting to MD Anderson with treatment naïve,&#xD;
      histologically confirmed prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the diagnostic accuracy of T2 weighted&#xD;
      imaging (T2WI) and restriction spectrum imaging (RSI) (T2WI + RSI) to that of multiparametric&#xD;
      MRI (mpMRI), for the detection of individual prostate cancer foci. Results will be validated&#xD;
      against histopathologic findings at prostatectomy as the reference standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that T2WI + RSI will detect more clinically significant prostate cancer foci&#xD;
      (any Gleason grade group &gt; 2) compared to mpMRI when one-to-one matching between imaging and&#xD;
      prostatectomy findings is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To perform a pilot study evaluating T2WI+RSI/US fusion guided biopsy compared to mpMRI/US&#xD;
      fusion biopsy for the diagnosis of clinically significant cancer (any Gleason grade group &gt;&#xD;
      2) in a cohort of patients scheduled for clinically indicated MRI/US fusion guided biopsy. In&#xD;
      this pilot study, we hypothesize that RSI/US fusion guided biopsy will be non-inferior to&#xD;
      mpMRI/US fusion guided biopsy in the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To acquire high frequency transrectal microultrasound data in patients undergoing&#xD;
           clinically indicated MRI/US fusion guided biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To perform additional comparative analyses of mpMRI and RSI images, including analyzing&#xD;
           variations in tumor contours between imaging data sets.&#xD;
