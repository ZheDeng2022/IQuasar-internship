      In order to improve routine immunization uptake during COVID-19 pandemic, and to understand&#xD;
      the perceptions and barriers related to vaccine hesitancy and coverage during COVID 19 and to&#xD;
      explore the need for COVID-19 vaccination, separately and as a part of routine immunization,&#xD;
      the investigators will be using qualitative methodology to explore and understand the role of&#xD;
      mHealth and social media interventions, that are most suitable in Pakistani context to&#xD;
      improve vaccination coverage during COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The application of information and communication technologies (through such digital health&#xD;
      methods as SMS, phone calls and automated calls, smartphone apps and wearable technology) has&#xD;
      paved the way for modification of health-related knowledge and bring in the behavior change&#xD;
      and practices to decrease vaccine hesitancy and improve immunization uptake. Mass and social&#xD;
      media are influential in the dissemination of information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, as&#xD;
      well as the development and use of vaccines, not only for COVID-19 but also CRI. However, the&#xD;
      same low-cost/free and accessible methods (social media platforms) that enable&#xD;
      low/middle-income populations to communicate, connect and access information can also be the&#xD;
      main factor in the distribution and prevalence of unregulated, unverified misinformation. In&#xD;
      particular, the anti-vaccination movement, which has been identified as a major factor for&#xD;
      vaccine hesitancy is the result of spreading misinformation through these same social media&#xD;
      platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of the current pandemic and distancing measures, CRI coverage is adversely affected&#xD;
      as caregivers avoid tertiary care hospitals or primary health centers. This has further&#xD;
      increased the risk of outbreak for vaccine-preventable diseases, as well as economic burden&#xD;
      due to morbidity and mortality and delay in caregiver getting back to work. A recent survey&#xD;
      by an international consortium also illustrated a decline in vaccination coverage across all&#xD;
      milestone age groups, except for vaccines administered at birth in hospital like Hepatitis B.&#xD;
      Hence due to reduced vaccination rates, various countries are experiencing outbreaks of&#xD;
      previously controlled diseases globally like measles, rubella, tuberculosis, and rotavirus,&#xD;
      and has even caused new mutated strains of polio to reemerge. However, for the first time in&#xD;
      almost three decades there has been the significant decrease in the coverage of DPT3 vaccine&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pakistan is identified as a LMIC with high vaccine hesitancy and is third among countries&#xD;
      with the most unvaccinated/under-vaccinated children. It ranks fourth in global child&#xD;
      mortality, with 60% of deaths due to infectious diseases that are vaccine-preventable. The&#xD;
      EPI coverage for fully immunized children were estimated to be 65% and 88% at national level&#xD;
      respectively in the past two survey reports. However, rates for Sindh province are even lower&#xD;
      with fully immunized children rates of 39% and 80% respectively. Further Pakistan is among&#xD;
      three polios endemic country and among top 5 countries with the most unvaccinated and&#xD;
      under-vaccinated children. With further decrease in immunization rates due to current&#xD;
      pandemic, vaccination coverage has only plummeted all time low coverage further due to&#xD;
      disruption in vaccination services and demand, causing new outbreaks of previously controlled&#xD;
      diseases like new polio strains, measles and rubella. Hence it is eminent to explore new&#xD;
      strategies included mhealth and social media to bring in the behavior change in order to&#xD;
      improve vaccine uptake. In addition, it is also important to understand the perceptions and&#xD;
      barriers related to vaccine hesitancy and coverage during COVID 19 and come up with&#xD;
      strategies to finalize our interventions.&#xD;
