  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Given the magnitude of the epidemic in Puerto Rico, congenital Zika virus infection may have&#xD;
      devastating complications to a significant population of children, also affecting families&#xD;
      and society at large. This proposal takes a critical first step to ensuring that children&#xD;
      with exposure to congenital Zika virus infection receive the follow-up care they need for&#xD;
      optimal clinical outcomes. We anticipate that lessons learned from this study may also&#xD;
      positively impact models for adherence to early intervention services in Puerto Rico.&#xD;

      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be the primary caregivers (age ≥18 years) of children with possible&#xD;
      congenital Zika virus infection. Participants will be recruited from the pediatric services&#xD;
      of the University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus (UPR-MSC), as well as other clinics&#xD;
      and community-based organizations in Puerto Rico. In the intervention, a community health&#xD;
      worker (CHW) will deliver personalized sessions framed around a multi-media health&#xD;
      communication tool. The CHW will deliver the intervention over a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be the primary caregivers (age ≥18 years) of children with possible&#xD;
      congenital Zika virus infection. Participants will be recruited via provider referral, peer&#xD;
      referral, and flyers. Once an individual expresses interest in the study, a study staff&#xD;
      member will screen that individual to assess eligibility. Individuals who are eligible will&#xD;
      be invited to enroll through an informed consent process and complete a baseline interview.&#xD;
      After completion of the baseline interview, study staff will randomize participants into an&#xD;
      enhanced control condition (ECC) or intervention condition that receives an&#xD;
      individually-tailored community health worker intervention. At trial exit, all participants,&#xD;
      including the ECC group, will complete an in-depth assessment to measure their barriers to&#xD;
      follow-up Zika-related pediatric services and provide feedback about their experience in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
