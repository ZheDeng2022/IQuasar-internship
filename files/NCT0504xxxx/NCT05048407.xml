  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Precision Robotics' Sirius Robotic Flexible Endoscopic System is a new fully integrated&#xD;
      compact 3D laparoscopic camera system with a disposable single-use flexible tip that can&#xD;
      change its viewing direction. The aim of this IDEAL-D Stage 1 study was to demonstrate that&#xD;
      the Sirius System could safely replace the conventional laparoscope in the surgical workflow&#xD;
      for minimally invasive gynaecological laparoscopic surgery&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic procedures for benign gynaecology are well established. For gynaecological&#xD;
      oncology, laparoscopic total hysterectomy bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is the gold&#xD;
      standard for the surgical management of early stage carcinoma of the corpus. Compared to&#xD;
      laparotomy, laparoscopy is associated with reduced morbidity and quicker recovery with no&#xD;
      compromise to overall survival. With advancement in laparoscopic technology, minimal access&#xD;
      surgery has progressed to single incision laparoscopy(SILS) and natural orifice&#xD;
      surgery(vNOTEs) thus further reducing morbidity and enhancing recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precision Robotics' Sirius System is a fully integrated compact 3D laparoscopic system with a&#xD;
      flexible tip that can change its viewing direction. The articulated tip has three degrees of&#xD;
      freedom enabling C and S-shaped bending providing a wider field of view compared to&#xD;
      conventional laparoscopes. This wider field of view is of particular advantage for SILS and&#xD;
      vNOTEs, and presently available commercial systems do not have the same field of view or&#xD;
      degrees of freedom.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From September 2019 to July 2020, three animal studies were performed by Precision Robotics&#xD;
      in collaboration with National Taiwan University Hospital and Shanghai Ruijin Hospital. Using&#xD;
      the Sirius System, expert surgeons successfully conducted the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laparoscopic Surgery - Performed a cholecystectomy where the gallbladder was removed&#xD;
           from an animal model laparoscopically.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trans-anal Surgery - A small tissue sample was removed using an electronic knife to test&#xD;
           the system's performance in a SILS operation with a porcine model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Orthopaedics Surgery - Conducted a MIS-TLIF (minimally invasive surgery - Transforaminal&#xD;
           lumbar interbody fusion) operation on an animal cadaver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgeons were able to complete their full surgical workflow using the system, and any&#xD;
      feedback was incorporated in refining the system's design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to animal studies, the system's safety was demonstrated through extensive testing&#xD;
      by qualified testing centres in compliance with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and&#xD;
      electrical safety standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tested in accordance to IEC 60601-1-2: 2014 / EN 60601-1-2:2015, FCC 47CFR Part 15: 2018&#xD;
           ANSIC63.4:2014, IEC 60601-1:2005+AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-2-18:2009,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biocompatibility test for all material in contact with patient body according to ISO&#xD;
           10993.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety, reliability and efficacy of an articulated laparoscopic camera system -&#xD;
      Precision Robotics' Sirius Robotic Flexible Endoscopic System in gynaecological laparoscopic&#xD;
      surgery particularly for Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery(SILS) and Vaginal Natural&#xD;
      Orifice Transluminal Endoscopy(vNOTEs). The aim in this pilot study is to show that the&#xD;
      Sirius System can safely replace the conventional endoscope in the surgical workflow for&#xD;
      gynaecological laparoscopic surgery.&#xD;

For every procedure using the Sirius System, a conventional laparoscope was on immediate standby to replace the Sirius System should there be an unanticipated equipment failure so that the procedure could be completed without delay.</description>
