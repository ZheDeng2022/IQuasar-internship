    <textblock>
      The National Australian HCV Point-of-Care Testing Program will establish an observational&#xD;
      cohort to evaluate whether scale-up of finger-stick point-of-care HCV testing increases&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment for HCV infection. Participants will be recruited from settings&#xD;
      providing services to people with a risk factor for the acquisition of HCV infection&#xD;
      (including drug treatment clinics, needle and syringe programs, homelessness settings, mental&#xD;
      health services, prisons, and mobile outreach). Participants will attend a single visit to&#xD;
      have their HCV RNA status tested and complete a self-administered survey. Participants will&#xD;
      not receive treatment as a part of this study. Participants who are HCV RNA positive will be&#xD;
      linked to standard of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The advent of simple direct-acting antiviral hepatitis C (HCV) therapies with cure rates &gt;95%&#xD;
      is one of the greatest medical advances in decades, having led to a reversal in liver-related&#xD;
      mortality. In Australia, treatment uptake has declined between 2016 (32,000 treated) and&#xD;
      2019/20 (2019: 11,500; 2020: 8,500).1 Progress towards HCV elimination has been impeded by&#xD;
      COVID-19, affecting the delivery of national and state-based HCV strategies. Improving HCV&#xD;
      treatment uptake to reduce disease burden is a key aim of global, national and state-based&#xD;
      HCV strategies.2-4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale-up of HCV testing and treatment will be required to achieve elimination by 2030.&#xD;
      Current diagnostic pathways require multiple visits to a practitioner reducing the proportion&#xD;
      who receive a diagnosis. In Australia, 81% of people have had HCV antibody testing (indicates&#xD;
      exposure), but only 47% have been HCV RNA tested (indicates active infection and the need for&#xD;
      HCV treatment).5 Mathematical modelling suggests that HCV RNA testing needs to increase by at&#xD;
      least 50% annually to achieve elimination in Australia by 2030.6&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kirby Institute is an international leader in research evaluating the Xpert HCV assay&#xD;
      (Grebely Lancet Gastro Hep 2017), having built a large network of Xpert platforms for HCV&#xD;
      testing in needle and syringe programs, prisons, drug treatment clinics, tertiary hospitals,&#xD;
      and Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service. In Kirby-led research, point-of-care HCV&#xD;
      testing interventions in needle and syringe programs and prisons have resulted in high HCV&#xD;
      treatment uptake (70-90%). The Kirby Institute and Flinders University also have a strong&#xD;
      track record of implementing point-of-care testing for STIs and COVID-19, providing an ideal&#xD;
      foundation to scale-up Xpert HCV testing in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kirby Institute and Flinders University will establish the Australian National HCV&#xD;
      Point-of-care Testing Program for the scale-up of point-of-care HCV RNA testing in services&#xD;
      with high prevalence of HCV infection, including community health centres, drug treatment&#xD;
      clinics, needle and syringe programs, and prisons. This program will include the development&#xD;
      of standard operating procedures, logistics/deployment, initial set-up, an operator training&#xD;
      program, and quality assurance and competency assessment program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An observational cohort study that will be established to evaluate HCV treatment uptake&#xD;
      following scale-up of point-of-care HCV testing among people with a risk factor for&#xD;
      acquisition of HCV infection or people attending a service caring for people with risk&#xD;
      factors for the acquisition of HCV infection. This study will also include the linkage of&#xD;
      survey data to a range of administrative datasets which will be used to evaluate the impact&#xD;
      of HCV testing and treatment scale-up on a range of long-term health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from settings that provide services to people with a risk&#xD;
      factor for the acquisition of HCV infection. Participants will attend a single visit to&#xD;
      receive point-of-care HCV testing and complete a self-administered survey. In settings with&#xD;
      high anticipated HCV antibody prevalence (&gt;15%; e.g. drug treatment, prisons, needle and&#xD;
      syringe programs), people who have previously been told they have HCV infection, or for&#xD;
      people who have previously received HCV treatment, testing will be performed using&#xD;
      point-of-care HCV RNA testing (results in one hour). In settings with a low anticipated HCV&#xD;
      antibody prevalence (&lt;15%; e.g. mental health, homelessness), testing will be performed using&#xD;
      point-of-care HCV antibody testing (results in 20 minutes) and if positive, point-of-care HCV&#xD;
      RNA testing will be performed. Participants will not receive treatment as a part of this&#xD;
      study. Participants who are HCV RNA positive will be linked to standard of care for any other&#xD;
      clinical assessments and treatment initiation.&#xD;
