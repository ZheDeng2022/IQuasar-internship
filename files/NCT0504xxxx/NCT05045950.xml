  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Study patients will receive Whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT) - pulsed reduced dose rate&#xD;
      (PRDR) within 14 days of registration. All patients will receive single daily fractions using&#xD;
      3D conformal radiotherapy. A dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions will be delivered using the PRDR&#xD;
      technique.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, single-arm, single-center study assessing the feasibility and tolerance&#xD;
      of WBRT using upfront PRDR in the treatment of solid tumor brain metastases. This study will&#xD;
      also examine the impact of substituting PRDR for standard whole-brain radiation therapy in&#xD;
      the upfront treatment of brain metastases on neurocognitive decline as compared to historical&#xD;
      controls. Additionally, clinical patient outcomes associated with radiation treatment of&#xD;
      brain metastases will be collected. Using a group sequential design with one interim analysis&#xD;
      to stop for futility, the investigators will recruit and enroll 53 adult patients (≥18 years)&#xD;
      undergoing upfront treatment of brain metastases to determine feasibility and a preliminary&#xD;
      analysis after the first 27 enrolled patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be eligible for this study, patients must have a biopsy-proven solid malignancy&#xD;
      with intracranial lesions radiographically consistent with or pathologically proven to be&#xD;
      brain metastases. Patient who are confirmed to meet all eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      registered to the study and start PRDR WBRT within two weeks postregistration. Patients will&#xD;
      receive PRDR WBRT as a dose of 30Gy in 10 fractions and start memantine orally two days prior&#xD;
      to (or one day prior to) but no later than the fourth PRDR WBRT treatment session.&#xD;

    <description>Study patients will receive WBRT-PRDR within 14 days of registration. All patients will receive single daily fractions using 3D conformal radiotherapy. A dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions will be delivered using the PRDR technique. Memantine should ideally start two days (or one day) prior to WBRT PRDR and must start no later than the fourth WBRT PRDR treatment and will continue for a maximum of 24 weeks (≈six months). Memantine will be administered as per standard institutional guidelines.</description>

    <description>Both extended release memantine and twice daily memantine dosing will be allowed.&#xD;
Twice daily dosing:&#xD;
The target dose for memantine is 20 mg (10 mg divided twice daily). Dose will be escalated by 5 mg each week to a target of 10 mg twice daily (i.e., 5 mg a day on week 1, then 5 mg twice daily (BID) on week 2, then 10 mg in AM plus 5 mg in PM on week 3, followed by 10 mg in AM plus 10 mg in PM by week 4).&#xD;
Extended Release Memantine:&#xD;
The target dose for extended release memantine is 28 mg. Dose will be escalated by 7 mg per week to a target of 28 mg daily (i.e., 7 mg a day on week 1, then 14 mg a day on week 2, then 21 mg a day on week 3, followed by 28 mg a day by week 4).</description>

    <description>The total dose of 3000 cGy (30 Gy) will be divided 10 fractions of 300 cGy (3 Gy); each fraction will be delivered as a series of 20 cGy (0.2Gy) pulses separated by 3 min time intervals. 20 cGy / 3 min = 6.67 cGy/min (or 0.0667 Gy/min). Total time is determined by the fractionated series and time intervals, meaning 300cGy/20cGy = 15 division x 3 minutes = 45 minutes. Including time to set up, approximate total time per treatment session will be 60 minutes.</description>

             unequivocal cytologic proof solid tumor malignancy from either the primary or any&#xD;
             metastatic site) with intracranial lesions radiographically consistent with or&#xD;
             pathologically proven to be brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who have undergone prior systemic therapy are eligible.&#xD;

             whose primary language is English).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with previous or other malignancies whose disease is controlled and not&#xD;
             impacting ECOG performance or life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Willing and able to give consent and to comply with treatment and follow-up schedule.&#xD;

             treatment, and/or follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Non-native English speakers will be excluded since patients often lose their faculty&#xD;
             with the language they acquired second before their native language is affected in the&#xD;
             context of cognitive decline. This could adversely affect performance on verbal&#xD;
