  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effect and safety of erenumab compared to placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of acute posttraumatic headache (PTH) in military service members and civilians&#xD;
      with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Headache is recognized as one of the most common and disabling symptoms following head&#xD;
      trauma. This study is designed to assess a calcitonin gene-related peptide (cGRP) monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody (erenumab) for the preventive treatment of PTH based on the rationale that headache&#xD;
      posttrauma is similar to migraine and is mediated by the activation of the trigeminal&#xD;
      vascular system and subsequent release of cGRP. This study is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of erenumab 140 mg&#xD;
      for the treatment of PTH in military service members and civilians with mTBI at military&#xD;
      treatment facilities across the United States.&#xD;
