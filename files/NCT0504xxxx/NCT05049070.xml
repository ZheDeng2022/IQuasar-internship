  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the reliability, validity and safety of a self administered, subjective&#xD;
      refraction test via a mobile medical app (GoEyes) as compared to standard of care subjective&#xD;
      manifest refraction performed by a health care provider, in subjects who have no known ocular&#xD;
      disease or condition other than refractive error.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GoEyes is a Mobile Medical Application, which can be downloaded to a smartphone and is being&#xD;
      developed as a self -administered subjective refraction examination that measures the&#xD;
      refractive error of the user's eyes in the home environment without any contact or help from&#xD;
      health care professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study will be conducted in 2 parts; Part A and Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 59 participants will be enrolled In Part A. Part A participants will have a&#xD;
      GoEyes refraction test in clinic on two separate days and will also have a standard of care&#xD;
      refraction test performed by a health care provider and best corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 220 participants will be enrolled in Part B. Part B participants will self&#xD;
      administer the GoEyes test at home on 2 separate days and will also have an in clinic&#xD;
      standard of care refraction test performed by a health care provider and best corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity assessments.&#xD;
