  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I trial studies the effect of pembrolizumab and lenvatinib in treating&#xD;
      patients with gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places in the body&#xD;
      (advanced/metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Lenvatinib may&#xD;
      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab and lenvatinib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 in adult subjects with previously treated&#xD;
      advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the duration of response (DOR), disease control rate (DCR),&#xD;
      time-to-progression (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), using RECIST 1.1 and&#xD;
      immune-related (i)RECIST criteria and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib in adult&#xD;
      subjects with previously treated advanced (unresectable and/or metastatic) gastroesophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform exploratory biomarker analyses to study the correlation between immunological&#xD;
      and molecular changes in tumor tissues and peripheral blood with clinical outcomes (DOR, DCR,&#xD;
      TTP, PFS, and OS) using RESIST 1.1 and iRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the association between PD-L1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC), shed&#xD;
      PD-L1 levels, somatic gene expression profiling (18-gene T-cell inflamed GEP) and antitumor&#xD;
      efficacy of pembrolizumab based on RECIST 1.1 imaging criteria as well as OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the relationship between genomic variation and response to the treatment&#xD;
      administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and lenvatinib&#xD;
      orally (PO) once daily (QD). Treatment repeats every 42 days for up to 17 cycles in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;

               -  Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
                  (abstinent on a long term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Must agree to use contraception unless confirmed to be azoospermic (vasectomized&#xD;

                       or breastfeeding partner must agree to remain abstinent from penile-vaginal&#xD;
                       intercourse or use a male condom during each episode of penile-vaginal&#xD;
                       penetration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Please note that 30 days after lenvatinib is stopped, if the subject is on&#xD;
                  pembrolizumab only, no male contraception measures are needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding,&#xD;
             and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;

               -  Is not a WOCBP OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Is a WOCBP and using a contraceptive method that is highly effective (with a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year) and has a low user dependency, or is abstinent&#xD;
                  from heterosexual intercourse as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent&#xD;
                  on a long term and persistent basis), as described in Appendix 12.8 during the&#xD;
                  intervention period and for at least 120 days post pembrolizumab or 30 days post&#xD;
                  lenvatinib, whichever occurs last. The investigator should evaluate the potential&#xD;
                  for contraceptive method failure (i.e., noncompliance, recently initiated) in&#xD;
                  relationship to the first dose of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test (urine or serum as&#xD;
                  required by local regulations) within 24 hours before the first dose of study&#xD;
                  intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a&#xD;
                  serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the subject must be excluded&#xD;
                  from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The investigator is responsible for review of medical history, menstrual history,&#xD;
                  and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an&#xD;
                  early undetected pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             they are radiological stable (i.e., without evidence of progression for at least 4&#xD;
             weeks by repeat imaging (note that the repeat imaging should be performed during study&#xD;
             screening), clinically stable and without requirement of steroid treatment for at&#xD;
             least 14 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment. This exception does not&#xD;
             include carcinomatous meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2&#xD;
             years (i.e., with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,&#xD;
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment and is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has symptomatic ascites or pleural effusion. A subject who is clinically stable&#xD;
             following treatment for these conditions (including therapeutic thoraco- or&#xD;
             paracentesis) is eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required treatment with steroids or&#xD;
             has current pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active infection requiring systemic therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance-abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days&#xD;
             after the last dose of trial treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies). No HIV&#xD;
             testing is required unless mandated by local health authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had an allogenic tissue/solid organ or hematologic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of hepatitis B virus (HBV; hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]&#xD;
             reactive) or known active hepatitis C virus (HCV ribonucleic acid [RNA] [qualitative]&#xD;
             is detected) infection. No testing for hepatitis B and hepatitis C is required unless&#xD;
             mandated by local health authority&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received a live or live-attenuated vaccine within 30 days before the first dose of&#xD;
             study intervention. Administration of killed vaccines are allowed&#xD;
