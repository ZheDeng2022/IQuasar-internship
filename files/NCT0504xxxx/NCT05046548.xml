      volunteers aged 18-60&quot; (Clinical trials, phase I/II). Study purpose is to assess the&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study is divided into 3 stages. At Stages I and II of the study, a maximum of 300 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers aged 18 to 60 years should be screened, of which 200 volunteers meeting the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and not non-inclusion criteria, should be included and randomized to study&#xD;
      the tolerability and safety of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I includes 15 men and women:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - 10 volunteers who will receive the Vaccine twice with an interval of 14 days&#xD;
      intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5 ml with a post-vaccination observation period of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - 5 volunteers who will receive placebo twice with an interval of 14 days&#xD;
      intramuscularly at a dose of 0.5 ml with a post-vaccination observation period of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage II includes 185 volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - 140 volunteers who will receive the Vaccine twice with an interval of 14 days&#xD;
      intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5 ml with a post-vaccination observation period of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - 45 volunteers who received placebo twice with an interval of 14 days&#xD;
      intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5 ml with a post-vaccination observation period of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage III of the study, a maximum of 300 volunteers should be screened, of which 200&#xD;
      volunteers, meeting the inclusion criteria and not non-inclusion criteria, should be included&#xD;
      and randomized to study the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 - 150 volunteers who will receive the vaccine twice with an interval of 14 days&#xD;
      intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5 ml with a period of post-vaccination observation for 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 - 50 volunteers who will receive placebo twice with an interval of 14 days&#xD;
      intramuscularly in a dose of 0.5 ml with a post-vaccination observation period of 6 months.&#xD;
