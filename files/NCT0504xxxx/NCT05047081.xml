  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to prevent the developmental of mental health symptoms in first-year&#xD;
      college students through providing a workshop aimed at preparing students for the academic,&#xD;
      social, and personal challenges associated with typical college experiences. Specifically,&#xD;
      the study hypothesizes that first-year student students who participate in a workshop on&#xD;
      college readiness will report fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety, higher levels of&#xD;
      self-esteem, and better academic performance compared to a similar group of students who do&#xD;
      not receive the intervention (the control group). Students in the intervention group will&#xD;
      participate in a one-time, two-hour workshop that discusses expectations about college,&#xD;
      setting goals that are aligned with one's values, predicting barriers to achieving these&#xD;
      goals, and how to overcome these obstacles. The workshop will provide students with external&#xD;
      resources (both on and off campus) for obtaining additional support to address barriers that&#xD;
      arise during their college experiences. Students will complete questionnaires about symptoms&#xD;
      of depression, anxiety, and their ability to cope with stress before the workshop, after the&#xD;
      workshop, and at the end of their first semester. At the end of the Fall 2021 semester,&#xD;
      students will be asked to share information about their Grade Point Average (GPA) and&#xD;
      academic status. The investigators predict that at the end of the semester, those students&#xD;
      who participated in the workshop will report lower levels of depression, anxiety and stress,&#xD;
      higher levels of self-esteem, and a higher GPA compared to students who did not receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Students who participated in the workshop will also be more likely to continue&#xD;
      (enrolled in the Spring 2022 semester) compared to controls.&#xD;
