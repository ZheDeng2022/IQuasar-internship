  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the existing medical system and insufficient medical resources in China, we developed a&#xD;
      mini program. a pain management mini app can be useful and appreciated by patients and health&#xD;
      care professionals, making it a good choice for the management of cancer pain in our country&#xD;
      . our study want to develop and test the mini program for pain management among Chinese&#xD;
      cancer patients in or discharged from hospital treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare interventions delivered via personal mobile device have been shown to be&#xD;
      acceptable to users, who have identified benefits such as convenience, access to personalized&#xD;
      information, greater awareness of own health. Integrating mini program into the cancer pain&#xD;
      care may be an effective strategy to improve cancer pain patients self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To design, construct, and test the mini program in patients managing cancer pain, evaluate&#xD;
      the total remission rate of pain and the improvement in medicine compliance to improve pain&#xD;
      management for cancer pain patients, and assess patient acceptance of the mini program.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in pain score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at four weeks after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Comparison of pain score of cancer pain patients with or without mini program. Pain score will be assessed by using numeric rating scale (NRS). An NRS allows a person to describe the intensity of his/her pain as a number usually ranging from 0 to 10, where &quot;0&quot; means &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;10&quot; means pain as &quot;bad as it could be.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in medication adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at four weeks after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will measure the change in medication adherence via Morisky Scale. Morisky Scale contains 4 questions, and the total score ranges from 0 to 4 with lower scores indicating higher adherence.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Incidence of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to four weeks after discharge</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events will be assessed throughout the study according the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Event (CTCAE) Version 4.0. Number of subjects who experienced an adverse event in this study is presented.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Pharmacists conducted a standardized education session to teach the participants how to operate the mobile phone, use mini program, assess pain. The participants in the trial group were asked to complete initial and final pain assessment questionnaires and Medication compliance on the mobile phones provided to them. Participants were encouraged to use mini program as much as possible to record their pain status.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>a control group</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group received conventional pharmaceutical care. Initial and final pain and Medication compliance data were collected. Before the patient was discharged from the hospital, the clinical pharmacist conducted detailed medication education (including medication methods, prevention and treatment of adverse reactions, and precautions) and asked the patient to attempt to maintain a paper version of the pain diary.</description>
