  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study of plasticity processes, in particular, memory, is one of the fundamental&#xD;
      directions in anesthesiology. To date, there are different views on the impact of sedation&#xD;
      and anesthesia on memory. Memory consolidation is one of the most crucial processes that the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist is interested in. Memory consolidation is the mechanism of transferring&#xD;
      short-term memory to long-term memory. The investigators suppose that propofol or&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine sedation disrupts memory consolidation. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      inquired about the impact of sedation on 'working memory'. Therefore, a better understanding&#xD;
      of the influence of anesthesia and sedation on basic memory processes will allow the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist to balance the choice of the drug and ensure the patient's safety in the&#xD;
      intraoperative period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study is a prospective, randomized, single blind design. Patients undergoing elective&#xD;
      trauma surgery (arthroscopy, reconstructive foot surgery) under subarachnoidal anesthesia are&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. All patients were randomly divided into three groups depending on the&#xD;
      drug type: first - propofol, second - dexmedetomidine, third - control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Montreal cognitive assessment test (MoCA - test) is a high validity test. MoCA - test is&#xD;
      used to determine cognitive impairments in patients in the pre-operative period. The MoCA&#xD;
      test time is approximately 10 minutes. The maximum possible score is 30; 26 points and more&#xD;
      are considered normal, 25 or less is evidence of cognitive impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system is used to&#xD;
      assess and communicate a patient's pre-anesthesia medical co-morbidities (ASA I - a normal&#xD;
      healthy patient, ASA II - a patient with mild systemic disease, ASA III - a patient with&#xD;
      severe systemic disease, ASA IV - a patient with severe systemic disease that is a constant&#xD;
      threat to life, ASA V - a moribund patient who is not expected to survive without the&#xD;
      operation, ASA VI - a declared brain-dead patient whose organs are being removed for donor&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the level of anxiety and depression in the preoperative period, patients are&#xD;
      tested using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Values on the HADS scale&lt;7&#xD;
      points are interpreted as normal, with scores from 8 to 10 as subclinically expressed anxiety&#xD;
      and/or depression, and above 10 points-clinically expressed anxiety and/or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room intravenous (i.v.) peripheral canulla Vasofix Certo (B. Braun, Germany)&#xD;
      with a diameter of 18 or 20 Gauge is inserted before the start of regional anesthesia for&#xD;
      infusion therapy. Before spinal anesthesia an anesthesiologist inject 0.9% saline infusion&#xD;
      (Grotex, Russia) of 6-8 ml/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this procedure, the investigators perform a puncture of the subarachnoid space with&#xD;
      a 27 Gauge Pencil Point needle (Bbraun, Germany) under aseptic conditions under local&#xD;
      anesthesia with lidocaine (Pharmasyntez, Russia) at the L2-L4 level. The criterion for&#xD;
      verifying the subarachnoid space is the appearance of liquor in the needle pavilion. After&#xD;
      performing the aspiration test, 10-15 mg of an isobaric solution of moxicaine&#xD;
      (Novosibhimfarm, Russia) is injected. To evaluate the sensory block, the investigators use&#xD;
      the tactile sensitivity loss test ('pinprick' test), and the motor block-the Bromage test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.9% saline (20 - 25 ml/kg) is administered to patients in the all groups. Propofol (1 group&#xD;
      (Propofol Kabi, Registration number from the State Register of Medicines - 000875)) or&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine (2 group (Dexmedetomidine, Registration number from the State Register of&#xD;
      Medicines - 005916) are used for sedation. Intravenous infusion of propofol or&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine is performed with a BBraun Space (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Registration&#xD;
      certificate for a medical device RZN 2013/905). Target control infusion (TCI, Shnider model)&#xD;
      is applied for the dosing of propofol concentration. At the beginning of sedation, the level&#xD;
      of the target propofol concentration is 1.5 - 2 mcg ml-1, during operation - 2.5 mcg ml-1.&#xD;
      Intravenous infusion of dexmedetomidine starts with a dose of 1 mcg/kg for 10 minutes, with&#xD;
      maintaining dose from 0.6 to 0.7 mcg/kg/min follows by titration from 0.2 to 2 mcg/kg/h&#xD;
      depending on the level of sedation. Propofol or dexmedetomidine infusion terminates 10&#xD;
      minutes before the end of the operation. 0.9% saline (20 - 25 ml/kg) is administered to&#xD;
      patients in the control group (3 group). Sedation is not performed in control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Richmond agitation and sedation Scale (RASS) and bispectral index monitor A-2000XP (BIS,&#xD;
      Aspect Medical Systems, Inc. (USA), Registration certificate for a medical device RZN&#xD;
      2005/498) are used to assess the depth of sedation. RASS values '-2' - '-3' (short-term eyes&#xD;
      opening for less than 10 seconds or voluntary movements without eye contact in response to a&#xD;
      call) correspond to light-moderate sedation, '-4' (eyes opening or voluntary movements in&#xD;
      response to physical stimulation) - deep sedation. BIS values 70 - 90 correspond to light -&#xD;
      moderate sedation, 60 - 70 - deep sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure patient safety, the investigators use the basic monitoring standard: noninvasive&#xD;
      arterial pressure (NAP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), SpO2, capnography (Philips&#xD;
      Monitor IntelliVue MP40 (Medizin Systeme Boblingen GmbH, Germany, Registration certificate&#xD;
      for a medical device RZN 2014/2009)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Memory testing is conducted in three stages. Stage 1 - immediately prior to sedation, stage 2&#xD;
      - 5-10 minutes after the start of sedation (RASS '-1' - '-2', BIS 70 - 90), stage 3 - 10&#xD;
      minutes after sedation is finished and consciousness is restored (RASS '0', BIS 95 - 100).&#xD;
      Five emotionally neutral words are heard by the patients twice at each stage to assess the&#xD;
      impact of sedation on memory consolidation. The experimental words are different at each&#xD;
      stage. The patients repeat the memorized words after each audition. To assess the effect of&#xD;
      sedation on the 'working memory', anesthesiologist asked the patient to remember and&#xD;
      reproduce the memorized words five minutes after learning in the second stage. Approximately,&#xD;
      24 hours after the end of anesthesia, recall and recognition of the experimental words are&#xD;
      tested. To assess recall, the patients remember all the words listened before, during and&#xD;
      after anesthesia. To test recognition, patients use to mark the words learned during surgery&#xD;
      in the list of words, which consists of 15 experimental and 10 control. The number of words&#xD;
      in recall and recognition testing is recorded by researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis is perfomed in MS Excel and Jamovi 2.0.0 programs. The Shapiro-Wilk and&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests are used to determine the normality of the distribution. The&#xD;
      analysis of the categorical variables is evaluated using the criterion χ2. For inter-group&#xD;
      comparison of quantitative variables, one-way analysis of variance (one-way ANOVA) followed&#xD;
      by post-hoc Bonferroni test are used. Repeated measures analysis of variance (RM-ANOVA)&#xD;
      followed by post hoc tests for multiple comparisons, which are Bonferroni-adjusted, are&#xD;
      performed to compare data within groups. Statistical significance level is set at P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
