  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot trial, the investigator will compare early post-stroke BP management using an&#xD;
      integrated Telehealth After Stroke Care (iTASC), to usual care with a primary outcome of BP&#xD;
      control defined by the mean 24-hr blood pressure through remote monitoring at 3 months and&#xD;
      survey patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a preliminary trial with a small sample, estimates derived will be used to plan&#xD;
      the subsequent larger confirmatory trial. Descriptive statistics will characterize the&#xD;
      randomized patients completing surveys and outcome assessments. The study will evaluate the&#xD;
      primary clinical outcome (BP &lt;140/90 mmHg) 90 days post-discharge as a function of treatment&#xD;
      and adjusted for from baseline BP. Change from baseline BP will also be assessed as an&#xD;
      outcome. Change in activity level and duration, as well as trends in sedentary time will be&#xD;
      compared between arms, and pre- and post-intervention with visual tailored infographics in&#xD;
      the intervention arm. Moderating effects of demographics will also be evaluated. Decisions&#xD;
      regarding the pursuit of a subsequent trial will use the primary outcome, and analysis of all&#xD;
      other measures will be hypothesis generating.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the single most modifiable risk factor for prevention of secondary stroke.&#xD;
      However, blood pressure (BP) remains poorly controlled after a stroke in up to 55% of&#xD;
      survivors. Uncontrolled hypertension is associated with lack of support, low level of&#xD;
      independence, poor medication adherence and limited self-efficacy. These barriers are&#xD;
      compounded following stroke with limited access to outpatient care. Sedentary behavior&#xD;
      prevalence after stroke is high in both inpatient and community settings. Addressing physical&#xD;
      activity may be a simple strategy to help counter growing health concerns during the pandemic&#xD;
      from social restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-COVID, the investigator created TASC (Telehealth After Stroke Care), an interdisciplinary&#xD;
      telehealth clinic inclusive of primary care, pharmacy, and stroke specialists to address&#xD;
      complex post-acute transitions of care and improve BP control. However, BP monitoring alone&#xD;
      at best has a modest impact on medication adherence and health behaviors. As telehealth&#xD;
      services expand during the pandemic, there is greater incentivization to devise interventions&#xD;
      that utilize remote care to foster effective self-management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving health behaviors through remote monitoring and patient tailored feedback in an&#xD;
      integrated post-acute stroke care model has not been studied. Integrated TASC (iTASC) is a&#xD;
      telehealth intervention inclusive of interdisciplinary care and remote technology including&#xD;
      BP monitoring and tracked activity, supplemented by infographics tailored with the patient's&#xD;
      own data, to enhance BP control and drive health behavior modification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proof-of-concept trial, the investigator will compare early post-stroke BP management&#xD;
      among post-acute stroke patients at discharge randomized to the iTASC intervention or usual&#xD;
      care (primary care and stroke physician follow up without remote monitoring) with a primary&#xD;
      outcome of BP control defined by the mean 24-hr BP at 3 months.&#xD;

    <description>â€¢ 3 week and 8 week follow up visits with pharmacy through telehealth&#xD;
Patients will provide home blood pressure monitoring kits at discharge for the first three months. The telemonitor that can send blood pressure readings, wirelessly or through telephone, to a secure server where study staff can look at the readings. Any blood pressure readings that are not within normal range will trigger an alert to be sent to study staff who will then follow up with the patient. A trained staff member will show the patient how to use the blood pressure monitor. Patients will be asked to take blood pressure at least 3 days per week and transmit the readings to study staff.&#xD;
Patients will also be asked to wear an activity monitor starting at 4 weeks.</description>
