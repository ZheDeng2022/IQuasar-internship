  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Chitosan-N-acetylcysteine (C-NAC;&#xD;
      Lacrimera®, Croma-Pharma GmbH, Leobendorf, Austria) in patients with corneal abrasion less&#xD;
      than one third of the corneal surface on subjective pain sensation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Commonly, standard of care for corneal abrasion is topical antibiotics. Bandage contact&#xD;
      lenses may be used in addition, which significantly decrease pain sensation in a vast&#xD;
      majority of patients. Recently, a new preservative-free agent consisting of a novel&#xD;
      biopolymer, Chitosan-N-acetylcysteine (C-NAC; Lacrimera®, Croma-Pharma GmbH, Leobendorf,&#xD;
      Austria) has been approved for the treatment of dry eye syndrome (DES). This agent&#xD;
      electrostatically binds to the mucine layer of the tear film, forming a glycocalyx-like&#xD;
      structure. In an animal model, the beneficial effect of Chitosan-N-Acetylcysteine on recovery&#xD;
      time has been observed. Aim of this study is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      Chitosan-N-acetylcysteine (C-NAC; Lacrimera®, Croma-Pharma GmbH, Leobendorf, Austria) in&#xD;
      patients with corneal abrasion less than one third of the corneal surface on subjective pain&#xD;
      sensation. It will further explore the extend of corneal healing after use of Lacrimera® over&#xD;
      5 days in those patients initially treated with Lacrimera®.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will either be randomized to group 1 (instillation of 1 drop of C-NAC) or group 2 (no instillation of C-NAC) in a 1:1 fashion. Afterwards one drop of C-NAC will be instilled into the study eye of group 1. 1 hour after treatment VAS and the symptom questionnaire will be performed repeatedly in both groups. Both groups will receive antibiotic ointment bandages and antibiotic eye drops for 5 days. Patients assigned to group 1 will receive Lacrimera® for home treatment over the following 5 days. 1 drop of Lacrimera® is supposed to be installed into the eye 20 minutes prior to installation of the respective antibiotic eye drops or ointments.</description>
