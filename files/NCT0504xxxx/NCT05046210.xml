  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      community-based oral exercise with LHA intervention on the oral health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, oral function and oral self-care behaviors. This randomized controlled trial included&#xD;
      LHA group (EG) and leaflet group (CG), respectively. The EG received a four-week one-on-one&#xD;
      session by an LHA. Baseline and follow-up data collection were used to collect the data in&#xD;
      oral Self-care behaviors, oral hygiene, oral function and quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted. The participants recruited from aboriginal&#xD;
      communities in Eastern Taiwan. Data collecting time was from 2019 to 2020. Participants from&#xD;
      the identified communities were randomly assigned to EG or CG using random table.&#xD;
      Participants who were 55 years old or above and indigenous people were recruited in the&#xD;
      study. Participants who were disability, have had oral cancer, impaired facial appearance and&#xD;
      impaired cognitive function were excluded. Impaired cognitive function was screening by Short&#xD;
      Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (SPMSQ). Participants were recruited according to the&#xD;
      predetermined minimal sample size estimated based on a type I error = 0.05, power = 0.95, and&#xD;
      effect size (ES) f = 0.25 (medium effect in Cohen's f) . The number of samples in each group&#xD;
      was expected 66 participants. An additional 30% drop out rate was added. The final number of&#xD;
      samples for each group were required at least 86 participants. The total sample size was 122&#xD;
      and 118 in EG and CG, respectively. All participants underwent data collection at baseline&#xD;
      and at 2-week, 3-and 6-month follow-ups.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Oral health-related quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 3-month and 6-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>OHRQoL was measured using the Geriatric Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI) , which was translated into Chinese for the participants (GOHAI-T). For example, &quot;Are you satisfied or happy with the appearance of your teeth, gums or dentures?&quot; Possible responses were range from 1 (always) to 5 (never). The total score ranged from 12 to 60 points. The higher the score, the better the quality of life. Cronbach's alpha was 0.75 for the scale.</description>

    <measure>Swallowing</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2-week, 3-month and 6-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>The Repetitive Saliva-Swallowing Test (RSST) was used to evaluate swallowing. Participants were asked to swallow saliva as many times as possible in 30 seconds.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>syllable /pa/, /ta/ and /ka/</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2-week, 3-month and 6-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>For oral diadochokinesis (DDK), the participants were asked to repeat the /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/ syllables as quickly as possible, and the number of articulations was counted. Using a digital counter, we separately counted the number of articulations of the /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/ syllables within 10 seconds.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Masticatory performance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2-week, 3-month and 6-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Masticatory performance was evaluated using the color-changeable chewing gum (Xylitol, 3.0 g Lotte, Saitama, Japan). This chewing gum contains xylitol, citric acid, and red, yellow, and blue dyes that change color when subjected to masticatory forces from chewing. The red dye is pH sensitive and changes color under neutral or alkaline conditions. Citric acid maintains a low internal pH of the yellowish-green gum before chewing commences. The gum changes to red when chewed because the yellow and blue dyes seep into saliva, and citric acid elution produces the red color. Participants were asked to chew for 2 minutes. Two minutes later, the observer checked the color of the gum by using a color chart of five color gradations ranging from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very good).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Saliva flow rate</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2-week, 3-month and 6-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Saliva flow rate was measured the saliva flow rate in one minute (ml/min). Participants were asked to chew the gauze for two minutes and spited out the gauze and saliva back into the test tube. After centrifuging the saliva of the gauze, pour the saliva into a measuring tube to measure the volume of the saliva.</description>

    <measure>Perceived dysphagia</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at 2-week, 3-month and 6-month after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Perceived dysphagia, which was defined as a subjective perception of problems swallowing, was measured using the swallowing screening scale developed by Ohkuma and has an internal consistency Cronbachα's alpha coefficient of 0.85. Examples of questions included &quot;Do you ever have difficulty swallowing?&quot; &quot;Do you ever have difficulty as a result of cough up phlegm during or after a meal?&quot; &quot;Does it take you longer to eat a meal than it used to?&quot; &quot;Do you feel that it is becoming difficult to eat solid foods?&quot; and &quot;Do you ever have difficulty sleeping because of coughing during the night?&quot; Possible responses were &quot;obviously&quot; (frequently), &quot;slightly&quot; (sometimes), or &quot;no&quot; (never). Respondents with at least one severe symptom were classified as having dysphagia.</description>
