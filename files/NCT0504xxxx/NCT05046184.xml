  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is investigating dysfunctions in neurocircuitry in regards to irritability with&#xD;
      healthy controls (HC) and individuals with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) by performing&#xD;
      MRIs. The MDD group will also be randomized to receive ketamine or midazolam to investigate&#xD;
      changes post-treatment in neurocircuitry with regards to irritability.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study aims to 1 (Aim 1) identify dysfunctions in neurocircuitry that engender&#xD;
      irritability, and (Aim 2) determine how changes in neurocircuit function related to change in&#xD;
      irritability. We will accomplish Aim 1 with resting-state and frustrative nonreward (FNR)&#xD;
      task-based fMRI data from n=30 HCs and n=60 subjects with MDD ((Fig 3). For Aim 2, we will&#xD;
      randomize the MDD cohort (n=60; same as Aim 1) to 2 weeks of twice-weekly 40-minutes long&#xD;
      intravenous infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) in a&#xD;
      double-blind parallel-arm fashion, and by repeating clinical assessments and fMRI scans after&#xD;
      the last infusion. The central hypothesis of the proposed study is that striatum is a key hub&#xD;
      in the neurocircuitry of irritability, and that treatment-related improvement in irritability&#xD;
      is associated with normalization of these neurocircuit functioning.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All subjects (Healthy Controls and MDD) will undergo resting-state and task-based fMRI and cerebral prefusion to characterize the (i) patterns of functional connectivity and (ii) neural responses to a behavioral task eliciting frustrative nonreward (FNR) that are associated with irritability [quantified with the 5-item irritability domain of Concise Associated Symptom Tracking scale (CAST-IRR)]. The MDD cohort (n=60) will then be randomized to four 40-minute intravenous infusions over two weeks of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.02 mg/kg) in a double-blind, parallel-arm fashion. Clinical assessments and 3T MRI scans will be repeated after the last infusion to evaluate (i) pre-to-post treatment changes in neurocircuit function using resting-state and FNR task-based fMRI with ketamine versus midazolam and (ii) the association between changes in neurocircuit function and irritability.</intervention_model_description>
