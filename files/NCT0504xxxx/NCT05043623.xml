      A study to investigate Rhinoswab as an alternative method to combined throat and deep nasal&#xD;
      (CTDN) swab for respiratory sample collection in children who present to the Royal Children's&#xD;
      Hospital (RCH) for viral testing. Children and their parent/guardian will answer a short&#xD;
      survey about their preferences. Laboratory staff will answer a short survey about handling&#xD;
      the different samples.&#xD;

      The microbiological test of choice for detection of respiratory viruses is a reverse&#xD;
      transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The test is reported as &quot;detected&quot; or&#xD;
      &quot;not-detected&quot; to the clinician. The Ct-value is a microbiological analysis that represents&#xD;
      the number of amplification cycles required for a target gene to exceed a threshold level, to&#xD;
      determine a negative or positive result and is interpreted to detect respiratory viruses. The&#xD;
      Ct-value is used to measure viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a respiratory virus of specific interest.&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is detected in the upper respiratory tract. National guidelines for diagnosing&#xD;
      COVID-19 in Australia require a combined throat and deep nasal swab (CTDN). No other testing&#xD;
      options are routinely recommended in Australia. However, research and international&#xD;
      guidelines recommend nasal swabs alone for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The Center for Disease&#xD;
      Control and Prevention (USA) currently recommend the use of an anterior nasal swab alone as a&#xD;
      method for detection of SARS-CoV-2. A recent systematic review suggested nasal swabs are a&#xD;
      clinically acceptable alternative specimen collection methods. In addition to satisfactory&#xD;
      diagnostic performance, nasal swabs are potentially less invasive, and can be self-collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research at the Melbourne Children's Campus has identified that the CTDN or nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      swab, are uncomfortable and distressing for children. The fear of the test is a barrier for&#xD;
      presentation to a health service for a SARS-CoV-2 test. Parental and child reluctance to&#xD;
      undergo testing may impact the public health response, through under-identification of&#xD;
      pediatric cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rhinoswab is a TGA approved anterior nasal swab for children and adults. The design of&#xD;
      the Rhinoswab allows for standardisation of the site of biological sampling, as compared with&#xD;
      CTDN swabs which are operator dependent. It is designed to be more comfortable and to collect&#xD;
      nasal secretions for PCR testing. The Rhinoswab Junior is a smaller paediatric version that&#xD;
      has novelty features which add interest and distraction. The child can use the swab&#xD;
      themselves, allowing autonomy and control. The capture and elution efficiency of the&#xD;
      Rhinoswab has been shown to be comparable, if not slightly superior, to the capture and&#xD;
      elution efficiency to the commercially available Copan eSwab by VIDRL and GNOMIX analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RCH has completed over 30,000 tests in children throughout the COVID-19 Pandemic from&#xD;
      March 2020 to June 2021 at the Respiratory Infection Clinic and Emergency Department. The RCH&#xD;
      nurses and doctors are well placed to trial the Rhinoswab due to extensive experience in&#xD;
      testing children, and have developed related clinical practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to determine if the Rhinoswab is as sensitive and specific as the standard&#xD;
      CTDN swab, in detecting respiratory viruses, in children aged 4-18 years. This study also&#xD;
      aims to understand which swab children prefer, and how the swabs compare when being handled&#xD;
      in the laboratory.&#xD;
