  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a&#xD;
      hemp-derived oral product containing cannabidiol (CBD) and cannabidiolic acid (CBD-A) at a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to examine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a&#xD;
      novel hemp-derived oral cannabinoid product, at various doses, in healthy adults. The study&#xD;
      will utilize a within-subjects, placebo-controlled, double-blind, ascending-dose design. Drug&#xD;
      administration will be double blind (the participant and research staff will be unaware of&#xD;
      the dose administered). Upon enrollment, participants will complete 4 dosing conditions&#xD;
      (placebo, 1 mg/kg, 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg of cannabinoids). Each condition will consist of a single&#xD;
      acute drug exposure, followed by an 8-hour period to evaluate acute pharmacodynamic and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) drug effects. Biological specimens (blood and urine) will be obtained&#xD;
      throughout these 8 hours to characterize the pharmacokinetics of CBD, CBD-A,&#xD;
      delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), and THC-A, as well as other relevant cannabinoids and&#xD;
      metabolites. Pharmacodynamic assessments including subjective drug effects, cognitive&#xD;
      performance testing, and vital signs will also be collected for 8 hours post-drug&#xD;
      administration. For each of the two days after each experimental session, participants will&#xD;
      be asked to return to the lab for brief visits (~20 min) to provide additional biospecimens&#xD;
      (~24 and ~48 hrs after dosing) to allow for further PK analysis. These procedures will be&#xD;
      completed 4 separate times by each participant (sessions will be separated by at least 1 week&#xD;
      to allow for sufficient drug washout between doses).&#xD;

             result or the safety of the participant. This includes any medication metabolized via&#xD;
             CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2B10, or which induce/inhibit CYP3A4 enzymes.&#xD;
