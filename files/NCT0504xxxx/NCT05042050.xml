      The relationships we have in childhood affect how we relate to others across our life,&#xD;
      including how safe or secure we feel. If our caregivers do not meet our needs well enough in&#xD;
      childhood, this can lead to an 'insecure attachment style'. This means we may push others&#xD;
      away or cling to them, but never feel fully safe or secure with them. This style is common in&#xD;
      people who have mental health problems. This includes psychosis, when people have unusual&#xD;
      experiences such as hearing voices others cannot hear. A lot of people with psychosis have&#xD;
      difficult experiences with mental health services. This includes involuntary treatments,&#xD;
      traumatic interactions and hospital stays, where they may think staff are trying to harm&#xD;
      rather than help them. As a result they may not feel safe working with staff and they might&#xD;
      re-experience the negative memories of these events. This is known as psychosis-related&#xD;
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PR-PTSD) and can lead to ongoing problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imagery is often defined as mental pictures but it includes imagining our senses (smell,&#xD;
      touch, taste) too. It can be a useful therapy tool to help people to work with difficult&#xD;
      memories and can help them to feel more safe and secure. Research shows that this is helpful&#xD;
      for people with psychosis and people who have been through trauma. Hence, it may be helpful&#xD;
      for people with PR-PTSD. The study aims to see if it is viable to do a 6-session therapy&#xD;
      using imagery to target PR-PTSD memories. The study will use a case series design where up to&#xD;
      12 people with psychosis will be able to try the therapy. They will be asked to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires to understand any potential benefits of the therapy. The findings could inform&#xD;
      the research and allow for further development of therapies in this area.&#xD;

      Attachment theory underpins human interpersonal experience: it suggests that our early&#xD;
      relationships, typically those with our primary caregivers in infancy, have a profound effect&#xD;
      on how we learn to relate to the others across the lifespan. Attachment styles in adulthood,&#xD;
      particularly insecure styles, have been associated with mental health problems, and it has&#xD;
      been noted that improving attachment security can improve mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, there has been an increase in research around the role of attachment in&#xD;
      psychosis, with an over-representation of insecure attachment patterns seen in individuals&#xD;
      with such diagnoses (76% in psychosis compared to 38% in non-clinical samples). A number of&#xD;
      studies have identified links with insecure attachment in several aspects of psychopathology,&#xD;
      including voice-hearing, persecutory delusions, social functioning and negative symptoms,&#xD;
      though the mechanisms between such remain poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attachment insecurity is significantly associated with paranoia and recent research has&#xD;
      focused on reducing this using the concept of &quot;felt security&quot;, which is defined as &quot;a sense&#xD;
      of interpersonal safety associated with secure, protective relationships&quot;. In childhood, this&#xD;
      sense of safety and security constitutes a 'secure base' from which the child is able to&#xD;
      explore. Priming felt security through imagery (i.e. undertaking an imagery exercise focused&#xD;
      on secure attachment with another individual in the image) has been found to reduce paranoia&#xD;
      in non-clinical adult samples. Moreover, 'felt security' imagery has been deemed effective in&#xD;
      engendering a sense of security and reducing paranoia prior to rescripting trauma memories&#xD;
      with an individual with psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imagery interventions have been long established for use as part of therapy for individuals&#xD;
      with psychosis, and have been recognised as a frontier in therapeutic intervention across&#xD;
      disorders, including working with negative imagery (e.g., imagery rescripting) and positive&#xD;
      imagery. A case series was completed and subsequently a protocol published for a six-session&#xD;
      imagery intervention, iMAgery focused psychological therapy for persecutory delusions in&#xD;
      PSychosis (iMAPS), targeting intrusive mental imagery and negative beliefs about self and&#xD;
      others in psychosis with a combination of negative and positive imagery techniques, which&#xD;
      indicated feasibility of combining various imagery techniques in a short intervention for&#xD;
      psychosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with psychosis may not only experience intrusive images as a component of their&#xD;
      psychotic symptomology, but also as a consequence of their psychosis itself.&#xD;
      Psychosis-Related Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PR-PTSD) is an under-researched area but a&#xD;
      recent review suggested that between 14% and 47% of individuals with psychosis may have&#xD;
      PR-PTSD, with associated factors including symptomology of psychosis, treatment factors&#xD;
      (involuntary admissions, traumatic inpatient events, restraint) and attachment style.&#xD;
      However, there appears to be minimal published literature on this beyond first-episode&#xD;
      psychosis. Anxiety in attachment relationships has been identified as positively correlated&#xD;
      with psychosis-related and hospital-related PTSD symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to add to the limited literature on PR-PTSD by evaluating the&#xD;
      feasibility of a short six-session attachment-focused imagery intervention for psychosis,&#xD;
      based upon the iMAPS protocol, which will be adapted to include 'felt security' imagery and&#xD;
      the imagery rescripting will focus on psychosis-related trauma. It is anticipated that this&#xD;
      would reduce PTSD symptomology. Moreover, by using attachment security primes in conjunction&#xD;
      with rescripting, paranoia may also be reduced.&#xD;
