  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will help us in understanding the role of transdermal buprenorphine patch in&#xD;
      reducing consumption of opioids in patients undergoing total knee replacement. The objective&#xD;
      of our study is to investigate the role of preoperative TDB patch in reducing postoperative&#xD;
      opioids consumption in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasties. Patients aged between&#xD;
      18 and 65years, scheduled to undergo total knee arthroplasty with an ASA score of 1 to 3 will&#xD;
      be included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Effective postoperative pain control is a major challenge to the treating surgeons and&#xD;
      Anaesthetists. Most opioids cause side effects such as sedation, nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      respiratory depression. A number of other modalities have also been recommended for treatment&#xD;
      of post-operative pain, including epidural infusion, patient-controlled analgesia, peripheral&#xD;
      nerve block, continuous intra-articular infusion and local intra-articular analgesic&#xD;
      injection. However, all of these treatments are invasive and aggressive and are potentially&#xD;
      associated with regional bleeding, infection and nerve damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study by Londhe et al, all patients received peri-articular local anesthetic&#xD;
      infiltration and then epidural/femoral nerve block infusion for 72 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
      Group A received the TDB patch 5 mcg applied at the end of surgery. Group B received a&#xD;
      combination of paracetamol and tramadol. They concluded that TDB patch is more efficacious in&#xD;
      reducing postoperative pain after TKA surgery and can be safely used with fewer systemic side&#xD;
      effects when compared to conventional analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to investigate the role of preoperative TDB patch in reducing&#xD;
      postoperative opioids consumption in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasties.&#xD;
