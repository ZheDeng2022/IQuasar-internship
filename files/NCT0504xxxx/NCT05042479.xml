  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical procedures can be a very frightening experience for children. It is known that&#xD;
      children who received painful medical procedures can develop a higher sensitivity of pain&#xD;
      during their following experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During their treatments for malignant diseases, children are exposed to a lot of painful&#xD;
      procedures (eg. needle insertion, lumbar punction, myelogram, etc…)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, medical societies propose the use of interventions like distraction techniques for&#xD;
      pain management in complement of pharmacological treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the repetitions of painful procedures and ineffective prevention of pain can&#xD;
      create care phobia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this context, immersive and participative virtual reality (VR) could be an innovative&#xD;
      distraction technique for pain management among children undergoing medical procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention Pain Theory can explain how virtual reality can reduce the perception of pain.&#xD;
      Attention is required to feel pain. When the patient is focused on another subject like an&#xD;
      immersive virtual environment, his brain is less available to treat information like painful&#xD;
      stimulus from care procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that VR can reduce procedural-related pain and can decrease&#xD;
      fear during the following procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of previous studies are varied : some showed a non-significant reduction of patient's&#xD;
      procedural pain despite the use of VR, whereas others concluded to a decrease of pain. The&#xD;
      question of the benefit of VR for the patients who are exposed to repeated painful procedures&#xD;
      remains still unclear, especially with patients who are likely to feel chronic pain or many&#xD;
      pain-related exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of virtual reality as a distraction&#xD;
      technique for pain management in children and adolescents with onco-hematological diseases,&#xD;
      undergoing painful procedures, compared to standard of care.&#xD;

      VIRTUOSO is a study that aims to evaluate the impact of using a virtual reality headset to&#xD;
      prevent care-induced pain in pediatric oncology. This study plans to include 34 patients. It&#xD;
      is a single-center, non-inferiority, controlled, with cross-over study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficiency of VR will be evaluated for each patient across 3 potentially painful&#xD;
      care-procedures :&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first treatment, the child will benefit usual distraction and pain prevention&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 2nd treatment, the child will use a VR headset as well as pain prevention techniques&#xD;
      (excluding oxygen-nitrous oxide mixtures). The child will choose the application he/she&#xD;
      wishes to use according to his/her age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the 3rd treatment, the child will choose his/her favorite technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The virtual reality headset is an Occulus Quest headset, composed of 2 integrated earphones.&#xD;
      It is adapted to the environment and can be used sitting or standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual pharmacological techniques for pain prevention will be maintained as per local&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All concomitant treatments are authorized except the use of oxygen-nitrous oxide mixtures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of this study is approximately 20 months. Inclusion will be for 10 months,&#xD;
      patient follow-up for 6 months. Data analysis will be performed during 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each treatment, if the child wishes to stop VR, the helmet will be removed and the&#xD;
      usual techniques will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each procedure, a self-assessment of the pain will be done immediately, using VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the third treatment, a short questionnaire will be proposed to the child in&#xD;
      order to collect the reasons for his choice. Another questionnaire will also be proposed to&#xD;
      the parent present during the care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative component will explore the social representations of the parents. A range of&#xD;
      semi-directive interviews will be conducted with 6 families by a trained professional under&#xD;
      the supervision of the methodologist.&#xD;
