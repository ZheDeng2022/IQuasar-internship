  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was planned to investigate whether there is a visual-spatial perception disorder&#xD;
      in individuals with idiopathic scoliosis and also to reveal its dependent/independent&#xD;
      relationship with vestibular dysfunction.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vestibular dysfunction is thought to be associated with the etiology of patients with&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis. However, there is limited data on this in the literature. However,&#xD;
      visuospatial ability has been evaluated in the literature regarding vestibular dysfunction&#xD;
      independent of scoliosis. In the study, it was first requested to investigate vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with scoliosis. However, as far as is known, there is no study in the&#xD;
      literature on visuospatial perception investigated for vestibular dysfunction in patients&#xD;
      with scoliosis. This study was planned to investigate whether there is a disorder related to&#xD;
      visuospatial perception and to reveal its dependent/independent relationship with vestibular&#xD;
      dysfunction. Based on the studies, it is planned to evaluate visuospatial (visual-spatial)&#xD;
      perception performance in the presence/absence of vestibular dysfunction in individuals with&#xD;
      idiopathic scoliosis. The hypothesis of the study is that vestibular function and related&#xD;
      visual-spatial perception may be affected in individuals with idiopathic scoliosis.&#xD;

    <description>Romberg test and single leg standing test will be used in balance assessment. The presence of vestibular dysfunction will be evaluated with the Utenberger test. Under the name of visual-spatial perception, spatial memory will be evaluated with the mobile application called Corsi Block Tapping, and navigation performance will be evaluated with the triangle completion task. In addition, X-ray images taken during routine follow-ups will be used to determine the location, type of curvature and Cobb angle of the scoliosis. The degree of rotation will be measured with a mobile application called Scoliodetector. Quality of life is planned to be evaluated with the Scoliosis Research Society-22 questionnaire.</description>
