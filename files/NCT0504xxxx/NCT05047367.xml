      The most common entrapment neuropathy symptoms, the diagnosis of CTS, is determined by&#xD;
      examination findings and by means of the results of electro-diagnostic test. With an increase&#xD;
      in disease severity, trap neuropathy, whose symptoms are more pronounced at night, negatively&#xD;
      affects the daily life of the person. Deterioration in sleep quality may cause depression and&#xD;
      anxiety. Conflicting results have been found in the studies related to these findings.&#xD;
      However, no study was found in which daytime sleepiness was evaluated in terms of CTS. The&#xD;
      investigators aim in this study is to evaluate the relationship between CTS severity and&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral neuropathy with an incidence of&#xD;
      2.7-4%. CTS, resulting from compression of the median nerve in the wrist, clinically&#xD;
      progresses with tingling, numbness matching the nerve trace, and motor deficit in the&#xD;
      presence of progressive nerve damage. Accordingly, the incidence of neuropathic pain is&#xD;
      increasing. In addition to these symptoms mentioned, electro-diagnostic tests are used for&#xD;
      diagnostic purposes and to determine the severity of nerve compression, and as a result,&#xD;
      there are different types of classification, but most commonly CTS is classified as mild,&#xD;
      moderate and severe. This classification is of great importance for the regulation of the&#xD;
      follow-up and treatment protocol and making the association of existing complaints with the&#xD;
      disease. Studies have shown that approximately 80% of CTS patients wake up at night due to&#xD;
      numbness in the hand, resulting in deterioration in sleep quality. Impairment of sleep&#xD;
      quality may cause increased sympathetic nervous system activity and awakening of physical and&#xD;
      psychological stressors. Deterioration in sleep quality may cause depression and anxiety.&#xD;
      Conflicting results have been found in the studies related to these findings. However, no&#xD;
      study was found in which daytime sleepiness was evaluated in terms of CTS. The investigators&#xD;
      aim in this study is to evaluate the relationship between CTS severity and depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, sleep quality and daytime sleepiness. This study;149 patients with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      CTS were prospectively included in the study. Electro-diagnostic test results were used to&#xD;
      determine the severity of the disease. In this context, Boston CTS rating scale was used to&#xD;
      evaluate the functional and symptomatic effects, Pittsburgh sleep quality scale and Epworth&#xD;
      sleepiness scale were used to evaluate sleep quality and daytime sleepiness, and pain DETECT&#xD;
      questionnaire was used to evaluate pain type.&#xD;
