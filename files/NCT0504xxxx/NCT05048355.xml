      This study is conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the Power Knee Mainstream Dynamic&#xD;
      compared to passive microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs) regarding metabolic cost for high&#xD;
      active transfemoral amputees.The test is of a single group repeated measures crossover&#xD;
      design. The primary endpoint is the difference in MET/HRI-VO2 index between conditions.&#xD;
      Subjects are measured on their prescribed device at visit 1, be fitted to the PKM which they&#xD;
      wear as their primary prosthesis for one week before coming for visit 2 and being measured&#xD;
      again on the PKM.&#xD;

      The metabolic cost of ambulation for individuals living with a lower limb amputation is&#xD;
      significantly increased compared to able-bodied individuals. Individuals living with&#xD;
      transfemoral amputation have shown up to 65% more exertion to generate half the ambulation&#xD;
      speed of able-bodied individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Power Knee Mainstream - Dynamic, was designed to provide powered swing dynamics to&#xD;
      restore muscle activity and thereby attempting to mitigate this increase in metabolic cost&#xD;
      that individuals living with TF amputation face. This study aims to evaluate this indirectly&#xD;
      by measuring the heart rate during level ground walking on the Power Knee Mainstream -&#xD;
      Dynamic compared to a passive MPK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies reported in the literature on previous versions of the Power Knee have shown&#xD;
      that it provides active flexion and extension during walking2, 3, 4 and more symmetric gait5&#xD;
      compared to passive microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs). By providing increased symmetry&#xD;
      and active swing during level ground walking the knee is meant to lower the effort needed by&#xD;
      the transfemoral prosthesis user to swing the leg forward and thereby lower the metabolic&#xD;
      cost of level ground walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This underpins the hypothesis being tested in this investigation, that the Power Knee&#xD;
      Mainstream - Dynamic enables the user to walk with less metabolic cost compared to passive&#xD;
      MPKs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot investigation that was conducted with 5 subjects indicated that the Power Knee&#xD;
      Mainstream - Dynamic enabled users to walk on level ground with less metabolic cost compared&#xD;
      to passive MPKs, however the difference did not reach statistical significance. The same&#xD;
      study procedure will be used in this study with sufficient sample size to achieve the&#xD;
      statistical power needed, which was determined in a power analysis using data form the pilot&#xD;
      study mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the investigational device&#xD;
      compared to passive microprocessor-controlled knees (MPKs) regarding metabolic cost for high&#xD;
      active transfemoral amputees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test is of a single group repeated measures crossover design. Amputees are a small&#xD;
      proportion of the general population. The primary endpoint is the difference in MET/HRI-VO2&#xD;
      index between conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing takes place in Össur HQ in Iceland as well as in Össur facility in Germany, the&#xD;
      collective sample size in both sites is 20 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are measured on their prescribed device at visit 1, be fitted to the PKM which they&#xD;
      wear as their primary prosthesis for one week before coming for visit 2 and being measured&#xD;
      again on the PKM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subject in the study is a current PKM user the procedure will apply in reverse and they&#xD;
      will be provided with a Rheo knee to act as a comparator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the first visit subjects will be contacted via telephone and asked screening&#xD;
      questions, if they fit the inclusion criteria they will be booked for study visit 1. They&#xD;
      will receive instructions to consume no alcohol and perform no exercise for 24 hours before&#xD;
      study visit 1, the same applies to visit 2. In addition, they will be instructed to consume&#xD;
      no caffeine prior to the visits (same day) or drink the same amount before both visits and&#xD;
      keep the same routine the 24 hours prior to visit 1 and 2 (breakfast, water/drink consumption&#xD;
      etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the one week follow up, subjects will be called via telephone to check the status of&#xD;
      the device and the alignment and if there are issues identified they will be asked to come in&#xD;
      to correct those.&#xD;
