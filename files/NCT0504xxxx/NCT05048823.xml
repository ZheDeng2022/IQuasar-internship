      INTRODUCTION: The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is responsible for controlling several&#xD;
      visceral functions, including the motility and secretion of the gastrointestinal system&#xD;
      (GIS). Alterations in the functioning of the ANS can directly influence the physiological&#xD;
      mechanisms of the GIS. Due to the importance of the ANS in the control of various body&#xD;
      functions, strategies aimed at acting in this system have become extremely important and have&#xD;
      been widely used in the literature. Some of the studies involving ANS analysis have shown&#xD;
      that osteopathic manipulative treatment is able to promote a reduction in sympathetic ANS&#xD;
      activity and an increase in parasympathetic ANS activity in asymptomatic youngsters, however,&#xD;
      none of them addressed the GIS, already known to be influenced by autonomic fibers.&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the immediate effects of GIS-directed osteopathic techniques on ANS&#xD;
      behavior and pain sensitivity to pressure in young people without symptoms of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders. METHODS: The present study is characterized by a randomized,&#xD;
      single-blind clinical trial, in which 42 asymptomatic individuals will be recruited,&#xD;
      regardless of gender, aged between 18 and 30 years. Volunteers will be randomly distributed&#xD;
      into two groups called intervention protocol and placebo protocol. The intervention protocol&#xD;
      will be performed by a professional with 10 years of clinical experience in the field of&#xD;
      Osteopathy and will perform the techniques of Generalized Discharge of the peritoneum and&#xD;
      intestinal wings, Mobilization of the Cecum, technique for the Mesentery Root, Release of the&#xD;
      D1-D2 angle, technique for the Sigmoid Colon. The approximate duration of the set of&#xD;
      techniques will be 15 minutes with the volunteers positioned supine on a stretcher. The&#xD;
      placebo protocol will apply in the same way regarding the positioning and duration of the&#xD;
      techniques. The therapist will position the hands in the same regions of the intervention&#xD;
      protocol, maintaining superficial contact for 3 minutes in each region, without therapeutic&#xD;
      intent. Volunteers will be evaluated for outcomes before and immediately after performing the&#xD;
      protocols. The heart rate variability will be measured by capturing the intervals between&#xD;
      each beat in ms, using a heart rate monitor and extracting the linear indices in the domain&#xD;
      of time, frequency and geometric heart rate variability. The pressure pain threshold will&#xD;
      also be measured using a pressure algometer that will be positioned in the vertebral region&#xD;
      of T5-L3. Comparisons of variables (indices of HRV and pressure pain threshold) between the&#xD;
      intervention protocol group and placebo protocol will be performed using the Student's T test&#xD;
      (normal data) or the Mann-Whitney test (non-normal data). All results will be discussed at&#xD;
      the 5% significance level.&#xD;

The pain threshold will be considered through the minimum pressure necessary to induce pain in the assessed region.
