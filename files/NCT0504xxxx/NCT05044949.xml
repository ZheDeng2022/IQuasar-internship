  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for the current study is to initially evaluate the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      novel strain of the probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a&#xD;
      health benefit on the host. Probiotics have been studied for decades for their potential&#xD;
      health benefits of non-pathogenic microorganisms. The species Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L.&#xD;
      reuteri), formerly Lactobacillus reuteri, is currently used in probiotic products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the study is based on the aim to study the safety and tolerability of a novel&#xD;
      strain of the probiotic Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in a limited number of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the incidence of treatment emergency adverse events (safety and tolerability).</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>The product to be investigated is a probiotic product and not an investigational medicinal product. However, the procedures for monitoring, collecting and reporting of AEs will be the same as for an investigational medicinal product.&#xD;
Vital signs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse will be measured. Vital signs will be judged as normal, abnormal, not clinically significant or abnormal, clinically significant.&#xD;
Safety laboratory parameters, blood samples for analysis of clinical chemistry and haematology will be analysed by routine analytical methods.&#xD;
Urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test will be performed. Abnormal values assessed by the Investigator as clinically significant will be reported as AEs. If an abnormal value is associated with corresponding clinical signs or symptoms, the sign/symptoms should be reported as the AE.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate tolerability in terms of gastrointestinal symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>28 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms by using Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) over the last week. The questionnaire will be answered by the subjects at visit 2 to 5.&#xD;
The Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale is a disease-specific instrument. The 15 items are combined into five clusters: Reflux, Abdominal pain, Indigestion, Diarrhoea and Constipation. The subjects are asked to numerically score their subjective symptoms 1-7. Thus the lowest score is 15 and the highest is105. The higher score the worse outcome. The reliability and validity of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale are well-documented, and norm values for a general population are available.&#xD;
The data collected using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale does not constitute AEs and will not be reported as numerical results. Accordingly, no causality assessment by the Investigator will be performed for the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale questionnaire.</description>
