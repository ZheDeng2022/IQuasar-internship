  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On 11 February 2020, the International Committee for the Classification of Viruses named the&#xD;
      disease caused by SAï¼²S-CoV-2 infection in humans as the new coronavirus pneumonia&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). Due to the changes of immune function and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary function in overweight people, the infection and severity of these patients&#xD;
      are higher than that of the general population during the epidemic period. More attention&#xD;
      should be paid to personal protection and disease prevention. Vaccination with COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine can effectively prevent COVID-19 infection, delay or prevent patients from developing&#xD;
      into critical illness and reducing mortality. In order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine for overweight people, and to guide COVID-19 vaccination more&#xD;
      scientifically, rationally and effectively, this study was carried out.&#xD;

      Due to the changes of immune function and cardiopulmonary function in overweight people, the&#xD;
      infection and severity of these patients are higher than that of the general population&#xD;
      during the epidemic period. More attention should be paid to personal protection and disease&#xD;
      prevention. Vaccination of COVID-19 can effectively prevent COVID-19 virus infection and&#xD;
      delay or prevent patients from developing into critical illness and reduce mortality. The&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in this population were evaluated in order to&#xD;
      play a scientific and theoretical supporting role in guiding COVID-19 vaccination more&#xD;
      scientifically, reasonably and effectively. The samples of this study were collected and&#xD;
      tested in the second affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Patients with&#xD;
      contraindications for vaccination will be excluded. The detected indexes included blood&#xD;
      routine test, liver function, COVID-19 antibody titer, antibody duration and other indexes of&#xD;
      healthy people (control group) and overweight people after vaccination ( 1, 3, 6 months after&#xD;
      vaccination). The adverse reactions related to the vaccine were recorded.&#xD;
