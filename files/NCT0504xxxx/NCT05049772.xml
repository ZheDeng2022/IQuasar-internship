  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common problem in society and causes loss of workforce. Its lifetime&#xD;
      prevalence reaches 80% and annual hospital admission rates in the adult population reach&#xD;
      15%.Most studies on motor imagery suggested the effects of motor imagery are related to&#xD;
      neuroplastic changes in the brain. Studies have shown that similar brain regions are&#xD;
      activated during motor imagery and real movement. However, the level of evidence about the&#xD;
      effect of motor imagery on autonomic functions is limited. Today, interest in&#xD;
      telerehabilitation has increased due to the Covid-19 pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of telerehabilitation-based motor imagery&#xD;
      training in patients with non-specific low back pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Kinesthetic and Visual Imagery Questionnaire-Short Form consists of 10 movements in total, measuring 5 visual and 5 kinesthetic visualization skills, developed to determine the extent to which individuals visualize and feel the imagined movements. The questionnaire is not a self-report scale, but is administered with an evaluator. All movements are evaluated in the sitting position. Higher scores indicate greater visual clarity or intensity of sensations.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Movement Imagery Questionnaire-Revised assesses visual and kinesthetic movement imagery ability and is comprised of four visual and four kinesthetic items. Each item entails performing a movement, visually or kinesthetically imaging that movement and then rating the ease or difficulty of generating that image on a 7-point scale from 1 = very hard to see/feel to 7 = very easy to see/feel. Higher scores indicate higher visual or kinesthetic movement imagery ability.</description>

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Questionnaire,</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Questionnaire, which allows the patient to self-evaluate, is used to evaluate the limitations that patients compare in daily life. The total score ranges from 0 to 100, and a high score indicates an increased level of disability.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is grouped as Low (Category 1), Medium (Category 2), Very active (Category 3). Calculation is made on a weekly basis as MET level x minutes of activity.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>VISUAL ANALOGUE SCALE</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Visual analog scale (VAS) is a psychometric response scale which can be used in questionnaires. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale- Revised</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In this test, the patient is asked to repeat the digits read to him, one second apart, in the same order backwards, starting from the last. The test starts with a two-digit number sequence, and when repeated correctly, one digit is increased and continues until the seventh sequence of eight numbers. The patient must repeat at least one of the two sequences of numbers of the same length in the correct order in order to progress in the test. Scoring is based on the total number of correct and repetitions.</description>

    <measure>d2 Attention-Tests</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The test form consists of 14 lines, each with 47 marked letters. There are 16 letters &quot;p&quot; and &quot;d&quot; marked with one, two, three or four lowercase lines in each line. The patient is asked to find and cross out the letters &quot;d&quot; with only two signs. For each line, the patient is given 20 seconds.</description>

    <measure>Trail Making Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Trail Making test consists of two parts. In Part A, the patient is asked to put together the circles with numbers in the correct order, which are scattered on the test form. In Part B, the patient is asked to combine the circles, which are scattered on the test form and contain both numbers and letters, in the correct order (1-A, 2-B, 3-C).</description>

    <measure>Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index evaluates sleep quality over the past month. 19 of the 24 questions included in the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index are self-report questions. Five questions are answered by the spouse or a roommate. The 18 items participating in the scoring are grouped into 7 component scores. Each item is evaluated over 0-3 points. The sum of the 7 component scores gives the overall Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index score.</description>

    <measure>SF-36 Short Fotm</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline at 10 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-36 has a total of 8 sub-components: physical function, physical role limitation, pain, general perception of health, vitality (energy), social function, emotional role limitation, and mental health. The answers to the questions answered by the participants are scored between 0-100. A high score indicates a good quality of life, and a low score indicates a poor quality of life.</description>
