      This study is a nutritional intervention in voluntary workers with abdominal obesity (waist&#xD;
      circumference ≥102cm and ≥88cm). The intervention is divided into two phases: the intensive&#xD;
      one has a duration of 6 months and consisted in a 4 face-to-face sessions with 9 online or&#xD;
      telephone contacts based on the use of nutritional counseling [Academy of Nutrition and&#xD;
      Dietetics, 2013] and the second phase: consisted in a 3 months' follow-up with 2 telephone&#xD;
      contacts and a final visit face-to-face. The investigators used the Cognitive Behavior&#xD;
      Therapy process as a theoretical framework, and also used the intervention comprised sessions&#xD;
      designed to promote motivation, social support, self-regulation to promote the eating&#xD;
      behavior change process. The participants were measured weight loss, waist circumference, and&#xD;
      the lipid profile change, pre-intervention, and after six and nice months post-intervention.&#xD;
