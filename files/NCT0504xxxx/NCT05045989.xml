  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular testing for SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an important strategy for controlling&#xD;
      virus outbreaks on university campuses during the COVID-19 pandemic but testing participation&#xD;
      rates can be low. The Residence-Based Testing Participation Pilot (RB-TPP) was a novel&#xD;
      intervention implemented at two student residences on a large university campus in the UK&#xD;
      over four weeks. The aim of the pilot was to increase the frequency of asymptomatic&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 saliva testing onsite. This process evaluation aimed to determine whether RB-TPP&#xD;
      was implemented as planned and identify implementation barriers and facilitators. A&#xD;
      mixed-methods process evaluation was conducted alongside the RB-TPP. Evaluation participants&#xD;
      were students (who opted in, or out of the RB-TPP) and staff with a role in service provision&#xD;
      or student support. Monitoring data were collected from the intervention delivery team and&#xD;
      meeting records. Data were collected from students via an online survey (n=152) and seven&#xD;
      focus groups (n=30), and from staff via individual interviews (n=13). Quantitative data were&#xD;
      analysed descriptively and qualitative data thematically.&#xD;

    <description>The aim of the RB-TPP was to increase and maintain participation of students in regular COVID-19 testing in university residences. The R-TPP was delivered over 4 weeks in April-May 2021 and required asymptomatic students to take a saliva test for COVID-19, twice weekly for four weeks. This was combined with relaxed social restrictions within the residence during the study period (i.e., removing the need for 2 metre distancing between students living in the same residence), surge testing and enhanced support for students who were required to self-isolate (i.e., welfare and financial support).</description>
