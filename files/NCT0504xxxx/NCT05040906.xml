    <textblock>
      This trial is a Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, controlled, and equivalence&#xD;
      phase Ⅲ study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to compare the objective response rate of H02 (rituximab biosimilar) plus CHOP&#xD;
      and rituximab plus CHOP, as first-line treatment of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose is to compare the safety of H02 combined with CHOP regimen and rituximab&#xD;
      injection (Rituximab®) combined with CHOP regimen in the treatment of newly treated diffuse&#xD;
      large B-cell lymphoma.&#xD;
