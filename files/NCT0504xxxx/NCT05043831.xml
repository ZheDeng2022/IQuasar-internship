  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness (Intra-Ocular Pressure lowering)&#xD;
      and safety of Direct Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty (DSLT) in ethnic Chinese subjects with&#xD;
      Primary Open Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glaucoma, which is very common disease in China, can result in blindness if left untreated&#xD;
      and as such it is extremely important to diagnose and treat the condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually doctors treat the first symptoms of glaucoma or ocular hypertension by prescribing&#xD;
      eye drops. Unfortunately, there can be side effects associated with the use of these eye&#xD;
      drops and there are reports of non-compliance due to difficulties in inserting these drops,&#xD;
      all of which can impact on how effective this treatment regimen is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess how well the new automated DSLT device for laser&#xD;
      treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension works in comparison with the standard SLT in&#xD;
      ethnic Chinese population and determine that it is as effective in reducing intraocular&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DSLT or SLT will be performed in the study eye according to the randomization assignment.&#xD;
      Eligible patients who sign the informed consent will be enrolled at each of the study sites,&#xD;
      and undergo a washout (in the case of being medicated). After washout there will be a&#xD;
      baseline visit, where continued eligibility is confirmed. Following confirmation of continued&#xD;
      eligibility, 50% of patients being randomized to each treatment group. Randomization will be&#xD;
      to a pre-determined randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one eye per participant will be included in the study and they will be treated using&#xD;
      either DSLT or SLT as per the randomized treatment allocation.&#xD;
