  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) pain is complex and difficult to treat. For individuals with&#xD;
      SCI, pain often begins early in the course of their SCI and continues longitudinally.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, SCI-related pain is frequently not responsive to medical treatment and medical&#xD;
      treatments that are available and commonly used, such as opioids, have negative side-effects&#xD;
      and risk of addiction. Nonpharmacological interventions to reduce chronic pain show promise&#xD;
      both for individuals with SCI as well as other chronic pain conditions. Research on&#xD;
      psychological interventions for chronic pain over the past two decades has consistently found&#xD;
      these interventions to be more effective than no treatment, standard care, pain education, or&#xD;
      relaxation training alone. However, many of these interventions are designed and implemented&#xD;
      in outpatient settings after chronic pain has already developed. The development of early,&#xD;
      effective, and preventative interventions to reduce the development of chronic pain has the&#xD;
      potential to vastly improve quality of life for individuals with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project is a pilot project to determine the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      offering an in-person hypnosis enhanced cognitive therapy (HYPNOCT) to patients with acute&#xD;
      SCI engaged in inpatient rehabilitation with persistent pain. An effective, early&#xD;
      intervention could reduce the transition of acute pain into more long-standing chronic pain,&#xD;
      thereby improving quality of life for people living with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the extent to which individuals with recent SCI will participate in&#xD;
      HYPNOCT to address pain during inpatient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To determine the extent to which patients can engage in the proposed course of&#xD;
      treatment during inpatient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: While the primary focus is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the study intervention, the investigators also plan to explore whether HYPNOCT reduces pain&#xD;
      intensity and interference as well as opioid use&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a two group nonrandomized pilot study to determine the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of providing hypnosis enhanced cognitive therapy for pain management during inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation after SCI. Those who consent to participate will elect to be in the&#xD;
      intervention or quasi-control condition. Following enrollment but prior to starting&#xD;
      treatment, participants will complete a &quot;baseline assessment.&quot; Following the end of&#xD;
      intervention (for the intervention group) or prior to discharge (for the measures only&#xD;
      group), participants will complete the &quot;follow-up assessment.&quot; A brief telephone&#xD;
      &quot;post-discharge assessment&quot; will be conducted at 3 months post-discharge for those who&#xD;
      consent to this assessment. The study has 2 primary aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: This trial is designed to assess if patients can be enrolled during their inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation hospitalization. Feasibility will be determined by the rate of eligible&#xD;
      patients who consent to participate. Acceptability will be determined by participant report&#xD;
      and adverse event tracking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1a: The investigators will enroll 30 adults with SCI who report moderate to severe&#xD;
      average daily pain of at least 3 on a 0-10 scale, who meet other eligibility criteria, and&#xD;
      consent to participate in the intervention group of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1b: At least 80% of eligible patients will be enrolled, and at least 85% of&#xD;
      enrolled participants will remain in the intervention and complete follow up assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1c: Less than 5% of the participants will experience an adverse event related to&#xD;
      the intervention, and no participants will experience an intervention related serious adverse&#xD;
      event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1d: 90% of participants will rate the intervention as satisfactory or very&#xD;
      satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: This trial is designed to determine if participants can fully participate in the&#xD;
      proposed, 4 session intervention during their inpatient rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Participants will complete an average of 75% of scheduled therapy sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim: While the primary focus is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      the study intervention, the investigators also plan to explore whether HYPNOCT reduces pain&#xD;
      intensity and interference as well as opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypotheses: Participants who complete the intervention will report lower pain and&#xD;
      interference immediately following the intervention compared to their baseline evaluation.&#xD;

    <description>HYPNOCT is a hybrid intervention that overlaps with both hypnosis and CT to identify adaptive cognitions and make adaptive changes in cognitions more integrated into the participant's belief system (note that traditional CT uses purposeful argument and logic to make these changes; in this condition the investigators add a hypnotic automaticity to this process). The participant will relax in a comfortable position and listen to the clinician speak. However, unlike standard hypnosis for pain, the post-induction suggestions will focus on changes in cognitive content and processes (as opposed to changes in sensory experience). Participants will undergo 4 sessions during inpatient rehabilitation admission, each lasting 30-60 minutes. Sessions will include brief assessments of pain intensity, adverse events, and between session practice. Participants in this group will also complete baseline, follow-up, and post-discharge assessments.</description>
