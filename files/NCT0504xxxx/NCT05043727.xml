  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinsons Disease is a progressive neuro degenerative disorder manifested by a broad&#xD;
      spectrum of motor and non-motor features. Approximately 500 000 people suffer from&#xD;
      Parkinson's Disease in the United States and there are approximately 50,000 new cases&#xD;
      reported annually . Postural instability, impaired gait, and freezing episodes are all common&#xD;
      occurrences in Parkinson's. Agility activities, including supine-to-stand, ambulation,&#xD;
      turning, and reaching activities, have been used to reduce freezing episodes, particularly in&#xD;
      the early stages of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional physical therapy(balance training, stretching and strengthening exercises) being&#xD;
      used for the balance and gait training in Parkinson. In recent time, there has been&#xD;
      development in such treatment plan. Virtual reality based games have been used for such&#xD;
      purposes. This study will look at the effects of virtual reality gaming in patients suffering&#xD;
      from Parkinson's disease and its outcomes in term of gait and balance training. A randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial will be performed. total 16 patients will be included in the study and will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups. VR Group will be receiving virtual reality based exercise plan while&#xD;
      the CONVENTIONAL group will receive conventional physical therapy . Division will be done&#xD;
      through lottery method. Unified parkinson's disease rating scale and dynamic gait index will&#xD;
      be used to collect the data. Treatment frequency will be three days per week for three months&#xD;
      .&#xD;
