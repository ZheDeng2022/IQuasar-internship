      The study aims to test the efficacy of a web-based interactive self-management support&#xD;
      intervention on the primary outcome, quality of life, secondary outcomes, symptom distress,&#xD;
      emotional distress, physical activity, and the mediation effects of self-efficacy, and&#xD;
      supportive care needs in colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Taiwan. With proper treatments,&#xD;
      most patients can be long-term survivors. However, patients often suffered long-term&#xD;
      consequences of the disease and its treatment side effects. In addition, unhealthy lifestyles&#xD;
      will further impact on patient's prognosis and quality of life. Face-to-face or web-based&#xD;
      self-management support interventions can help colorectal cancer patients to achieve a&#xD;
      healthy lifestyle and better adjustment. However, they are costly and may not be assessable&#xD;
      for a certain population. Therefore, it is necessary to develop the most cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions for patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: The study aims is to test the efficacy of a web-based interactive self-management&#xD;
      support intervention on the primary outcome, quality of life, and secondary outcomes, symptom&#xD;
      distress, emotional distress, physical activity, nutrition intake, and the mediation effects&#xD;
      of self-efficacy, social support, and supportive care needs in colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A multi-center randomized six-month follow-up parallel-group superiority design will&#xD;
      be used to test the intervention efficacy. A convenient sample of 160 post-operative&#xD;
      colorectal cancer patients (stage I-III) will be recruited and randomized to the control or&#xD;
      intervention group. Outcome variables will be assessed on the baseline, 2nd, 4th, and 6th&#xD;
      month in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments: The study instruments include Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Version, 34-item&#xD;
      Supportive Care Needs Survey, M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory, The Center for Epidemiologic&#xD;
      Studies Depression Scale, International Physical Activity Questionnaire, and FACT-C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: Descriptive analysis will be used to describe patients' demographics, disease&#xD;
      variables, and outcome variables. The Chi-square, t-test, and Linear Mixed Model will be used&#xD;
      to test the efficacy of the study interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: The study results will provide evidence for the efficacy of the web-based&#xD;
      interactive self-management support intervention for enhancing a healthy lifestyle and&#xD;
      quality of life in colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study participants will be randomly assigned 1:1 to the intervention or the control group by the stratified permuted block randomization and block 4, 6, 8 will be used. The randomization will be stratified by cancer stage (stage I-IIA; stage IIB-III). The Sealed Envelope software (Sealed Envelope Ltd., 2016) will be used to generate the random sequences and sealed envelopes will be used to conceal the assignment of each participant.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>There are two subscales, 27 items of FACT-General and 9 items of Colorectal Cancer Subscale. Each item is rated on a 5-point Likert scale (0-4). The total score of the 36 items represents the score of the scale. The possible score for the scale ranges from 0 to 136. The higher values represent better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>International Physical Activity Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The Taiwan Version of International Physical Activity Questionnaire is used to measure a patient's physical activity. The scale has 7 items, asking patients the time they spent on walking, moderate, and vigorous physical activities during the past 7 days. The amounts of time spent on walking, moderate and vigorous physical activities are then multiplied by 3.3, 4.0, and 8.0 MET, respectively. The sum of the METs-min/wk for three types physically actives is the total score of the scale.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Version</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>There are 12 questions in total. It measures cancer patients 1) maintain independence and a positive attitude, 2) participate in medical care, (3) respond to and manage stress, and 4) Four aspects of self-efficacy, such as managing emotions. Each question is scored from 1 point &quot;very unconfident&quot; to 9 points &quot;very confident&quot;. The total score of each question is the total score of the scale, and the possible range of scores Between 12 and 108 points, the higher the score, the higher the self-efficacy.</description>

    <measure>Supportive Care Needs Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-SF34) measures the supportive care needs of research subjects. This scale mainly to assess cancer patients' psychological (10 questions), health system and information (11 questions), body and daily life (5 questions), medical care and support ( 5 questions) and sex (3 questions) and other five aspects of support and care needs, each question is scored on a Lick-style scale ranging from 1 point &quot;not necessary&quot; to 5 points &quot;very necessary&quot;, and the total score of each question is added. The total score in the table, the possible score ranges from 34 to 170 points, the higher the score, the higher the need for support and care.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2, 4, and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>MDASI (M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory) measures the symptom distress and consists of a 13-item symptom scale and a 6-item interference scale. The 13 symptoms were pain, fatigue, nausea, interrupted sleep, depression, shortness of breath, difficulty in remembering, loss of appetite, lethargy, dry mouth, sadness, vomiting, numbness/tingling. The interference scales for 6 questions are interference with walking, mobility, working ability (including housework), relationship with others, enjoying life, and mood. Each question is scored on a Lick-style scale ranging from 0 points &quot;not at all&quot; to 10 points &quot;very bad&quot;. The average score of each question is the total score of the scale. The possible score ranges from 0 to 10 points. The higher the score, the more the symptom. The more serious the trouble, the average score of 1 to 4 means mild symptom distress, 5-6 means moderate symptom distress, and 7-10 means severe symptom distress.</description>
