  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female breast cancer is the most common cancer and fifth leading cause of cancer death&#xD;
      worldwide. In the past decade, breast cancer consistently to be the most common cancer for&#xD;
      women in Hong Kong, so much that it accounts for 27% of all female cancers, with 4,600 new&#xD;
      cases of breast cancer registration every year and the lifetime breast cancer risk for&#xD;
      females is 1 in every 14. At the same time, breast cancer ranks the third in cancer death in&#xD;
      Hong Kong, with a five-year relative survival rate of 84%. Regular mammography screening has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce the mortality of breast cancer. International guidelines recommend&#xD;
      annual or biannual mammography screening for women aged 50 or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adherence to regular mammography screening remains a challenge. Studies had shown that&#xD;
      the adherence decreased over time. Mailed and telephone reminder were being proven to be&#xD;
      effective tools to increase the adherence to regular breast screening using mammography.&#xD;
      However, both mailing and telephone strategies are associated with labor intensity and high&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past two decades, the advent of internet and smartphone provided a fertile platform&#xD;
      for the development of mobile-health technologies. WhatsApp Messenger is one of the most&#xD;
      frequently used free-of-charge mobile messenger that permits users to send secure messages&#xD;
      across different device platforms. A recent randomized controlled trial from our team has&#xD;
      suggested its clinical utility in improving adherence to regular colorectal cancer screening&#xD;
      using fecal immunochemical test. This encouraging data prompted us to investigate the&#xD;
      potential role of WhatsApp Messenger in breast cancer screening. We hypothesized that text&#xD;
      reminder sent via WhatsApp Messenger improves the longitudinal adherence to biannual&#xD;
      mammography in a community-based, opportunistic breast screening program.&#xD;
