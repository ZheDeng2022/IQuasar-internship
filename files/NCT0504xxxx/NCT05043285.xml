    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I/II/III clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of SCTV01C (A Bivalent Recombinant Trimeric S Protein Vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 Variants) in healthy population aged ≥18 years previously vaccinated with inactivated vaccine against COVID-19.&#xD;
The study consists of 2 parts: Phase 1/2: to identify preferred dose level and expanded cohort; Phase 3: an efficacy part.&#xD;
In Phase 1/2, participants receive 20 µg dose or placebo，40 µg dose or placebo. Phase 3 dose level will be evaluated on phase 1/2 results.&#xD;
Participants who originally received placebo will be offered the opportunity to receive SCTV01C at defined points as part of the study.</intervention_model_description>
