  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational study drawing on data from the Brigham and Women's Home&#xD;
      Hospital database. Sociodemographic and clinic data from a training cohort were used to train&#xD;
      a machine learning algorithm to predict patient deterioration throughout a patient's&#xD;
      admission. This algorithm was then validated in a validation cohort.&#xD;

    <time_frame>From admission to discharge, on average 5 days</time_frame>
    <description>We will use general estimating equations (GEE) with three outcomes per patient (the number of clinically important alarms for BioVitals, NEWS2, and traditional vital signs); the GEE will account for the clustering between the three outcomes on a patient. The GEE will use a negative binomial marginal model with a log-link for the number of alarms with clinical utility and an offset for log length-of stay (in hours); with this model, we model the rate per hour of number of alarms with clinical utility with BI, NEWS2, and traditional vital signs. The main covariate in the negative binomial model will be a three-level covariate for method: BI vs NEWS2 vs traditional vital signs, and the exponential of the effect of this covariate will be a pair-wise rate ratio for BI vs NEWS2 vs traditional vital signs.</description>
