  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thousands of people are working daily in a dusty environment. Many studied reported&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms and ventilatory disorders among Factory workers who exposed to cement&#xD;
      dust. But the evidence for respiratory effect and daily activities over a long time of cement&#xD;
      dust exposure has not been conclusive&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 49 subjects working in a cement production factory were assessed and divided into&#xD;
      three groups according to the total period of work exposure. Groupe A (18 subjects) with work&#xD;
      period &lt; 10 years, group B (13 subjects) with work period 10-15 years, group C (18 subjects)&#xD;
      with work period &gt; 15 years. The ventilatory functions, oxygen saturation, and quality of&#xD;
      life were assessed in the three groups. RESULTS: The study results revealed a statistically&#xD;
      significant difference between the three groups in the mean values of FVC (%), FEV1/FVC (%),&#xD;
      SPO2.&#xD;

        Out of sixty persons who were assigned to this study, a total of 49 subjects (group 1 n =&#xD;
        18, group 2 n = 13 and group 3 n = 18) completed the study (Fig. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In all groups, A, B and, C; height and weight scale were obtained for calculating BMI. The&#xD;
        distribution of smokers between different age groups was measured (table ) The pulmonary&#xD;
        function tests were performed to evaluate the capacity and volume of the lungs among the&#xD;
        participants. Spirometry measurements, including FVC, FEV1, ratio of FEV1 to FVC&#xD;
        (FEV1/FVC), forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF 25-75%), and peak expiratory flow (PEF&#xD;
