  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myocarditis and pericarditis are inflammatory diseases of the myocardium and pericardium, and&#xD;
      can be related to different causes, including vaccines. In the past, some people developed&#xD;
      inflammatory heart disease after receiving a live or inactive virus vaccine (smallpox vaccine&#xD;
      or flu vaccine). Myocarditis was also seen in people with COVID-19. More recently, many&#xD;
      countries reported that some people have developed an inflammatory condition of the&#xD;
      myocardium or pericardium after receiving a vaccine for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past months, doctors have noticed more people presenting to the Emergency Department&#xD;
      with chest pain and shortness of breath after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine, symptoms that&#xD;
      resemble myocarditis or pericarditis. These symptoms may start between 2 to 10 days following&#xD;
      vaccination and are frequently noticed after the second dose of the vaccines. While&#xD;
      pericarditis seems to affect people of various age groups and gender, myocarditis is more&#xD;
      commonly seen in young males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of two components. First, the vaccine-induced inflammatory heart&#xD;
      disease registry will be established It will include a retrospective cohort study and a&#xD;
      prospective, pragmatic design case-control study. We will collect clinical information and&#xD;
      include blood samples for biomarkers at the baseline/recruitment visit and first follow-up&#xD;
      visit. Follow-up telephone interview will be conducted at the 3-month and record search at&#xD;
      6m, 12m and yearly up to 10 years..&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of three components. First, the vaccine-induced inflammatory heart&#xD;
      disease registry will be established. This will include a retrospective chart review in&#xD;
      collaboration with Ottawa Public Health and the Ontario Data Platform (OHDP). Second, we will&#xD;
      invite patients with persistent symptoms, identified in the retrospective chart review, to&#xD;
      participate in research bloodwork and a 3-month telephone interview. Third, there will be a&#xD;
      prospective, pragmatic design case-control study. We will not have a standardized management&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a multi-centre study conducted in tertiary centres in Ontario treating&#xD;
      post-vaccine inflammatory heart disease in both the inpatient and outpatient setting. The&#xD;
      study will commence at UOHI and The Ottawa Hospital, but expected to rapidly obtain&#xD;
      additional sites. In Ontario, the major hospitals will include CHEO, London, Toronto,&#xD;
      Hamilton, and Kingston.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be invited to participate in the Registry when they present to the Emergency&#xD;
      Department, during inpatient admission, or in the Cardiology Outpatient Clinic, either by&#xD;
      being approached by a research coordinator or by being provided contact information to call&#xD;
      if they are interested. Patients will be invited to ask their first-degree relatives to&#xD;
      contact the research site to serve as controls. The retrospective component of the study will&#xD;
      be conducted by identifying patients previously diagnosed with this condition at&#xD;
      participating centres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will collect clinical information and include blood samples for biomarkers at the&#xD;
      baseline/recruitment visit and first follow-up visit. The timing of the follow-up visit is&#xD;
      limited by availability of clinic appointment times but expected to be between 2 and 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the initial visit. The research blood samples will be stored and processed at the&#xD;
      Ottawa Heart Institute. They will be stored for future research in Dr. Peter Liu's Cardiac&#xD;
      Function laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be followed up in a rapid assessment clinic dedicated to patients with&#xD;
      vaccine-induced inflammatory heart disease. Patients at other sites will be followed-up by&#xD;
      their respective local site-PIs and bloodwork will be arranged to be sent to the UOHI.&#xD;
      Outpatient standard of care clinical cMRI is being expedited by the MRI department for local&#xD;
      patients. If an MRI is abnormal, a repeat cardiac MRI will be completed for routine clinical&#xD;
      care follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UOHI will see the patients for clinical purposes and the research data will be captured&#xD;
      at the same time points. These are expected at baseline/initial visit and then a 2-6 week&#xD;
      follow-up visit. Clinical assessments, and bloodwork will be conducted at the two visits.&#xD;
      Subsequent follow-up via telephone interview will be conducted at the 3-month mark with a&#xD;
      script-based questionnaire to ascertain the patient's clinical status and the achievement of&#xD;
      clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event the patient is admitted to the hospital, follow-ups can be completed by a&#xD;
      medical record search. Chart reviews will be conducted at 180 days (6 months) and 365 days (1&#xD;
      year) and then annually for up to 10 years.&#xD;

      At the time of standard-of-care bloodwork collection, additional research blood samples for&#xD;
      biomarker assessment will be collected. Analysis of serum biomarkers such as hs-CRP, ESR,&#xD;
      TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta IL-6, and IL-10 may help shed light on the pathway of inflammation.&#xD;
      Antibody titres response to mRNA vaccination in younger patients will be of particular&#xD;
