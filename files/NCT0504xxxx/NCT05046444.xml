  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last decades hematologists have excelled at improving and refining the&#xD;
      classification, diagnosis, and thus ultimately the therapeutic decision-making process for&#xD;
      their patients. This continuous evolution proceeded in parallel to seminal discoveries in&#xD;
      basic science such as FISH, PCR and NGS. So far, the current WHO classification serves as&#xD;
      reference to diagnostic decision making and is largely based on 5 diagnostic pillars:&#xD;
      cytomorphology of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow smears, histology and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry of bone marrow trephine biopsies or lymph nodes, immunophenotyping,&#xD;
      chromosome banding analysis supplemented by FISH analysis, molecular genetics including PCR&#xD;
      and targeted panel sequencing via NGS. This leads to a swift diagnosis in 90 % of all cases.&#xD;
      The leftover 10 % remain a challenge for hematopathologists and clinicians alike and are&#xD;
      resolved through interdisciplinary teams in the context of specialized boards. With the&#xD;
      advent of high throughput sequencing (mainly WGS and WTS) the possibility of a comprehensive&#xD;
      and detailed portrait of the genetic alterations - specifically in challenging cases - has&#xD;
      become a realistic alternative to classical methods. In SIRIUS the investigators will&#xD;
      prospectively challenge this hypothesis to address the question of how often a better or&#xD;
      final diagnosis can be delivered by WGS and/or WTS and if unclear cases can be efficiently&#xD;
      resolved.&#xD;

      1. Background and Rationale Treatment of hematological diseases relies on a single cardinal&#xD;
           prerequisite: correct classification within the broad specter of malignant diseases&#xD;
           arising from the hematopoietic system. With the ever-expanding availability of distinct&#xD;
           yet complementary diagnostic tools, our understanding of the landscape of hematological&#xD;
           diseases steadily increases. As such, the current consensus classification as summarized&#xD;
           through the WHO classification (2017) represents a compass guiding diagnostic algorithms&#xD;
           to the correct diagnosis. Today, the gold standard of routine diagnostic process relies&#xD;
           on five methodological pillars: cytomorphology, histology, chromosomal cytogenetics,&#xD;
           immunophenotyping, and molecular genetic testing. This leads to a treatment enabling&#xD;
           diagnosis in the vast majority of cases. However, approximately 10 % of cases remain&#xD;
           unresolved from a diagnostic point of view and hence do not lead to a satisfactory&#xD;
           diagnosis according to current WHO standards (2017). The investigators intend to solve&#xD;
           this issue to provide illuminating diagnostic guidance for the best possible patient´s&#xD;
           care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objectives To address this problem, the investigators hypothesize that novel high&#xD;
           throughput sequencing methods, e.g., whole genome and/or whole transcriptome sequencing&#xD;
           are able - by virtue of painting a more delicate genetic portrait of a tumor sample - to&#xD;
           provide a more accurate diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end the investigators generated a reference collection of 5,500 samples with the full&#xD;
      spectrum of hematological malignancies, for which the investigators performed whole-genome&#xD;
      sequencing as well as whole-transcriptome sequencing. Moreover, gold standard diagnoses&#xD;
      according to WHO classification with all needed techniques, all performed in MLL, clinical&#xD;
      data and therapy response data are fully available for these cases. The main advantage of&#xD;
      this reference collection consists of the unambiguity of each diagnosis, providing a&#xD;
      reference framework for any further classification and diagnosis especially in difficult&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, SIRIUS will compare the diagnostic superiority of WGS or WTS to the combined&#xD;
      approach with gold standard results and by matching the obtained results to the nearest&#xD;
      &quot;digital sibling&quot; within our reference cohort of more than 5,500 WGS and WTS (both in 93% of&#xD;
      cases). To this end, the investigators will use an inhouse developed matching algorithm,&#xD;
      which is able to match genomic or transcriptomic profiles to a group of similar cases and&#xD;
      gold standard results from timepoint of this study. Current workflows intended to generate&#xD;
      WTS/WGS data from patient samples - all while fulfilling state of the art accreditation (ISO&#xD;
      15189) - require up to 5 - 7 days. This is largely comparable to classical methods but holds&#xD;
      the promise to replace error prone and arduous iterations in the methodological work up. The&#xD;
      objective is to test whether WTS and/or WGS based approaches can surpass classical methods&#xD;
      regarding diagnostic precision and routine reliability. Here the investigators will test this&#xD;
      hypothesis in a prospective real-world setting under diagnostically difficult circumstances.&#xD;
