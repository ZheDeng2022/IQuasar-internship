  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective observational survey study. We will survey a sample of adult parents&#xD;
      or legal guardians who have a child who has been diagnosed with Attention Deficit&#xD;
      Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and who discussed ADHD treatment options for their child with a&#xD;
      health care provider within the last 2 years. The main goal is to gather evidence of the&#xD;
      validity and reliability of the Shared Decision Making Process scale. Secondary goal is to&#xD;
      gather evidence on the quality of decisions parents make about their children with ADHD. A&#xD;
      third goal is to assess the impact of a Decision Aid on participant knowledge of ADHD&#xD;
      treatment options. Participants will be randomized to one of two arms: participants in the&#xD;
      intervention arm will review a Decision Aid (patient educational tool) partway through the&#xD;
      survey and those in the control arm will not receive any educational materials. All&#xD;
      participants will complete survey that includes the Shared Decision Making process survey&#xD;
      along with a few other measures. A subset of respondents will also complete a retest survey&#xD;
      about two weeks after the initial survey.&#xD;

      about two weeks after the initial survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study staff are working with a national sampling firm to recruit subjects and obtain 500&#xD;
      responses. The sample size was determined to ensure 80% power to detect difference of 0.25SD&#xD;
      at 0.05 significant between intervention and control arm on participant knowledge scores. The&#xD;
      decision aid intervention consists of a set of pre-visit summary cards for parents that cover&#xD;
      the different treatment options and was developed by the Cincinnati Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analyses, study staff will examine the descriptives of the Shared Decision Making&#xD;
      Process items and knowledge scores for the two arms. Study staff will examine rates of&#xD;
      missing data to determine acceptability, and will examine descriptive results to see whether&#xD;
      the scores span the range of total possible scores, are normally distributed, and whether&#xD;
      there is evidence of floor or ceiling effects. Study staff will also test several hypotheses&#xD;
      to examine validity of the scores such as whether higher shared decision making process&#xD;
      scores are associated with less decisional conflict and less regret. Staff will also examine&#xD;
      retest reliability of the Shared Decision Making Process scale.&#xD;

    <description>The parent pre-visit cards from the Cincinnati Children's Hospital's Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) Treatment for School Age Children Decision Aid were used in this study. The 6 pre-visit cards provide an overview of ADHD treatment options, the respective benefits and downsides of each option, and questions to elicit goals/preferences. The four different treatment options presented were: (1) watchful waiting, (2) behavioral treatment, (3) medication treatment, and (4) combined treatment (behavioral and medication together).</description>

    <ipd_description>The study team will create a complete, cleaned, de-identified copy of the final dataset. After the main analyses have been published, information for accessing the data will be made available on the Health Decision Sciences Center website and in publications of the data. Dr. Sepucha will share a de-identified data set with outside investigators at no cost, according to approved Massachusetts General Hospital/Partners policies for data sharing. Investigators from other sites will be able to request the data and will be required to complete a data use agreement that ensures that all local Institutional Review Board requirements are met before using the data, that they will not attempt to identify any data in the dataset, and that they will not share the data set with anyone outside their project team.</ipd_description>
