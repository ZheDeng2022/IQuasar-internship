      To assess the prevalence of renal disease in a pediatric population of patients with celiac&#xD;

      In this study the investigators seek to quantify the prevalence of urine sediment&#xD;
      abnormalities in children with celiac disease to assess whether there is value in screening&#xD;
      for renal disease in this population. Celiac disease (CD) is frequently accompanied by a&#xD;
      variety of extra-digestive manifestations, making it a systemic disease rather than a disease&#xD;
      limited to the gastrointestinal tract. CD belongs to the group of autoimmune diseases, a&#xD;
      significantly increased prevalence of other autoimmune diseases (AD) has been reported in&#xD;
      individuals with CD and their first-degree relatives, and a significantly increased&#xD;
      prevalence of CD has been documented in individuals with other AD. The association between CD&#xD;
      and other ADs may be explained by a shared pathogenic basis, involving genetic susceptibility&#xD;
      as in type 1 diabetes (T1D), similar environmental triggers, increased intestinal&#xD;
      permeability, and possibly by undiscovered mechanisms. Many of the extraintestinal&#xD;
      manifestations of CD involve the kidney. Urolithiasis and crystal-induced renal disease,&#xD;
      nephrogenic ascites, increased risk of end-stage renal disease, and membranoproliferative&#xD;
      glomerulonephritis type 1 are associated with CD. However, little is known about the risk of&#xD;
      kidney disease in individuals with CD, and it would be interesting to assess the prevalence&#xD;
      of urine sediment abnormalities in a pediatric population at diagnosis and during follow-up.&#xD;
      No previous studies have examined the risk of renal disease, and there are currently no&#xD;
      recommendations for screening for renal involvement in patients with CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the renal conditions that particularly attracts our attention is IgA nephropathy&#xD;
      (NIgA). First, studies suggest a common pathogenic basis between this nephropathy and CD and&#xD;
      second, it is one of the most common primary glomerulonephritis in children and adolescents&#xD;
      worldwide. NIgA usually progresses to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 20 years; the&#xD;
      median age of patients starting dialysis ranges from 40 to 50 years. Cohort studies with&#xD;
      extensive follow-up show that 10-13% of children eventually reach ESRD within 10 years and&#xD;
      20-30% within 20 years. In more than half of cases, NIgA is asymptomatic (microscopic&#xD;
      hematuria) and is diagnosed after an incidental finding of hypertension, subnormal glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate, hematuria, and/or proteinuria in children and adults. Renin-angiotensin&#xD;
      system inhibitors have shown effective results in reducing the progression of kidney damage&#xD;
      in young NigA patients with moderate proteinuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of its potential severity, the arguments in favor of its association with CD, its&#xD;
      generally asymptomatic clinical presentation, and the usefulness of its early detection, it&#xD;
      seems interesting to us to evaluate the prevalence of urinary abnormalities characteristic of&#xD;
      NigA in children with celiac disease. The results of this study could have an impact on the&#xD;
      prevention of renal disease in patients with celiac disease.&#xD;

    <description>measurement of proteinuria, creatininuria and urine cytology Hematuria is defined by a number of red blood cells in the urine greater than or equal to 10,000 / ml. This will be carried out by counting red blood cells by an automatic device.&#xD;
The search for proteinuria will be carried out on a urination by an automatic device. Proteinuria is considered positive when the urine protein / creatinine ratio is 0.03 g / mmol. In case of positive proteinuria we will measure the microalbuminuria on the same sample.</description>
