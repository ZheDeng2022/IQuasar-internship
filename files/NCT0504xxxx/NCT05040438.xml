  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 2a trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NK cell therapy combined with&#xD;
      the hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) in patients with intermediate and/or locally&#xD;
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We hypothesized that 5-fluorouracil (FU) with&#xD;
      immunomodulatory functions would relieve the immunosuppressive microenvironment from the&#xD;
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), thereby enhancing the anti-tumor activity of NK&#xD;
      cells. Thus, the subsequent infusion of autologous NK cells (VAX-NK/HCC) following HAIC&#xD;
      treatment may further improve the anti-tumor activity in patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;

      Primary Objective I. To assess the objective response rate (ORR) of administering VAX-NK/HCC,&#xD;
      autologous NK cells combined with HAIC in patients with locally advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives I. To assess the efficacy of administering VAX-NK/HCC combined with&#xD;
      HAIC. II. To assess the safety of administering VAX-NK/HCC combined with HAIC. III. To assess&#xD;
      the immune responses of administering VAX-NK/HCC combined with HAIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a Phase 2a study. Patients receive HAIC treatment every 4 week for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles followed by ex-vivo expanded autologous NK cell infusions. The NK cell treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 4 weeks for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed until&#xD;
      the disease progression.&#xD;
