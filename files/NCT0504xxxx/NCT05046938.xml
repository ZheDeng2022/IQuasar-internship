  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine the effect of online group motivational interviewing&#xD;
      (MI) on eating behavior, healthy lifestyle behaviors and quality of life in nursing&#xD;
      participants with food addiction at three state universities in Ankara. The population of the&#xD;
      research will be those who meet the diagnostic criteria for food addiction according to the&#xD;
      Yale Food Addiction Scale. The research sample size was calculated with the G* Power package&#xD;
      program. As a result of the power analysis, a total of 52 participants, 26 for the&#xD;
      intervention group and 26 for the control group, were found sufficient for the sample with&#xD;
      90% power, 5% margin of error and 0.2065 effect size. Considering that the number of&#xD;
      participants would decrease during the research process, the number of samples was increased&#xD;
      by 10% to a total of 58 university participants, 29 of which were interventions and 29 were&#xD;
      controls. Among the participants who meet the food addiction criteria, the participants who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the research will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention and control groups (n1=29; n2=29). After these participants are&#xD;
      stratified according to the change (pre-contemplation and contemplation stage) phase, a&#xD;
      simple random assignment process within the strata will be done by an independent researcher&#xD;
      to avoid selection bias. Random assignment will be done through a simple random numbers&#xD;
      table. The independent researcher who does not know which group is the intervention group and&#xD;
      which group is the control group will collect the data. Data collection tools will be applied&#xD;
      to the participants in the intervention and control groups in the pre-MI session, the post-MI&#xD;
      session, and 2 months later in the follow-up session. It was planned to apply 5 sessions of&#xD;
      MI to the intervention group, and to follow-up 2 months after the interviews were completed.&#xD;
      No application will be made to the participants in the control group, and at the end of the&#xD;
      study, a seminar on food addiction and quality of life will be given to the participants.&#xD;

&#xD;
      H1-3: Motivational interview has an effect on the eating behavior of nursing students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Place and time of research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research will be conducted online on first, second, third and fourth year participants at&#xD;
      Gazi University Faculty of Health Sciences Nursing Department, Ankara University Faculty of&#xD;
      Nursing and Hacettepe University Faculty of Nursing in the fall semester of the 2021-2022&#xD;
      academic year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The universe and sample of the research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase One of the Study: The first phase of the study will be carried out between September&#xD;
      2021 and October 2021, after obtaining the ethics committee and institutional permission.&#xD;
      There are 635 nurse participants in Ankara University Nursing Faculty, 1022 participants in&#xD;
      Hacettepe University Nursing Faculty and 992 nursing participants in Gazi University Faculty&#xD;
      of Health Sciences Nursing Department. In order to determine the participants who will be&#xD;
      invited to the motivational interview, the &quot;Personal Information Form&quot; and the &quot;Yale Food&#xD;
      Addiction Scale&quot; (YFAS) were used as data collection tools for the participants of Ankara&#xD;
      University Faculty of Nursing, Hacettepe University Faculty of Nursing and Gazi University&#xD;
      Faculty of Health Sciences Nursing Department, to their e-mail addresses and university&#xD;
      website. The web-based form will be sent. Participants will first be expected to read the&#xD;
      information on the &quot;Participant Informed Consent Form&quot; in the first section and mark the &quot;I&#xD;
      Agree&quot; option. After this required field is filled, the data collection tools will be opened&#xD;
      for participants to answer the questions. Among the participants who fill in the forms and&#xD;
      return to the researcher, those who meet the diagnostic criteria of food addiction according&#xD;
      to the YFAS will form the universe of the research. Among the participants who make up the&#xD;
      universe, the participants who meet the inclusion criteria of the research will form the&#xD;
      sample of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second Stage of the Research: The sample size of the research was calculated with the&#xD;
      calculation (G* Power) package program. In particular, a study that was similar in terms of&#xD;
      research design and scale used was examined. The sample calculation for the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups planned to be included in the study was based on a study similar to our study.&#xD;
      As a result of the power analysis, a total of 52 participants, 26 for the intervention group&#xD;
      and 26 for the control group, were found sufficient for the sample with 90% power, 5% margin&#xD;
      of error and 0.2065 effect size. Considering that the number of participants would decrease&#xD;
      during the research process, the number of samples was increased by 10% and it was increased&#xD;
      to a total of 58 university participants, 29 of which were interventions and 29 were&#xD;
      controls. Among the participants who meet the food addiction criteria, the participants who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the research will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to the intervention and control groups (n1=29; n2=29). &quot;The form for determining the&#xD;
      stages of change in participants with food addiction&quot; will be applied to the determined&#xD;
      participants. After these participants are stratified according to the change&#xD;
      (pre-contemplation and contemplation stage) phase, a simple random assignment process within&#xD;
      the strata will be done by an independent researcher to avoid selection bias. Random&#xD;
      assignment will be done through a simple random numbers table. The independent researcher who&#xD;
      does not know which group is the intervention group and which group is the control group will&#xD;
      collect the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables of the Study Independent variables: Motivational interviewing Dependent variables:&#xD;
      Quality of life, healthy lifestyle behaviors and eating behavior scales Control (Mixer)&#xD;
      Variable: Motivational interview change phase The data of the study will be collected with&#xD;
      'Participant information form', 'Yale Food Addiction Scale', Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors&#xD;
      Scale-II and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant Information Form: Participant information form prepared by the researcher;&#xD;
           It consists of a total of 13 questions including socio-demographic characteristics (age,&#xD;
           gender, cohabitation, employment status, etc.) and food addiction (height, weight,&#xD;
           counseling status) of university participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS): The scale, which was developed by Gearhardt et al. in&#xD;
           2009 and adapted into Turkish by Bayraktar et al. in 2012, consists of 27 questions. In&#xD;
           the reliability analysis performed for the Food Addiction Scale, the Cronbach's Alpha&#xD;
           value of the scale was found to be 0.93. The scale is a scale used to measure&#xD;
           addictive-like eating behaviors towards certain types of food (high-fat and high-sugar)&#xD;
           in the past 12 months. The scale was created by adapting the substance addiction&#xD;
           criteria in DSM-IV to food addiction in order to determine the dependence on specific&#xD;
           foods. The first 16 questions of the scale, from 1 to 5, are 'never', 'once a month',&#xD;
           'twice a month', 'twice a week' and 'more than four times a week' and are in a 5-point&#xD;
           Likert type. Questions 17-24 will be answered as yes or no. The 25th question includes&#xD;
           five items asked about eating habits in the last year. Question 26 includes the&#xD;
           preferred nutrient for the nutrition filled by the participant. The 27th question is&#xD;
           about whether the person has any other food preferences. The scale is calculated with 7&#xD;
           sub-measures evaluated in the diagnosis of substance addiction. In addition, the scale&#xD;
           has an 8th clinical significance score. For the diagnosis of food addiction, at least 3&#xD;
           of the 7 diagnostic criteria must be met and clinical significance must be present. In&#xD;
           dystomic scoring, clinical significance, one (1) point of the 15th or 16th item and a&#xD;
           symptom score (≥3) are evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale-II (HLBS-II): The scale was developed in 1987 as a&#xD;
           result of the studies of Walker, Sechrist, and Pender. In 1996, this scale was developed&#xD;
           and renamed as the Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale II. The validity and reliability of&#xD;
           HLBS- II was established by Bahar et al. in 2008. The cronbach's alpha value of the&#xD;
           scale is 0.92 for the total scale, and the reliability coefficients of its&#xD;
           sub-dimensions range from 0.64 to 0.80. HLBS II consists of 52 items and six&#xD;
           sub-dimensions. Rating is done in the form of a four-point likert. Scale; never (1),&#xD;
           sometimes (2), often (3), regularly (4). The lowest score that can be obtained from the&#xD;
           scale is 52, and the highest score is 208. Sub-dimensions of the scale; health&#xD;
           responsibility, physical activity, nutrition, mental development, interpersonal&#xD;
           relationships and stress management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. SF-36 Quality of Life Scale: SF-36 was developed by Ware in 1987 for use in the&#xD;
           evaluation of clinical practice and health policy in research, and in general population&#xD;
           reviews. The scale was translated into Turkish and validity and reliability studies were&#xD;
           conducted. The SF-36 was created to provide the minimum psychometric standards required&#xD;
           for group comparisons. The items of SF 36 also represent behavioral functions,&#xD;
           dysfunctions, and both pleasant and unpleasant personal evaluations such as anxiety and&#xD;
           happiness. Each item in the scale is used to score only one subscale. SF 36 is a&#xD;
           multi-item measurement tool that evaluates 3 main health areas and 8 health concepts.&#xD;
           Among these, physical functionality (10 questions), physical role limitations (4&#xD;
           questions), emotional role limitations (3 questions), social functionality (2 questions)&#xD;
           are in functional status. Pain (2 questions), mental health (5 questions), and&#xD;
           energy/vitality (4 questions) are included in the field of well-being. General health&#xD;
           perception (5 questions) is included in the general assessment of health. There is also&#xD;
           an item on the scale that evaluates changes in health during the past year. Except for&#xD;
           the fourth and fifth items, the evaluation criterion is likert type, and the fourth and&#xD;
           fifth items are answered as yes/no. Subscales evaluate health between 0 and 100, and '0'&#xD;
           indicates poor health, while '100' indicates good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Application First of all, participants will be expected to answer the &quot;Participant&#xD;
      Information Form&quot; and &quot;Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS)&quot; respectively. Among the participants&#xD;
      who fill in the forms completely and return to the researcher, the participants who meet at&#xD;
      least 3 diagnostic criteria according to YFAS and have clinical significance will form the&#xD;
      universe of the research. Among the participants who make up the universe, the participants&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria of the research will form the sample of the research. The&#xD;
      participants who accept to participate in the research will be given the &quot;Identification of&#xD;
      Change Stages in participants with Food Addiction Form&quot;. According to the change stages, one&#xD;
      of the similar groups will be randomly assigned as the intervention group and the other as&#xD;
      the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage of the study, after determining the participants who meet the diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria and have clinical significance according to the YFAS, they will be stratified&#xD;
      according to the stages of change (pre-contemplation and contemplation) and assigned to the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups by an independent researcher with a simple random assignment.&#xD;
      A total of 58 participants who want to continue the research will be determined in the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. Data collection tools for the participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group who participated in the research between November 2021 and March 2022&#xD;
      before MI session, Week 5 (final session) and 2 months later in the follow-up session. It was&#xD;
      planned to apply 5 sessions of motivational interviewing to the intervention group, and to&#xD;
      conduct a follow-up interview 2 months after the interviews were completed. The group&#xD;
      counseling process will be completed in 5 sessions in total. Group sessions will be held for&#xD;
      60-75 minutes and once a week. Assignment of participants to the groups will be made in line&#xD;
      with the limits of the minimum 6 and maximum 8 participants. The day and time of the groups&#xD;
      will be determined with the researcher before the first session, outside the class hours of&#xD;
      the participants, and the sessions will continue on the same day and time every week.&#xD;
      Sessions will be held online. One day before each session, participants will be called by&#xD;
      phone and reminded about the time of the session. Data collection tools will be applied to&#xD;
      the participants in the control group simultaneously with the first group session, 3 times in&#xD;
      the first session, in the 5th week and 2 months later. No application will be made to the&#xD;
      participants in the control group, and a webinar will be given to the participants at the end&#xD;
      of the study on food addiction and quality of life. An online motivational interview will be&#xD;
      held with the participants who make the request. Motivational Interview Plan was created by&#xD;
      the researcher and will be submitted to expert opinion. The pre-application researcher&#xD;
      participated in the Motivational Interview (MI) training program and received a certificate.&#xD;
