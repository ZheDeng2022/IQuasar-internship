  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nutritional deficiency and subsequent weight loss in patients with head and neck cancer is a&#xD;
      common problem and a negative predictor of treatment outcomes and mortality, as well as&#xD;
      quality of life. Nutritional support for patients is a prerequisite for the successful&#xD;
      management of cancer patients. Sensory changes can be side effects of chemotherapy or&#xD;
      ionizing radiation, which damages sensory receptors in the area of radiation, disrupts the&#xD;
      function of the salivary glands, leading to hyposalivation and a decrease in taste.&#xD;
      Individual choice of nutrition based on sensory sensations can significantly improve the&#xD;
      quality of life of patients and ensure timely correction of their eating behavior.&#xD;
