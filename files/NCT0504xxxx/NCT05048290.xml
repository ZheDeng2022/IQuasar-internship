  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial investigates how receiving instruction in communication skills affects short and&#xD;
      long-term career outcomes for students, postdoctoral fellows, and future faculty. This may&#xD;
      help researchers learn more about the factors that may help or block career goals and career&#xD;
      persistence of trainees.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine communication across difference (CAD) workshop effects over time using&#xD;
      experimental and control dyads of summer students and their matched junior mentors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ia. Develop and deliver CAD skills workshops to dyads of students and junior mentors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ib. Test CAD workshop effects for individual participants with pre-, post-, and follow-up&#xD;
      surveys of model variables over the course of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Identify causal relationships of the social-influence variables with experimental and&#xD;
      control groups of dyads over the 9-month course of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. Assess the psychological processes and causal relationships for students linking CAD to&#xD;
      career intentions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIb. Assess the psychological processes and causal relationships for junior mentors linking&#xD;
      CAD to career intentions and intentions to mentor diverse students in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIc. Assess the paired interaction effects between dyad members using pre-, post-, and&#xD;
      follow-up model variables over the course of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess long-term outcomes of the intervention and predictive utility of the student and&#xD;
      mentor models by measuring changes in Hallmarks of Success: distal career persistence and&#xD;
      network growth for students and junior mentors, as well as junior mentors' engagement in&#xD;
      mentoring of diverse students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Dyads of summer students and their matched junior mentors are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP I (EXPERIMENTAL): Participants complete 2 communication workshops about conversational&#xD;
      skills and development of a video about the summer student's research experience over 3 hours&#xD;
      each during the second week of the summer research experience and 2-3 weeks before the&#xD;
      conclusion of summer experience. Participants also complete surveys over 15 minutes each&#xD;
      about their communication, their engagement with research, mentoring experience, and current&#xD;
      career intentions, before participating in the workshop, after the second workshop and at 6&#xD;
      months after the conclusion of the summer experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GROUP II (CONTROL): Participants complete 2 generic communication workshops about networking&#xD;
      and presentation skills over 3 hours each during the second week of the summer experience and&#xD;
      2-3 weeks before the conclusion of summer experience. Participants also complete surveys over&#xD;
      15 minutes each about their communication, their engagement with research, mentoring&#xD;
      experience, and current career intentions, before participating in the workshop, after the&#xD;
      second workshop and at 6 months after the conclusion of the summer experience.&#xD;
