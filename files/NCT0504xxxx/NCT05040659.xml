  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how to better identify people who have been&#xD;
      infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes COVID-19). Most people who have been exposed&#xD;
      to the virus develop changes in their sense of smell (olfaction). We are interested in&#xD;
      measuring smell function objectively via smell cards that test odor intensity,&#xD;
      identification, and discrimination. The impact of smell testing to identify people at risk&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 will be maximized if objective and precise olfactory testing can be performed&#xD;
      in the convenience of one's home. We will use results from this test to better understand the&#xD;
      relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and olfactory function and to learn whether the AROMHA&#xD;
      longitudinal smell test is a reliable screening tool to detect smell loss in the context of&#xD;
      possible COVID exposure.&#xD;

    <description>The Aromha Smell Test is a battery of 18 odors across 6 smell cards. The subject smells each of the 3 scents per card to determine smell intensity, identification, and discrimination. Increased number of correct responses indicates better sense of smell. We will evaluate previously diagnosed anosmic patients.</description>

The subject smells each of the 3 scents per card to determine smell intensity, identification, and discrimination. Increased number of correct responses indicates better sense of smell.

    <description>The AROMHA Longitudinal Smell Test is a self-administered, at-home smell test intended for use as a screening test by asymptomatic individuals to help prevent exposure to and spread of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, through a serial testing approach. The device consists of six versions of a smell card, each containing three unique odors.</description>
