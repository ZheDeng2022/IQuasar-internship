  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic function is a combination of ventricular chamber compliance, active myofilament&#xD;
      relaxation, and elastic recoil of systolic potential energy. Diastole is classically divided&#xD;
      into four stages-isovolumetric relaxation, early rapid filling, late slow filling, and atrial&#xD;
      contraction. Isovolumetric relaxation refers to the rapid decrease in LV pressure with little&#xD;
      or no change in volume and ends with the opening of the mitral valve and early LV filling.&#xD;
      These early phases, sometimes referred to as LV suction, are characterized by a rapid decline&#xD;
      in LV intracavity pressure and require energy in the form of ATP to pump cytosolic calcium&#xD;
      back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and enable uncoupling of actin and myosin. Filling later&#xD;
      in diastole is more dependent on ventricular compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to investigator knowledge, the effect of mechanical ventilation on patient hemodynamics is&#xD;
      still unclear especially in patients with diastolic dysfunction. The optimal ventilation mode&#xD;
      for anesthesia of patient with diastolic dysfunction remains a subject of debate. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study is to investigate whether the pressure regulated volume-controlled mode&#xD;
      (PRVC) in comparison with the volume-controlled mode in patients with diastolic dysfunction&#xD;
      is associated with better hemodynamic alterations and different vasopressors support during&#xD;
      anesthesia for radical cystectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diastolic dysfunction represents an abnormality in left ventricular relaxation and/or&#xD;
      compliance that changes the onset, rate and extent of LV pressure decline and filling during&#xD;
      diastole. These changes cause an abnormal relation between LV pressure and volume so that&#xD;
      higher filling pressures are required to maintain normal LV end-diastolic volume and cardiac&#xD;
      output .Ventricular compliance is affected by numerous factors, including the accumulation of&#xD;
      cytoskeletal collagen, which increases with age (over 60 years), longstanding wall stress&#xD;
      beyond its physiological reserve, for example, during episodes of uncontrolled systemic&#xD;
      hypertension, long term DM, obesity, cardiac ischemia or atrial fibrillation (AF), and&#xD;
      various neuro-humoral factors. Less common causes are infiltrative diseases, pericardial&#xD;
      constriction, and collection. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic examination of diastolic function including transmitral flow velocities&#xD;
      early (E) and atrial (A), as well as the corresponding velocities of the mitral valve annuli&#xD;
      (e' and a'), is currently recommended .After cardiac and noncardiac surgery, diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction is thought to be a risk factor for postoperative consequences including greater&#xD;
      mortality and a higher incidence of serious cardiovascular events including myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, pulmonary edema, ventricular fibrillation, or primary cardiac arrest and complete&#xD;
      heart block. However, the underlying mechanism by which diastolic dysfunction raises the risk&#xD;
      of postoperative complications is unknown. Anesthetic drugs may cause altered hemodynamic&#xD;
      function and subsequent impairment of diastolic function in patients with diastolic&#xD;
      dysfunction, which may be linked to a higher incidence of postoperative problems Positive&#xD;
      pressure ventilation is required for anesthesia, and significant volume shifts occur&#xD;
      intraoperatively and postoperatively, especially in major surgery. The interactions of&#xD;
      positive pressure ventilation with the cardiovascular system are complex and affect both&#xD;
      ventricles .Whereas Volume-controlled ventilation ensures the delivery of a defined tidal&#xD;
      volume and uses a square waveform flow delivery method that produces high peak airway&#xD;
      pressures in low-compliance states. On the other hand, Pressure-regulated volume-controlled&#xD;
      (PRVC) mode of ventilation is an example of adaptive targeting mode. There is the adaptive&#xD;
      targeting of inspiratory pressure with the aim of delivering the desired minute tidal volume.&#xD;
      The ventilator uses a feedback method on breath-to-breath basis to continuously adjust the&#xD;
      pressure delivered to achieve the tidal volume target .The effects of different ventilatory&#xD;
      modes on patientÂ´s hemodynamics requires further investigations, the increase of the&#xD;
      intrathoracic pressure produced by mechanical ventilation can decrease venous return and then&#xD;
      preload resulting in decreased cardiac output .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of hemodynamics remain one of the core tasks in perioperative and critical care&#xD;
      settings. The basis of hemodynamic management in patients undergoing major surgery is formed&#xD;
      by a rational titration of fluids, vasopressors and inotropes. the use of dynamic parameters&#xD;
      to guide intravenous and inotropic therapy is frequently applied with the intention to&#xD;
      optimize peri-operative hemodynamic profiles and maximize oxygen delivery in patients&#xD;
      undergoing major abdominal surgery .Direct measurement of SV using noninvasive techniques has&#xD;
      become an accepted tool for guiding fluid administration in high risk surgical patients.&#xD;
      Dynamic indices have emerged as promising predictors in last decade, and have been proven to&#xD;
      predict fluid responsiveness far better than static measures .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized, cross- over study will be conducted on 100 pairs of patients&#xD;
      scheduled for radical cystectomy. A written informed consent will be obtained from all&#xD;
      participants in the study.This study will include adult patients -who diagnosed by&#xD;
      preoperative cardiac ECHO-with diastolic dysfunction of both sexes. The patients at risk of&#xD;
      diastolic dysfunction usually include concomitant comorbidities like long term hypertension,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation or aged patients above 65 years who will scheduled for&#xD;
      radical cystectomy and urinary diversion for muscle invasive urinary bladder carcinoma at&#xD;
