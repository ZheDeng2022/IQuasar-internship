  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to measure the correlation of hyperpolarized 129-Xe magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (129-XeMRI) in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (allo-HCT) recipients at MD&#xD;
      Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) who develop bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) or BOS&#xD;
      stage 0p (pulmonary impairment not meeting the definition for BOS, defined below) and&#xD;
      controls with chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to correlate 129-Xenon measures of ventilation, gas&#xD;
      exchange, and pulmonary circulation with spirometric and quantitative CT measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to determine whether measurement of 129-Xe MRI characteristics in&#xD;
      patients with BOS stage 0p can predict BOS progression 6 months after enrollment.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to correlate 129-Xenon measures of ventilation, gas&#xD;
      exchange, and pulmonary circulation with spirometric and quantitative CT measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A secondary objective is to assess the differences in 129-Xe MRI characteristics between&#xD;
      patients with and without OS progression at 6 months after enrollment. Other secondary&#xD;
      objectives include the assessment of the relationship of VDP, barrier defects (continuous&#xD;
      variable), and circulation defects (continuous variable) with pulmonary function,&#xD;
      quantitative CT measurements, SGRQ, and SF-6D.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allo-HCT recipients who are at least 18 years of age and have BOS (n=10 patients), BOS 0p&#xD;
        (n = 10 patients), or cGVHD of a non-lung organ without evidence of pulmonary impairment (n&#xD;
        = 5 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, we will perform only XeMRI imaging on 10 healthy adult volunteers with no&#xD;
        medical issues for technical calibration of the XeMRI technology. Members of the study team&#xD;
        may serve as healthy volunteers if they have no prior history of lung disease. These data&#xD;
        will not be included as part of the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients unable to follow up at MD Anderson for routine clinical care&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability or unwillingness to give informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Relapsed disease or life expectancy less than 6 months at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Severe claustrophobia precluding MRI imaging&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Active pulmonary infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant women&#xD;
