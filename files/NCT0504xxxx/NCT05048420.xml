      Purpose/reason of the research: The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is an important ligament&#xD;
      in maintaining knee function. In patients with anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury,&#xD;
      concomitant intra-articular lesions are usually seen. It has been reported that approximately&#xD;
      43% of all patients with ACL tears have associated lateral or medial meniscal injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury associated with a tear of the meniscotibial ligament in the posterior horn of the&#xD;
      medial meniscus is defined as a RAMP lesion. Because the RAMP lesion is located within the&#xD;
      posteromedial &quot;blind spot&quot;, it has historically been underdiagnosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been reported that 9-17% of all ACL tears have RAMP lesions. RAMP lesions have been&#xD;
      found to increase the force on the ACL. Injury to the meniscotibial ligaments has been shown&#xD;
      to increase rotational instability of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available literature, there is a discrepancy between authors regarding the&#xD;
      repair of a RAMP lesion during an acute ACL surgery. In chronic ACL rupture, some authors&#xD;
      have suggested that the RAMP lesion has a suitable biological environment for healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      thinks. However, excessive mobility of the meniscocapsular junction has been reported in RAMP&#xD;
      lesions during knee flexion and extension. It has been suggested that these lesions are&#xD;
      different from other peripheral tears and are not suitable for spontaneous healing. It is&#xD;
      suggested that meniscal RAMP lesion repair will be the most effective approach.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation after repair of a RAMP lesion depends on whether the repair is performed&#xD;
      concurrently with ACL surgery. When performed with an ACL surgery, the process is followed&#xD;
      according to the ACL rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if the functionality of the knee is fully restored in the post-ACL surgery period, not&#xD;
      all patients can return to their previous level of sportive performance due to various&#xD;
      psychological, social and physiological factors. In the literature, different information can&#xD;
      be found as criteria for returning to sports after ACL surgery. The rate of returning to&#xD;
      sports was reported as 65-88% in patients with ACL reconstruction, and 19-82% in patients who&#xD;
      were followed conservatively. However, there are few studies with short- or long-term&#xD;
      follow-up after the identification and treatment of RAMP lesions. Accordingly, our aim in&#xD;
      this study is to comprehensively evaluate the return to sports of participants who have&#xD;
      undergone isolated anterior cruciate ligament surgery and who have had simultaneous RAMP&#xD;
      lesion repair with anterior cruciate ligament surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assessment will provide the opportunity to examine functional capacity, balance,&#xD;
      psychological state, activity level and pain with different measurement methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and method of the research: The study will consist of 2 groups, including 12&#xD;
      participants who have undergone isolated ACL surgery and 12 participants who have had&#xD;
      simultaneous RAMP lesion repair in Istanbul Medipol Mega Hospitals Complex Orthopedics and&#xD;
      Traumatology Unit, with a total of 24 participants.&#xD;
