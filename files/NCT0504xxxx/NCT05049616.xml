  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a combined pill of Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)&#xD;
      inhibitors (a medication that helps relax your veins and arteries to lower your blood&#xD;
      pressure) with diuretics (sometimes called water pills, help rid your body of salt and water)&#xD;
      will control blood pressure better than a different blood pressure medication of calcium&#xD;
      channel blocker (lower your blood pressure by preventing calcium from entering the cells of&#xD;
      your heart and arteries). Both medications are part of our usual care for high blood pressure&#xD;
      after delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In individuals with preeclampsia, persistent hypertension and edema result in part from the&#xD;
      mobilization of up to 8 liters of fluid and sodium from the extravascular to intravascular&#xD;
      space. The increased urinary sodium excretion on days 3-5 postpartum likely results from&#xD;
      higher atrial natriuretic peptide concentrations in plasma and activation of the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Adding diuretics for postpartum hypertension has been&#xD;
      associated with better blood pressure control in some of the studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CVD is the leading cause for mortality worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary prevention is more effective than treating CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy is often the 1st adult engagement with the healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preeclampsia is a risk factor for long term CVD, even after controlling for mutual risk&#xD;
           factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CVD is the leading cause for pregnancy related mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no good data regarding the optimal medications to control blood pressure after&#xD;
           delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACE inhibitors play an important role in controlling blood pressure outside of pregnancy&#xD;
           and there is extensive evidence to support their cardioprotective effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The optimal use of diuretics in the postpartum in patients with preeclampsia, require&#xD;
           further study and clarification to augment current management schemes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: that in postpartum women with hypertensive disorders, oral combined&#xD;
      Hydrochlorothiazide/Lisinopril will reduce postpartum hypertension at 7 days after delivery&#xD;
      compared to usual care with calcium channel blockers.&#xD;
