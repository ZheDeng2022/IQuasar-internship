    <textblock>
      Evaluate the hemodynamic and anatomical effect of the commercially available CMCS system&#xD;
      within its current indication on a subset of patients with exercise induced mitral&#xD;
      regurgitation. This will be primarily evaluated by standard of care exercise testing and&#xD;
      echocardiography. The purpose is to evaluate HFrEF CHF patients that may have mild to&#xD;
      moderate-severe MR at rest but aggravated upon activity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The EXERCISE FMR trial is a prospective, multi-center clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The centers will utilize pre-screening of existing medical records to identify potentially&#xD;
      eligible subjects. Once informed consent has been obtained, the subject will undergo standard&#xD;
      of care assessments which include: Transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography (if necessary), and functional assessments (NYHA and KCCQ Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire). Following final eligibility determination, eligible subjects will under the&#xD;
      index procedure to implant the commercially available Carillon device (includes coronary&#xD;
      sinus venogram) according to the Instructions for Use. Subject will be discharged following&#xD;
      after standard of care discharge assessments are completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implanted subjects will have follow-up assessments performed at 1 month, 6 months, and 12&#xD;
      months post index procedure. Most assessments performed as part of follow-up are intended to&#xD;
      be standard of care at each institution. The only elements that may fall outside of standard&#xD;
      of care would be the non-invasive assessments of TTE, 6-minute walk test and the&#xD;
      questionnaire. Further, follow-up at 1 and 6 months may also not be common site practice.&#xD;
