  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSA) is a common condition associated with major&#xD;
      repercussions such as excessive daytime sleepiness and impaired quality of life as well as&#xD;
      metabolic and cardiovascular complications. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)&#xD;
      remains the treatment of choice but its effectiveness remains limited, especially in reducing&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic risk. Interventions to modify the lifestyle are therefore recommended in the&#xD;
      management of OSA. The emergence of information and communication technologies is an&#xD;
      opportunity for patients to have tools that promote self-management and behavioral changes.&#xD;
      The recent development of telerehabilitation (TR) is a promising approach that has only been&#xD;
      the subject of pilot studies. In a randomized, controlled and multicenter study, we propose&#xD;
      to test the hypothesis according to which the use of a mobile TR solution, associated with&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), will allow obese patients to adopt behavioral&#xD;
      modifications to improve markers of severity of OSA. The analysis of big data (data-mining)&#xD;
      will allow a better understanding of the motivational obstacles and levers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Statistical analysis plan The number of patients solicited for the study and the number of&#xD;
      subjects included and randomized in each group will be reported on the flow chart. Premature&#xD;
      stops (lost to follow-up, death, study withdrawals) and their reasons will be reported as&#xD;
      well as any deviations from the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial descriptive analysis of each of the groups will be carried out. For qualitative&#xD;
      variables, this description will include the number as well as the frequency of the different&#xD;
      modalities. Concerning the quantitative variables, the description will include the number,&#xD;
      the mean, the standard deviation, the median as well as the extreme values according to the&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparability of the 2 groups will be verified for all the initial characteristics likely&#xD;
      to influence the results. In the event of non-comparability on one or more parameters, an&#xD;
      adjustment will be made on this or these parameters for the comparisons between groups of&#xD;
      judgment criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of the primary judgment criterion The variation in the evolution of the various main&#xD;
      criteria will be compared between the 2 groups using a nonparametric means comparison test&#xD;
      (Mann-Whitney test) or if the distribution turns out to be Gaussian and the conditions&#xD;
      application are verified, a parametric test (Student's T).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of secondary endpoints The qualitative variables will be compared by a Chi-square&#xD;
      test. Otherwise, if the conditions for performing this test are not met, Fisher's exact test&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative variables will be compared between the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the case of Gaussian variables, by a student's t test or an analysis of variance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  in the case of non-Gaussian variables, by a Wilcoxon-Mann-Withney test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal data (quality of life scores, physical activities) will be modeled by a mixed&#xD;
      regression with the patient effect as a random variable. A linear regression model modeling&#xD;
      the variation of the longitudinal endpoints will be fitted to the covariates having at least&#xD;
      one trend (p &lt;0.15) to the difference between the two arms of the study. A forward type&#xD;
      procedure will be implemented to obtain a final multivariate model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IPTW method will be used. The lost to follow-up will be considered using a weighting on&#xD;
      the inverse of the probability of being censored&#xD;
