  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthy young and older adults will complete two trials in a randomized crossover&#xD;
      counter-balanced order, including resistance exercise and sedentary control. During each&#xD;
      trial, blood samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesized that an acute bout of resistance exercise exert different&#xD;
      inflammation responses in young and older adults.&#xD;
