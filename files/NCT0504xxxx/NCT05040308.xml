    <textblock>
      This is an evaluation of programs to integrate PrEP into existing services for PWUD. PrEP&#xD;
      will be delivered according to Uganda national guidelines and data from national monitoring&#xD;
      and evaluation forms will be leveraged to address key outcomes. Additionally, research&#xD;
      components will be implemented to support greater understanding of PrEP use and experiences&#xD;
      of participants engaged with the PrEP programs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first facility-based medication-assisted treatment (MAT) program (with methadone) in&#xD;
      Kampala launched in 2020, providing opportunity to integrate pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP)&#xD;
      as part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package. Additionally, a community-based needle and&#xD;
      syringe exchange program (NSP) provides opportunity to integrate PrEP and meet priorities of&#xD;
      PWID while building rapport between providers and end-users. With two different service&#xD;
      models - integrating PrEP into facility-based MAT and community-based NSP - there is a great&#xD;
      opportunity to optimize the integration of PrEP and other HIV prevention services for PWUD.&#xD;
      By integrating PrEP into two existing programs (MAT and NSP), this study will determine&#xD;
      uptake and persistence of PrEP use and leverage these programs to conduct costing research&#xD;
      and budget impact analysis.&#xD;

    <description>The clinic staff will train up to 50 health care providers of PWUD on PrEP service delivery using the national curriculum on PrEP services delivery. We will administer a quantitative assessment of PrEP knowledge and experiences with service provision at three time points: 1. Before the training (Baseline survey), 2. immediately after training (Post training survey), and 3. ~3 months post training (Exit survey).</description>

    <measure>To conduct a budget impact analysis for integrating PrEP into MAT and NSP programs.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months post study enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>The clinic staff will conduct micro costing c using activity-based approaches for costs incurred (clinic wide trainings, recruitment, service delivery, lab monitoring, PrEP support, and provision of PrEP) and costs averted (health costs saved by averting incident HIV infections). Cost data will also be collected from the study budget, public health clinic budgets, published government reports, and the health economics literature. Time and motion studies will be conducted by observing visits of people who are accessing services, and staff time spent on counseling, clinical procedures, and delivering PrEP.</description>
