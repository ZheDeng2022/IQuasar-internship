      This purpose of this study is to learn about how to provide treatment to gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      survivors who have difficulty sleeping.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study has two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1, 15 gynecologic cancer survivors will receive three candidate intervention&#xD;
      components known to reduce sleep disturbance (i.e., sleep restriction, stimulus control,&#xD;
      systematic light exposure) simultaneously for six weeks. Participants will then complete&#xD;
      semi-structured individual interviews to provide feedback about barriers to and facilitators&#xD;
      of intervention adherence. Results of Part 1 will inform the design and delivery of the&#xD;
      candidate components in Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, a 2^3 full factorial design will be followed to randomize 80 gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      survivors to one of eight six-week intervention conditions reflecting all possible&#xD;
      combinations of the three candidate intervention components.&#xD;
