  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this modern era, Text Neck is a new term used to describe neck pain and associated damage&#xD;
      caused by continuous flexed posture due to excessive use of smartphones for a long time. The&#xD;
      term text neck was first introduced by Dr. Dean L. Fishman, who is US based chiropractor.&#xD;
      Text neck can also be described as overuse syndrome caused by repetitive stress on neck due&#xD;
      to prolonged flexion. There is coordinated work between cervical spine and surrounding&#xD;
      structure such as muscles, ligament, nerves and bones. In addition, any nerve compression at&#xD;
      cervical spine leads to radiating pain in neck, shoulder and arm. Previous literature&#xD;
      reported use of cell phone is very common in population of 18 to 44 years of age. Seventy&#xD;
      nine percent (79%) population have smartphone with them all the time. Technology has become&#xD;
      essential part of modern lifestyle. Sustained flexed posture forces the head to exert weight&#xD;
      on neck of varying degrees. Weight of neutral head is 10 to 12 pounds and increases 6 times 1&#xD;
      inch forward movement of head. Children are at higher risk because of their large head size.&#xD;
      This study will be a Randomized clinical trial with objective to reduce neck pain and&#xD;
      disability in patients with text neck syndrome. Two groups will be designed, in one group&#xD;
      ElDOA (n=20) and in other group post facilitation technique (n=20) will be applied. Patients&#xD;
      will be recruited into two groups by consecutive sampling by non-replacement lottery method&#xD;
      with equal no. of chits. Patients will be assessed by Numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), Neck&#xD;
      disability index (NDI), smartphone addiction scale before and after treatment. Both groups&#xD;
      will receive heating pad as common treatment first after that group A will be treated with&#xD;
      ELDOA and group B will be treated with Post-facilitation. Session of 6 weeks with 3 days per&#xD;
      week will be conducted. After that post treatment assessment will be done.&#xD;
