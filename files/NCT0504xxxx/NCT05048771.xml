  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: When a cancer is diagnosed in a child, the urgency is to take therapeutic&#xD;
      actions. Children and their families face the reality of cancer and the reality of the&#xD;
      treatments that, in addition to be overwhelming, might cause infertility. Immediately after&#xD;
      the diagnosis, a fertility preservation consultation is proposed to discuss fertility&#xD;
      preservation options. In practice, it is often difficult to organize.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several years after the end of treatments, a second information consultation is proposed to&#xD;
      inform about fertility, evaluate the fertility status and propose a second line of Fertility&#xD;
      Preservation when possible. The literature reflects a lack of knowledge regarding the degree&#xD;
      of fertility-related distress among pediatric cancer patients as well as insufficient tools&#xD;
      at the disposal of medical doctors and nurses to discuss about reproduction with children and&#xD;
      young adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project objective: Understand how young cancer patients and their parents felt about&#xD;
      sterility risk at the diagnostic time and now as cured adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients &amp; Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      300 patients (15-25 years) from 5 different centers (20 patients per year and per center for&#xD;
      3 years) will be included in this study at the information consultation. They will be&#xD;
      surveyed through self-administered questionnaires and semidirected interviews that will 1)&#xD;
      retrieve perceptions and emotional being of children during the fertility preservation&#xD;
      consultation; 2) assess the decision-making process of parents and family since the fertility&#xD;
      preservation consultation through the patient's speech; 3) interview the patients about&#xD;
      personal history and experience of cancer and consequences of potential fertility impairment&#xD;
      and 4) survey the current experience and projections in the future and evaluate their&#xD;
      reaction to the proposition of a second line of Fertility Preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: what points should the doctor / psychologist discuss with pediatric cancer&#xD;
      survivors in response to their fertility stress? and how to do it? for better initial and&#xD;
      follow-up care to improve their quality of life after cancer.&#xD;
