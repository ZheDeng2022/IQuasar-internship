  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Improvement of patients' care and outcome is largely based on development and validation of&#xD;
      drugs and technologies, especially in rapidly evolving fields as Interventional Cardiology.&#xD;
      In fact, even though the optimal efficiency of a cathlab can be influenced by Interventional&#xD;
      Cardiologist's mental workload, stress' accumulation and performance, little if any attention&#xD;
      is paid to the monitoring and optimization of his/her mental status. Electroencephalogram&#xD;
      (EEG)-based neural-interfaces are able to estimate workload, fatigue and the degree of&#xD;
      sleepiness through spectral analysis techniques. In particular, the amplitude of alpha waves&#xD;
      is a widely validated indicator of mental engagement's level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developing a low cost and highly feasible device to monitor and analyze operator's mental&#xD;
      engagement level and performance could be extremely appealing, especially considering both&#xD;
      the lack of data in literature for interventional disciplines and the recent technology&#xD;
      developments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will prospectively record and analyze Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals&#xD;
      from 5 interventional cardiologists and 2 fellows in training in all consecutive procedures&#xD;
      at Ferrara University Hospital. Considering the hypothesis of independence of the working&#xD;
      shifts, given the heterogeneity of their structure in terms of procedures' number and type&#xD;
      and their distance in time, it is then possible to assume that the same operator's&#xD;
      psycho-physical state diverges between two different acquisition days. Muse S (InteraXon;&#xD;
      Canada), a minimally invasive device paired via Bluetooth to a dedicated app, is used to&#xD;
      record EEG signals. Neurometrics will be acquired during Alpha Attenuation Protocols (AAP), a&#xD;
      sensitive test to quantify sleepiness which involves measuring alpha power during 2 cycle of&#xD;
      eye opening/closing protocol, for a total amount of 4 minutes. AAP will be recorded at the&#xD;
      beginning of the shift, before and after each procedure performed and allow to extrapolate&#xD;
      waves' power measures obtained during resting condition (AA Coefficient-eyes open (AAC-eo),&#xD;
      AAC-eyes closed (AAC-ec) and AAC-mean), related to fatigue, and AAC-ec/AAC-eo (AAC-ratio),&#xD;
      related to sleepiness. In addition, alpha-prevalence (AP) during on-task will be measured.&#xD;
      Alpha prevalence is an estimate of alpha-power. Investigators will also measure several&#xD;
      validated psychometric questionnaires: Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), Sleep Quality Scale&#xD;
      (SQS) and Profile of Mood States-Fatigue subscale (POMS-F). Heart rate variability (HRV)&#xD;
      during tasks, related to psycho-physical stress, is assessed through the square root of the&#xD;
      mean of the sum of squares of differences between adjacent normal R-R (rMSSD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Game-on project aims to describe workload, mental fatigue and sleepiness through&#xD;
      variation of psychometric and neurometric measurements during a work shift with the intent of&#xD;
      establishing determinants of error and lengthening of procedural times.&#xD;
