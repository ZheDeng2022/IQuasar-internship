        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. 18 years of age or older; 2. Symptomatic CVI subjects, Clinical Etiological&#xD;
             Anatomical Pathophysiological (CEAP) classification 4 to 6; 3. Failed at least 6&#xD;
             months of conservative therapy at some point during the course of their CVI management&#xD;
             (symptoms not adequately resolved or patient non-compliant/unable to tolerate); 4.&#xD;
             Willing and able to sign the approved informed consent form (ICF); 5. Willing to&#xD;
             comply with follow-up evaluations and protocols; 6. Deep system venous reflux&#xD;
             characterized by &gt;1 second reflux time in two contiguous vein segments (vein segments&#xD;
             defined as: proximal femoral, distal femoral, and popliteal), as assessed by DUS with&#xD;
             patient in the standing position; 7. Presence of at least two potential target sites&#xD;
             within the target vessel, which is defined as a segment within the femoral or&#xD;
             popliteal vein that is:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  not less than 7mm in luminal diameter, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  not more than 11mm in luminal diameter, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  at least 3cm long (two target sites in a row must be spaced at least 1cm apart),&#xD;
                  and&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absent severe obstructive features such as thrombus, synechiae, natural valves,&#xD;
                  major tributaries (valves can be formed opposite tributaries) or severe&#xD;
                  heterogeneous fibrotic changes of the vessel wall which, in the Investigator's&#xD;
                  opinion, would preclude formation of a valve, as preliminary assessed by DUS, and&#xD;
                  then by IVUS, while the vein is under physiologically appropriate hemodynamic&#xD;
                  pressure, with IVUS being the definitive modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  8. In the Investigator's opinion, the subject is a good candidate for treatment&#xD;
                  with the BlueLeaf System based on their symptoms, quality of life, anatomy, and&#xD;
                  the likelihood of benefit from continued conservative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Untreated significant superficial venous incompetence within 30 days of screening&#xD;
             which, in the opinion of the Investigator, may be the primary source of existing&#xD;
             symptoms; 2. A competent vein valve in any vein segment through which the device is&#xD;
             likely to be inserted, as assessed by DUS (&lt;1 second reflux time) or with contrast&#xD;
             venography (Investigator's opinion);Deep venous intervention (includes stenting) in&#xD;
             the target limb or outflow vessels within 90 days of consent; 3. Deep venous&#xD;
             intervention (includes stenting) in the target limb or outflow vessels within 90 days&#xD;
             of consent 4. Significant peripheral arterial disease with an ankle-brachial index of&#xD;
             &lt;0.70 or with incompressible vessels; 5. Contraindications to all protocol specified&#xD;
             anticoagulation options; 6. Known and uncontrolled hypercoagulopathy (i.e.&#xD;
             hypercoagulopathy that cannot be adequately managed/controlled with medication); 7.&#xD;
             Acute deep venous thrombosis (DVT) within 6 months of consent; 8. Comorbidity risks or&#xD;
             other concerns (e.g. recent cancer) which, in the opinion of the Investigator, limit&#xD;
             longevity or likelihood of complying with the protocol and its prescribed follow up or&#xD;
             would preclude the patient from open surgery in the event of a complication requiring&#xD;
             surgical intervention (e.g. severe vein laceration); 9. General contraindications to&#xD;
             local, regional or general anesthesia required for the index procedure; 10. NYHA Class&#xD;
             III or IV heart failure; 11. Active systemic infection; 12. Women on long-term oral&#xD;
             contraceptives; 13. Subject is enrolled in another clinical study that, in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator, may conflict with this study or compromise study results; 14.&#xD;
             Invasive surgical procedure within the last 90 days that in the Investigator's opinion&#xD;
             would interfere with the study procedure or results; 15. History of stroke within the&#xD;
             last 6 months; 16. Flow-limiting venous outflow obstruction central to the intended&#xD;
             target sites, defined by a common femoral vein duplex exam found to have a continuous&#xD;
             waveform without respiratory variation or a 50% or greater reduction in luminal&#xD;
             cross-sectional area on IVUS; 17. Inadequate flow into or through the target vessel&#xD;
             (Investigator's opinion); 18. Anatomy that does not support proper device access of&#xD;
             the treatment vein through the ipsilateral common femoral or femoral vein; 19. Luminal&#xD;
             diameter &lt;7 mm between the vein access site and the intended treatment site, as&#xD;
             assessed by IVUS, while the vein is under physiologically appropriate hemodynamic&#xD;
             pressure; 20. A competent vein valve in any vein segment through which the device is&#xD;
             likely to be inserted (common femoral or femoral vein) 21. Chronic renal insufficiency&#xD;
             with creatinine level of â‰¥2mg/dL; 22. Hemoglobin level &lt;9.0 mg/dL; 23. Platelet count&#xD;
             &lt;50,000 or &gt;1,000,000 per mm3; 24. Total white blood cell count &lt;3,000/mm3; 25.&#xD;
             Pregnant or lactating female; positive pregnancy test, women of childbearing potential&#xD;
             must be tested; 26. Non-ambulatory patients; 27. Patients with a history of right&#xD;
             heart failure occurring as a consequence of, for example, biventricular failure,&#xD;
             intrinsic pulmonary disease, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension, and other&#xD;
             etiologies that result in elevated right-sided pressures.&#xD;
