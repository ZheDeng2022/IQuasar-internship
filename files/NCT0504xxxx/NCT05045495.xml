    <textblock>
      An adult pilot study to establish the normal reference range and optimal cutoffs for the oral&#xD;
      50g Sucrose Challenge Test (SCT) and the 50g 13C-Sucrose Breath Test (CBT) for patients with&#xD;
      CSID and healthy controls. This study will enroll 120 healthy controls and 50 CSID patients.&#xD;
      No study drug will be administered during this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to mimic the real-world diagnostic setting for these tests, this study will be&#xD;
      conducted virtually using a central site with telemedicine capabilities and electronic data&#xD;
      capture software to collect data in real time via a mobile app. Subject will complete 3&#xD;
      visits within 21 days. Eligible subjects will undergo the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 50g 13C-Sucrose Breath Test (CBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Sucrose Intolerance Hydrogen Methane Breath Test (HBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sucrose Challenge Test (SCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Buccal swab for CSID Genetic Testing (GT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to establish the reference/normal ranges and optimal cutoff values for the&#xD;
      SCT and CBT.&#xD;
