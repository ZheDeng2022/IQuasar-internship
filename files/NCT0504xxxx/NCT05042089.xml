      The investigators aimed to evaluate the role of some findings that can be detected in&#xD;
      preoperative radiological imaging of kidney masses in predicting locally advanced disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is one of the most common urinary system cancers and accounts for&#xD;
      3% of all cancers. With the frequent use of imaging methods most renal masses are detected&#xD;
      localized. The standard treatment option in localized RCC is radical nephrectomy (RN) or&#xD;
      nephron-sparing surgery (NSS). NSS is preferred when appropriate in patients with tumor stage&#xD;
      1 (T1) and has been shown to be comparable to RN in terms of oncologic outcomes. Although&#xD;
      there is no prospective randomized study comparing NSS with RN in terms of oncological and&#xD;
      renal functions in T2 patients, there are retrospective studies conducted to date. According&#xD;
      to the current European urology guideline, the standard approach in patients with T2 and&#xD;
      above is RN. Pre-operative clinical staging is performed with computed tomography (CT) or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and patients may develop local recurrence despite surgical&#xD;
      procedures based on clinical stage. Pre-operative the patient and in the management of local&#xD;
      disease. In clinical practice, pre-operative CT and MRI provide information about tumor size,&#xD;
      tumor localization, presence of tumor invasion into vascular structures and adjacent organs.&#xD;
      However, apart from these frequently reported findings, there are CT and MRI findings that&#xD;
      can be used to predict advanced disease. In the 2017 Tumor, node, metastasis (TNM)&#xD;
      classification, invasion of the pelvicalyceal system, perirenal or renal sinus fat invasion&#xD;
      has been included in the T3a category. There are studies evaluating predictive value of CT to&#xD;
      indicate renal sinus fat or perirenal fat invasion. Although not in the standard TNM&#xD;
      classification, it has been shown that renal capsule invasion is an independent prognostic&#xD;
      variable for advanced disease and can be detected on CT. On the other hand, it has been&#xD;
      indicated that thickening of the Gerota's fascia, the presence of enlarged collateral&#xD;
      vessels, and the presence of intra-tumoral necrosis may be imaging findings that can be used&#xD;
      to predict advanced disease. The investigators think that the markers evaluated so far in&#xD;
      pre-operative imaging and some additional markers may predict advanced disease in RCC. The&#xD;
      investigators also think that the predictive value of MRI may be higher than CT. Therefore,&#xD;
      in this study the investigators evaluated some predictive features (Renal capsule invasion,&#xD;
      perirenal fat invasion, thickening of the Gerota's fascia, presence of enlarged collateral&#xD;
      vessels, tumor necrosis, perinephric stranding) of pre-operative computed tomography and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging for advanced disease in renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
