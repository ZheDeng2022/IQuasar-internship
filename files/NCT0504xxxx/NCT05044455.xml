  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who have recovered from Postpartum Depression and are well now, receive training to&#xD;
      teach a 9 week Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) treatment to women who are feeling&#xD;
      depressed after giving birth in the last year. Eligible women are randomly assigned to one of&#xD;
      two groups. Women in one group will receive a 9 week group CBT treatment delivered online by&#xD;
      the trained Peer Leaders. Women in the other group will not receive the CBT group treatment&#xD;
      and will continue to receive treatment as usual or regular care for new mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in both groups will complete online questionnaires three times - when participants&#xD;
      start the study, nine weeks later and six months after that. Participant information will&#xD;
      help determine if the CBT treatment is helpful for postpartum depression.&#xD;

      Women who meet the eligibility criteria for the study (18+ years of age, with a baby under 12&#xD;
      months of age at recruitment, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score of 10+ and&#xD;
      living in Hamilton/Brant/Haldimand/Niagara/Halton regions) are screened using the Mini&#xD;
      International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Women free of bipolar, psychotic or current&#xD;
      substance use disorders and borderline personality disorder are randomized 1:1 to the&#xD;
      experimental (online 9 week peer-delivered CBT program) or control group (treatment as usual,&#xD;
      TAU) after providing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Treatment Group receive a 9 week on-line CBT group (2 hrs weekly)&#xD;
      delivered by Peer Leaders who are women who have recovered from Postpartum Depression (PPD)&#xD;
      and have been trained to deliver CBT. Participants may also continue to receive treatment as&#xD;
      usual (medication, psychotherapy), or typical care, for new mothers from any source&#xD;
      (healthcare providers, etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the Control Group do not receive the CBT group and are given a list of&#xD;
      resources for mental health and postpartum depression supports and are also encouraged to&#xD;
      seek treatment as usual or typical care for new mothers from any source. Participants will&#xD;
      also receive follow up emails monthly with information about when to seek emergency treatment&#xD;
      (if symptoms worsen, experience thoughts of self-harm or harm to the participant's baby).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive personalized emails with links to participant's online&#xD;
      questionnaires through REDCap at 3 time points (recruitment, nine weeks later and 6 months&#xD;
      later). The data from both groups will be examined to determine treatment effects and&#xD;
      durability, respectively.&#xD;

    <description>The Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire (PBQ) is a 25-item maternal-report measure that assesses four aspects of maternal-infant relations: (1) bonding, (2) rejection and anger towards the infant, (3) infant-focused anxiety and (4) incipient abuse. Subscales 1-3 will be explored as a continuous outcome using subscale total score. Each item is scored on a scale of 0-5, with higher scores suggestive of more problems. Mother-infant bonding will be measured as a continuous and dichotomous outcome, using cut-off scores for each subscale indicating bonding disorders. Cutoff values of 12 for the bonding subscale, 17 for rejection and anger, and 10 for infant-focused anxiety have been proposed to define bonding disorders in each category.</description>

    <description>The immediate treatment group will receive an online 9 week CBT intervention led by trained peers who have themselves recovered from postpartum depression. The CBT group will be two hours long, weekly and involves teaching and practice of core CBT skills. Core cognitive skills including thought records and cognitive restructuring are introduced and practiced from week 1. Behavioural techniques are introduced at week 2 and continue throughout the group, including behavioural activation, relaxation techniques, sleep strategies, exercise and goal setting. Each participant will receive a professionally design CBT manual to facilitate learning. Participants in the treatment group may also receive typical care or treatment as usual for new mothers.</description>
