      The 4-month daily regimen containing moxifloxacin (2HRZEM 7 / 2HRM7) of ICMR-NIRT was studied&#xD;
      in 321 sputum positive pulmonary TB patients in a randomised clinical trial. Of the 321,&#xD;
      there were 96% with sputum smear grading of 2+/3+ and 80% with &gt;2 zone involvement in the&#xD;
      chest radiograph, The sputum culture conversion at the end of intensive phase was 94%,&#xD;
      favourable response at the end of treatment of 92% and the TB recurrence rate was 4.1%. The&#xD;
      regimen was safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of a 33% reduction in treatment duration are manifold in terms of financial&#xD;
      and other administrative implications. As the next logical step investigators believe that&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this shortened regimen that proved successful in our study needs to be&#xD;
      tested in the field. Under NTEP the anti-TB drugs are offered as Fixed dose Combination&#xD;
      (FDC).3 The HREZ intensive phase and HRE continuation phase FDC are administered to patients&#xD;
      based on body weight category. If our proposed study proves successful, the addition of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin tablet to the FDC of anti-TB drugs in the intensive and continuation phases of&#xD;
      treatment would be feasible under TB program settings. Investigators propose to evaluate&#xD;
      4-month moxifloxacin containing daily regimen [2 months of HRZEM daily / 2 months of HREM&#xD;
      daily (2 HRZEM 7 / 2HREM7)] in the treatment of newly diagnosed sputum smear positive&#xD;
      pulmonary TB patients.&#xD;

      Scientific rationale The 4-month daily regimen containing moxifloxacin (2HRZEM 7 / 2HRM7) of&#xD;
      ICMR-NIRT was studied in 321 sputum positive pulmonary TB patients in a randomised clinical&#xD;
      trial.7 Of the 321, there were 96% with sputum smear grading of 2+/3+ and 80% with &gt;2 zone&#xD;
      involvement in the chest radiograph, The sputum culture conversion at the end of intensive&#xD;
      phase was 94%, favourable response at the end of treatment of 92% and the TB recurrence rate&#xD;
      was 4.1%. The regimen was safe and well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of a 33% reduction in treatment duration are manifold in terms of financial&#xD;
      and other administrative implications. As the next logical step investigators believe that&#xD;
      the effectiveness of this shortened regimen that proved successful in our study needs to be&#xD;
      tested in the field. Under NTEP the anti-TB drugs are offered as Fixed dose Combination&#xD;
      (FDC). The HREZ intensive phase and HRE continuation phase FDC are administered to patients&#xD;
      based on body weight category. If our proposed study proves successful, the addition of&#xD;
      moxifloxacin tablet to the FDC of anti-TB drugs in the intensive and continuation phases of&#xD;
      treatment would be feasible under TB program settings. Investigators propose to evaluate&#xD;
      4-month moxifloxacin containing daily regimen [2 months of HRZEM daily / 2 months of HREM&#xD;
      daily (2 HRZEM 7 / 2HREM7)] in the treatment of newly diagnosed sputum smear positive&#xD;
      pulmonary TB patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the TB recurrence free cure rate among microbiologically confirmed new pulmonary&#xD;
      tuberculosis (PTB) patients treated under NTEP with the 4-month moxifloxacin containing daily&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the Adverse drug reactions (ADR) with the 4-month moxifloxacin containing&#xD;
           daily regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine to response to treatment with the 4-month moxifloxacin containing daily&#xD;
           regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To store paired samples of culture isolates of patients with TB recurrence for future&#xD;
           genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sites: Nagpur, Lucknow, Delhi, Hyderabad, Vellore (5 sites) Study population: Newly&#xD;
      diagnosed adult sputum smear and or CBNAAT positive PTB patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculated was 550 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening assessments Clinical evaluation, Laboratory evaluations will be done initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positive sputum isolates at baseline and at the time of TB recurrence will be sent to&#xD;
      ICMR-NIRT, Chennai for storage for future genotyping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Follow-up during treatment: During the treatment phase the patients will be&#xD;
      followed every month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up post- treatment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      During post-treatment, the patients will be followed up once in 3 months at 3, 6, 9 and 12&#xD;
      months and once every six months upto 24 months (ie. at 18 and 24 months). The 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval of the TB recurrence free cure rate will be used to conclude on the performance of&#xD;
      the 4 month moxifloxacin containing regimen under program settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment, training of staff: 2 month Duration of enrollment : 10 months Duration of&#xD;
      treatment: 4 months Follow-up period : 24 months post-treatment Data analysis and report&#xD;
      generation : 2 months Total study duration: 3.5 years&#xD;
