    <textblock>
      Psychological skills training is the mental training that can apply for increased athletes'&#xD;
      performance to make athletes more confident. The objective of psychological skill training is&#xD;
      to develop the potential of athletes to be able to show their abilities (Peak Performance),&#xD;
      and to create satisfaction, self-esteem, for athletes. Additionally, the ability to&#xD;
      concentrate and reduce anxiety could affect athletes' emotions and be ready to participate in&#xD;
      the competition. Therefore, this study will apply psychological skills training for athletes.&#xD;
      The effectiveness of psychological skill training will be measured by using quantitative EEG&#xD;
      before and after training. The quantitative EEG assessments could demonstrate an anxiety&#xD;
      level at different stages of the competition and it could reveal the changes caused by&#xD;
      training. The intervention will begin 3 months before the competition. The quantitative EEG&#xD;
      measurements are arranged 4-5 times following the previous study. The sequence of the&#xD;
      measurement will be including a baseline: one month before the competition, two weeks before&#xD;
      the competition, a week before the match, three days before the match (depend on the&#xD;
      situation), three days after the match (post-training).&#xD;
