  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beta-cryptoxanthin (BCX) is a naturally occurring member of the carotenoid family, found in a&#xD;
      wide range of fruits and vegetables. The unique biological functions of BCX have not been&#xD;
      well-established, although BCX, like other members of the carotenoids have antioxidant&#xD;
      functions. BCX, may also serve as a precursor of Vitamin A. Vitamin A has a wide range of&#xD;
      functions including maintain immunity, vision, growth and development. Whilst not specific&#xD;
      for BCX, epidemiological studies indicate that dietary intake of carotenoids may be of&#xD;
      benefit in maintaining cognitive health and reducing stress via its antioxidant,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. This pilot study aims to establish the&#xD;
      relationship between supplemental dose and circulating concentrations of BCX and related&#xD;
      carotenoids in circulation. Results obtained from this study will provide greater insight of&#xD;
      bioavailability and carotenoid metabolism, necessary for larger supplementation in selected&#xD;
      target populations.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous Singapore maternal and child health cohort study, Growing up towards healthy&#xD;
      outcomes (GUSTO), it established potentially significant health function to be significantly&#xD;
      correlated with BCX. At childbirth, mothers' blood concentrations of carotenoids, including&#xD;
      α-, β-carotene and BCX were simultaneously measured by ultra-performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography. Unique to the carotenoids, there was a correlation between higher maternal&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of BCX with lower rates of depression and reduced anxiety scores during&#xD;
      pregnancy for the mother. Furthermore, the concentrations of BCX were uniquely correlated&#xD;
      with child neurocognitive function by age 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current studies have only been food-based efficacy trials with an increase of dietary BCX&#xD;
      intake through BCX-rich foods in humans. There have been no direct assessments of risk&#xD;
      associated with BCX exposure, and current evidence in the literature does not identify any&#xD;
      consistent, substantial risks for any level of BCX supplementation. Overall, the utility of&#xD;
      BCX as a pro-vitamin A is clear, but evidence towards benefits beyond this role is&#xD;
      inconsistent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, this is a pilot study that will aim to examine bioavailability of a novel BCX&#xD;
      preparation supplemented at 2 doses (3mg and 6mg daily) versus placebo, consumed once daily&#xD;
      in a randomised, doubled-blinded parallel trial, in healthy female subjects of reproductive&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
