  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Different studies reported that CPAP is effective to prevent respiratory complication in post&#xD;
      CABG patient and have greater impact on walking time, ventilatory function and breathing&#xD;
      pattern.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The walking time (6 minute walk test), effect on arterial blood gasses and long term effects&#xD;
      of CPAP on cardiac activity, the previous studies focus only on the acute effects of CPAP&#xD;
      along with specific exercises but did not tell about the long term effects. based on these&#xD;
      finding this study is design to assess the effectiveness of CPAP in Post-op CABG patients&#xD;
      regarding there early mobilization, walking time, ABGs and Ejection Fraction as there&#xD;
      prognostic parameters in both phase-1 cardiac rehabilitation within hospital as well as in&#xD;
      long-term prognosis, is of great interest.&#xD;
