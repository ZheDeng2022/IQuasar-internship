  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify the influence of positive and negative auditory&#xD;
      cues, music and a placebo (silence) on mood and gait during 30 minutes of free walking.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to walk for a total of 30 minutes with mood being measured&#xD;
      every 5 minutes and gait measured throughout the 30 minute protocol.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to stand without an assistive device&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  This study requires subjects to stand and to walk with the Delsys monitors, thus&#xD;
                  we are unable to use subjects who cannot stand without assistive devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Delsys monitors are a wearable device that allows for comprehensive analysis of&#xD;
                  gait and balance. The sensors will be attached to the subject and they will be&#xD;
                  instructed to perform the gait test by walking for 5 minute intervals over the&#xD;
                  duration of 63 minutes. The Delsys will generate a report automatically that will&#xD;
                  then be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to walk in 5-minute intervals over the duration of 63 minutes without assistive&#xD;
             devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The objective of this study is to measure gait. Assistive devices change gait and&#xD;
                  limit our ability to measure gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  • Subjects must be within the age of 18-45&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Impairment or inability to perform physical activity (e.g. walking) independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to walk for 2 minutes without pain or discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological conditions (i.e. stroke or Parkinson's disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
             ○ Many neurological conditions can potentially alter gait. Therefore, we are&#xD;
             eliminating individuals in this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent (within 6 months) orthopedic surgery that impacts walking ability and balance,&#xD;
             e.g. total joint replacement&#xD;
&#xD;
             ○ The objective of this study is to measure gait and people with lower extremity&#xD;
             injuries may have excessive variation in gait. Hence we will be eliminating them from&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Wound or absent sensation on plantar surface (bottom) of the subject's feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ○ Subjects with this issue will have alterations and variations in gait due to sensory&#xD;
             deficits and/or pain. They will not eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visual Impairment ○ Subjects must be able to read and visually recognize words.&#xD;
             Therefore, subjects must have 20/40 (corrected) vision. Subjects who are blind cannot&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Day of testing eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not have consumed caffeine within the last 12 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have slept &gt;2 hours of their normal reported sleep time .&#xD;
