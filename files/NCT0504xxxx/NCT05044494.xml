    <textblock>
      From November 2004 to June 2020, there were more than 200 patients with acute TAAD patients&#xD;
      who underwent aortic surgery at our hospital.Of all the patients in the study period, there&#xD;
      were 34 patients (defined as study group) who sought for medical attention with symptoms for&#xD;
      several days (median 5 days, range 3-7 days) or deferred aortic surgery several days later&#xD;
      (median 3 days, range 2-7 days) even though acute TAAD was diagnosed on the same day when&#xD;
      chest pain or back pain occurred. For reducing the selection bias, propensity score matching&#xD;
      (PSM) was used to match the study group with the control group from all the patients treated&#xD;
      at our hospital during the study period. Comparison between the two groups was performed.&#xD;

      From November 2004 to June 2020, there were more than 200 patients with acute TAAD patients&#xD;
      who underwent aortic surgery at our hospital. The research protocol used in this study was&#xD;
      approved by the institutional review board of MacKay Memorial Hospital (IRB number:&#xD;
      21MMHIS005e). Of all the patients in the study period, there were 34 patients (defined as&#xD;
      study group) who sought for medical attention with symptoms for several days (median 5 days,&#xD;
      range 3-7 days) or deferred aortic surgery several days later (median 3 days, range 2-7 days)&#xD;
      even though acute TAAD was diagnosed on the same day when chest pain or back pain occurred.&#xD;
      The mean age at presentation was 60.2 +/- 13.2 years (range 33.4~83.5 years). All the&#xD;
      patients in the study group were divided into 3 groups: DP group (n=22) with acute TAAD&#xD;
      diagnosis delayed by patient but received prompt aortic surgery; DD group (n=4) with acute&#xD;
      TAAD diagnosis delayed by patient and received deferred aortic surgery; ID group (n=8) with&#xD;
      acute TAAD diagnosis on the same day when the symptoms occurred but received deferred aortic&#xD;
      surgery several days later. For reducing the selection bias, propensity score matching (PSM)&#xD;
      was used to match the study group with the control group from all the patients treated at our&#xD;
      hospital during the study period. Comparison between the two groups was performed.&#xD;

        From November 2004 to June 2020, there were more than 200 consecutive patients with acute&#xD;
        TAAD treated surgically at our hospital. Among all the acute TAAD patients, 34 patients&#xD;
        sought for medical attention with symptoms (chest pain, back pain or shortness of breath)&#xD;
        for several days or deferred aortic surgery several days later although acute TAAD was&#xD;
        diagnosed on the same day when chest pain or back pain occurred.&#xD;
