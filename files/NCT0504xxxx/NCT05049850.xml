  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether imlifidase in combination with bortezomib,&#xD;
      belatacept, rituximab and IVIg can suppress donor specific antibodies (DSA) and the&#xD;
      occurrence of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in highly sensitized patients with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease with a positive crossmatch towards their living donor during a period of 3&#xD;
      months from transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Imlifidase is an immunoglobulin G (IgG)-degrading enzyme of Streptococcus pyogenes that is&#xD;
      highly specific for IgG. The cleavage of IgG generates one F(ab')2- and one homodimeric&#xD;
      Fc-fragment and efficiently neutralizes Fc-mediated activities of IgG. Clinical studies with&#xD;
      imlifidase have demonstrated that the treatment enables transplantation in patients otherwise&#xD;
      highly unlikely to be transplanted, by converting a positive crossmatch to a negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as with other desensitization methods, DSA tend to reappear within weeks after&#xD;
      treatment and transplantation, which may cause AMR and increased risk of graft loss. In this&#xD;
      study, treatment with imlifidase in combination with approved drugs that prevent or suppress&#xD;
      DSA rebound by targeting antibody-producing plasma-cells and their B-cell precursors is&#xD;
      suggested. These drugs include (i) bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor which has activity&#xD;
      against mature plasma cells, the source of DSA, (ii) belatacept, a fusion protein which is&#xD;
      crucial in blocking T-cell co-stimulation and which is effective in reducing de novo DSA&#xD;
      generation in humans, (iii) rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that targets B-cells&#xD;
      and which is an immunomodulatory agent, and (iv) intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) which is&#xD;
      commonly used in desensitization regimens and for the treatment of AMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a 2-week screening period to determine eligibility for study&#xD;
      entry. Patients who meet the eligibility requirements will then start treatment with&#xD;
      belatacept and bortezomib about 3 weeks prior to the imlifidase infusion and transplantation.&#xD;
      Rituximab will be initiated 8 days after transplantation and IVIg 10 days after&#xD;
      transplantation. Induction and maintenance immunosuppression will also be administered. The&#xD;
      patients will be hospitalized for approximately 2 weeks following transplantation and after&#xD;
      that 9 follow-up visits to the clinic will take place up to 6 months after transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>The recurrence of DSA may cause AMR and increased risk of graft loss.&#xD;
Rebound of DSA is defined as:&#xD;
If positive flow cytometry crossmatch test (FCXM) at screening is due to low titer, non-complement binding (C1q-negative) DSAs;&#xD;
Immuno-dominant DSA: a post-transplant MFI value that is ≥50% the pre-imlifidase value OR&#xD;
Total DSAs: a post-transplant serum where ≥50% of the DSA prior to imlifidase have a MFI value ≥50% of the pre-transplant MFI value AND the sum MFI must be ≥50% of the pre-transplant value&#xD;
If FCXM at screening is due to high titer, complement binding (C1q-positive) DSAs;&#xD;
Immuno-dominant DSA: a post-transplant MFI value at 1:16 dilution that is ≥8000 MFI OR&#xD;
Total DSAs: a post-transplant 1:16 diluted serum where ≥50% of the DSA prior to imlifidase have an MFI value that is ≥50% of the pre-transplant MFI value AND the sum MFI must be ≥8000</description>
