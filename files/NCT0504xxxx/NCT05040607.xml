  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased pulmonary function, peripheral muscle strength, and exercise capacity were reported&#xD;
      in primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) in recent studies. We aimed to investigate the data&#xD;
      conducted between 10 July 2015 and 10 January 2015 of pulmonary function, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength, exercise capacity, physical fitness, and activities of daily living (ADL) in PCD&#xD;
      and healthy counterparts retrospectively at the first stage of the study and the effects of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle strength on pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength and exercise&#xD;
      capacity in PCD patients with decreased inspiratory muscle strength from the database&#xD;
      recorded between 10 July 2015 and 10 January 2015 retrospectively at the second stage of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
