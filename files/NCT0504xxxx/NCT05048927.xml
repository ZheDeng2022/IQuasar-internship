    <textblock>
      Symphony IL-6 is a device that quantitates human IL-6 by fluorescence enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      (FEIA) from whole-blood specimens. Use of Symphony IL- 6 removes the need for plasma&#xD;
      separation before testing. Symphony IL-6 comprises two components, the Symphony Fluorescence&#xD;
      Immunoanalyzer and the Symphony IL-6 Cartridge. Whole blood is added to the cartridge and&#xD;
      then up to six cartridges can be inserted into the immunoanalyzer. After 20 minutes a readout&#xD;
      and printout are given with a quantitative IL-6 concentration. The used cartridges are fully&#xD;
      enclosed and can be easily disposed of in general hospital bio-waste. Given the nature of&#xD;
      this device and its portability, there is potential for future deployment as a point-of-care&#xD;
      (POC) device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to validate an interleukin-6 (IL-6) cutoff value using the Symphony IL-6 test&#xD;
      for patients at high risk of severe sepsis caused by a COVID-19 infection&#xD;

        This study will test 48 whole blood specimens prospectively collected as baseline samples&#xD;
        after admission from confirmed COVID-19 patients at the University of Texas Southwestern&#xD;
        Medical Center. Subjects will be symptomatic and have been confirmed by an emergency use&#xD;
        authorized (EUA) real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test to&#xD;
        be COVID-19 positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The whole blood specimens will be de-identified prior to testing on the Symphony IL-6&#xD;
        system. Test results from the Symphony IL-6 system are investigational and are not to be&#xD;
        used for managing patient care. The results will not be reported to health care personnel&#xD;
        responsible for treating patients.&#xD;
