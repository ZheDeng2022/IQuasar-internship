  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the treatment efficacy of CYH33 monotherapy in&#xD;
      patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal clear&#xD;
      cell carcinoma, who received prior systemic anti-tumor treatment.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with single agent CYH33&#xD;
      significantly improves ORR compared to historical efficacy data in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent/persistent ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) harboring PIK3CA hotspot mutations&#xD;
      who received prior systemic anti-tumor treatment.&#xD;
