  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) seriously affects the quality of life of patients. During&#xD;
      treatment, it is found that patients are often accompanied by a certain degree of&#xD;
      psychological problems, such as depression, sensitivity, introversion, depression, and&#xD;
      pessimistic disappointment. Among them, anxiety and depression are the most common. Through&#xD;
      prospective observational research, statistics of the incidence of depression in inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease in our hospital, comparison of the proportions of each subtype, screening of&#xD;
      intestinal biomarkers in IBD patients with depression, and observation of inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      disease with different The type and quantity of different intestinal flora in patients with&#xD;
      severe depression, and the correlation between intestinal flora and depression.&#xD;

      The subjects voluntarily participated in the study and signed an informed consent form.&#xD;
      Follow the steps below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. When you come to the hospital or the first to second days of admission, collect general&#xD;
           information: ID number, gender, age, height, weight, BMI, complete medical history&#xD;
           including a) date of diagnosis, b) degree of disease, c) course of disease , D) previous&#xD;
           surgery, e) previous hospitalization, f) comorbidities, g) current symptoms, h)&#xD;
           extra-articular manifestations, i) endoscopic data, j) treatment drugs and other data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Scale evaluation (see Annex 1 for details): Screening related scales for anxiety and&#xD;
           depression symptoms (PHQ9, SDS, HADS, HAMA, HAMD), inflammatory bowel disease quality of&#xD;
           life scale (IBDQ), ulcerative colitis Patient's modified Mayo score/Simplified&#xD;
           questionnaire surveys for patients with Crohn's disease such as CDAI score, stool&#xD;
           characteristics, abdominal pain degree, and Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale (GSRS);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stool specimens were collected once during the visit to the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The time, frequency and precautions for patients to go to the hospital for examination&#xD;
           and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a prospective observational study. When the patient comes to the hospital or on&#xD;
      the first to the second day of admission, the subject will be given a full set of scales to&#xD;
      check once, and a stool sample will be collected during the treatment. Co., Ltd. performed&#xD;
      16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the results of the bacterial flora once. In this study, there&#xD;
      is no need for patients to come to the hospital for follow-up follow-up.&#xD;
