  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective is to demonstrate, from the initial episode of nephrotic syndrome (NS) in&#xD;
      children with standard prednisolone treatment, once complete remission has occurred, that the&#xD;
      use of Broncho-Vaxom (administration for 6 months) may reduce the risk of subsequent relapse&#xD;
      during 12-month of follow-up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NS is the most frequent glomerular disease in children. Between 80% and 90% of children with&#xD;
      steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) will relapse following an initial response to&#xD;
      corticosteroids. Half of these children will experience frequent relapses (FRNS) or become&#xD;
      steroid-dependent (SDNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection is the most common and serious complication in children with NS. More than 80%&#xD;
      patients had infections before relapse. The results of multiple observational studies and&#xD;
      randomized control trials have shown that Broncho-Vaxom, a lysate of 8 common bacterial&#xD;
      respiratory pathogens, is safe and effective to prevent infections in children. To the&#xD;
      investigators' knowledge, Broncho-Vaxom has never been investigated for the initial episode&#xD;
      of NS with the aim to reduce the subsequent risk of relapse that is a major concern in the&#xD;
      management of children with NS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 1-18 years with the first episode of the SSNS will be treated with&#xD;
      Broncho-Vaxom for 6 months. The prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day (maximum 60 mg in&#xD;
      single or divided doses) for 6 weeks, followed by 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg) as a single&#xD;
      morning dose on alternate days for the next 6 weeks; therapy is then discontinued.&#xD;
