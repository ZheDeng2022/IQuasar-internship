      Title: PeAF-Box. Feasibility, Safety and Efficacy of Isolating the Left Atrial Posterior Wall&#xD;
      (PWI) added to Pulmonary Vein Isolation (PVI) as First-Line Strategy in Treatment of&#xD;
      Persistent Atrial Fibrillation (PeAF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A prospective, observational, single center, unblinded, clinical study with 3 years&#xD;
      of follow-up and two interventional procedures: An index ablation procedure and a&#xD;
      reassessment/ reablation procedure after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: In patients with PeAF the effect of first-line ablation with pulmonary vein&#xD;
      isolation (PVI) is smaller than in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), where&#xD;
      PVI alone is effective in reducing symptoms and increasing quality of life. Adding PWI to PVI&#xD;
      is increasingly used despite concerns about safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: (1) To use PVI + PWI as first-line ablation-strategy in participants with PeAF&#xD;
      and to assess the feasibility of obtaining that goal. (2) To assess the safety of applying&#xD;
      this lesion set - in terms of heat-induced injury to the esophagus - using esophagoscopy. 3)&#xD;
      To asses arrhythmia burden using continuous monitoring for 3 years after ablation. (4) To&#xD;
      assess the durability of the PVI + PWI lesion set by a relook/ reablation procedure after 6&#xD;
      months. (5) To follow the effect of PVI + PWI on participants' quality of life over three&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study site: Dept of Cardiology - Electrophysiology Laboratory, Gentofte Hospital, University&#xD;
      of Copenhagen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: 24 patients referred for ablation of PeAF are asked for informed consent&#xD;
      for these elements that surpass standard treatment in PeAF: (1) Taking amiodarone for 3 weeks&#xD;
      prior to the index procedure to 3 weeks after the procedure, (2) Additional ablation with PWI&#xD;
      compared to standard first-line therapy with PVI only. (3) Implantation of an implantable&#xD;
      cardiac monitor (ICM), (4) Post-procedure esophagoscopy, (5) Regular clinic visits for 3&#xD;
      years post procedure, (6) Undergoing an interventional relook/ reablation procedure 6 months&#xD;
      after the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticoagulation drugs during the procedure and follow up: To prevent thromboses participants&#xD;
      are prescribed periprocedural oral anticoagulant treatment to be continued for shorter or&#xD;
      longer/lifelong periods according to the participants' risk of thrombosis (the CHA2DS2-VASC&#xD;
      score).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-arrhythmic drugs (AADs): Except from periprocedural amiodarone treatment, no AADs are&#xD;
      allowed during the follow-up apart from occurrence of otherwise untreatable arrhythmias.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The PeAF - Box study is observational and investigates single procedure PVI+PWI. Adding PWI to PVI substantially increases the amount of ablation close to the esophagus raising concerns of the risk of esophageal thermal injury. Accordingly, the study includes a formal analysis of the safety of PVI+PWI in terms of risk of esophageal thermal injury. The study includes 24 participants based on power calculations showing that at least 23 participants were required to illustrate a non-inferior risk of inducing esophageal thermal injury by PVI+PWI compared to relevant recently published data.</intervention_model_description>
