      To investigate whether high-dose vitamin D supplementation may have a beneficial effect on&#xD;
      secondary prevention in preschool children (1-5 years of age), with respiratory infections&#xD;
      being the primary cause of acute exacerbations with asthma-like symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways with a variable, reversible airway&#xD;
      obstruction and hyper-reactivity in the airways. The disease results in intermittent episodes&#xD;
      with asthma-like symptoms such as difficulty breathing with wheezing, dyspnoea, chest&#xD;
      tightness and coughing. These episodes occur in connection with upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections, physical activity and can be triggered by airborne allergens and by high particle&#xD;
      load in the environment, including pollutants and tobacco smoke. The prevalence of asthma has&#xD;
      more than doubled in the Western world, as well as in the societies that have embraced the&#xD;
      Western world in recent decades. Currently, half of younger children experience asthma-like&#xD;
      symptoms, 20% have recurrent symptoms, and by school age, 10% of children are diagnosed with&#xD;
      asthma. Asthma and asthma-like symptoms are currently the primary cause of chronic use of&#xD;
      medication and hospitalization of younger children, and have a major negative impact on&#xD;
      children and their families, and also carry a significant socio-economic burden on society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preschool children who suffer from asthma and asthma-like symptoms have the highest rate of&#xD;
      acute visits to a child's clinic compared to older children with asthma, and one in three&#xD;
      requires real hospitalization in this regard. Most acute exacerbations with asthma-like&#xD;
      symptoms in younger children are triggered by viral or bacterial upper respiratory tract&#xD;
      infections, which are associated with poorer response to oral corticosteroids (OCS). OCS is&#xD;
      currently one of the few options for the treatment of exacerbations in younger children&#xD;
      (tertiary prevention). Preventive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) as monotherapy or with the&#xD;
      addition of oral leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) is effective in achieving daily&#xD;
      symptom control in preschool children with asthma and asthma-like symptoms (secondary&#xD;
      prevention). However, up to 50% still experience acute exacerbations with asthma-like&#xD;
      symptoms that require OCS treatment and / or hospitalization. At present, there are no&#xD;
      official clinical guidelines describing step-up treatment with regard to to improve secondary&#xD;
      prevention; in particular, there is a lack of intervention opportunities with regard to to&#xD;
      reduce the high morbidity associated with acute asthma-like symptoms, which is therefore a&#xD;
      major deficiency in the clinical management of this age group of vulnerable children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous trials with vitamin D supplements A systematic review with 2016 meta-analysis,&#xD;
      involving randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of vitamin D supplementation for&#xD;
      patients with asthma, showed that vitamin D supplementation significantly reduced the rate of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations requiring OCS by 36% (relative rate (RR) 0.64, 658 adults / 22 preschool&#xD;
      children) and acute visits to child reception or real hospitalizations with 61% (odds ratio&#xD;
      (OR) 0.39, 664 adults / 277 school children / 22 preschool children). As there are few RCTs,&#xD;
      and in these there is an under-representation of preschool children, great heterogeneity in&#xD;
      vitamin D dose and concomitant ICS therapy, there was not enough power in the meta-analysis&#xD;
      to examine subgroup differences, especially among younger children. It is therefore still&#xD;
      unclear about patient characteristics such as age, baseline level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin&#xD;
      D (25OHD), genetic variations in vitamin D metabolism and / or treatment characteristics such&#xD;
      as vitamin D treatment plan, including e.g. use of bolus versus no bolus, duration of&#xD;
      treatment and form of administration influence the extent of the positive effect of vitamin D&#xD;
      on acute asthma-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric RCTs have subsequently been performed, but none that have included preschool&#xD;
      children. Currently, there are 7 published pediatric studies with relatively few included&#xD;
      trial participants (n = 22-430). In the currently published RCTs, there is only one where the&#xD;
      included children are of preschool age, which is a pilot study on the safety of vitamin D&#xD;
      treatment of acute viral-induced asthma (DIVA). In the DIVA pilot study, 22 preschool&#xD;
      children were randomized to an oral bolus of vitamin D of 100,000 international units (IU) (~&#xD;
      250 μg) plus 400 IU / day (~ 10 μg / day) for 6 months or placebo. The treatment was safe and&#xD;
      resulted in significantly increased serum 25OHD to a level&gt; 75 nmol / L. However, the study&#xD;
      did not have enough power to show a difference in acute doctor visits based on acute&#xD;
      asthma-like symptoms. Apart from the so-called DIVA RCT (NCT03365687), there are no other&#xD;
      registered RCTs regarding vitamin D supplementation for preschool children with acute&#xD;
      asthma-like symptoms registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Therefore, there is a need for a study&#xD;
      that includes preschoolers who have enough power to show whether vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
      improves the secondary prevention of acute asthma-like symptoms by reducing the number of&#xD;
      exacerbations and the need for OCS and / or hospitalization, independent of baseline serum&#xD;
      25OHD levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential mechanisms of vitamin D in acute asthma-like symptoms It is important to&#xD;
      investigate the potential mechanisms of action of the possible protective role of vitamin D&#xD;
      against acute asthma-like symptoms. These may be dependent on specific asthma phenotypes&#xD;
      where vitamin D supplementation is more effective. A subgroup analysis from a 2017&#xD;
      meta-analysis of individual participant data from 25 RCTs showed that vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation significantly reduced the risk of acute upper respiratory tract infections by&#xD;
      40% (OR 0.60; 513 children) in a group of children aged 1- Sixteen years. This may suggest&#xD;
      that vitamin D supplementation in particular may have a beneficial effect on secondary&#xD;
      prevention in preschool children, with respiratory infections being the primary cause of&#xD;
      acute exacerbations with asthma-like symptoms. Vitamin D coordinates the functions of the&#xD;
      immune system both by inducing and by inhibiting inflammation as well as by modulating&#xD;
      inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of the cells of the immune system. In most tissues&#xD;
      exposed to infection or an allergen, the expression of the enzyme CYP27B1, which converts&#xD;
      25OHD to the active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, is induced. The active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D&#xD;
      binds to the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which regulates the transcription of many genes,&#xD;
      including several associated with the smooth muscle cells of the bronchi, which may explain&#xD;
      the observed association between serum 25OHD and airway reactivity. A study involving a&#xD;
      similar patient group of infants with acute asthma symptoms found that gene expression was&#xD;
      associated with vitamin D levels and was a predictor of later asthma, supporting the&#xD;
      hypothesis that vitamin D plays a role in asthma at this age and that gene Expression can be&#xD;
      an important biomarker for the effect of treatment. An immunomodulatory and synergistic&#xD;
      effect of vitamin D on ICS treatment response and thus on airway inflammation may also be&#xD;
      present, which is supported by observational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone health status improves when serum 25OHD is&gt; 75 nmol / L, which is equivalent to&#xD;
      sufficient vitamin D status. However, the 25OHD threshold for optimal immunological,&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and respiratory function is unknown, but it is likely to be higher. In&#xD;
      addition, genetic variation in the GC gene, which encodes vitamin D binding protein, plays a&#xD;
      role in the level of 25OHD in the blood, which thus plays a role in the amount of vitamin D&#xD;
      available in the target tissue. Research into vitamin D levels and the impact of&#xD;
      immunological and inflammatory processes will increase the understanding of the mechanisms of&#xD;
      action on acute asthma-like symptoms.&#xD;

        episode will be defined as annoying coughing, wheezing (wheezing or wheezing in connection&#xD;
        with exhalation) and / or dyspnoea, which affects the child's well-being and requires&#xD;
        hospitalization in a pediatric ward. Participation in the study requires that the child is&#xD;
        in or has been in treatment with SABA, as monotherapy, or in combination with ICS, and&#xD;
        possibly also in combination with LTRA in accordance with the Danish guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The child is hospitalized with pneumonia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child's daily intake of vitamin D supplementation is&gt; 400 IU / day (~ 10 μg /&#xD;
             day).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is given a combination of vitamin and dietary supplements containing vitamin&#xD;
             D, thus the daily recommended dose is exceeded, as 2400 IU / day (~ 60 μg / day) is&#xD;
             accepted for children aged 1-4 years, as everyone here is recommended to take 400 IU /&#xD;

          -  The baby has been exclusively breastfed for the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is malnourished&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  for children&gt; 2 years of age whose age-specific BMI is less than the 3rd&#xD;
                  percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  for children &lt;2 years, whose weight or height in relation to age is less than the&#xD;
                  3rd percentile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child is a newly arrived refugee or immigrant from regions with a high risk of&#xD;
             rickets.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The child has other chronic lung diseases.&#xD;
