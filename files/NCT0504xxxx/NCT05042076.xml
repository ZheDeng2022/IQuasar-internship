  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of viral-specific T cells (VST)&#xD;
      against BK Virus (BKV) in adult kidney transplant recipients. Participants are expected to be&#xD;
      on study for 52 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral infections, or their reactivation in the immunocompromised host, remain serious&#xD;
      complications that adversely affect outcomes of transplantation. These infections may be&#xD;
      refractory to pharmacologic treatment and result in increased morbidity and mortality after&#xD;
      transplantation. Furthermore, the available pharmacologic therapies can result in severe&#xD;
      toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once an infection occurs, adequate immune reconstitution is decisive for recovery from viral&#xD;
      disease after kidney transplantation. The present trial will consist of the treatment of&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients diagnosed with severe BK infection as defined by a viral load ≥&#xD;
      250 copies/mL and BKN, with virus-specific, antigen-selected T cells using the CliniMACS®&#xD;
      Prodigy System. BK-specific T cells will be isolated from donor leukapheresis products using&#xD;
      the CliniMACS® Prodigy. Prior studies on transfer of CMV-specific T cells have been shown to&#xD;
      be safe and efficacious in the treatment of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, so the same&#xD;
      methods will be used to transfer BK-specific T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main trial objective is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of BK-specific T-cell&#xD;
      transfer in adult patients suffering from BK infections following kidney transplantation. The&#xD;
      incubation with viral antigens (MACS Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) PepTivator) allows the&#xD;
      enrichment of BK-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Increasing evidence of the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of CMV-specific T-cell is available. Furthermore, the safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      specific manufacturing approach using the fully automated protocol of the CliniMACS® Prodigy&#xD;
      for the isolation of CMV-specific T cells against CMV has been described and has demonstrated&#xD;
      that these cells retain their biological properties. Based on the CMV data, the investigators&#xD;
      believe BK-specific T cells will follow the same pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Overview&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase I, open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment&#xD;
      study will assess the safety and tolerability of transfer of BK-specific T cells isolated&#xD;
      from a leukapheresis product. Secondary objectives will focus on the feasibility and efficacy&#xD;
      of the BK-specific T-cell transfer. The Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) will be&#xD;
      generated automatically by the CliniMACS® Prodigy using the CliniMACS Cytokine Capture System&#xD;
      (IFNγ) after incubation with MACS GMP PepTivator® BKV LT &amp; VP1 for enrichment of&#xD;
      virus-specific T-cells in adult patients suffering from BK infections following kidney&#xD;
      transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be assessed by determining the incidence and severity of acute&#xD;
      infusion-related toxicities, incidence and severity of acute rejection of the kidney&#xD;
      allograft, occurrence and time to newly occurring acute GVHD grade ≥1 until Week 12 after&#xD;
      T-cell transfer, and aggravation of pre-existing acute GVHD grade ≥1 until Week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of BK virus specific T-cells will be assessed by determining the successful&#xD;
      production of BK-VST from donors on an intent-to-treat basis, measuring dropout rate and&#xD;
      reasons for drop out as well as time from patient inclusion to administration of the IMP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by determining the number of patients and time to reaching ≥1 log&#xD;
      decrease in BK viral load, number of patients with BK clearance, time to BK clearance, and&#xD;
      number of patients with resolution of clinical BK organ disease by Week 12. Number of BK&#xD;
      reactivations following BK viral clearance and overall survival (OS) will be determined at&#xD;
      Week 52.&#xD;
