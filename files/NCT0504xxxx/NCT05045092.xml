      Descriptive study of two-year follow-up outcomes of surviving neonates who are enrolled in&#xD;
      the Chinese Neonatal Extracorporeal Life Support Registry (Chi-NELS) from 2022 to 2024.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe the six -month, one-year and two-year neurodevelopmental outcomes&#xD;
      of survivors of neonatal ECLS treatment in the Chi-NELS. The study population will be&#xD;
      neonates who receive ECLS support within 28 days of life and are enrolled in the Chi-NELS.&#xD;
      These infants will be prospectively followed for two years. Mortality, growth, and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcomes will be assessed at six months, one year and two years.&#xD;
