      Existing problem with DR TB management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injectable regimens for longer duration with toxicity Poor adherence, treatment failures,&#xD;
      continued transmission&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral regimens of shorter duration Improved treatment adherence Implementation of&#xD;
      community-based models of care Reduction in direct costs and indirect costs of patients&#xD;
      Improved treatment outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Need for shorter, tolerable and effective regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence modified BPaL regimen is designed to study the newer shorter oral in varying doses of&#xD;
      Linezolid for pre XDR Tb patients and MDR TI/NR patients&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The regimen proposed is based on the NIX-TB and ZeNIX trial regimen with modification in the&#xD;
      Linezolid doses. The rationale is -&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. While the EBA study showed that a modestly greater bactericidal effect over 14 days at&#xD;
           the highest 1200 mg daily, this dose appears to be associated with a greater incidence&#xD;
           of neuropathic and myelosuppressive effects than the 600 mg daily dose in the NIXTB&#xD;
           trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Linezolid EBA study showed similar bactericidal activity over 14 days irrespective of&#xD;
           the single daily dose or twice-daily doses. A single daily dose will enhance patient&#xD;
           adherence and will reduce the total time of exposure to the drug concentration that is&#xD;
           greater than the calculated concentration associated with mitochondrial toxicity (likely&#xD;
           mechanism for the toxicities of peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. While a full 6 months of linezolid therapy in the regimen may give greater culture&#xD;
           conversion and avoid relapse, the mouse model found that linezolid dosing only for one&#xD;
           or two months, when B and Pa were given continuously for a total of 3 months, maximized&#xD;
           relapse-free cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. More than 2 months of linezolid, when combined with B and Pa, does not increase&#xD;
           relapse-free cure in the mouse model. Thus, the treatment arms in this study will give&#xD;
           randomized comparative information about the optimal duration and dose of linezolid in&#xD;
           the regimen relative to efficacy and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The ZeNIX study with consistent dosing of bedaquilline and pretomanid reported 93%&#xD;
           success rate with linezolid 1200 mg for 6 months and 91% with linezolid 600mg for 6&#xD;
           months. However 2 months of 600mg linezolid showed a success rate of 84%. Adverse&#xD;
           reactions were reported in 38 % of those receiving 1200mg linezolid for 6 months, 24% of&#xD;
           those receiving 600mg of linezolid for 6 months and 13% of those receiving 600mg&#xD;
           linezolid for 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Interim analysis of BEAT study (personal communication/52nd UNION abstract) with 6 month&#xD;
           regimen of bedaquilline, delaminid, clofazimine and linezolid (600mg daily for 6 months)&#xD;
           reported 89.6% success rate at the end of 6 months of treatment. Adverse reactions such&#xD;
           as peripheral neuropathy were reported in 39% and myelosuppression in 47% of the&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Learning from ZeNIX and BEAT study, a planned reduction of Linezolid along with BDQ and&#xD;
      Pretomanid is planned as BDQ+Pa+LZD 600mg for 9 weeks followed by 300 mg for 17 weeks and&#xD;
      BDQ+Pa+LZD 600mg for 13 weeks followed by 300mg for 13 weeks. This will help in deciding the&#xD;
      effective dosing of Lzd to be combined with Bdq and Pa for drug resistant TB in the program.&#xD;
