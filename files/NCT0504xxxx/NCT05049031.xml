  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most frequently observed cancer in women in France.The mortality rate is&#xD;
      still decreasing with a decrease of 1.6% per year between 2010 and 2018, explained by the&#xD;
      improvement in available treatments.For patients with breast cancer expressing hormone&#xD;
      receptors, treatment with Tamoxifen or anti-aromatase can have the risk of the cancer coming&#xD;
      back.However, these treatments have many side effects, including the risk of osteoporosis and&#xD;
      metabolic disorders with anti-aromatases; and arterial and thromboembolic accidents with&#xD;
      Tamoxifen.These effects have been well studied while taking hormone therapy.However, very few&#xD;
      studies have analyzed the impact of these treatments after stopping them in women who have&#xD;
      had non-metastatic hormone-sensitive breast cancer and uncertainties persist on the evolution&#xD;
      of the health risk after initial treatment.&#xD;
