  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PavéDerm J-fill soft&#xD;
      dermal filler vs. Restylane® Lyft lidocaine in the treatment of moderate to severe nasolabial&#xD;
      folds.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, subject and evaluator blinded, intra-individual, split-face&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial. After subjects voluntarily give written consent to the&#xD;
      participation in the study, his/her eligibility for the study will be judged through&#xD;
      demographic and past &amp; medication history investigation and laboratory test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects eligible in the screening will be enrolled. Each patient will receive PavéDerm&#xD;
      J-Fill Soft Dermal Filler in one nasolabial fold and Restylane Lyft Lidocaine (20 mg/mL&#xD;
      Hyaluronic acid with 3 mg/ml Lidocaine hydrochloride) in the other by randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The faces of all subjects are going to be digitally photographed at rest upon every visit.&#xD;
      The identical ambient conditions will be used for all photographs and assessments. To ensure&#xD;
      blinding status, the subjects will be put on eye mask during injection. On injection day,&#xD;
      subjects will receive injections, with at least 60 minute apart, to each nasolabial fold by&#xD;
      the treating investigator. The amount of injection will be determined according to the width,&#xD;
      length, and depth of the nasolabial folds to ensure optimal correction for each subject. The&#xD;
      injected volume will not exceed 1.0 mL in ipsilateral nasolabial fold. The relevant&#xD;
      information associated with the injection of the investigational medical device will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After each injection, the treating investigator will observe subjects through 30 minutes for&#xD;
      assessment of adverse events. Subjects will be asked about adverse events at each follow-up&#xD;
      visit, and any adverse events will be documented for safety assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical efficacy will be assessed by the appropriately trained evaluator using the WSRS and&#xD;
      GAIS under blinded fashion, as well as by subjects using GAIS. Pre-treatment photographs of&#xD;
      each subject taken at the pre-treatment (baseline) will be reviewed and will be used for&#xD;
      comparison. The blinded evaluator will assess the photographs taken at each visit after the&#xD;
      study device administration (photographic assessment). All subjects will perform the&#xD;
      self-assessment by comparing their appearance in a mirror against a high-magniﬁcation&#xD;
      photograph taken at baseline at each visit after the study device administration. The mirror&#xD;
      symmetry will be reminded in all subjects. Under the explanation by the treating investigator&#xD;
      or designee, subjects will assess the satisfaction of wrinkle improvement using the GAIS&#xD;
      scoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is going to be assessed using a patient self-assessment 10-cm visual analogue scale with&#xD;
      anchors at 0 m (no pain) and 10 cm (extreme pain).&#xD;
