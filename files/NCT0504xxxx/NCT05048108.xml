  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Majority of breast cancer survivors are overweight or obese at time of diagnosis, putting&#xD;
      them at increased risk for insulin resistance and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Women with&#xD;
      insulin resistance at time of breast cancer diagnosis often have larger tumors, later stages&#xD;
      of cancer and worse prognosis. Additionally, chemotherapy often leads to increases in insulin&#xD;
      resistance and cognitive impairment. Many cancer survivors experience memory and brain&#xD;
      function decline following chemotherapy that can last for years, and insulin resistance may&#xD;
      contribute to worse cognitive outcomes in cancer survivors. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty&#xD;
      acids (PUFAs) are anti-inflammatory nutrients that may help reduce insulin resistance and&#xD;
      negative cognitive outcomes from cancer treatments. The purpose of this observational study&#xD;
      with cross-sectional design is to investigate the relationship of omega-3 PUFAs with insulin&#xD;
      resistance and cognitive function in obese breast cancer survivors. Due to the global&#xD;
      pandemic caused by the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), this study will be conducted&#xD;
      entirely remotely using electronic data collection and remote finger-stick blood sample&#xD;
      collection. The study will aim to enroll 80 racially and ethnically diverse female breast&#xD;
      cancer survivors (age 45-75) who are postmenopausal, obese, and 1 to 4 years post breast&#xD;
      cancer diagnosis. Participants will complete study questionnaires online, and some cognitive&#xD;
      tests will be completed through zoom sessions with trained study personnel. Participants will&#xD;
      be mailed kits with thorough instructions to complete fingerstick blood sample collections&#xD;
      and mail them back to the research lab. Upon receipt of blood samples and completion of all&#xD;
      study questionnaires, participation will be complete.&#xD;
