  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the safety and effectiveness of the SFM&#xD;
      Anastomosis Device when used to create a small bowel anastomosis for patients undergoing&#xD;
      ileostomy reversal as compared with a propensity-matched historic control group of patients&#xD;
      who underwent ileostomy reversal using a conventional closure technique (sutures or stapler).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm study in which clinical outcomes prospectively evaluated&#xD;
      for a minimum of 100 subjects undergoing ileostomy reversal using the SFM Anastomosis Device&#xD;
      will be 1:1 propensity score matched through nearest neighbor matching to a historical&#xD;
      control cohort of patients who underwent ileostomy reversal using conventional closure&#xD;
      techniques. In order to have a sufficient pool of retrospective patients for matching,&#xD;
      retrospective data will be collected for a minimum of 300 patients. The historical control&#xD;
      cohort will be accrued from the same pool of institutions participating in the prospective&#xD;
      study. Eligibility criteria will be standardized between the prospective investigational&#xD;
      treatment arm and the historical control. Within this analysis, propensity score (PS)&#xD;
      matching will be used to reduce bias due to potential differences in key covariates between&#xD;
      the prospective and retrospective cohorts.&#xD;

    <description>The magnets will be manually deployed into the small intestine during open surgery following creation of a mini or full laparotomy as clinically indicated. Once the desired segment of small bowel is resected, the magnet is inserted through the open ends of each bowel section. Once proper magnet position is confirmed and the bowel ends are approximated, the magnets couple to form the anastomosis.</description>
