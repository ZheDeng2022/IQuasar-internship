  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center study with the CathVision Cube® system and the PVI Analyzer&#xD;
      software in radiofrequency (RF) and cryo balloon procedures.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) who are indicated to undergo&#xD;
      first pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) procedure and meet all eligibility criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the Study. Intracardiac signals will be passively recorded using the&#xD;
      investigational CathVision Cube® System in parallel with the conventional (CE marked) EP&#xD;
      recording system. The investigational device will not be used for direct clinical care&#xD;
      decisions or therapy. The validation of the automated algorithm for PVI will be performed&#xD;
      offline&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to validate the PVI Analyzer software with a novel EP recording&#xD;
      system (CathVision Cube® System) for assisting assessment of isolation status following PVI&#xD;
      ablation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the feasibility of &quot;real-time&quot; assessment of PVI&#xD;
      analysis and rhythm dependent performance using the PVI Analyzer and CathVision Cube® System.&#xD;

    <measure>The primary performance objective is to validate the PVI Analyzer software with a novel EP recording system (CathVision Cube® System) for assessment of isolation status following PVI ablation.</measure>
    <time_frame>From EP procedure until study completion at discharge; an average of 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PVI Analyzer classification of isolation status following PVI ablation using data from the investigational CathVision Cube System. Specificity is defined as the ratio of correct negative (non-isolated) predictions among data points from non-isolated veins. Sensitivity is defined as the ratio of correct positive (isolated) data points from isolated veins. Classification is performed using recorded data before and after the isolation of each available pulmonary vein independently.</description>

    <measure>The safety endpoint of the Study will evaluate the adverse events and/or device malfunctions reported with the use of the CathVision Cube® System.</measure>

    <measure>Automated PVI Analyzer classification of PV isolation in SR by procedure</measure>
    <time_frame>From EP procedure until study completion at discharge; an average of 24 hours.</time_frame>
    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PVI Analyzer classification of isolation status within the two subgroups of Cryo-balloon ablation and Radiofrequency ablation. Sensitivity and specificity are measured in the same way as for the primary endpoint, but calculated within the subgroups of veins ablated with Cryo-balloon or Radiofrequency, respectively. Classification also follows the definition in the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>Sensitivity and specificity of PVI Analyzer classification of isolation status within the subgroup of data recorded in non-sinus rhythm.&#xD;
Non-sinus rhythm is defined as any rhythm not regarded as sinus rhythm, including atrial fibrillation, typical- and atypical atrial flutter. Sensitivity and specificity are measured in the same way as for primary endpoint. Classification follows the definition in the primary endpoint.</description>

    <description>Accuracy of PVI Analyzer classification of isolation status at different timepoints before, during and after ablation.&#xD;
The accuracy is defined as the agreement of re-classification of pairs of non-overlapping samples before, during and after ablation.</description>
