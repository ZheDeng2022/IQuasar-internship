  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While surgery is considered the only potentially curative therapy for pancreatic cancer,&#xD;
      5-year overall survival (OS) is typically &lt;25%. Following surgical resection of pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer, adjuvant conventionally fractionated RT (CRT, delivering 45-54 Gy in 1.8-2.0 Gy per&#xD;
      fraction) with 5-FU chemotherapy is recommended in high-risk patients (positive lymph nodes&#xD;
      and/or R1-R2 resection margin status). However, the benefit of CRT in this setting is&#xD;
      controversial due to lack of prospective positive data. Moreover, duration of treatment&#xD;
      course (delaying initiation of more effective chemotherapy schedules), insufficient dose&#xD;
      delivery due potential radiation-related severe toxicity to proximity organs represents a&#xD;
      serious limitation to treatment efficacy. Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) is a novel&#xD;
      radiotherapy technique consisting of highly focused irradiation with a steep dose gradient,&#xD;
      thus allowing the delivery of ablative radiation doses and significant sparing of proximity&#xD;
      critical structures. Higher doses per fraction allows for more intensive treatments and&#xD;
      shorter duration of the radiation course.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic carcinoma is expected to become in the next 10 years the second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer-related mortality. Resection is the only treatment with the potential to achieve&#xD;
      long-term survival, although expected survival at 5 year is &lt;25%: postoperative use of local&#xD;
      and systemic adjuvant treatments has been proposed to improve outcome While the efficacy of&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy, in parrticular multiagent chemotherapy, has been established, the&#xD;
      potential impact of chemoradiation in the adjuvant setting is still controversial. However,&#xD;
      its use in patients with high risk features such as nodal involvement and close or positive&#xD;
      margins may be of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjuvant chemoradiation, when clinically indicated, is usually delivered in a 6 week&#xD;
      treatment course in association with concurrent dose-adapted chemotherapy, implying the&#xD;
      necessity to interrupt more effective multi-agent chemotherapy schedules due to risk of&#xD;
      increased toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been proposed that higher radiotherapy doses may result in improved outcome although a&#xD;
      potential detrimental effect on survival of dose escalation &gt;55 Gy with conventional&#xD;
      fractionation, possibly related to increased toxicity, has been reported. Stereotactic Body&#xD;
      Radiotherapy (SBRT) is a novel radiotherapy technique consisting of highly focused&#xD;
      irradiation with a steep dose gradient, thus allowing the delivery of ablative radiation&#xD;
      doses and significant sparing of proximity critical structures. Higher doses per fraction&#xD;
      allows for more intensive treatments and shorter duration of the radiation course. In a&#xD;
      retrospective study by Rwigema et al, adjuvant pancreatic SBRT was shown to be a safe and&#xD;
      feasible treatment option for patients with high-risk pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
