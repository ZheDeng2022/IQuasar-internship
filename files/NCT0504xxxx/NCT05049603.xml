    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease&#xD;
      (GD). Based on its clinical signs and symptoms, GO is graded as mild, moderate-to-severe, or&#xD;
      severe, and active or inactive, the latter feature being established on a 5/7-scale score&#xD;
      named Clinical Activity Score (CAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Group on Graves Orbitopathy (EUGOGO) has recently formulated and published&#xD;
      up-to-date guidelines for the management of GO, according to which high dose intravenous (iv)&#xD;
      glucocorticoids (GC) (ivGC) is the first line treatment for moderate-to-severe and active GO.&#xD;
      A protective effect of atorvastatin on the development of GO in patients with GD has been&#xD;
      reported, based on which we recently conducted a phase II, randomized, open label clinical&#xD;
      trial and found that atorvastatin improves the response of GO to ivGCs in&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemic patients. The effect was unrelated to cholesterol levels, suggesting&#xD;
      that it may be the consequence of a direct action of atorvastatin. To investigate this issue&#xD;
      further and to introduce atorvastatin in the clinical practice, we designed the present Phase&#xD;
      III, double-blinded, multicenter, randomized, adaptive, superiority, no profit, clinical&#xD;
      trial to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin on Graves' Orbitopathy (GO) in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe and active GO subjected to intravenous glucocorticoid therapy, regardless&#xD;
      of cholesterol levels.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is the most common extra-thyroidal manifestation of Graves' disease&#xD;
      (GD). GO profoundly impairs the quality of life of affected patients. The pathogenesis is&#xD;
      autoimmune, reflecting cross-reactivity against antigens shared by thyroid epithelial cells&#xD;
      and orbital fibroblasts. Once the autoimmune reaction is initiated, a series of molecular&#xD;
      mechanisms involving T and B cells, antibodies, cytokines, and oxidative stress, lead to&#xD;
      fibroblast proliferation and release of glycosaminoglycans, resulting in the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of the disease, namely exophthalmos (or proptosis), soft tissue inflammation,&#xD;
      diplopia, and in the most severe cases sight reduction or loss, due to corneal damage or to&#xD;
      compression of the optic nerves, the so called optic neuropathy. Based on its clinical signs&#xD;
      and symptoms, GO is graded as mild, moderate-to-severe, or severe, and active or inactive,&#xD;
      the latter feature being established on a 5/7-scale score named Clinical Activity Score&#xD;
      (CAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The European Group on Graves Orbitopathy (EUGOGO), a scientific Society involving several&#xD;
      European Centers, including some of the Centers participating in the present study, has&#xD;
      formulated and published up-to-date guidelines for the management of GO, which is referred to&#xD;
      across the present study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to EUGOGO guidelines, high dose intravenous (iv) glucocorticoids (GC) (ivGC) is the&#xD;
      first line treatment for moderate-to-severe and active GO. The use of systemic&#xD;
      glucocorticoids takes advantage from their immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory actions,&#xD;
      resulting in an overall beneficial effect ranging from ~35 to ~60% of patients in various&#xD;
      studies. Recent studies have provided evidence for the best balance in terms of&#xD;
      effectiveness/risks for a total methylprednisolone dose of 4.5 g, given in 12 weekly&#xD;
      administrations, six of 500 and six of 250 mg, which is therefore recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides genetic and demographical variables, risk factors associated with the development of&#xD;
      GO in GD patients are known to be inadequate control of hyperthyroidism, radioiodine&#xD;
      treatment, and smoking. In a large retrospective study conducted in more than 8,000&#xD;
      individuals with GD, it was reported that treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme&#xD;
      reductase inhibitors, better known as statins, especially atorvastatin, is associated with a&#xD;
      ~40% reduced risk of developing GO in GD patients. The findings were interpreted as the&#xD;
      consequence of the anti-inflammatory action of statins, being GO an autoimmune, inflammatory&#xD;
      condition. Statins influence autophagic events and it has been shown that they induce cell&#xD;
      death of human fibroblasts through a complex mechanism involving co-regulation of apoptosis,&#xD;
      autophagy, and unfolded protein response (UPR). Thus, statins may reduce GO risk by&#xD;
      modulating both apoptosis and autophagy activities. The molecular mechanisms that determine&#xD;
      autophagy, apoptosis, and their interaction are not fully established, but the impact of&#xD;
      statins on these two processes and their interplay in different cell types may provide a&#xD;
      novel explanation for their pleiotropic effects in GO. Shih et al. found a positive&#xD;
      correlation between macrophage count in the Muller's muscle and severity of upper lid&#xD;
      retraction and concluded that the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration of Muller's muscle&#xD;
      is associated with clinical severity of upper eyelid retraction in GO. Because some statins&#xD;
      potently affect macrophage viability in vitro through the induction of apoptotic process, it&#xD;
      is plausible that the early autophagic flux induced by statin treatment may be a potential&#xD;
      mechanism to induce apoptosis of Muller's muscle infiltrating macrophages in patients with&#xD;
      GO, thus eliciting a beneficial effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a possible direct action of statins on the eye, the possibility exists that&#xD;
      the action of statins in GO may additionally reflect lowering of cholesterol. Thus, in a&#xD;
      recent cross-sectional study a direct correlation between total and LDL-cholesterol levels&#xD;
      and the presence and activity of GO in unselected patients with a GD of recent onset was&#xD;
      observed, suggesting a direct link between cholesterol and GO. In addition, LDL-cholesterol&#xD;
      was found to be a predictor of response to treatment. The mechanisms responsible for the&#xD;
      relation between the presence of GO and cholesterol may be related to the altered&#xD;
      inflammatory state of hypercholesterolemia. Thus, it is well known that disorders of lipid&#xD;
      metabolism are associated with a state of mild-to-moderate, systemic, chronic inflammation.&#xD;
      The increase load of free fatty acids on the liver, present in hyperlipemic states, causes&#xD;
      dysfunction of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes, leading to the&#xD;
      release of reactive oxygen radical species. In addition, free fatty acid can indirectly cause&#xD;
      the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α,&#xD;
      both involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms of GO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these findings, the investigators recently conducted a phase II, randomized, open&#xD;
      label, external ophthalmological investigator-blinded, pilot, clinical trial, to determine&#xD;
      whether administration of statins increases the efficacy of ivGC in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe, active GO. Atorvastatin improved the response of GO to ivGCs in&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemic patients. The effect was unrelated to cholesterol levels, suggesting&#xD;
      that it may be the consequence of a direct action of atorvastatin. To investigate this issue&#xD;
      further and to introduce atorvastatin in the clinical practice, the present Phase III,&#xD;
      double-blinded, multicenter, randomized, adaptive, superiority, no profit, clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin on Graves' Orbitopathy (GO) in patients with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe and active GO subjected to intravenous glucocorticoid therapy, regardless&#xD;
      of cholesterol levels.&#xD;
