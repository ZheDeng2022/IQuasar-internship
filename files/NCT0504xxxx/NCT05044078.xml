  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this randomized control trial is to determine the effectiveness of Autogenic&#xD;
      and Reciprocal Inhibition techniques with conventional therapy in mechanical neck pain to&#xD;
      improve Pain, Range of Motion, and Functional Disability in long term. This study is being&#xD;
      conducted at the Physiotherapy department of Sindh Institute of Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation, Karachi (former institute of Dow University of Health Sciences) among 80&#xD;
      patients with mechanical neck pain on the basis of non-probability purposive sample technique&#xD;
      with screening for study criteria through a consultant physician (blinded) . After taking&#xD;
      informed consent all participants will be randomly allocated in two groups through second&#xD;
      researcher who is not involved in screening, baseline assessment and providing intervention.&#xD;
      Group 1 will receive Autogenic Inhibition muscle energy technique (MET) with conventional&#xD;
      therapy and Group 2 will receive Reciprocal inhibition MET with conventional therapy. A total&#xD;
      of 12 sessions will be provided. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, after 1st session,&#xD;
      and at last session.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>It is a randomized control trial. Total 80 patients will be recruited, 40 in each group that includes 10 patients as a dropout in both groups. There will be one interventional group and one active comparator group. Treatment will be allocated using a random number sheet generated by statistician. Participants are assigned to one of two groups in parallel for the duration of the study.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in disability on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) at first session.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 1 day</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire has been designed to give information as to neck pain of patient has affected the ability to manage in everyday life. Patient will be asked to answer every section and mark in each section only the one box that most closely describes his or her problem. The NDI can be scored as a raw score or doubled and expressed as a percent. Each section is scored on a 0 to 5 rating scale, in which zero means 'No pain' and 5 means 'Worst imaginable pain'. Points summed to a total score.The test can be interpreted as a raw score, with a maximum score of 50, or as a percentage. The 0 points or 0% means : no activity limitations, 50 points or 100% means complete activity limitation. A higher score indicates more patient-rated disability. It is available in both English and Urdu. Minimum Detectable Change (90% confidence): 5 points or 10% points.</description>

    <description>It is an instrument that is used to measures the available Range of Motion around a joint in degrees. The investigator will appropriately place goniometer to measure the range of motions of neck (Flexion, extension, right and left lateral flexion and rotation). Lower the reading of goniometer suggests decreased in range of motion and vice versa.</description>
