      The purpose of this study is to find out if taking the drug Buspar will increase breathing&#xD;
      capacity in individuals with spinal cord injuries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chemoreceptive regulatory feedback is crucial for precise ventilatory control, especially&#xD;
      during exercise. However, individuals with high-level SCI have a reduced chemoreceptive drive&#xD;
      to breathe. Studies have shown lesser increases in minute ventilation and mouth pressure&#xD;
      during hypercapnia in those with tetraplegia. Peripheral factors rather than central factors&#xD;
      appear to cause the reduction of the ventilatory response to hypercapnia. This reduced&#xD;
      ventilatory drive may have functional impact on exercise ventilation in patients with high&#xD;
      level SCI and enhancing ventilatory drive may improve exercise ventilation in high-level SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are no treatments to overcome these functional deficits that affect daily&#xD;
      activity and exercise-based rehabilitation recovery. However, previous work in an animal&#xD;
      model of SCI has found that that a serotonin agonist markedly increases respiratory responses&#xD;
      to carbon dioxide. Treatment with a serotonin 5HT1A agonist effectively improved the&#xD;
      ventilatory drive after both acute and chronic spinal cord injuries in rats. One potential&#xD;
      mechanism is increased excitability of the ventral motoneurons that have survived the spinal&#xD;
      cord injury. 5-HT1A receptors do exist on these neurons, and when activated, amplify the&#xD;
      excitatory output. Another mechanism resides at the intercostal and abdominal muscle&#xD;
      afferents which influence supraspinal respiratory group neurons in the brainstem and motor&#xD;
      output to the muscles of breathing. Hence, serotonin agonists may act on neural pathways in&#xD;
      the spinal cord responsible for transferring afferent information from intercostal muscles to&#xD;
      supraspinal centers. Lastly, 5-HT1A receptors may also be involved in functional plasticity&#xD;
      of neural respiratory pathways, in particular ipsilateral phrenic nerve activity. Up&#xD;
      regulation of 5-HT1A receptors due to denervation supersensitivity could result in&#xD;
      postsynaptic hyperresponsivity due to loss of descending input.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BuSpar/Buspirone is a serotonin 5HT1A agonist and used as an anxiolytic in humans. It does&#xD;
      not cause sedation, has minimal effects on psychomotor performance or cognition, and has low&#xD;
      threshold for abuse potential or dependence liability. Prior studies have found Buspirone to&#xD;
      be well tolerated. It has been used safely in spinal cord injury, but not for respiratory&#xD;
      purposes. (Though there is one clinical trial in process: Role of Enhancing Serotonin&#xD;
      Receptors Activity for Sleep Apnea Treatment in Patients with SCI.) However, Buspirone up to&#xD;
      60 mg daily has been used to treat disturbed respiratory rhythms in multiple sclerosis, brain&#xD;
      cancer, and brainstem infarction. Interestingly, in patients with COPD, a 14-day oral&#xD;
      administration of buspirone (20 mg) found improved anxiety and depression as well as&#xD;
      increased exercise tolerance with lesser sensations of dyspnea. Hence, buspirone may offer a&#xD;
      treatment to improve hypercapnic ventilatory drive. Given that oral administration of 30 mg&#xD;
      results in peak plasma levels at one hour and that the average elimination half life is about&#xD;
      2 to 3 hours, buspirone is an attractive and safe approach to exploring the ability to&#xD;
      improve respiratory responses to exercise and/or hypercapnia exposure in those with high&#xD;
      level spinal cord injury that limits breathing capacity.&#xD;
