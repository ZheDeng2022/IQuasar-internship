  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter study that will be conducted at up to 20 inpatient rehabilitation&#xD;
      facilities (IRFs) in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BQ 2.0 is a wearable medical device that produces and delivers non-invasive,&#xD;
      extremely-low-intensity and low-frequency, frequency-tuned electromagnetic fields in order to&#xD;
      stimulate neuronal networks with the aim of reducing disability and promoting neurorecovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, BQ 2.0 is intended to reduce disability in adult patients with subacute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, with a moderate to severe disability which includes an upper extremity motor&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BQ 2.0 will be used for 9 weeks in conjunction with physical and occupational therapy&#xD;
      (PT/OT), with treatment initiated in inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRF) and then&#xD;
      continued post-discharge in subjects' homes under periodic remote supervision of a trained&#xD;
      site study team member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll up to 150 subjects who will be randomly assigned (1:1 allocation ratio)&#xD;
      to either active or sham study intervention using BQ 2.0.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study intervention will be initiated 4-10 days after the index stroke event and will&#xD;
      consist of a total of 45 sessions over a period of 9 weeks (5 treatments per week). Each&#xD;
      session will last 60 minutes during which 40 net minutes of active or sham study intervention&#xD;
      using BQ 2.0 will be administered. Each study group will receive a standardized, pre-defined&#xD;
      and evidence-based physical and occupational therapy regimen concurrent with the study&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective subjects, who are 3 to 9 days post-stroke, will be consented to participate in&#xD;
      the study at either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a participating initial acute care hospital (ACH) 1-2 days prior to anticipated transfer&#xD;
           to a participating IRF; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. within the first 1-3 week days after arrival to a participating IRF. Consented subjects,&#xD;
           who are 4 to 10 days post-stroke, will be screened for eligibility to participate in the&#xD;
           treatment phase of the study within the first 1-3 days after arrival to a participating&#xD;
           IRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned, at a 1:1 allocation ratio, to either the active&#xD;
      or sham study intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow-up Randomized patients will proceed to the treatment phase of the study.&#xD;
      Active or sham study intervention sessions using BQ 2.0 (active or sham therapy,&#xD;
      respectively) will be conducted 5 times a week, starting 4-10 days after stroke onset and no&#xD;
      later than 48 hours after randomization. Each session will last up to 60 minutes, with active&#xD;
      or sham field being turned on for up to 40 minutes. The only difference between the BQ 2.0&#xD;
      active stimulation and sham therapy is that the sham device does not generate electromagnetic&#xD;
      fields during treatment. Subjects in both the active intervention group (BQ 2.0 group) and&#xD;
      sham group will perform trial-specified physical and occupational therapy activities during&#xD;
      each session, in addition to their standard care rehabilitation therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo a detailed interim outcome assessment on the 20th (±4) day of treatment&#xD;
      and final detailed outcome assessment on the 90th (±15) day after the onset of the index&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

    <masking_description>This is a double-blind study, subjects and Investigators will be blinded to the device setting (Active/Sham). The study site team members receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions will be blinded. Subjects' caregivers will also be blinded. There are no differences in the active and sham device appearance. Due to the non-invasive nature of the treatment, as well as the physical characteristic of the EMF, there is no noticeable difference between sessions conducted using an active or a sham device, facilitating full blinding of both subjects and Investigators.&#xD;
An independent unblinded statistician (not the study statistician) will perform the assessments described. Only the unblinded statistician and members of the DSMB will be exposed to the interim report.</masking_description>
