  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postural balance control is based on complex mechanisms involving several sensory and motor&#xD;
      systems. Maintaining postural equilibrium requires muscle activation to oppose the balance&#xD;
      threats. Stroke may be associated with a variety of deficits, including impaired upper limb&#xD;
      functions , poor postural stability, impaired reactive balance control, and delayed responses&#xD;
      to external balance perturbations. Individuals with stroke are at high risk for falls in all&#xD;
      post-stroke stages. Falls may have long-term serious consequences and can lead to more&#xD;
      disability. Upper extremity movements have a relevant contribution in controlling balance and&#xD;
      enhance the ankle and hip strategies for maintaining upright postural stability among healthy&#xD;
      adults. Upper extremities movements also, constitute important elements in both equilibrium&#xD;
      and protective reactions. Appropriate corrective responses of both the upper and lower&#xD;
      extremities are essential to regain balance control and reduce the risk of falls. More&#xD;
      studies are required to know about the impact of arm movements on postural balance control in&#xD;
      individuals post-stroke. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the&#xD;
      improvement of the upper extremity functions on postural balance control in patients with&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is defined as rapidly developing clinical signs of focal (or global) disturbance of&#xD;
      cerebral function, leading to death, with no apparent cause other than that of vascular&#xD;
      origin. It considered the biggest burden cause of disability all over the world, 16 million&#xD;
      people suffer from a stroke every year with great economic and social repercussions.&#xD;
      Following a stroke, a number of impairments may influence the patient's ability to perform&#xD;
      functional activities. These include weakness, alterations in tone, sensory loss,&#xD;
      uncoordinated response, reduced balance mechanisms, and walking problems. Upper limb&#xD;
      involvement is usually more pronounced than the lower limb. The effects of stroke on the&#xD;
      upper limb functions are common and a significant cause of long-term disability. Balance&#xD;
      impairment is one of the most common deficits in patients post-stroke. After a stroke,&#xD;
      balance abilities are reduced due to abnormal muscle activity and asymmetric posture.&#xD;
      Impaired Balance not only increases the risk of falls but also adversely affects physical&#xD;
      activity and social participation. The inﬂuence of arm movements on postural control only&#xD;
      appears to be evident in case of impairs upper extremity functional performance. Arm&#xD;
      movements play a functional role in postural stability during standing and walking. Arm and&#xD;
      hand movements can also serve a protective role to prevent head injury in case of falling.&#xD;
      Rehabilitation programs aiming for improving upper extremity impairments and improving&#xD;
      balance performance can reduce the fall risk in individuals with stroke. Recently, virtual&#xD;
      reality-based training exercises, are used to improve upper limb functions, balance, gait,&#xD;
      and quality of life in stroke survivors. Many studies supported that virtual reality-based&#xD;
      programs are suitable and have a potential value for patients with stroke. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to investigate the impact of the improvement of the upper motor abilities by&#xD;
      using virtual reality-based training on balance control in patients with chronic stroke.&#xD;

    <time_frame>[Data collected at baseline, and 12 weeks after intervention commencement.] (i.e. Difference between Fugl-Meyer Assessment Scale Score of Upper-Extremity at both baseline and completion of 12 weeks of intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>The Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) is a stroke-specific, performance-based impairment index. It measures the movement, coordination and reflex action of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist and hand. The scale includes 33 items divided into 4 subscales: (A) shoulder/elbow, 18 items, (B) wrist, 5 items, (C) hand, 7 items, and (D) coordination/speed, 3 items. Each item is scored on an ordinal 3-point scale, where 2 points are assigned when the movement is performed fully, 1 point when performed partially, and 0 points when the movement cannot be performed. A total score of 66 indicates better sensorimotor function. Thus, the higher the score a patient will get after completion of the treatment program compared to the baseline score, the better the improvement in upper extremity motor functions.</description>

    <description>Balance Subscale of the Fugl-Meyer Test is designed to evaluate balance impairment after stroke. It contains 7 items, 3 for sitting and 4 for standing. These items are sitting without support, parachute reaction (both sides), standing with and without support, unilateral stance (both sides). The seven items are rated on a 3-point scale (0-2). The total score is ranged from 0 to 14. This test is a valid and reliable clinical balance measures at different post-stroke stages of recovery.</description>

    <description>The Biodex Balance System will be used to assess the change in the Overall Stability Indices of the Postural Stability Test. The test includes measurement of the following indices: overall stability index, anteroposterior index and mediolateral index which represents the patient's ability to control his postural balance stability in all directions. High values % represent less stability and the patient has difficulty in balance control. On the other hand lower values are indicative of a better balance control.</description>

    <description>Participants who participated in the control group received a traditional physical therapy program for two hours. It included two parts, each of them was for one hour and 15 minutes rest in between. The first part included: muscle strengthening and facilitation exercises, stretching exercises, and postural reactions exercises. The second part included: functional exercise for facilitation of arm-reaching and arm-hand skills, manipulative tasks (grasping and release activities), and daily living activities for the affected upper limb.&#xD;
The traditional treatment program was applied for both groups by therapists, experienced in stroke rehabilitation. It was carried out three sessions per week for twelve successive weeks.</description>

    <description>Participants in the experimental group received two hours treatment program that included three parts, the first and the second parts (similar to that were applied for participants in the control group). These two parts were applied for one hour followed by 15 minutes rest, then the third part was applied for one hour. The third part of the program was a one-hour virtual reality intervention program by using (ArmeoSpring) virtual reality equipment to simulate a range of upper limb tasks that facilitate arm activities, manipulative skills, and daily living tasks through using different interactive games and soft-wares.&#xD;
The traditional treatment part of the program was applied by therapists, experienced in stroke rehabilitation. The virtual reality part of the program was applied by other experienced physiotherapists, who were well trained in using the (ArmeoSpring) System. All three parts of the program were carried out three sessions per week for twelve successive weeks.</description>
