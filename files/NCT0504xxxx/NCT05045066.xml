  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This early phase I is to find out how common vitamin D deficiency is among African American&#xD;
      patients with a history of prostate cancer that has not spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
      (localized) or has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and how vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency affects the immune system. This study also aims to find out if replacing vitamin D&#xD;
      results in normalization of the immune function. Information from this study may benefit&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients by identifying vitamin D deficiency which in several studies had&#xD;
      been found to contribute to more aggressive prostate cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among African American (AA) prostate&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the changes in circulating immunological cell function among patients with&#xD;
      vitamin D deficiency and the effects of vitamin D replacement on those changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine the acceptability of cholecalciferol (vitamin D) replacement therapy among AA&#xD;
      prostate cancer patients and potential impact on health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine if there are differences in the peripheral blood immunological cell function in&#xD;
      AA patients with metastatic prostate cancer compared to those with localized prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with low vitamin D3 levels receive cholecalciferol orally (PO) daily for 8 weeks in&#xD;
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
