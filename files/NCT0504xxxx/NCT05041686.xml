  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute cholecystitis is the most common complication of cholelithiasis. Acute cholecystitis is&#xD;
      inflammation of the gallbladder that develops over hours, usually due to an obstruction of&#xD;
      the cystic duct by a gallstone. Removal of the gallbladder (Cholecystectomy) is the only&#xD;
      definitive treatment for acute cholecystitis, with laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC)&#xD;
      considered the gold standard. Serious complications that may occur with laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy, including bile duct injury, bile leaks, bleeding, and bowel injury, result&#xD;
      in part from the anatomy, disease related pathology and structural misidentification due to&#xD;
      inflammatory process (Gupta 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CADISS® System, Chemically Assisted mechanical DISSection, is intended for the selective&#xD;
      detachment of pathological tissue layers and/or fibrotic tissues in various surgical&#xD;
      procedures without using cutting instruments. It is based on the property of the drug mesna&#xD;
      (Sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate) to cleave the disulfide bonds responsible for the&#xD;
      adherence of pathological tissues and for the strength of fibrosis. This study is a&#xD;
      prospective, multi-sites, open label, single cohort clinical trial evaluating the use of&#xD;
      CADISS® system to facilitate dissection of severe adhesions in cholecystectomy and to allow&#xD;
      better identification of different structure.&#xD;

    <description>The CADISS® device was procured from AuXin Surgery. It consists in three elements:&#xD;
A single use disposable Remote Kit, containing a sterile cartridge, which prepares the Drug Product immediately before use, and the sterile tubing for fluid connexion. The Drug Product is a 30 ml sterile 5% mesna solution of pH 7.3+/-0.5 2.&#xD;
Reusable stainless steel noncutting mechanical instruments similar to those used in the normal practice, except for the provision of an internal irrigation channel bringing the Drug Product at the working edge.&#xD;
A pedal controlled electric motor driving the peristaltic cassette included in the disposable tubing in order to control the dispensing of the Drug Product during the procedure.</description>
