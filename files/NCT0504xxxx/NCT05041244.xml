    <textblock>
      Topical Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (TNPW) is an established tool in the management of&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulcer in many countries. This treatment option is under utilized in the public&#xD;
      sector of Mauritius. This study aims to determine the efficacy of TNPW through identification&#xD;
      of biomarkers in the Mauritian setting compared with conventional treatment. Patient with DFU&#xD;
      will be selected based on an eligible criteria and randomly assigned to intervention group or&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the efficacy of TNPW in the public sector in Mauritius&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To compare healing times, prognostic factors skin biopsies based on&#xD;
      biomarker, histological and genomic analysis A randomised controlled study is being proposed,&#xD;
      where up to 100 participants will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wounds of participants in the intervention arm will be managed with 3 weeks of TNPW.&#xD;

      Study Description: Topical Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (TNPW) is an established tool in&#xD;
      the management of Diabetic foot ulcer in many countries. This treatment option is under&#xD;
      utilized in the public sector of Mauritius. This study aims to determine the efficacy of TNPW&#xD;
      through identification of biomarkers in the Mauritian setting compared with conventional&#xD;
      treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To determine the efficacy of TNPW in the public sector in Mauritius&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To compare healing times, prognostic factors skin biopsies based on&#xD;
      biomarker, histological and genomic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of complete wound closure at 7, 14 and 21 days Time for complete wound closure Side&#xD;
      and depth of diabetic ulcer at 7, 14, 21 days Extent of granulation tissue&#xD;
      (Epithelialisation) (7- 21 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints: Hospital stay, readmission, rate of amputation and rate of infections&#xD;
      and adverse events Number of dressing changes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 50 patients in each arm (interventional and control) Chronic diabetic&#xD;
      ulcers, Wagner's 2-3 Male and female Diabetes Mellitus without renal and liver impairment Age&#xD;
      18- 74 years Stable patients with Diabetic foot ulcer A G Jeetoo Hospital, Port-Louis and&#xD;
      Souillac District Hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: 2 Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants: The study will take place at&#xD;
      the above mentioned units Approval has been received by the Regional Health Director and&#xD;
      Consultant in Charge and the Ministry of Health and Wellness for A G Jeetoo Hospital and&#xD;
      Souillac District Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from the Diabetes Clinic or the General Surgery Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic diabetic ulcer fulfilling the eligibility criteria Description of Study&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (TNPW) arm and&#xD;
      conventional treatment arm offered at the above named hospitals. TNPW devices will be used in&#xD;
      patients in the intervention arm for 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TNPW is described as a medical procedure which involves application of a dressing to the&#xD;
      wound. The dressing is attached to a vacuum device that provides sub-atmospheric pressures&#xD;
      which help in the removal of exudates to promote the healing process. Dressings will be&#xD;
      changed weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: 12 months Participant Duration: Each participant will be followed weekly&#xD;
      during the procedure then 3 monthly to assess wound healing and enquire about need for&#xD;
      further treatment including admissions and long term adverse effects.&#xD;

    <description>Initial cycle: Continuous first 48 hours Subsequent cycle: Consider intermittent DPC (5 min ON/2 mins OFF) for rest of the therapy Target Target Pressure: 50-175mmHg, to be titrated for more drainage Dressing change interval: every week; need for more frequent dressing need to be evaluated. More frequent change of adaptic can be considered. (Adaptic is a layer of thin dressing that will be in direct contact with the wound to reduce the risk of maceration and adherence to the dressing)</description>
