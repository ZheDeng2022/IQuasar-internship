  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe the efficacy, durability and safety of cerebellar continuous θ&#xD;
      burst stimulation (cTBS) in the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy, and to provide a new&#xD;
      method for the treatment of drug-refractory epilepsy and improve the quality of life of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was a randomized cross-over study. First, the clinical information, imaging, EEG&#xD;
      and quality scores of lives of patients with drug-refractory epilepsy were collected, who&#xD;
      were continuously enrolled in the Neurology department of Xijing Hospital. Secondly, patients&#xD;
      were randomized into groups for cross-over treatment, and the efficacy was analyzed by&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      θ burst stimulation (TBS) is characterized by plexus stimulation. This mode is that each&#xD;
      plexus usually contains three pulses and the frequency of intra plexus pulse is 50Hz while&#xD;
      the frequency of interplexus pulse is 5Hz. Continuous θ burst stimulation (cTBS) mainly&#xD;
      produces inhibitory effects on the cortex, and the inhibition of motor evoked potentials&#xD;
      (MEP) lasts for 60min, which is more durable than traditional rTMS, but the intensity of&#xD;
      stimulation is lower and the time of stimulation is shorter.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life in epilepsy (QOLIE-31) will be taken before recruiting. The scale has 31 questions including 8 evaluation factors. And each evaluation factor is based on a percentage scale. Total points=SUM( points in each factor/ question number in the factor)*weight. Then search the form to find the corresponding T value and the higher T value, the better of life quality.</description>
