  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary and sexual dysfunctions are among the most common complications in rectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of laparoscopic&#xD;
      functional total mesorectum excision (FTME) on urinary and sexual function in male patients&#xD;
      with mid-low rectal cancer. This is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, uncontrolled,&#xD;
      clinical study in 88 eligible subjects with mid-low rectal cancer. After informed consent,&#xD;
      eligible patients will be performed laparoscopic FTME surgery. Patients' demographic,&#xD;
      operative detail, postoperative outcomes and follow-up will be recorded prospectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previously, our studies have demonstrated the presence of nerve plane in laparoscopic rectal&#xD;
      cancer surgery, which was the overlying tiny membranous tissue including the nerves, the&#xD;
      adipose tissue, and the extremely tiny capillaries around the nerve. As a consequence, the&#xD;
      concept of nerve plane-oriented functional total mesorectal excision (FTME) was proposed as&#xD;
      an optimal surgical procedure about pelvic autonomic nerve preservation in rectal cancer&#xD;
      surgery. Following the TME principles, the surgical procedure of FTME was guided by the nerve&#xD;
      plane and dissected between the proper fascia of the rectum and nerve plane (the first gap),&#xD;
      which could ensure completeness of the nerve plane and the proper fascia of the rectum. This&#xD;
      surgical procedure not only ensures radical resection but also protects PAN better, and the&#xD;
      investigators also showed the difference between routine TME and FTME in our previous study,&#xD;
      which included inferior mesenteric plexus preservation, station 253 nodes dissection,&#xD;
      existence of the first gap, Waldeyer's fascia and Denonvillier's fascia (DVF) preservation,&#xD;
      neurovascular bundles preservation, and completeness of mesorectum and nerve plane.&#xD;
      Currently, it was a lack of higher-level evidence-based evidence to confirm the protective&#xD;
      effect of laparoscopic FTME on urinary and sexual function in male patients with mid-low&#xD;
      rectal cancer. In the present study, the investigators performed the prospective, single-arm,&#xD;
      multicenter, uncontrolled clinical study, eligible patients will be performed laparoscopic&#xD;
      FTME surgery. Postoperative sexual function, urinary function, complications, quality of&#xD;
      life, recurrence rate, recurrence patterns, disease-free survival, and overall survival will&#xD;
      be recorded prospectively. The results of the patients will be assessed to validate&#xD;
      postoperative functional outcomes and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic FTME surgery.&#xD;
