             treatment is complete and symptoms have resolved within the 90-day screening window,&#xD;
             eligible participants may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Diagnosed with an acute STI requiring treatment per current CDC guidelines&#xD;

             1 (Female Genital Grading Table for Use in Microbicide Studies [Dated November 2007])&#xD;
             Note: Cervical bleeding associated with speculum insertion and/or specimen collection&#xD;
             judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical judgment of the&#xD;
             IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual bleeding and is not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may be&#xD;
             enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary severity&#xD;
             grading or resolved within 90 days of providing informed consent for screening.&#xD;

                  Visit, colposcopy and cervical biopsies for evaluation of an abnormal Pap test as&#xD;
                  well as IUD insertion/removal are not exclusionary.&#xD;

                  laboratory result may be re-tested and may be enrolled/randomized after the&#xD;
                  findings have improved to a non-exclusionary severity grading or resolved within&#xD;
                  90 days of providing informed consent for screening. Results of safety laboratory&#xD;
                  testing performed at the Enrollment Visit are expected to be received after the&#xD;
                  Enrollment Visit, and thus will not be exclusionary. Abnormal results will be&#xD;
                  noted as pre-existing conditions, and may result in product discontinuation, per&#xD;
                  IoR discretion as per Section 7.2.1 of the protocol.&#xD;

             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate the interpretation of&#xD;
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives&#xD;
             including any significant uncontrolled active or chronic medical condition.&#xD;
