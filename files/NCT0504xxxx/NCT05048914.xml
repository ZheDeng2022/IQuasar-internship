      Migraine headaches in children and adolescents may cause severe attacks that require abortive&#xD;
      treatment. This study evaluated the incidence and efficacy of medications used for relieving&#xD;
      migraine headache attacks in the pediatric population in Israel. Children 6-18 years of age&#xD;
      who were diagnosed in our pediatric neurology clinic as having migraine headaches were&#xD;
      enrolled into the study. Children and their parents filled in questionnaires about their&#xD;
      response to abortive treatment two hours after use, during three acute headache attacks. The&#xD;
      questionnaire included demographic data, baseline headache intensity, migraine-associated&#xD;
      symptoms, medications used, and pain assessment.&#xD;

      Background: Headaches are a common complaint in children and adolescents. Most cases are&#xD;
      caused by a benign problem or a primary headache disorder, such as migraine and tension-type&#xD;
      headaches. Not enough research has been done about the effect of analgesics in treating acute&#xD;
      primary headache attacks among children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objective-This study's goal is to describe which medications are used for relieving&#xD;
      primary headache attacks in outpatient pediatric population in Israel, and to evaluate their&#xD;
      analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study group will include 50 patients who were assessed in the pediatric&#xD;
      neurology clinic and were diagnosed as having a primary headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the results via filled out surveys;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First survey for headache assessment at the pediatric neurology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second survey for tracking given analgesic and its effect by the child at home in&#xD;
           addition to checkup calls by pediatric staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will include; demographic data, headache diagnosis, baseline headache intensity,&#xD;
      antipyretic used and pain assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research topic:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of Common Analgesics in Primary Headaches among Children and Adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headaches are a common complaint in children and adolescents; (1) most cases are caused by a&#xD;
      benign problem or a primary headache disorder. Migraine and tension-type headache are the two&#xD;
      most common recurring headache patterns seen in children and are distinguished clinically by&#xD;
      their characteristics and accompanying features according to the IHS criteria (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of Migraine Frequent Migraine headaches can cause a significant impact on&#xD;
      disability, as well as quality of life, prompting the need for early recognition and&#xD;
      treatment (3,4,5,6). Thus, the goal of acute treatment of migraine headaches should be a&#xD;
      consistent of rapid treatment with minimum side effects and a rapid return to normal&#xD;
      function. The most commonly used analgesics are Ibuprofen, and Acetaminophen, and Dipyrone&#xD;
      which have shown safety in controlled trials (7). The patient should be instructed to treat&#xD;
      the headache as quickly as possible, or at the onset of the aura, if present. Along with&#xD;
      treating the acute headache attack, support therapies should be offered by the pediatric&#xD;
      neurologist, pediatrician, psychologist, and support groups to reduce the frequency of the&#xD;
      attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen Efficacy of drugs for the acute treatment of migraine in children&#xD;
      has not been studied in well controlled trials. A double-blind crossover study of 88 children&#xD;
      was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Acetaminophen and Ibuprofen, both drugs were shown&#xD;
      to be effective and economical treatments for severe to moderate migraine attacks in&#xD;
      children. Ibuprofen gave the best relief (8). A similar study was performed on a group of&#xD;
      younger children using ibuprofen versus placebo with a similar outcome, although there was a&#xD;
      slight male-to-female difference (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dipyrone Dipyrone is used to treat headaches in many countries including Israel. However, it&#xD;
      is not available in others, particularly the USA, because of its association with potentially&#xD;
      life threatening blood dyscrasias. Its efficacy for the acute treatment of primary headaches&#xD;
      in children has not been studied in well controlled trials. Evidence from a small number of&#xD;
      trials suggests that Dipyrone is effective for episodic tension-type headache and migraine.&#xD;
      No serious adverse events were observed in the included trials, but agranulocytosis is rare&#xD;
      and would probably not be observed in such a relatively small sample (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Israel, yet no studies have been initiated to check the efficacy of acute treatment of&#xD;
      primary headache attacks among children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of TTH Tension type headaches (TTH) are a heterogeneous syndrome, which is&#xD;
      diagnosed mainly by the absence of features that are found in other headache types, such as&#xD;
      migraine (11). TTH receives much less attention than other types of headache from health&#xD;
      authorities, clinical researchers, or industrial pharmacologists. One of the reasons for that&#xD;
      may be the fact that most people with infrequent TTH do not consult a doctor for pain relief.&#xD;
      They usually manage it themselves using over-the-counter analgesics (12). However, chronic&#xD;
      TTH, defined as headache that occurs on 15 days or more per month, is a major health problem&#xD;
      with significant educational and socioeconomic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of an acute episode of TTH a gradual strategy is appropriate, as the patients'&#xD;
      activity is usually not interrupted and pain intensity is usually not severe (13). In case of&#xD;
      repeated, prolonged, or severe episodes of both types of primary headaches, the use of&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment should be considered. Pharmacological prophylaxis Life style changes&#xD;
      are recommended for young people (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medication overused headaches Medication-overuse headache (MOH) is a chronic headache&#xD;
      disorder defined by the International Headache Society as a headache induced by the overuse&#xD;
      of analgesics, triptans, or other acute headache compounds. The population-based prevalence&#xD;
      of MOH is 0·7% to 1·7%. Most patients with MOH have migraine as their primary headache and&#xD;
      overuse triptans or simple analgesics. The pathophysiology of MOH is still unknown. As well&#xD;
      as psychological mechanisms such as operant conditioning, changes in endocrinological&#xD;
      homoeostasis and neurophysiological changes have been observed in patients with MOH.&#xD;
      Recently, a genetic susceptibility has been postulated. In most cases, treatment of MOH&#xD;
      consists of abrupt withdrawal therapy and then initiation of an appropriate preventive drug&#xD;
      therapy (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal is to describe which medications are used for relieving primary headache attack in&#xD;
      outpatient pediatric population in Israel, and to evaluate their analgesic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study group will include 50 children 5-18 years of age who were evaluated in the&#xD;
      pediatric neurology clinic and were diagnosed as having either migraine or tension type&#xD;
      headache. After signing an informed consent the children and/or their parents will be asked&#xD;
      to fill a survey about the used of analgesic during acute headache attack, both when they are&#xD;
      at the clinic and at home during the headache attack. The surveys will be filled out for a&#xD;
      period of 3 months at the first 3 headache episodes. A checkup call by pediatric staff will&#xD;
      be performed a month and a half after study initiation, the checkup call's purpose is to make&#xD;
      sure the surveys are filled out correctly, follow up and to give medical consultancy when&#xD;
      needed. The survey will include; demographic data, headache diagnosis, baseline headache&#xD;
      intensity, antipyretic used, dosage, pain assessment at one, three and six-hour time point,&#xD;
      migraine-associated symptoms quantification before treatment and at one, three and six-hour&#xD;
      time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-sample t-tests will be performed for continuous variables (headache intensity and&#xD;
      treatment) and χ2 for categorical data (such as gender, headache diagnosis). Odds ratios with&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals were computed.&#xD;
