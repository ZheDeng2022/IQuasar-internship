  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TQB3811 tablet is a second-generation tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) inhibitor that&#xD;
      selectively inhibits the kinase activity of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC, and also selectively&#xD;
      inhibits the kinase activity of TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC that produce secondary drug-resistant&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
