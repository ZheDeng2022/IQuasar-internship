  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study; To investigate the effects of Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue&#xD;
      Mobilizations and Stretching Exercises on flexibility, spasticity, balance and functional&#xD;
      mobility in patients with CP.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Various intervention studies; reported positive results with EDYDM after carpal tunnel&#xD;
      syndrome, myofascial trigger point, chronic low back pain, nonspecific thoracic spine pain,&#xD;
      ankle instability, mastectomy and total joint arthroplasty. Observational studies have shown&#xD;
      positive results in improving posterior shoulder range of motion, hip, knee, and ankle ROM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no study in the literature with EDYDM in patients with CP. Many of the problems in&#xD;
      which EDDM is applied for fascia and muscle mobilization in different diseases are also seen&#xD;
      in patients with CP. In current rehabilitation methods, Stretching Exercises are applied for&#xD;
      muscle and fascia shortening. The advantages of the applications over each other are unknown.&#xD;
      Our study is planned as a study with high original value as it is the first study to be&#xD;
      conducted using EDYDM in cases with CP. In our study, the effectiveness of EDYDM treatment,&#xD;
      which will increase the effectiveness of stretching exercises in CP or can be an alternative&#xD;
      treatment approach in cases with CP, will be compared with Stretching Exercises.&#xD;

    <measure>Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>In the evaluation of the presence of spasticity in patients with CP, the ankle plantar flexors will be based. It is recorded as an assessment of the resistance encountered while passively moving the limb at full range of motion. It is scored as 0, 1, 1+, 2, 3, 4. A value of 0 is the best score without muscle tone increase, while a value of 4 is when the extremity is in a rigid position. Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) will be used to evaluate spasticity.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pediatric Berg Balance Scale (PBBS)</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Berg Balance Scale, which is the version of the Berg Balance Scale designed for children by Franjoine et al., will be used to evaluate their functional balance in activities of daily living. The scale consists of 14 sections and each section is scored between 0-4; The highest score that can be obtained from the scale is 56.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Selective Motor Control Test (SMCT)</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>Ankle dorsiflexion Selective Motor Control Test will be used in the evaluation of selective movements. This test evaluates the isolated dorsiflexion movement of the ankle and is evaluated between 0-4 according to the selectivity of the ankle dorsiflexion movement in the long sitting position.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Weight-Bearing Lunge Testi (WBLT)</measure>
    <time_frame>one month</time_frame>
    <description>In order to measure the weight-bearing dorsiflexion ROM, the Weight-Bearing Lunge Test, which is positioned with support from the wall in the closed chain position, will be applied. An increase in ankle dorsiflexion angle will be considered as a positive result.</description>

    <intervention_name>Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Mobilization</intervention_name>
    <description>This technique will be performed using instruments of different sizes, shapes and treatment styles.&#xD;
During the application, instruments will be applied to loosen the muscle tissue and fascia by gliding on the tissue at certain angles.&#xD;
The muscle groups to be treated with IASTM are gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis posterior. It will also be applied to the superficial and deep fascia.&#xD;
The instrument will be sterilized before treatment.&#xD;
IASTM treatment will be applied without damaging the tissue after massaging cream is applied to the muscle fibers with the instrument.</description>
