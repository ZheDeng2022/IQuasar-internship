  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intensive Care Unit-Acquired Weakness (ICU-AW) is a clinical entity frequently encountered in&#xD;
      critically ill patients that have both short term and long-term implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standard of diagnosis is by assessment of manual muscle strength, using the&#xD;
      6-grade Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score. However, not all Intensive Care Unit (ICU)&#xD;
      admitted patients are conscious or cooperative enough to use MRC sum score for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of ICU-AW. Ultrasound imaging of muscles has emerged as a valid and reliable tool for&#xD;
      providing qualitative and quantitative details about muscle disease and has been suggested as&#xD;
      an alternative to assess ICU-AW in critically ill patients in whom the MRC cannot be&#xD;
      assessed. This study will be a prospective observational study to evaluate the relationship&#xD;
      between the trend of changes in muscle thickness, echogenicity and fasciculations during the&#xD;
      first 7 days of ICU stay as measured by ultrasound and ICU-AW among critically ill patients.&#xD;
      The study will be performed in the ICU of TU Teaching Hospital, Kathmandu, Nepal for 1 year.&#xD;
      All newly admitted adult patients ≥ 16 years of age, expected to stay in ICU / critical care&#xD;
      areas for at least 7 days, barring the exclusion criteria, will be included in the study and&#xD;
      evaluated for MRC sum score and skeletal muscle thickness, echogenicity and fasciculations&#xD;
      using ultrasound on day 1, day 4 and day 7. The measurements will then be statistically&#xD;
      analyzed to see if there is any relationship between trend of changes in muscle thickness,&#xD;
      echogenicity and fasciculations and ICU-AW&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All newly admitted patients (shifted to ICU within 48 h of hospital admission), aged ≥ 16&#xD;
      years and expected to stay in ICU or critical care areas for 7 days will be included in the&#xD;
      study after excluding those who fulfill excluding criterial. In all the participants, muscle&#xD;
      strength will be assessed at day 1, day 4 and day 7, if the patients are awake as assessed by&#xD;
      Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) (19) between -1 and 1, and cooperative (20) assessed&#xD;
      by being able to follow at least 3 out of 5 verbal commands with facial muscles (scored by&#xD;
      the Score of 5 Questions). Assessment will be done by an ICU physician blinded to the result&#xD;
      of ultrasound. The MRC score will be used for assessment of strength in the following six&#xD;
      muscle groups bilaterally: wrist dorsiflexors, elbow flexors, shoulder abductors, hip&#xD;
      flexors, knee extensors and ankle dorsiflexors. ICU-AW will be defined as MRC sum score &lt; 48,&#xD;
      in accordance with the international consensus statement.(1) Muscle ultrasound measurements&#xD;
      (the index test) Muscle ultrasound will be performed by an ICU faculty or a DM resident of&#xD;
      Critical care medicine (who has an experience of at least 25 muscle ultrasonography with at&#xD;
      least 10 muscle ultrasonography performed under supervision) (21) and will be blinded to the&#xD;
      result of MRC score of the patient. Muscle ultrasound images on day 1, day 4 and day 7 will&#xD;
      be obtained in the participants, using Mindray DC-60® portable ultrasound machine, with a 9&#xD;
      to 13 MHz linear probe. The device settings include MSK pre-set, and will be kept constant&#xD;
      during all examinations. The depth can be altered individually when deeper view is required&#xD;
      to visualize the entire muscle thickness. Patients will be examined in the supine position&#xD;
      with extended upper, lower limbs and completely relaxed muscles. The relaxation of muscle&#xD;
      will be ensured by scanning the muscle in the sagittal view. A contracted muscle will show&#xD;
      bulging in the central portion with thinning of its more distal ends. The angle of pennation&#xD;
      can be seen to change as the muscle moves through its range of motion and the interosseous&#xD;
      membrane will show bulging. A generous amount of contact gel will be used to minimize the&#xD;
      required pressure of the transducer on the skin. Compression of the tissue will be avoided as&#xD;
      it can affect the quality of muscle images. Transverse images of each muscle will be obtained&#xD;
      with the transducer perpendicular to the direction of muscle fibre orientation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be measured by muscle ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Muscle thickness&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Muscle echogenicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Muscle fasciculations Muscle thickness Measurements will be made using the built-in&#xD;
           electronic calipers on a frozen, real time, cross section image over the largest bulk&#xD;
           visible to eye. 3 measurements will be taken at each site and the mean value used for&#xD;
           statistical analysis. The following anatomical sites will be assessed bilaterally: (22)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The biceps brachii muscle including the underlying brachialis muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The forearm flexor group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The quadriceps femoris muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The tibialis anterior muscle Muscle echogenicity The muscle echogenicity will be&#xD;
                assessed by muscle ultrasound and graded according to Heckmatt and colleagues into&#xD;
                four grades:(16) Grade I: Normal echo intensity with starry-night aspect with&#xD;
                distinct bone echo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade II: Increased echo intensity with normal bone echo. Grade III: Increased echo intensity&#xD;
      with reduced bone signal. Grade IV: Increased echo intensity and loss of bone signal Muscle&#xD;
      fasciculations The muscle fasciculations will be detected by ultrasound.(18) Each muscle will&#xD;
      be examined over a time period of 10 seconds. The movement of fasciculation will be defined&#xD;
      as twitching of small parts of the muscle lasting for 0.2-0.5 s, at least two of which will&#xD;
      be required to be classified as being present. A fasciculation score ranges from 0 to 4 which&#xD;
      is the number of regions with fasciculations out of four muscle regions. All the participants&#xD;
      will be managed according to the ICU protocol of TUTH and there will be no variation in&#xD;
      treatment between those allocated to study and those not allocated to the study.&#xD;
