    <textblock>
      This study is a type-1 hybrid effectiveness-implementation RCT comparing a novel&#xD;
      family-inclusive childhood obesity treatment program, the &quot;Healthy Living Program&quot; (HeLP), to&#xD;
      a protocol that enhances usual primary care to deliver Recommended Treatment of Obesity in&#xD;
      Primary Care (RTOP). Children with obesity and their families will be referred to the study&#xD;
      by primary care providers and randomized to HeLP or RTOP. The clinical setting is a&#xD;
      practice-based research network serving majority Hispanic and Medicaid-insured populations.&#xD;
      The intensive phase and booster sessions of HeLP will take place at recreation centers&#xD;
      located near the clinics and will be led by health educators employed by the clinics. Visits&#xD;
      with primary care providers (PCPs) for HeLP maintenance or RTOP will occur at the clinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to learn about how well a family childhood&#xD;
      weight management program works compared to healthy lifestyle counseling by providers at&#xD;
      participating clinics. The goal is to compare weight change in children with obesity from&#xD;
      low-income predominantly Hispanic/Latino families that will participate in the program, the&#xD;
      Healthy Living Program (HeLP) vs. Recommended Treatment of Obesity in Primary Care (RTOP).&#xD;
      Low-income children with obesity from mostly Hispanic clinical populations will be referred&#xD;
      to the project by their primary doctors and will be enrolled into either HeLP or RTOP.&#xD;
      Families (including siblings and caregivers) who are in HeLP will be offered 12 sessions at&#xD;
      local rec centers where health educators and fitness trainers will teach them about parenting&#xD;
      skills, nutrition, fitness, and mindfulness. Families who are in RTOP will receive an&#xD;
      enhanced version of the care that is usually provided at their primary care clinics.&#xD;
      Providers will be trained in a skill called Motivational Interviewing and use an electronic&#xD;
      tool called &quot;HeartSmartKids&quot; to help families make healthy lifestyle changes. Families who&#xD;
      are in RTOP will go to follow-up visits every 3 months and will go to HeLP after 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 (Treatment): To compare the BMI change relative to the 95th percentile for age and sex&#xD;
      in children with obesity in 3 different age groups (2-6, 7-12, and 13-16 years old) 18 months&#xD;
      after being in either HeLP or RTOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 (Prevention): To compare the weight change in healthy and unhealthy weight 2-6-year-old&#xD;
      children who have siblings with obesity and are in either HeLP or RTOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3 (Implementation): To describe implementation processes of HeLP and RTOP using a&#xD;
      framework called RE-AIM: R-Reach: Is the project reaching the people it needs to reach?&#xD;
      E-Effectiveness: Is the program effective? A-Adoption: are the health educators, providers,&#xD;
      and clinics promoting and doing the program? I-Implementation: Are the health educators,&#xD;
      providers and clinics delivering the intervention as intended? M-Maintenance: Is the&#xD;
      intervention working to help children with their weight and healthy lifestyle changes? The&#xD;
      cost of delivering the program will also be studied to inform potential sustainability.&#xD;
