  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigational study drug, JNJ-64281802, is being developed for the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of dengue infection. This study is hypothesizing that the highest dose of the&#xD;
      investigational study drug is superior to receiving a placebo with respect to its antiviral&#xD;
      activity in healthy adult participants inoculated with Dengue Serotype 3.&#xD;
