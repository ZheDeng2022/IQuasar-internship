  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to begin investigating the possibility that early use of near&#xD;
      vision glasses will improve vision in infants at risk of Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI),&#xD;
      leading to further improvement in other areas of development. This active intervention,&#xD;
      starting at either 2 or 4 months of age (depending on randomisation), could be more effective&#xD;
      than waiting until a problem is detected before giving glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a feasibility study, the investigators are looking at a small sample of babies&#xD;
      (n=75) to see whether their parents/carers are willing to take part in a 3-arm study&#xD;
      comparing two differently timed interventions to a control group, as well as looking at&#xD;
      different aspects of the research plan in preparation for a larger final study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and the acceptability of randomisation and&#xD;
      the intervention, namely near vision glasses, from parents of very young babies at risk of&#xD;
      Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants are born with an immature visual system, and for vision to develop normally, a&#xD;
      clear image needs to transmit to the visual centres of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good vision plays an important role in facilitating normal development so if CVI goes&#xD;
      unnoticed, it can have a damaging effect on the child's early development, and subsequent&#xD;
      education and quality of life. Children use their sight to learn to walk, talk, think and&#xD;
      communicate. For this reason, early intervention has the potential to have positive effects&#xD;
      on children's vision and general development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that up to 75% of school age children, who have CVI, have&#xD;
      difficulty focussing their eyes on a near target, so near objects, such as their hands and&#xD;
      parents' faces, will appear blurry. These studies also showed that wearing glasses for near&#xD;
      focus improved vision but has not been assessed in babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-centre, parallel group, open-label feasibility trial to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of testing the effect near vision glasses (full cycloplegic refraction plus 3.00D&#xD;
      add for near) could have on the visual and developmental outcome in babies at risk of brain&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants at risk of developing CVI include those who have had hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy&#xD;
      (HIE) and those born prematurely before 29 weeks gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The paediatric research optometrist will enrol and assess all eligible babies of consenting&#xD;
      families; first visit at 8 or 16 weeks corrected gestational age, depending on randomisation.&#xD;
      Each infant will be followed up 3 months and 6-months (+/- 3 weeks) after the first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three main areas of the assessment, which will be leading to potential primary&#xD;
      outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Visual Responses (including visual acuity and refractive status)&#xD;
&#xD;
           At each visit, vision will be evaluated using Atkinson's battery for Child Development&#xD;
           for Examining Functional Vision (ABCDEFV) according to the child's age and their&#xD;
           ability. This comprises age-appropriate core vision tests (such as visual acuity and&#xD;
           fixing and following) as well as additional tests that assess visual perception and&#xD;
           visuomotor behaviour. If visual acuity cannot be obtained using Keeler acuity cards, as&#xD;
           per ABCDEFV, the children will receive a measure using a Near Detection Scale (NDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. General Development and Neurodevelopmental Delay&#xD;
&#xD;
           Non-visual developmental assessments will include the Bayley Scales of Infant&#xD;
           Development - 3rd edition (BSID-III) assessment as appropriate for age at routine&#xD;
           neonatal clinical appointments at 3, 6,12 and 24 months (not the research clinics). A&#xD;
           Prechtl video will also be performed at the 3-month appointment to assess the presence&#xD;
           of fidgety movements. The presence of these movements at 3 months corrected gestational&#xD;
           age has been strongly correlated with normal motor development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Functional broadband near infrared spectroscopy (fBNIRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Identification of changed functional haemodynamic and metabolic response to visual&#xD;
           stimulus in infants at risk of visual dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Assessment of changes in functional response in relation to response to glasses&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible children with consenting parents will be screened for high refractive error&#xD;
           prior to randomisation by the research optometrist to avoid post-randomisation dropouts.&#xD;
           Evidence of high refractive error (more than -6.00D spherical equivalent or +8.00D&#xD;
           spherical equivalent) will result in a referral to ophthalmology and exclusion from the&#xD;
           study due to the possibility of associated ocular pathology with high refractive error.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All of the above assessments have been organised at University College London Hospitals&#xD;
           (UCLH). If the infant is randomised to get glasses, they will be given a near vision&#xD;
           spectacle prescription (full cycloplegic refraction plus 3.00D add for near) to take to&#xD;
           Great Ormond Street Hospital Eye Department dispensing optician to get the special&#xD;
           glasses ordered.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Expert ethical advice has been sought through the NIHR's Research Design Service to&#xD;
           check on the dimension of potential harm (with a positive review). Each case will be&#xD;
           monitored by the independent data monitoring and ethics committee (IDMEC) using follow&#xD;
           up data who will report to the trial steering committee (TSC). The IDMEC, Trial Steering&#xD;
           Committee (TSC) and Trial Management Group (TMG) will oversee the conduct of this trial.&#xD;
