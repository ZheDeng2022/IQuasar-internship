    <measure>Composite Healing Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 through Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Composite healing score will be calculated from clinical grading of wound healing parameters as (general wound appearance score plus [+] smoothness score + epithelial confluence score) minus [-] (erythema score + edema score + crusting/scabbing score). Composite healing score on a 25-point scale (-12 [no healing] to +12 [towards healing]) is indicative of extent of wound healing and will be calculated for each wound site at each evaluation day.</description>
