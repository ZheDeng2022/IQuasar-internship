  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the use of a telemedicine tool, the TELE-ASD-PEDS&#xD;
      (TAP), that is designed to assess for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms in toddlers.&#xD;
      The TAP was developed at VUMC by a team of clinical psychologists with expertise in the early&#xD;
      identification of ASD. The TAP has been studied in controlled laboratory settings, with high&#xD;
      levels of family and clinician satisfaction, as well as excellent agreement with blinded&#xD;
      comprehensive ASD evaluation. The TAP has also been used to complete direct-to-home&#xD;
      telemedicine assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the investigators have not&#xD;
      yet compared direct-to-home assessments using the TAP with gold standard, in-person ASD&#xD;
      assessments. It has also not yet been studied in a diverse sample of families or with&#xD;
      providers outside of VUMC. This study will allow the investigators to address those gaps.&#xD;

      The investigators propose to evaluate the use of a telemedicine tool, the TELE-ASD-PEDS&#xD;
      (TAP), that is designed to assess for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms in toddlers.&#xD;
      This study will recruit 360 toddlers (18-42 months of age) across two sites (VUMC and the&#xD;
      University of California, Davis). All toddlers will receive in-home telemedicine assessment&#xD;
      for ASD using the TAP. This study has two aims. The first aim will randomize participants to&#xD;
      receive either (1) telemedicine assessment and an in-person ASD assessment or (2)&#xD;
      telemedicine-based assessment only. The investigators will measure diagnostic accuracy of the&#xD;
      TAP in comparison to gold standard, in-person ASD assessment. The investigators will also&#xD;
      assess test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and the sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
      and positive predictive value of the TAP. In the second aim, all 360 families will be&#xD;
      followed over six months to evaluate service access, family engagement, and family&#xD;
      perceptions of the diagnostic process.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Clinicians conducting in-person diagnostic evaluations will be blind to the outcomes of initial telehealth diagnostic appointments until after in-person assessments are administered and scored. Clinicians will be unblinded to telehealth diagnostic outcomes prior to sharing the results of in-person assessment with families.&#xD;
Clinicians conducting the second telehealth appointments for test-retest and interrater reliability purposes will be blind to recruitment pathway and diagnostic outcome from the initial telehealth appointment.</masking_description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to completion of in-person autism evaluation, approximately two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The investigators will compare diagnoses made from the tele-assessment using TAP to those from in-person evaluation. We will calculate the percent agreement between diagnoses assigned in each condition.</description>

    <measure>Validity of the TAP</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to completion of in-person autism evaluation, approximately two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Validity of the TAP will be measured by assessing the psychometric properties of the tool. Estimated performance metrics will include positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity of the TAP.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family perceptions of tele-assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Family perceptions of tele-assessment will be measured by the Parent Perceptions of Telemedicine (PPT) survey. The PPT is an 11-question survey. Seven questions are measured on a three-point scale and will provide quantitative data. Each question ranges from 1 (not true) to 3 (very true). Possible survey scores can range from 7 to 21. Higher scores indicate more positive perceptions of tele-assessment.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family satisfaction with diagnostic services</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Family satisfaction with diagnostic services will be measured by the Parent Service Satisfaction (PSS) survey. The PSS is an 7-question survey. Questions are measured on a three-point scale ranging from 1 (not true) to 3 (very true). Possible survey scores can range from 7 to 21. Higher scores indicate higher satisfaction with diagnostic services.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Family empowerment</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and six-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Family empowerment will be measured using the Family Empowerment Scale (FES), which asks questions about caregiver self-efficacy related to understanding, navigating, and supporting their child's needs. The FES is an 24-question survey. Questions are measured on a five-point scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). Possible survey scores can range from 24 to 120. Higher scores indicate greater self-perceived empowerment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Child service access and utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to six-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Child service access and use will be measured using the Service Access and Utilization (SAU) questionnaire. The questionnaires asks about receipt of Part C early intervention services as well as private therapy services. Caregivers will complete the questionnaire at seven time points (approximately 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, and 180 days following initial evaluation). At each time point, caregivers will endorse service milestones they have reached (e.g., scheduled an evaluation with the Part C service system, created an Individualized Family Service Plan, began services). We will calculate time to each milestone for each participant.</description>
