      This is a phase 1a/1b, multicentre, open-label, non-randomized study of NG-641 in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab in patients with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize the safety and tolerability of NG-641 in combination with nivolumab in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or advanced epithelial tumours and to determine the recommended dose&#xD;
      of NG-641 in combination with nivolumab for further development in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      or advanced epithelial tumours&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Phase 1a part of the study is is a dose-escalation phase investigating NG-641&#xD;
      administration by intravenous (IV) infusion in combination with fixed doses of nivolumab in a&#xD;
      range of tumour types. Patients eligible for Phase 1a will have metastatic or advanced&#xD;
      disease after failure of prior anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed cell&#xD;
      death ligand 1 (PD-L1) therapy. Dose escalation will be governed by the Bayesian Optimal&#xD;
      Interval (BOIN) design, with up to four dose-escalation cohorts planned, plus an optional&#xD;
      dose de-escalation cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1b part of the study will further investigate the efficacy and safety of the&#xD;
      selected dose regimen in up to three of the tumour types evaluated in phase 1b&#xD;
      (tumour-specific Dose Expansion Cohorts A, B and C). Patients eligible for Phase 1b will have&#xD;
      metastatic or advanced disease and primary resistance to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment, patients will be followed every 8 weeks for 12 months for tumour imaging&#xD;
      and evaluation (until disease progression), overall survival and outcomes on further&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
