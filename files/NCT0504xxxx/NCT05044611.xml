  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lithium (Li) is the leading treatment for BD, protecting against both maniac and depressive&#xD;
      relapse, and reducing the risk of suicide and mortality. However, despite this major clinical&#xD;
      efficacy, the use of lithium is limited by its narrow therapeutic index and by its side&#xD;
      effects. Li induces a vasopressin-resistant urinary concentration defect, with resulting&#xD;
      nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) in 12-50 % of patients. This feature is more frequent&#xD;
      after 5 years of treatment with lithium. Polyuria and subsequent thirst might affect&#xD;
      patients' quality of life, but also cause potentially life-threatening hypernatremia if free&#xD;
      access to water is impaired. Thus, we aim at evaluating the efficacy of amiloride on urine&#xD;
      concentrating ability in patients with nephrogenic diabetes insipidus due to chronic lithium&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be referred to the nephrology or the renal physiology department for the usual&#xD;
      follow-up of the lithium treatment. After verification of eligilibity criteria, information&#xD;
      and collection of consent, patient will be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first phase, patients will be randomized in two parallel groups: the experimental&#xD;
      arm will receive 5mg of amiloride twice daily during 2 months and the control arm will&#xD;
      receive a placebo twice daily during 2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures of fasting urine osmolality will be performed at baseline, 2 months, at 6 months and&#xD;
      at 12 months, in order to compare the difference of urine osmolality before and after&#xD;
      treatment between the two-randomization arms. Other baseline explorations are as follows:&#xD;
      mean number of nocturnal voids, SF-36 questionnaire, thirst intensity and distress scales,&#xD;
      YMRS/MADRS mood scale, GAD7 anxiety scale, PSQI sleep scale, GFR measurement and estimation,&#xD;
      24h urine for the quantification of the polyuria and osmolality, plasma and erythrocyte&#xD;
      lithium level, serum osmolality, natremia, kalemia, plasma copeptine and vasopressin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A nephrologist visit will take place 15 days after the initiation of the treatment along with&#xD;
      a new measure of plasma lithium level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at 1 month only if a change in posology is required after the&#xD;
      first measurement at day 15 and then at 2, 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In parallel, patients will be evaluated by at the psychiatry clinic at 1 month, 2, 6 and 12&#xD;
      months, and in any condition requiring additional visit as usual in standard care (follow-up&#xD;
      of anxiety, sleepiness, suicidal ideation, depression).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the completion of this first phase, the open label second phase will begin. Unblinding&#xD;
      the trial will allow the treatment allocation being available for the participants and health&#xD;
      care professionals. Amiloride will be continued in participants in the experimental group,&#xD;
      and the remaining participants will be followed-up without treatment. This phase will last&#xD;
      for 10 months (total trial duration : 12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At one year, renal functions (GFR, urine concentration and 24h urine production) will be&#xD;
      assessed along with report of events including hospital admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety of the experimental treatment will be assessed by regular evaluations of plasma&#xD;
      lithium and potassium level, beginning at 2 weeks after treatment initiation and after 2&#xD;
      months. The main risk of amiloride is hyperkalemia, which occurs in patients with severe&#xD;
      renal insufficiency. These patients will not be included in our study. Otherwise the&#xD;
      treatment is generally safe and well-tolerated. Plasma lithium level will be measured at the&#xD;
      first month clinical evaluation if a change in posology is required after the first&#xD;
      measurement at day 15.&#xD;

1st phase: Double blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to demonstrate the efficacy of 2 months treatment with amiloride 5mg twice a day to increase urine osmolality in patients with BD treated with lithium for at least 5 years and with a urine concentration defect.&#xD;
