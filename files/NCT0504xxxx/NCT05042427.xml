  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide obesity has continued to increase over the past decades. Among the adult women, the&#xD;
      overweight and obesity rates in Taiwan are much higher than that of women in nearby Asian&#xD;
      countries. In particular, the body mass index of women with low health literacy exceeds the&#xD;
      normal range before pregnancy. Without proper supervision, the increase in body weight during&#xD;
      pregnancy may result in multiple maternal complications, affect the newborn's health, and&#xD;
      increase unnecessary medical expenses in Taiwan's health care system. Thus, assessing&#xD;
      pregnant women' s health literacy to manage their body weight is of importance. However,&#xD;
      currently, there is no appropriate instrument available in Taiwan to assist health&#xD;
      practitioners in assessing the health literacy of pregnant women for weight management. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to develop an instrument to measure the health literacy regarding weight&#xD;
      management of pregnant women and examine its psychometric properties.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a multiphase prospective longitudinal design. While developing the items&#xD;
      of the instrument based on the review of the literature, five content experts will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the study for examining the appropriateness of the generated items. Upon&#xD;
      the approval of the Institutional Review Board, a convenience sample will be recruited to&#xD;
      establish face validity. Then the instrument will be refined according to the report derived&#xD;
      from the pretesting. The content experts will then review the revised instrument again, and&#xD;
      another 330 primigravida women will be enrolled in the study for assessing the psychometric&#xD;
      properties. The validity and reliability of the instrument will be examined through&#xD;
      evaluating the internal consistency reliability, split-half reliability, concurrent validity,&#xD;
      and predictive validity. Health practitioners can use this newly developed instrument to&#xD;
      assess pregnant women's health literacy to help manage their weight gain during pregnancy. By&#xD;
      utilizing this instrument, health practitioners can provide individually tailored nursing&#xD;
      care to improve the effectiveness of their weight management.&#xD;

    <description>This study uses the short-form health literacy questionnaire (HL-SF12) to check the level of health literacy.The perceived difficulty of each health-related task was rated on 4-point Likert scales (1=very difficult, 2=difficult, 3=easy, and 4=very easy).An index value was thus obtained in which 0 represented the lowest HL and 50 the highest HL.The HL matrix was constructed from 4 steps of information processing in three health domains, which created a total of 12 dimensions or components of HL. The indices for HL were standardized to unified metrics from 0 to 50 using the formula; Index=(mean-1)×(50/3), where Index is the specific index calculated, mean is the mean of all participating items for each individual, 1 is the minimal possible value of the mean (leading to a minimum value of the index of 0), 3 is the range of the mean, and 50 is the chosen maximum value of the new metric.</description>
