    <textblock>
      On 11 February 2020, the International Committee for the Classification of Viruses named the&#xD;
      disease caused by SAＲS-CoV-2 infection in humans as the new coronavirus pneumonia&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19). People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)&#xD;
      are affected by their underlying diseases and are listed by the World Health Organization&#xD;
      (WHO) as a high-risk population of SARS-CoV-2 infection.To evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in those patients with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
      infection , and to guide the COVID-19 vaccination more scientifically, reasonably and&#xD;
      effectively, this study was carried out.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), affected by their underlying&#xD;
      diseases, are listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a high-risk population for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection.. More attention should be paid to personal protection and disease&#xD;
      prevention. Vaccination of COVID-19 can effectively prevent COVID-19 virus infection and&#xD;
      delay or prevent patients from developing into critical illness and reduce mortality. The&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in this population were evaluated in order to&#xD;
      play a scientific and theoretical supporting role in guiding COVID-19 vaccination more&#xD;
      scientifically, reasonably and effectively. The samples of this study were collected and&#xD;
      tested in the second affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. Patients with&#xD;
      contraindications for vaccination will be excluded. The detected indexes included blood&#xD;
      routine test, CD4, HIV virus load, COVID-19 antibody titer, antibody duration and other&#xD;
      indexes of healthy people (control group) and HIV infenction people after vaccination ( 1, 3,&#xD;
      6 months after vaccination). The adverse reactions related to the vaccine were recorded.&#xD;
