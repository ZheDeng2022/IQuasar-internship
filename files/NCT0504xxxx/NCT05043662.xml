    <textblock>
      Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) diagnosis include urography using computed tomography&#xD;
      urography (CTU) or urography using MRI (MRU). The sensitivity of CTU decreases substan¬tially&#xD;
      with decreasing lesion size. Other drawbacks of CTU include the radiation exposure and&#xD;
      potential adverse effects in patients with allergic reactions or pre-existing renal&#xD;
      impairment. In terms of urine cytology, the major drawbacks of urine cytology are low&#xD;
      sensitivity and highly dependent of the experience and skills of the cytopathologist. We here&#xD;
      intended to investigate whether UroCAD can be added in the diagnostic work-up of UTUC&#xD;
      patient, and improve the accuracy of predicting UTUC before surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The recommendations for imaging in UTUC diagnosis include urography using CTU or MRU. In the&#xD;
      standard diag¬nostic work up, urine cytology and a cystoscopy to rule out a concomitant&#xD;
      bladder tumor are also advised. In addition, diagnostic ureterorenoscopy and biopsy are&#xD;
      advised in patients in whom the findings of these pro¬cedures could influence treatment&#xD;
      decisions, The sensitivity of CTU decreases substan¬tially with decreasing lesion size. For&#xD;
      polypoid tumors of 5-10 mm maximal diameter, CTU has a high sensitivity and specificity, but&#xD;
      sensitivity decreases to 89% for lesions &lt;5 mm and further to 40% for lesions &lt;3 mm. Flat&#xD;
      lesions are even more difficult to diagnose. Other drawbacks of CTU include the radiation&#xD;
      exposure and the need for intravenous contrast media with accompa¬nying potential adverse&#xD;
      effects in patients with allergic reactions or pre-existing renal impairment. In terms of&#xD;
      urine cytology, the major drawbacks of urine cytology tests: the sensitivity of positive&#xD;
      urine cytology is highly dependent on tumor grade and decreases to 12% for low-grade tumors&#xD;
      and 15% for non-invasive stage Ta tumors. Hence, low-grade urothelial tumors cannot be&#xD;
      reliably detected by urine cytology. Finally, the accuracy of the cytology findings is highly&#xD;
      dependent of the experience and skills of the cytopathologist. Our previous study has proved&#xD;
      that UroCAD, which is able to detect chromosomal aberrations of the urine exfoliated cells,&#xD;
      is a reliable method in diagnosing urothelial carcinoma with sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      82.5% and 96.9%, respectively. But its potential role in diagnosis of UTUC in combination&#xD;
      with CTU and cytology hasn't been assessed yet and the accuracy of UroCAD in detecting UTUC&#xD;
      still need to be further validated. We here intended to investigate whether UroCAD can be&#xD;
      added in the diagnostic work-up of UTUC patient, and improve the accuracy of predicting UTUC&#xD;
      before surgery.&#xD;
