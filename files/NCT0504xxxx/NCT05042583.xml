      Lobe resection of complex process Traumatic big liver door block causes the body's nervous&#xD;
      system very excited or inhibit the endocrine system, immune excessive activation of&#xD;
      inflammatory cells, triggering and cause dysfunction of the immune inflammatory reaction, of&#xD;
      patients with injury of tissues and organs and affect its repair, increase the risk of&#xD;
      complications after liver resection, affected lobe resection in patients with postoperative&#xD;
      rapid recovery. Stellate ganglion block has been widely used in the treatment of various&#xD;
      systemic diseases due to its advantages of simple operation and obvious effect. SGB has broad&#xD;
      application prospects and can promote postoperative recovery of patients undergoing major&#xD;
      surgery, but its effect on the rapid recovery of patients undergoing liver lobectomy and its&#xD;
      mechanism remain to be further explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stellate ganglion, also known as cervicothoracic sympathetic ganglion, is a fusion of the&#xD;
      subcervical sympathetic ganglion emitted from C3-C7 and the first thoracic sympathetic&#xD;
      ganglion, located in the lateral lateral of the transverse tubercle of the 7th cervical&#xD;
      vertebra and the cervical protubertion of the first rib, and receives THE T1-T2 nerve SGB,&#xD;
      which is mainly manifested in the central and peripheral nerves The central function is to&#xD;
      maintain the stability of internal environment by regulating the activity of hypothalamus.&#xD;
      The peripheral effect is mainly manifested by blocking the preganglionic and postganglionic&#xD;
      fibers, which inhibits the muscle tension, cardiovascular movement and bronchoconstrictor&#xD;
      glands in the distribution area to secrete pain conduction, so as to achieve the purpose of&#xD;
      treating diseases such as heart, lung, head and neck. The study also found that SGB can&#xD;
      regulate the endocrine system autonomic nervous system and immune system, and play an&#xD;
      important role in maintaining the stability of the body's internal environment. SGB is&#xD;
      considered a very important weapon for modern anesthesiologists. The clinical application of&#xD;
      SGB is not only for the pain treatment of head, face, neck, shoulder and limb, but also for&#xD;
      the treatment of arrhythmia, traumatic stress and the control of hypertension. SGB has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective in treating ventricular arrhythmias, stopping ventricular tachycardia&#xD;
      in patients with long QT syndrome, and ventricular fibrillation with recurrent acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. SGB has a certain therapeutic effect on pulmonary hypertension by&#xD;
      down-regulating sympathetic activity and improving endothelial dysfunction. SGB can regulate&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction, promote gastrointestinal motility recovery, and has obvious&#xD;
      curative effect on gastrointestinal diseases. Studies have confirmed that SGB can&#xD;
      significantly decrease serum inflammatory cytokines IL-1B,IL-6 and TNF-α. Planetary ganglion&#xD;
      block in patients with severe trauma showed significant downregulation of inflammatory&#xD;
      factors IL-1B,IL-6 and TNF-α in patients with 6, 24 and 72 hours, suggesting that SGB has a&#xD;
      regulatory role in the early inflammatory response of trauma and improves the prognosis of&#xD;
      acute trauma. SGB can reduce the inflammatory response, improve gastrointestinal dysfunction&#xD;
      and promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function after surgery by reducing stress&#xD;
      response, inhibiting the synthesis of cytokines inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide&#xD;
      synthase&#xD;

    <description>The probe direction was 30-45 degrees from the sagittal plane of the neck. The anterior nodules of the transverse process of the sixth cervical vertebra were displayed. The important anatomical structures were distinguished, and the internal carotid artery and longus cervical muscle were observed. A 25G, 6cm puncture needle was used with the tip beveled downward, and the needle path and tip were shown under ultrasound. The tip reached the high-echo sieve structure between the carotid artery and longus cervical muscle, and the drug solution was injected after withdrawal without blood and gas . The experimental group was injected with 6ml 0.5% ropivacaine.</description>
