      Leukotac (inolimomab) is not approved yet for marketing in any region. In the absence of&#xD;
      medical options and based on the safety and efficacy data obtained during the clinical&#xD;
      development program (in a phase III (INO-107) and in a Long Term Follow Up study), the French&#xD;
      National Agency for the Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) granted a Temporary&#xD;
      Authorisation for Use (ATU) so-called cohort ATU (cATU) for LEUKOTAC® (inolimomab) and&#xD;
      approved the temporary use protocol .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This early access program has been granted to Leukotac (inolimomab) in adults and in children&#xD;
      over 28 days of age, for treatment of acute cortico-resistant or cortico-dependent grades&#xD;
      II-IV acute graft versus host disease (GvHD) according to the Glucksberg classification after&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite improvements in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)&#xD;
      settings, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains a significant issue after transplantation&#xD;
      and a major cause of non-relapse mortality. Acute GvHD (aGvHD) still develops in about 30% to&#xD;
      80% of patients, for which high dose corticosteroids can be initiated in those with grade&#xD;
      ≥II. However, up to 50% of patients fail to obtain a satisfactory response with steroid&#xD;
      treatment alone. Treatment of steroid-resistant (SR) aGvHD remains an unmet clinical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inolimomab is an IgG1 mouse monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to the alpha chain&#xD;
      of the human interleukin-2 receptor (CD25, IL-2R), a receptor expressed on the surface of the&#xD;
      T cells in response in to antigenic stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inolimomab efficacy in the treatment of corticosteroid-resistant graft-versus-host disease&#xD;
      after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant was assessed in a multicenter phase 3&#xD;
      randomized double-blind controlled study (INO-0107) versus Thymoglobulin® (anti-thymocyte&#xD;
      globulin (ATG )).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long term survival data were collected in the 43 surviving patients at the end of the phase 3&#xD;
      study INO-0107 (23 inolimomab; 20 ATG) and up to 104 months after discontinuation of&#xD;
      treatment (median follow-up: 58.4 months). These long term follow-up data showed a&#xD;
      statistically significant difference for survival with relative risk of death reduced by 43%&#xD;
      in the inolimomab group (p=0.030). These data confirm the 1-year observations of the phase 3&#xD;
      study INO-0107 with a clear clinical benefit on survival statistically greater in patients&#xD;
      receiving inolimomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukotac (inolimomab) is not approved yet for marketing in any region. This early access&#xD;
      program has been granted to Leukotac (inolimomab) in adults and in children over 28 days of&#xD;
      age, for treatment of acute cortico-resistant or cortico-dependent grades II-IV acute graft&#xD;
      versus host disease (GvHD) according to the Glucksberg classification after allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;

    <description>1 or 2 Induction Phases at 0.3 mg/kg/day for adults or 0.4 mg/kd/day for children over 8 consecutive days If no complete response (CR) occurs after 8 days, a second induction phase is conducted until day 16 (even if CR is obtained before completion of the second induction phase).&#xD;
Maintenance Phase: 0.4 mg/kg administered 3 times a week until Day 28 In case of a CR at day 9, the maintenance phase will start after day 9 and will be sustained until day 28.&#xD;
In case of a CR, partial response (PR) or mixed response (MR) at day 17, the maintenance phase will start after day 17 and will be sustained until day 28.&#xD;
Total duration of treatment is 28 ±2 days.</description>
