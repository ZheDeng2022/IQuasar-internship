    <textblock>
      PICCOLO is a Phase 2, multicenter, open label study designed to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of MIRV in participants with platinum-sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancers with high folate receptor-alpha (FRα) expression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mirvetuximab Soravtansine (MIRV) is an investigational antibody drug conjugate designed to&#xD;
      selectively kill cancer cells. The antibody (protein) part of MIRV targets tumors by&#xD;
      delivering a cell-killing drug to the tumor cells carrying a tumor-associated protein called&#xD;
      folate receptor alpha (FRα). It is being developed for the treatment of subjects with&#xD;
      recurrent platinum-sensitive, high-grade epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian&#xD;
      tube cancers with high folate receptor-alpha expression. Patients will have had at least 2&#xD;
      prior lines of therapy. These will include at least 2 lines of platinum-containing therapy or&#xD;
      1 line with a documented platinum allergy. FRα positivity will be defined by the Ventana&#xD;
      FOLR1 (FOLR1- 2.1) CDx assay (Ventana FOLR1 Assay)&#xD;
