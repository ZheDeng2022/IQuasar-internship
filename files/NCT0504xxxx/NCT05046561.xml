      Protocol STRI12 - Study to Reinforce Immunity (STRI) - A Phase 2 Double-Blind, Randomized,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Study to Reinforce Immunity (STRI) Phase 2 Clinical Trial is a randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial protocol assessing the safety and efficacy of STRI Formula&#xD;
      in non-hospitalized participants with COVID-19. STRI Formula is a combination of food-based&#xD;
      substances designed specifically to combat SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the Study is to assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction of&#xD;
      time from treatment initiation to initial meaningful clinical improvement in COVID-19&#xD;
      symptoms. Additional secondary objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the safety of STRI Formula&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction of time to COVID-19 sustained&#xD;
           symptom improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction of time to COVID-19 initial symptom&#xD;
           resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction of time to COVID-19 sustained&#xD;
           symptom resolution&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction in need for hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction in rates of fever&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To assess the efficacy of STRI Formula in reduction in rates of hypoxia&#xD;
