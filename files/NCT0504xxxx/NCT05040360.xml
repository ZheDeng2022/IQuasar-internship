    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the effect of capecitabine and temozolomide after surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients with high-risk well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs, such as capecitabine and temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving capecitabine and temozolomide after surgery could&#xD;
      prevent or delay the return of cancer in patients with high-risk well-differentiated&#xD;
      pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate recurrence-free survival (RFS) in participants with resected pancreatic&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors (pNETs) randomized to treatment with capecitabine + temozolomide&#xD;
      (CAPTEM) compared to observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate overall survival (OS) in participants randomized to treatment with CAPTEM&#xD;
      compared to observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CAPTEM compared to observation only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BANKING OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To bank specimens for future correlative studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-14 and&#xD;
      temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 10-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo surveillance with no active treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years and&#xD;
      then annually until 5 years from randomization.&#xD;
