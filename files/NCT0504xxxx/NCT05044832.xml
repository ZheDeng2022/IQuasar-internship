  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the impact of personalized music on emergence agitation&#xD;
      (EA), as measured by Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium scores in pediatric patients&#xD;
      recovering from elective procedures under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized music may help to decrease EA in children undergoing elective surgeries under&#xD;
      general anesthesia by decreasing perioperative anxiety and minimizing perceived pain. The&#xD;
      study has the potential to improve perioperative care by improving safety, decreasing the&#xD;
      need for postoperative pharmacologic and nursing interventions, thereby shortening the time&#xD;
      of recovery and improving caregiver satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants participating in this study will be randomly assigned to receive personalized&#xD;
      music plus standard of care, or standard of care alone. Those assigned to the music group&#xD;
      will receive music in the preoperative holding area as well as in the post-operative care&#xD;
      unit.&#xD;

      Study Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial of children 3-9 years of undergoing&#xD;
      myringotomy, laser treatment for skin lesions, and adenoidectomy without tonsillectomy to&#xD;
      assess the impact of perioperative personalized music on the incidence of emergence agitation&#xD;
      (EA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 2 groups in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personalized music group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard care group&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants enrolled in this study will receive a standardized anesthetic consistent&#xD;
      with standard practice at the Stanford Children's Hospital, consisting of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral midazolam (0.5mg/kg up to a maximum of 20mg) preoperatively, unless clinically&#xD;
           contraindicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inhalational induction of anesthesia, either with a combination of nitrous oxide and&#xD;
           sevoflurane or 8% sevoflurane, depending on provider preference and clinical context.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A combination of fentanyl (1 mcg/kg) and ketorolac (0.5 mg/kg) given in a single&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intramuscular (IM) injection, given while under anesthesia in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled in this study will be randomly assigned to receive personalized music&#xD;
      or standard care during the perioperative period. Those assigned to the music group will&#xD;
      receive music in the preoperative holding area as well as in the post-operative care unit in&#xD;
      addition to standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed post-operatively for emergence delirium using the Pediatric&#xD;
      Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) assessment tool. All participants will also be assessed&#xD;
      for anxiety using the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scale (mYPAS) while in the preoperative area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient guardians will be assessed for anxiety using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory&#xD;
      (STAI) during the procedure). These assessments are validated for use in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Patient demographic information, clinical documentation (clinic notes,&#xD;
      procedure reports, labs, anesthesia records, imaging reports etc.) will be collected. Data&#xD;
      collection sheet attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium (PAED) scores will be used as our primary outcomes&#xD;
      measure to assess for emergence agitation, which is a 20-point scale and assumes a normal&#xD;
      distribution. The investigators plan to collect six PAED scores for each patient taken at 10&#xD;
      minute intervals following completion of each procedure for all participants. Participants&#xD;
      will be divided randomly into two groups: half with music, and half without music. The&#xD;
      Investigators anticipate an incidence of emergence agitation in the range of 10-20% (defined&#xD;
      as a PAED score of 10 or greater) based our subject group and literature review. To assess&#xD;
      for a difference in PAED scores between groups, with a Type 1 error of 0.05, and a power of&#xD;
      0.8, the investigators estimate a need of 40 participants per group (80 participants total)&#xD;
      to detect an effect size of 0.3. The investigators plan to recruit 100 total participants in&#xD;
      order to account for potential withdrawals or protocol deviations. Secondary measures of&#xD;
      interest include the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale (mYPAS) and parental State and&#xD;
      Trait Anxiety (STAI) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator will review subject enrollment, adverse events, unanticipated&#xD;
      occurrences, and protocol deviations. Any adverse events meeting criteria will be reported to&#xD;
      the IRB. The investigators will follow the guidelines in the IRB's Adverse Event and&#xD;
      Unanticipated Problems Reporting Policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personalized music may help to decrease EA in children undergoing elective surgeries under&#xD;
      general anesthesia by decreasing perioperative anxiety and minimizing perceived pain. The&#xD;
      study has the potential to improve perioperative care by improving safety, decreasing the&#xD;
      need for postoperative pharmacologic and nursing interventions, thereby shortening the time&#xD;
      of recovery and improving caregiver satisfaction.&#xD;
