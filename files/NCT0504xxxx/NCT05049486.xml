  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to obtain finer details of tissues surrounding a lead in the pelvis using a&#xD;
      combination of high-resolution anatomical MRI sequences and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&#xD;
      DTI is a non-invasive technique sometimes described as fiber tractography that enables&#xD;
      visualization of the pathways and integrity of nerves. In this feasibility study, we plan to&#xD;
      use DTI to assess the sacral plexus and its peripheral nerves. A model will be constructed by&#xD;
      superimposing SNS lead from a CT scan onto the DTI imaging to map out the electrode position.&#xD;
      It is hoped that this study will lead to a better understanding of both therapeutic and&#xD;
      adverse stimulation effects and enable patient-specific adjustments of stimulation&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who have had successful temporary SNS and awaiting permanent SNS will be approached.&#xD;
      An assessment will be made to determine whether the patient meets the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients will be given a consent form to sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit from the outpatient clinic a total of ten patients for this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A physical examination will be performed as per standard practice. Patients will be asked to&#xD;
      fill in questionnaires probing the severity of faecal incontinence symptoms. Included&#xD;
      questionnaires are ICIQ-B4, Wexner's and St Mark's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incontinence score (see appendix). It will also evaluate any existing pain symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will undergo an MRI scan (3 Tesla) of the pelvis using sequences including&#xD;
      anatomical sequences and diffusion tensor imaging technique for construction of sacral nerve&#xD;
      tractography prior to permanent SNS. This will be performed at Mount Vernon Hospital over an&#xD;
      hour: first 30 minutes for anatomical sequences and the second 30 minutes for DTI sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A surgical procedure (implant of SNS) will be performed as per standard practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, an antibiotic will be given at induction of anesthesia prior to skin incision. All&#xD;
      types of equipment for SNS implantation will be soaked in antibiotic solution (gentamicin&#xD;
      80mg in 500ml of normal saline or equivalent). Under general anesthesia without neuromuscular&#xD;
      junction blockade and the patient in prone position, a permanent quadripolar lead (model&#xD;
      3889) will be inserted aiming to observe contraction of the anus and/or toe flexion, which&#xD;
      are signs to confirm that the lead is nearby third sacral nerve root. The lead position will&#xD;
      be confirmed by an x-ray and the lead will be connected to an implantable neurostimulator&#xD;
      which will be placed under the skin but deep enough in the upper outer area of the buttock&#xD;
      region. The procedure will be performed according to the manufacturer's manual as per our&#xD;
      clinical standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the implantation, patients will be given one generic starting program to start the&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three to 4 weeks after the procedure the patient will undergo a limited CT scan of the pelvis&#xD;
      to visualise the position of the SNS lead. The scan will focus only on the sacrum, implanted&#xD;
      lead, and rectum and will not be extended beyond this area. Imaging from this CT will be&#xD;
      superimposed to the MRI imaging the patient had pre-operatively, and a computational&#xD;
      simulation will be performed (see details below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the scan, a clinician will test stimulation settings systematically to find an optimal&#xD;
      program. Briefly, as the lead as 4 electrodes, each electrode will be tested, followed by a&#xD;
      combination of electrodes. The patient's subjective responses (type and site of sensation, if&#xD;
      there is any pain/discomfort site and nature, a degree of pain using a Lickert scale,) will&#xD;
      be recorded. The investigators will try and obtain motor response if possible, at the level&#xD;
      when patients' anus contracts slightly if this is achievable without causing significant&#xD;
      distress and pain to the patients. This is also a routine process and the clinician will note&#xD;
      if there is any specific setting that causes adverse pain and identify settings that are&#xD;
      comfortable and give stimulation sensation around the anus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computational model will be done in a computer laboratory and the record will be compared&#xD;
      and evaluated for any clinical relevance. The same set of questionnaires used during the&#xD;
      baseline evaluation will be repeated at follow-ups, as per routine care.&#xD;
