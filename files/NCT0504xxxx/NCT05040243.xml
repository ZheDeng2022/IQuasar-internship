  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Lumbar JOA Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline JOA at 4weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The JOA scale for low back pain consists of the patient's subjective symptoms (0-9 points), clinical signs (0-6 points), daily activity limitation (0-24 points) and bladder function (normal 0 points, slight loss of control-3 points, severe loss of control) -6 points) Four parts, a total score of 29 points. The total score reflects the symptoms and dysfunction of low back pain, and the score indicates the severity of the dysfunction.</description>

    <description>The JOA scale for low back pain consists of the patient's subjective symptoms (0-9 points), clinical signs (0-6 points), daily activity limitation (0-24 points) and bladder function (normal 0 points, slight loss of control-3 points, severe loss of control) -6 points) Four parts, a total score of 29 points. The total score reflects the symptoms and dysfunction of low back pain, and the score indicates the severity of the dysfunction.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scoring (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline VAS at 2weeks ,4 weeks and follow up 2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>VAS is a pain scoring scale that is currently widely used in clinical practice. The scale uses a line segment or ruler with a length of 10 cm, and the subject makes corresponding marks on the line segment according to the subjective pain intensity.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Oswestry Dysfunction Index (ODI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline ODI at 2weeks ,4 weeks and follow up 2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>ODI is a self-evaluation scale for dysfunction of patients with low back pain. It consists of 10 aspects including pain degree, personal living ability (washing, dressing), lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleep influence, sex life, social activities and travel. Each aspect covers 6 options, with points ranging from 0 to 5 points. The lowest score indicates no abnormal dysfunction, and the highest score indicates severe dysfunction. The corresponding candidate content scores are added up in turn according to the scores, and the percentage of the total score in the highest score (50 points) of all content is obtained, which is called the Oswe-stry dysfunction index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline MPQ at 2weeks ,4 weeks and follow up 2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>MPQ is a multi-factor pain score scale, which establishes a three-dimensional structure of the nature of pain. MPQ has a higher evaluation dimension and can evaluate the multi-dimensional factors of pain. The higher the score, the more severe the pain.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Concise health scale SF-36</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline SF-36 at 2weeks ,4 weeks and follow up 2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is currently one of the most widely used universal health-related quality of life measurement tools in the world. SF-36 covers 8 dimensions for assessing health-related quality of life and a total of 36 content items. Each dimension includes: physical function (PF), role physical (RP), bodily pain (BP), General health (GH), vitality (VT), social function (SF), role-emotional (RE) and mental health (MH). SF-36 first calculates the original scores of the eight dimensions, and then obtains the final score after corresponding conversion. The final score is 0-100 points. The higher the final score, the better the health of the testee.</description>

    <measure>Tenderness threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline tenderness threshold at 2weeks ,4 weeks and follow up 2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Use the digital pressure pain meter to measure the pressure pain threshold of soft tissues and muscles, and conduct an objective and quantitative assessment of pain. It is used for auxiliary diagnosis and scientific research of pain in muscles and tendons.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Averaged electromyography, AEMG</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline AEMG at 2weeks ,4 weeks and follow up 2weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Surface electromyography (sEMG) is the bioelectric change of neuromuscular activity recorded from the surface of the muscle through electrodes, which can objectively reflect the activity level and functional state of the muscle. The electromyographic biofeedback meter was used to measure the surface electromyographic signals of the paraspinal muscles on both sides during the lumbar flexion and extension exercise in the standing position, and calculate the average electromyographic value (AEMG).</description>
