  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3 study is intended to assess clinical lot-to-lot consistency by evaluating and&#xD;
      comparing the immunogenicity of three consecutively manufactured lots of Coronavirus-like&#xD;
      Particle (CoVLP).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, observer-blinded, multicenter, Phase 3 lot-to-lot consistency study in&#xD;
      approximately 900 healthy seronegative adults 18-49 years of age after the administration of&#xD;
      two doses of CoVLP (3.75 ug) adjuvanted with AS03 (referred to as &quot;CoVLP formulation&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are seronegative for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive one of three lots of the CoVLP formulation. Subjects will receive two&#xD;
      intramuscular injections 21 days apart. The same lot will be used for both IM injections in&#xD;
      each subject. Safety and immunogenicity assessments will be performed. Subjects will&#xD;
      participate in this study for approximately 49 days.&#xD;
