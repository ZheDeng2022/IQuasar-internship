    <textblock>
      As many as 250 million people suffer from allergic rhinitis in China, which has a large&#xD;
      population, early use of drugs may help better control the symptoms.This study aimed to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of early interventional treatment with the leukotriene receptor&#xD;
      antagonist (LTRA) montelukast on seasonal allergic rhinitis.&#xD;

    <measure>The change of subjective AR symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, visit 1: 2 weeks prior to the high weed pollen stage, visit 2: high weed pollen stage, visit 3: 2 weeks after the high weed pollen stage.</time_frame>
    <description>Symptom change before and after treatment was estimated by Visual analogue scale(VAS) symptom score. The VAS symptom scores ranged from 0 (asymptomatic) to 10 (very severe). The questionnaire included nasal symptoms: nasal congestion, nasal discharge, sneezing, and rhinocnesmus; eye symptoms: lacrimation, eye itching, eye redness, swelling, and ophthalmodynia; airway symptoms: wheezing, chest constriction, cough, labored breathing.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, visit 1: 2 weeks prior to the high weed pollen stage, visit 2: high weed pollen stage, visit 3: 2 weeks after the high weed pollen stage.</time_frame>
    <description>Eccovision acoustic rhinometry was used to measure the nasal cavity volume (NCV) according to standardized recommendations. Measurements of nasal volume were made from the first 2 cm (V2), the first 4 cm (V4), from the first 6 cm (V6), from the segment between 0 and 5 cm (V0-5), and the segment between 0 and 7 cm (V0-7) of the nose. All measurements were performed three times by the same operator, and nasal volumes were calculated as the sum of both nostrils24. In the current study, the change in the nasal cavity volume was measured at 2-5 cm, as this seems to be an important variable for mucosal changes.24 Nasal airway resistance (NAR) was measured by anterior active rhinomanometry in a quiet room at temperature of 25°C and humidity of 70%. NAR was measured at 75 Pa point (R75T).</description>

    <time_frame>baseline, visit 1: 2 weeks prior to the high weed pollen stage, visit 2: high weed pollen stage, visit 3: 2 weeks after the high weed pollen stage.</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the mRNA expression levels of the cytokines interleukin-4, interleukin-5, interleukin-13, leukotriene C4, RANTES, tumor necrosis factor-α, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, and EOTAXIN in the nasal mucosa before and after treatment. The qRT-PCR data were processed using the 2-△△CT method.</description>
