  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this clinical study, the investigators will compare vital parameters measurements obtained&#xD;
      using continuous data from reference monitors and continuous wireless MultiSense® monitoring&#xD;
      patch in 30 healthy volunteers under induced and controlled hypoxia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The MultiSense® strip is a unique, band aid-sized, clinical signal quality, connected strip&#xD;
      for real-time monitoring of cardio-respiratory parameters. The MultiSense® strip measures in&#xD;
      real-time, remotely and continuously 11 clinical key-indicators by being attached to the&#xD;
      patient thorax: ECG trace, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and relative&#xD;
      respiration depth, pulse transit time, plethysmographic trace, perfusion index, skin&#xD;
      temperature, physical activity and body position. Designed to be worn continuously for at&#xD;
      least seven days, the patient can keep the patch during his sleep or in the shower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to determine the quality of measurements of arterial blood&#xD;
      saturation (SpO2) provided by the MultiSense® system in comparison to measurements made with&#xD;
      a reference Pulse Oximetry System under induced hypoxia, in terms of accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes 30 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
