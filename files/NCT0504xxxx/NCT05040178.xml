      This study is being conducted to obtain short-term and long-term clinical safety information&#xD;
      from adult and pediatric patients treated for hyperammonemia due to Methylmalonic Acidemia&#xD;
      (MMA) and Propionic Acidemia (PA). This study will collect data on; developmental outcomes,&#xD;
      details of treatment with Carbaglu® and other treatments for hyperammonemia including dietary&#xD;
      and protein management, plasma ammonia levels, pregnancy and maternal complications, adverse&#xD;
      effects on the developing fetus and neonate, adverse effects on the infant through first year&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Prescribed and treated with Carbaglu®&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have an established diagnosis of PA or MMA defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diagnosed with PA by semi quantitative urine organic acid analysis, defined as&#xD;
                  presence of elevated methylcitric acid and normal methylmalonic acid levels and&#xD;
