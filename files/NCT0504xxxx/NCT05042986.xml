  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase I, open-label, nonrandomized, single dose study in healthy male&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be screened to assess their eligibility to enter the study within 28&#xD;
      days prior to the dose administration. Subjects will be admitted into the study site on Day&#xD;
      -1 and be confined to the study site until at least Day 8. On the morning of Day 1, all&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single oral dose of [14C]-SKI-O-703. Subjects will be discharged if&#xD;
      the following discharge criteria are met: plasma radioactivity levels below the limit of&#xD;
      quantitation for 2 consecutive collections, ≥ 90% mass balance recovery, and ≤ 1% of the&#xD;
      total radioactive dose is recovered in combined excreta (urine and feces) in 2 consecutive&#xD;
      24-hour periods. If discharge criteria are not met by Day 8, subjects will remain in the&#xD;
      study site up to Day 15.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SKI-O-703 is being developed by Oscotec Inc. and is currently being studied for the treatment&#xD;
      of adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis and for the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with persistent and chronic immune thrombocytopenia. SKI-O-592 (the&#xD;
      free base of SKI-O-703) has demonstrated high selectivity and potency against spleen tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase in a biochemical assay. For immunoreceptor activation linked to SYK, the effect of&#xD;
      SKI-O-592 on the anti-inflammatory response consisting of tumor necrosis factor alpha,&#xD;
      β-hexosaminidase, and CD69 expression was greater than the effects of first-generation SYK&#xD;
      inhibitors (eg, R406) in several immune cell lines and in human primary cells. This&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activity was responsible for the selective inhibition of p-SYK (Y525/526),&#xD;
      which led to the sequential inhibition of downstream effectors. In vitro studies revealed&#xD;
      excellent SYK selectivity of SKI-O-592 that led to no inhibition of SYK-independent signal&#xD;
      pathways, indicating that SKI-O-592 shows more potent anti-inflammatory activity to allow&#xD;
      continuous administration of SKI-O-703 compared with the first-generation SYK inhibitors.&#xD;
      SKI-O-703 is currently not approved or marketed in any country.&#xD;
