  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll subjects with HER2-mutated or HER2-amplified locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic solid tumor cancers whose prior standard of care therapies have failed. This&#xD;
      basket trial will evaluate ARX788 across multiple cancer populations, as defined by HER2&#xD;
