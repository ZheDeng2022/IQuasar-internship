  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On 11 February 2020, the International Committee for the Classification of Viruses named the&#xD;
      disease caused by SAＲS-CoV-2 infection in humans as the new coronavirus pneumonia&#xD;
      (coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19).Due to the decline of immunity and cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      function in the middle-aged and elderly, COVID-19 's severe illness and mortality mainly&#xD;
      occur in the middle-aged and elderly over the age of 60, especially those with basic diseases&#xD;
      (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease,&#xD;
      etc.). Vaccination of COVID-19 vaccine can effectively prevent COVID-19 virus infection and&#xD;
      delay or prevent patients from developing into critical illness and reduce mortality.To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the population vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine, and&#xD;
      to play a scientific and theoretical supporting role in guiding COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
      scientifically, reasonably and effectively, so this study was carried out.&#xD;

      Due to the decline of immunity and cardiopulmonary function in the middle-aged and elderly,&#xD;
      COVID-19 's severe illness and mortality mainly occur in the middle-aged and elderly over the&#xD;
      age of 60, especially those with basic diseases (hypertension, diabetes, chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, etc.). At present, there is no evidence that the&#xD;
      middle-aged and elderly people with these types of diseases have been vaccinated against&#xD;
      COVID-19, but CDC vaccination and the guidelines and consensus of various professional&#xD;
      societies hold that: (1) the middle-aged and elderly are susceptible; (2) the people with&#xD;
      underlying diseases have low immunity and are easy to develop into severe patients with high&#xD;
      mortality; (3) although there is no direct evidence of evidence-based medicine, it is best to&#xD;
      be vaccinated with COVID-19 vaccine in the absence of disease progression activities to&#xD;
      reduce high risk. To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the population vaccinated with&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine, and to play a scientific and theoretical supporting role in guiding&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination scientifically, reasonably and effectively, so this study was carried&#xD;
      out.&#xD;
