    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective cohort study to assess the real world effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in England. The study is using linkage of the English&#xD;
      national databases on COVID-19 vaccination, testing, medical records, hospitalization, and&#xD;
      death.&#xD;

      AZD1222 has been shown to be highly efficacious in pivotal randomized clinical trials (RCT),&#xD;
      demonstrating 82% overall efficacy against symptomatic infection and 100% efficacy against&#xD;
      severe infection. Recent unpublished data from the phase 3 pivotal trial in the United States&#xD;
      (US) showed high efficacy (85%) in people 65 years of age or older, and again confirmed 100%&#xD;
      efficacy in preventing severe cases. Although a high level of single dose efficacy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in clinical trials between 3 and 12 weeks and confirmed in early effectiveness&#xD;
      studies conducted in the United Kingdom (UK), clinical trials and effectiveness study so far&#xD;
      have not included detailed vaccine-specific analysis by age group, co-morbidities, nor have&#xD;
      they assessed vaccine impact on critical care admission, mortality, and overall outcomes.&#xD;
      Thus, it remains important to better understand vaccine effectiveness by ages, time intervals&#xD;
      between doses, and also to determine if single dose effectiveness may extend beyond 12 weeks.&#xD;
      It's also important to assess vaccine effectiveness by age groups and comorbidities for best&#xD;
      guidance for COVID-19 immunization programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UK is one of the first countries that are introducing mass vaccination campaign for&#xD;
      COVID-19 and is currently vaccinating the elderly population starting from the oldest age&#xD;
      groups (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice 2020). Three COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccines were licensed and are being used including the Moderna, the BioNTech/Pfizer, and the&#xD;
      Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines. Vaccination with the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine started in December&#xD;
      2020 and with the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine started in early January 2021. This study is to&#xD;
      primarily assess the effectiveness of the Oxford/AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine. Given the&#xD;
      known high efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine in RCT and real world evidence (RWE) studies, the&#xD;
      study is also to evaluate the Pfizer vaccine effectiveness as a validation of the study's&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
