      This experiment will use a clinical design that will collect cases in a local teaching&#xD;
      hospital. The way of convenience sampling will gather from the irritable bowel syndrome&#xD;
      patients. After a questionnaire, randomly to make invention and control groups. Invention and&#xD;
      control groups are 4 weeks and 3 weeks respectively. Each time will be for 20 minutes&#xD;
      acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation treatment. The Control group&#xD;
      will still have normal nursing. There will be 72 patients in two groups. The measured timing&#xD;
      will be in the second, fourth, and eighth weeks after the prediction and invention.&#xD;
