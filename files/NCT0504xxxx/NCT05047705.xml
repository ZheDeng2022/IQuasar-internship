  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although behavior therapy is recognized as a first-line intervention for Tourette's Disorder&#xD;
      (TD), less than 40% of adults with TD respond to this evidence-based treatment. Limited&#xD;
      tolerance for aversive premonitory urges and affective states that accompany tics may be one&#xD;
      likely factor that impedes behavior therapy outcomes. This study examines the relationship&#xD;
      between distress tolerance and tic inhibition among adults with TD, and investigates the&#xD;
      mechanism and effect of therapeutic skills training to enhance distress tolerance abilities.&#xD;
      Findings will determine the optimal approach to enhance distress tolerance among adults with&#xD;
      TD and ultimately lead to better behavior therapy outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Disorder and other persistent tic disorders collectively affect about about 1% of&#xD;
      the population, cause significant distress, and functional impairment. Although behavior&#xD;
      therapy is recognized as a first-line intervention for Tourette's Disorder (TD), less than&#xD;
      40% of adults with TD respond to this evidence-based treatment. Limited tolerance for&#xD;
      aversive premonitory urges and affective states that accompany tics may be one likely factor&#xD;
      that impedes behavior therapy outcomes. This study examines the relationship between distress&#xD;
      tolerance and tic inhibition among adults with TD, and investigates the mechanism and effect&#xD;
      of therapeutic skills training to enhance distress tolerance abilities.&#xD;

    <measure>Distress Tolerance Scale (DTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week after completion of Distress Tolerance Skills Training</time_frame>
    <description>The Distress Tolerance Scale is a 15-item self-report measure that measures the perceived capacity to tolerate distress from a multidimensional framework, including tolerance, appraisal, absorption, and regulation. Items are rated on a 1-5 Likert scale, and then summed. Score ranges from 15-75. Higher total scores indicate greater difficulty with tolerating distress.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Revised (YGTSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Within 1 week after completion of Distress Tolerance Skills Training</time_frame>
    <description>The YGTSS is a clinician-rated semi-structured interview that measures tic symptom severity over the previous week. It consists of 10-items that assess different dimensions of tic severity for motor and vocal tics, which are rated on a 0-5 scale. The YGTSS produces a Total Tic Score (range: 0-50), with higher ratings indicating greater tic severity.</description>

    <description>Individuals with TS will receive distress tolerance skill training. Therapeutic skill training will consist of 4 weekly 1-hour sessions. Skill training will occur either in-person or remotely via videoconferencing software. Sessions will focus on building participants' distress tolerance skills with strategies drawn from third-wave CBT.</description>
