      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the diagnosis and subtyping of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is verified with&#xD;
      histopathology which requires a biopsy. Because this technique is invasive, new non-invasive&#xD;
      strategies have been developed, including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). This innovative&#xD;
      technique enables microscopically detailed examination of lesions, which is useful for&#xD;
      diagnosing and identification of various subtypes of BCC. The diagnostic value of the&#xD;
      VIVOSIGHT OCT in daily clinical practice, has not been established to date.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic value and usability of OCT in the&#xD;
      diagnosis and subtyping of clinically suspect BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective observational trial, the VIVOSIGHT OCT device will be used on all&#xD;
      patients attending the policlinic Dermatology of the MUMC and will undergo a skin biopsy.&#xD;
      Information collected from OCT images will be compared with the clinical diagnosis by the&#xD;
      specialist, including dermatoscopy, and the gold standard consisting of the histopathological&#xD;
      diagnosis obtained from biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients attending the policlinic Dermatology of the MUMC that will undergo a skin&#xD;
      biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will be asked for informed consent to participate in this study&#xD;
      before the planned biopsy is performed. The consent includes the undergoing of the imaging&#xD;
      and extracting the pathology report from the patient's file. Imaging of the lesion will be&#xD;
      performed subsequently, which is non-invasive and requires only several minutes of time.&#xD;
      After the imaging, the patient is treated conform regular care: the following biopsy will be&#xD;
      send for histopathologic examination by the pathologist, and the patient will hear the&#xD;
      outcome of this investigation via his or her own physician. The histopathologic diagnosis and&#xD;
      subtype will be obtained from the pathology report to compare with the diagnosis and subtype&#xD;
      based on clinical diagnosis and OCT imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study parameters comprise the diagnostic value of OCT imaging for BCC, defined as&#xD;
      the sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative predictive value, compared with the&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis and the gold standard of histopathological diagnosis. Secondary outcome is&#xD;
      the value of OCT for subtyping BCC. Retrospectively, the necessity of a biopsy to confirm the&#xD;
      diagnosis will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is conducted during regular patient care. Patients that are planned to have a&#xD;
      skin biopsy for histopathological study will be asked to participate and provide informed&#xD;
      consent. When a biopsy is planned, the OCT imaging will be performed while the patients are&#xD;
      waiting for the biopsy to be prepared, the OCT imaging process is performed by the&#xD;
      investigator. The outcome of the planned biopsy will be used as the gold standard for&#xD;
      comparison with OCT. The results of this biopsy will be extracted from the pathology report&#xD;
      in the electronic patient history file. Possible risks for biopsies are not influenced by the&#xD;
      OCT imaging apparatus and include: post-operative bleeding, allergic reactions, wound&#xD;
      infection and hematoma formation. With OCT imaging valuable information can be obtained&#xD;
      without influencing the regular care procedure. This is benificial because in the future the&#xD;
      non-invasive OCT might replace invasive skin biopsies.&#xD;

    <description>OCT is an imaging technique, which is able to produce real-time, in vivo, cross-sectional images of lesions with a depth of 1,5-2 mm. OCT imaging is based on light-interferometry, calculating the interference of an optical beam reflected by the tissue with a reference. [2] In such ways, microscopic details of lesions and tissues can be visualized. This information could be used to identify a lesion as BCC, and further specify the subtype. Therefore, the use of the OCT can reduce the number of biopsies and the accompanying morbidity.</description>
