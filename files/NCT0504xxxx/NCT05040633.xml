  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this double-blind randomized control trial (RCT) is to evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of LLLT as adjunctive therapy to standard exercise treatment in&#xD;
      patients with non-specific chronic LBP. Specifically, the study will aim to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of adjunct LLLT in the reduction of pain in patients as well as determine its&#xD;
      long-term functional outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Low back pain (LBP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders and the leading cause&#xD;
      of years lived with disability worldwide with significant socioeconomic impacts. Around 10-15&#xD;
      % of LBP patients develop chronic symptoms lasting more than 3 months, and this is considered&#xD;
      chronic, with the causes often being &quot;non-specific&quot; with no identifiable causes. Despite the&#xD;
      availability of medication-based protocols, the management of non-specific chronic LBP&#xD;
      (NSCLBP) is an increasing challenge to clinicians and their patients. Adjunctive therapy can&#xD;
      play an important role in the treatment of NSCLBP. In recent decades, low-level laser therapy&#xD;
      (LLLT) has been widely used to relieve pain caused by different musculoskeletal disorders.&#xD;
      Though widely used and reported as a safe, non-invasive treatment with minimal side effects;&#xD;
      reported therapeutic outcomes of LLLT are varied and conflicting, due in part to&#xD;
      methodological concerns, lack of data and unclear results.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be allocated to three groups and provided with one of the following interventions: (i) Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) therapy in combination with standard exercise therapy (Arm 1), (ii) sham LLLT therapy in combination with standard exercise therapy (Arm 2), or (iii) exercise therapy alone (Arm 3).&#xD;
Participants will receive treatment three times per week for four consecutive weeks (i.e., each participant will receive a total of 12 treatment sessions; see section 2, Trial Design).</intervention_model_description>

    <masking_description>Randomization codes will be generated by a member of the trial team who is not involved in the day-to-day running of the trial, nor will they be involved in future data analysis. Each participant's randomized code will be kept in a sealed envelope to be opened only by the assessor during the first trial visit. The assessor and patients will be blinded to treatment allocation but physiotherapists offering treatment will not be blinded to treatment allocation.</masking_description>
