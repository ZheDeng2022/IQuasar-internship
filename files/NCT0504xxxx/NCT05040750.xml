  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By July 9, 2020, the global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection had resulted in over 11.8&#xD;
      million confirmed cases and over 545000 deaths. Patients with a history of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease are especially vulnerable and have a bad prognosis. According to the findings,&#xD;
      cardiac injury manifested by cardiac biomarker elevation is detected in a significant number&#xD;
      of COVID-19 patients and is linked to poor outcomes and mortality. However, it is unclear how&#xD;
      effective cardiac biomarkers are in COVID-19 prognosis and how to use these indicators.&#xD;

      The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has led to &gt;11.8 million confirmed cases with&#xD;
      &gt;545000 deaths worldwide by July 9, 2020 Patients with preexisting cardiovascular conditions&#xD;
      are particularly at risk and have poor prognosis data suggest that cardiac injury, manifested&#xD;
      by cardiac biomarker elevation, is detected in a sizable of COVID-19 patients and is&#xD;
      associated with adverse outcomes and increased mortality. However, how useful cardiac&#xD;
      biomarkers are in COVID-19 prognosis and how to utilize these markers have not been well&#xD;
      defined The study will include all moderate to severe COVID 19 patients admitted to ICU. Both&#xD;
      genders within the age group 18-60 years were included. The primary outcome is the relation&#xD;
      between cardiac markers and mortality rate in critically ill COVID 19 patients The secondary&#xD;
      outcome is the relationship between cardiac and inflammatory and coagulation markers&#xD;
