  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with cancer, resistance training appears to be a safe and effective exercise&#xD;
      modality to increase both lean muscle mass and strength, as well as attenuates cancer-related&#xD;
      fatigue. It may serve as a feasible intervention in these patients to mitigate cachexia,&#xD;
      especially if implemented before the onset of cancer cachexia or in a pre-cachectic state.&#xD;
      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial that will compare a metabolic-stress&#xD;
      induced resistance training intervention during the pre- (prehabilitation) and post-operative&#xD;
      (rehabilitation) phase in patients with pancreatic and biliary tract cancer, versus usual&#xD;
      care on skeletal muscle and other health-related outcomes.&#xD;
