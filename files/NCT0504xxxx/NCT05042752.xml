      The purpose of this study is to assess whether clinical ultrasound (CU)-guided treatment in&#xD;
      acute heart failure (AHF) is superior to the standard care (SC)-guided treatment. We would&#xD;
      like to see if using a portable ultrasound to guide diuretic therapy for AHF patients will&#xD;
      prevent hospital readmissions in the setting of hospitalization at home (HAH). This study&#xD;
      will use a handheld ultrasound called IVIZ-Sonosite and aims to see whether changing diuretic&#xD;
      therapy based on the performance of the ultrasound will result in the less hospitalizations&#xD;
      for heart failure as compared to performing just SC-guided therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      AHF remains a leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Despite advances in medical&#xD;
      treatment, an estimated 250,000-300,000 AHF patients are hospitalized in the United States&#xD;
      each year for symptoms caused by low cardiac output. Although the events that cause acute&#xD;
      decompensation are multifactorial, the common pathway associated with decreased ventricular&#xD;
      function are autonomic dysfunction and fluid retention. It has been previously suggested that&#xD;
      an estimated 50%-66% of CHF hospitalizations may be preventable with improved monitoring of&#xD;
      fluid volume status. In Spain, more than 10% of discharged patients are readmitted within 30&#xD;
      days. AHF is one of the most frequent reasons for readmission, mainly because of&#xD;
      congestion-related symptoms. The size and shape of the inferior vena cava and the presence of&#xD;
      B lines have proven to be effective to estimate volume overload and to guide diuretic&#xD;
      treatment in AHF on a hospital setting. At the same time, technology is quickly evolving and&#xD;
      new approaches for clinical care are arising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is two compare SC-guided therapy vs CU-guided therapy in AHF patients&#xD;
      admitted on a HAH. We designed an open label clinical trial, in which patients are randomized&#xD;
      into two groups: &quot;ultrasound group&quot; who undergoes CU together with SC and &quot;control group&quot; who&#xD;
      undergoes SC only. Diuretic treatment will be tailored according to the findings of the SC&#xD;
      together with the CU or according to the findings of the SC respectively. A total of 140&#xD;
      patients will be recruited, 70 patients on each arm. The outcome variables are readmission&#xD;
      for AHF and other causes, mortality for AHF and other causes, and the combined event of&#xD;
      readmission for AHF and mortality for AHF at one month and two months. The CU protocol will&#xD;
      include both lung ultrasound and inferior vena cava measurement and will be performed with an&#xD;
      ultraportable device (IVIZ-Sonosite). Standard care will involve physical examination and&#xD;
      basic complementary tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The way patients end up admitted to HAH are transferences from the emergency room, from the&#xD;
      internal medicine ward, from the clinics and from primary care. During admission, daily&#xD;
      visits are carried out by the nursing staff (except when clinical stability and no need to&#xD;
      intravenous treatment infusions) and every two days by the medical team. Admission in the HAH&#xD;
      is always voluntary and patients can decide to return to hospital during HAH stay. In the HAH&#xD;
      unit, there is a 24-hour telephone service coordinated by a specialized nurse on call.&#xD;
