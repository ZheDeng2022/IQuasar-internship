  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain in CP entails several independent yet overlapping mechanisms including oxidative&#xD;
      stress-mediated parenchymal inflammation, pancreatic and central neuropathy and&#xD;
      neuroplasticity. Medical modalities for long-term pain management includes antioxidants and&#xD;
      neuromodulators. Pancreatic enzymes are also invariably used for pain management. CP with&#xD;
      ductal obstruction and pain is treated with either endotherapy or drainage surgery. However,&#xD;
      it has been observed that a substantially increasing proportion of patients experience pain&#xD;
      recurrence as the duration of follow-up after endotherapy or surgery gets longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural and dietary (proteins) stimuli activate CCK receptors in D1 &amp; D2 which gives a&#xD;
      positive feedback signal for pancreatic secretion. Once enzyme secretion starts, due to&#xD;
      ductal and interstitial/tissue hypertension, nociception begins that results in pain.&#xD;
      Blockade of the duodenal CCK receptors could inhibit the positive feedback loop, thereby&#xD;
      reducing pancreatic secretion and resulting pain. Currently available enteric coated enzyme&#xD;
      supplements are released throughout the small bowel and therefore may not be released&#xD;
      sufficiently in the duodenum to effectively suppress the feedback loops. High doses of&#xD;
      proteases (~25k-30k) would be required to block the receptors, while most of the currently&#xD;
      available preparations have higher lipase but not proteases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This led to the investigators' hypothesis that negative feedback of CCK by non enteric coated&#xD;
      pancreatic enzymes could ameliorate pain in a more effective manner by NE-PERT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a fibro-inflammatory disorder of the pancreas characterized by&#xD;
      progressive and irreversible damage. It manifests with abdominal pain and/or exocrine or&#xD;
      endocrine insufficiency. Recurrent abdominal pain is the dominant clinical hallmark that&#xD;
      mandates aggressive management. Pain in CP entails several independent yet overlapping&#xD;
      mechanisms including oxidative stress-mediated parenchymal inflammation, pancreatic and&#xD;
      central neuropathy and neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical modalities for long-term pain management includes antioxidants and neuromodulators.&#xD;
      Pancreatic enzymes are also invariably used for pain management. CP with ductal obstruction&#xD;
      and pain is treated with either endotherapy or drainage surgery. However, it has been&#xD;
      observed that a substantially increasing proportion of patients experience pain recurrence as&#xD;
      the duration of follow-up after endotherapy or surgery gets longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been postulated that neural and dietary (proteins) stimuli activate CCK receptors in&#xD;
      D1 &amp; D2 which gives a positive feedback signal for pancreatic secretion. Once enzyme&#xD;
      secretion from the pancreas begins, due to ductal and interstitial/tissue hypertension,&#xD;
      nociception is initiated that results in pain. On this premise, the investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that blocking the duodenal CCK receptors could inhibit the positive feedback&#xD;
      loop, thereby reducing pancreatic secretion and resulting pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier meta-analyses that evaluated the effect of pancreatic enzyme supplementation on pain&#xD;
      reported that there were no overall benefits in pain management. All but two of those studies&#xD;
      used enteric coated enzyme. Currently available enteric coated enzyme supplements are&#xD;
      released throughout the small bowel and therefore may not be released sufficiently in the&#xD;
      duodenum to effectively suppress the feedback loops. High doses of proteases (~25k-30k) would&#xD;
      be required to block the receptors, while most of the currently available preparations have&#xD;
      higher lipase but not proteases. However, on subgroup analyses in the aforementioned&#xD;
      meta-analyses, pain reduction was observed in the two studies that used non-enteric coated&#xD;
      preparations. These studies were done several years earlier, had a small sample size, and had&#xD;
      a cross over design. This formed that rationale of the investigators' current study to test&#xD;
      the hypothesis using a statistically valid design with a higher sample size that would allow&#xD;
      subgroup analyses, adjust for alternative pain mechanisms, and achieve a better effect size.&#xD;
