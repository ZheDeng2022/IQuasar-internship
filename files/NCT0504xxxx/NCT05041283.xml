      In order to improve bowel preparation for colonoscopy and consequently enhance detection rate&#xD;
      of malignant and premalignant findings, a prospective, randomized and controlled three-arm&#xD;
      study was developed. Patients who undergo ambulatory colonoscopy are randomly assigned into a&#xD;
      control group with standard preparation, a phone call supported preparation group or a group&#xD;
      supported by an artificial intelligence based chatbot. Primary endpoint is defined as quality&#xD;
      of bowel preparation (Boston Bowel Preparation Score), secondary endpoints are patients&#xD;
      satisfaction, comprehensiveness of bowel preparation, sedation dose, rate of coecal&#xD;
      intubation and the rate of adenoma and polyp detection, anxiety referred to colonoscopy and&#xD;
      patients satisfaction with preparation support.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate bowel preparation is crucial for detection of adenoma and polyps of the colon, which&#xD;
      can transform into malignant and premalignant lesions. In particular ambulatory performed&#xD;
      colonoscopy is often insufficient due to inadequate preparation by patients at home. To focus&#xD;
      this issue, a artificial intelligence based chatbot was developed to help patients who&#xD;
      undergo bowel preparation by answering questions concerning bowel preparation. To compare the&#xD;
      effect of this program, a three-arm randomized, controled multicentric clinical trial was&#xD;
      developed. All patients who undergo ambulatory colonoscopy and meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
      (18 y.o., informed consent, WhatsApp access) were randomized in a standard preparation group&#xD;
      (medical briefing and preparation brochure), a group receiving phone calls with instructions&#xD;
      for bowel preparation and a third group with access to the chat bot answering questions&#xD;
      concerning bowel preparation and examination conduct. As the primary end point, the quality&#xD;
      of bowel preparation measured as Boston Bowel Preparation Scale was defined. As secondary&#xD;
      endpoints patients satisfaction, comprehensiveness of bowel preparation, sedation dose, rate&#xD;
      of coecal intubation, the rate of adenoma and polyp detection, anxiety referred to&#xD;
      colonoscopy and patients satisfaction with preparation support were measured.&#xD;
