  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether anesthesiology clinicians working in a telemedicine setting can&#xD;
      predict patient risk for postoperative complications (death and acute kidney injury) more&#xD;
      accurately with access to a machine learning display than without it.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Perioperative Outcome Risk Assessment with Computer Learning Enhancement (Periop ORACLE)&#xD;
      study will be a sub-study nested within the ongoing TECTONICS trial (NCT03923699). TECTONICS&#xD;
      is a single-center randomized clinical trial assessing the impact of an anesthesiology&#xD;
      control tower (ACT) on postoperative 30-day mortality, delirium, respiratory failure, and&#xD;
      acute kidney injury. As part of the TECTONICS trial, investigators in the ACT perform medical&#xD;
      record case reviews during the early part of surgery and document how likely they feel each&#xD;
      patient is to experience postoperative death and acute kidney injury (AKI). In Periop ORACLE,&#xD;
      these case reviews will be randomized to be performed with or without access to machine&#xD;
      learning (ML) predictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators in the ACT will conduct all case reviews by viewing the patient's records in&#xD;
      AlertWatch (AlertWatch, Ann Arbor, MI) and Epic (Epic, Verona, WI). AlertWatch is an&#xD;
      FDA-approved patient monitoring system designed for use in the operating room. The version of&#xD;
      AlertWatch used in this study has been customized for use in a telemedicine setting. Epic is&#xD;
      the electronic health record system utilized at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Each case review will&#xD;
      be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to be completed with or without ML assistance. If the case&#xD;
      review is randomized to ML assistance, the investigator will access a display interface&#xD;
      (currently deployed as a web application on a secure server) that shows real-time ML&#xD;
      predicted likelihood for postoperative death and postoperative AKI. If the case review is not&#xD;
      randomized to ML assistance, the investigator will not access this display. After viewing the&#xD;
      patient's data, the investigator will predict how likely the patient is to experience&#xD;
      postoperative death and postoperative AKI and will document this prediction. The area under&#xD;
      the receiver operating characteristic curves for predictions made with ML assistance and&#xD;
      without ML assistance will be compared.&#xD;
