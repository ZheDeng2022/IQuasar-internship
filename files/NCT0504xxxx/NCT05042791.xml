      This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of SRT combined with pyrotinib and capecitabine&#xD;
      in the treatment of patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer patients with brain&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Brain metastases occur in 30-50% of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. In&#xD;
      the case of multiple brain metastases, radiation therapy is the preferred therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches. However, the side effects of WBRT for long-lived patients are also obvious, such&#xD;
      as irreversible decline in cognitive function and decline in memory function. WBRT can also&#xD;
      cause extensive hair loss and extensive white matter lesions on imaging. Pyrotinib as an oral&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor has good efficacy and safety in patients with breast cancer brain&#xD;
      metastases. Therefore, in order to reduce the impact of WBRT on the cognitive function, a&#xD;
      phase II clinical study of SRT versus WBRT combined with pyrotinib and capecitabine in the&#xD;
      treatment of MBC with brain metastases was carried out to explore the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      radiotherapy de-escalation therapy.&#xD;
