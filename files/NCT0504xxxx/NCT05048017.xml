      To observe and evaluate the efficacy, safety and biomarker analysis of regorafenib combined&#xD;
      with PD-1 inhibitor for the second-line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.In this study,&#xD;
      20 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be enrolled for regorafenib combined with PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy.In the absence of any of the following conditions, such as withdrawal of&#xD;
      informed consent by subjects, intolerable drug side effects, or the investigator's&#xD;
      determination that further study is not appropriate, the expected study treatment for each&#xD;
      subject will continue until radiologically confirmed tumor progression. Efficacy indicators&#xD;
      and safety indicators will be observed during the trial.&#xD;

    <description>Regorafenib (BAY 73-4506, Stivarga®) is an oral diphenylurea multi-kinase inhibitor that targets angiogenic (VEGFR1-3, TIE2), stromal (PDGFR-β, FGFR), and oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases (KIT, RET, and RAF).&#xD;
Camrelizumab (AiRuiKa™), a programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) inhibitor being developed by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. Ltd, recently received conditional approval in China for the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma.&#xD;
Toripalimab, a recombinant, humanized programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody that binds to PD-1 and prevents binding of PD-1 with programmed death ligands 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2), is being developed by Shanghai Junshi Bioscience Co., Ltd in China for the treatment of various cancers.&#xD;
Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) is one of the checkpoints that regulates the immune response. Ligation of PD1 with its ligands PDL1 and PDL2 results in transduction of negative signals to T-cells.</description>

             using disease modulators, corticosteroids, or immunosuppressive agents). Alternative&#xD;
             therapy (e.g., physiological corticosteroid replacement therapy for thyroxine,&#xD;
             insulin, or adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered as a form of&#xD;
             systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Reproductive women: Agree to abstain from sex (avoid heterosexual intercourse) or use&#xD;
             a contraceptive method with an annual contraceptive failure rate &lt; 1% during treatment&#xD;
             and for at least 6 months after the last administration.&#xD;

             reasons other than menopause are found), and have not undergone sterilization (removal&#xD;
             of the ovaries and/or uterus), it is considered that the patient is fertile.&#xD;
&#xD;
             16.2 Examples of contraceptive methods with an annual contraceptive failure rate &lt; 1%&#xD;
             include bilateral fallopian tube ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives&#xD;
             that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices and copper-ring&#xD;
             intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
             16.3 The reliability of sexual control should be evaluated relative to the duration of&#xD;
             the clinical trial and the preferred and daily lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (for example, calendar days, ovulatory period, symptomatic body&#xD;
             temperature, or post-ovulation methods) and external ejaculation are unacceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Male: Agree to abstinence (not having heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive&#xD;
             measures, and agree not to donate sperm, defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             17.1 When his female partner has fertility, the male patient must abstain from sex&#xD;
             during treatment and within 6 months after the last administration, or use condoms and&#xD;
             other contraceptive methods to make the annual contraceptive failure rate &lt; 1%. Male&#xD;
             patients must agree not to donate sperm during the same time period. When his female&#xD;
             partner is pregnant, the male patient must abstain from sex or use a condom for&#xD;
             contraception during the treatment period and within 6 months after the last dose to&#xD;
             avoid the fetus being affected by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. The reliability of sexual control should be evaluated relative to the duration of the&#xD;
             clinical trial and the preferred and daily lifestyle of the patient. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (for example, calendar days, ovulatory period, symptomatic body&#xD;
             temperature, or post-ovulation methods) and external ejaculation are unacceptable&#xD;
             methods of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Before the first dose of study medication for biomarker analysis, archived tumor&#xD;
             tissue or new tissue biopsy specimens must be available. In the case when the archived&#xD;
             tissue cannot be provided, and the biopsy cannot be performed, participants can&#xD;
             consult the investigator and join the group after obtaining the investigator's&#xD;
