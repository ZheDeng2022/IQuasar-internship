  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death in older&#xD;
      Americans. COPD increases in frequency with age, and older adults with COPD often have&#xD;
      significant unmet geriatrics-palliative care needs that results in reduced quality of life,&#xD;
      high healthcare utilization, and care at the end of life that does not align with the values&#xD;
      and wishes of patients and their care partners. Older adults with COPD could benefit from&#xD;
      proactive geriatrics-palliative care before the end of life. However, no&#xD;
      geriatrics-palliative care interventions have been systematically developed and tested in&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults with COPD and their care partners. As the number of older&#xD;
      adults with COPD increases to levels unmatched by current palliative care workforce trends,&#xD;
      innovative strategies are desperately needed to improve the delivery of geriatrics-palliative&#xD;
      care in COPD before the end of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project EPIC (Early Palliative Care In COPD) is a multiphase study to refine and pilot test&#xD;
      the ENABLE-COPD early palliative care intervention in older adults with COPD and their care&#xD;
      partners. ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise Before Life Ends) is an early palliative care&#xD;
      intervention that improves quality of life and mood for patients with advanced cancer and has&#xD;
      underwent decades of iterative refinement and rigorous randomized controlled trial testing.&#xD;
      In the intervention, palliative care-trained nurse coaches deliver the Charting Your Course&#xD;
      Curriculum over the phone to patients (six sessions) and their care partners (four sessions),&#xD;
      with activities and monthly telephone follow-up following a manualized curriculum. We&#xD;
      conducted a formative evaluation in a diverse and multidisciplinary group of stakeholders to&#xD;
      refine ENABLE for patients with COPD and pilot tested the potential feasibility of the&#xD;
      refined intervention, ENABLE-COPD, in patients and their care partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study summatively evaluates ENABLE-COPD through a hybrid type-1&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementation pilot randomized controlled trial in dyads of community-dwelling&#xD;
      older adults with moderate to very severe COPD and their care partners randomized to usual&#xD;
      COPD care (control) versus usual COPD care + ENABLE-COPD (intervention). The primary outcomes&#xD;
      are trial and intervention feasibility and acceptability. Secondary geriatrics-palliative&#xD;
      care outcomes include Life-Space mobility, quality of life, cognitive impairment, functional&#xD;
      status, healthcare utilization, palliative care uptake, and care partner burden.&#xD;

    <measure>UAB Life Space Assessment (LSA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>15-item measure of Life-Space mobility, or the frequency, distance, and independence of movement in the 4 weeks prior to administration. Scores range from 0-120, and lower scores are associated with more restricted Life-Space mobility. A threshold LSA score of &gt;=60 is used to identify restricted Life-Space mobility, which is a marker of social isolation, frailty, and predictor of healthcare utilization in older adults. We have also demonstrated that restricted Life-Space mobility predicts severe exacerbations of COPD. MCID=5 points with an alpha=0.80.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3 months, 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>14-item measure of emotional symptoms with a 7-item anxiety subscale and a 7-item depression subscale. Each question has a 4-point Likert scale, and scores from 0-21 per subscale, with higher scores associated with more severe anxiety and depressive symptoms. A subscale score &gt;=8 on each subscale is the accepted threshold for clinically-elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms. The minimal clinically important difference is 1.5 points on each subscale with an alpha=0.82-0.83.</description>

ENABLE (Educate, Nurture, Advise, Before Life Ends) is a theory-based, rigorously tested, and multicomponent early palliative care model that improved quality of life and emotional symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. The PI adapted ENABLE to meet the specific needs of patients with COPD and their care partners. ENABLE-COPD includes a series of weekly telephone-based, nurse coach-led sessions for patients (six) and their care partners (four) aided by a manualized curriculum. Participants also complete activities geared to solving problems and making difficult decisions, attend a Supportive Care clinic visit, and complete advance directives.</description>
