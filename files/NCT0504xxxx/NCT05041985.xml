    <textblock>
      Whiplash injury is very common and lot of patients which suffered the injury have chronic&#xD;
      symptoms despite different treatment options. One of main symptoms include muscle spasm and&#xD;
      pain caused by neck movement. Diazepam is a well known drug which can be used to treat muscle&#xD;
      spasms. The aim of this study is to determine whether short term Diazepam therapy can have&#xD;
      positive effect on long term outcomes after whiplash injury.&#xD;

      This randomized, assessor-blinded study was conducted on patients presented due to a cervical&#xD;
      spine injury caused by a traffic accident in the previous 48 hours from 1st January 2020 to&#xD;
      31st December 2020. All the patient which were included in this study were divided into 2&#xD;
      groups: group A, the Test group, and group B, the control group. All patients signed the&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study prior to randomization. During the initial examination a&#xD;
      detailed history was taken and it included Visual Analog Pain Scale (VAS). On follow up&#xD;
      examinations 7 days, 6 weeks and 6 months after the injury, all patients completed Neck&#xD;
      disability index (NDI), Whiplash disability questionnaire (WDQ) as well as Visual Analog Pain&#xD;
      Scale (VAS). Any patient which didn't complete all the follow up examination was excluded&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
