      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people who are referred to the EMG (Electromyography) Section of the NIH are enrolled&#xD;
      into specific active studies. This allows researchers to learn about a range of rare&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorders. But study criteria may not give researchers the chance to evaluate a&#xD;
      single person or study a common symptom. Therefore, researchers want to assess people with&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorders who are not currently enrolled in any NIH studies. They will perform&#xD;
      tests on these individuals in the EMG Lab. Then they will create a repository of data that&#xD;
      may be used for future research. This will help them learn more about these disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To retain data that is collected as part of participant visits to the NIH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 18 and older who will be visiting the NIH for evaluation of their neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a physical exam. They will be evaluated for their neuromuscular&#xD;
      disorder. They may have tests to learn more about how their nerves and muscles work that are&#xD;
      called nerve conduction and EMG studies. Their muscles and nerves may be assessed with an&#xD;
      ultrasound. Their ability to sweat may be measured. Their heart rate and blood pressure may&#xD;
      be taken. Changes to their breathing or changes in their body position may be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant data will be given a unique numerical identifier that can be used if the data is&#xD;
      shared. Data will be stored on a server and in a database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1-2 visits. Each visit will last less than 4 hours. They may be&#xD;
      contacted for a follow-up visit.&#xD;

      PROTOCOL SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection for Standard Care of Patients in the EMG Section&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is designed to provide a repository of information for future hypothesis&#xD;
      generation. We will be evaluating patients with neuromuscular disorders that are not&#xD;
      currently enrolled in any NIH protocols with procedures performed in the EMG Lab. The&#xD;
      procedures include standard neurophysiological studies of EMG, autonomic nervous system (ANS)&#xD;
      testing, and neuromuscular ultrasound (NMUS) as deemed necessary for appropriate diagnostic&#xD;
      and clinical status testing. This will allow us to investigate into the problems of these&#xD;
      patients with the purpose of furthering general knowledge of neuromuscular disorders and&#xD;
      enhancing our EMG capabilities. Our ability to evaluate patients with a wide variety of&#xD;
      neuromuscular diseases is also critical to maintaining our accreditation with the clinical&#xD;
      neurophysiology fellowship programs and training our fellows to be competent physicians, as&#xD;
      well as for keeping all staff, including senior staff, up-to-date and familiar with the&#xD;
      evaluation of patients with a wide spectrum of diseases. We may also be able to later refer&#xD;
      these patients into treatment protocols or re-evaluate patients that are no longer in an&#xD;
      active NINDS protocol. This protocol will be valuable resource to the community by&#xD;
      engendering greater interaction with the local neurologists and clinics as well as providing&#xD;
      certain types of neurophysiological testing that are not readily available in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a repository of information on enrolled participants to allow for hypothesis&#xD;
      generation in future research&#xD;
&#xD;
      To add value to the Clinical Neurophysiology training programs by providing consult,&#xD;
      diagnostic tests, and medical follow-up of participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To provide a repository of information on enrolled participants to allow for hypothesis&#xD;
      generation in future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population includes patients, male or female, who are age 18 or older with no upper&#xD;
      age limit restrictions. The study population will be limited to 200. They may have&#xD;
      neuromuscular disorder or neurodegenerative disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NINDS Intramural Clinical Research Program located in the NIH Clinical Center, Bethesda, MD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current estimated study duration is 10 years. An extension to this study duration may be&#xD;
      requested in the future via an amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no specific time limitation on participant visits, though many participants may have&#xD;
      only 1-2 visits.&#xD;
