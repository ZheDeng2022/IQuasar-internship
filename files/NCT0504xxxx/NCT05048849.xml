  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and immunogenicity of MVC-COV1901 vaccine&#xD;
      who are generally healthy or with stable pre-existing health conditions and have received 2&#xD;
      doses of Placebo in the main study CT-COV-21&#xD;

      This is an extension study of the main study CT-COV-21, &quot;A Phase II, Prospective,&#xD;
      Double-blinded, Multi-Center, Multi-Regional Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and&#xD;
      Immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Candidate MVC-COV1901.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      This extension study is a prospective, open-label, multicenter study. In this extension&#xD;
      study, approximately 500 participants who received the placebo and have remained blinded in&#xD;
      the main study until Day 119 (90 days after the second vaccination of the main study) are&#xD;
      enrolled and receive MVC-COV1901. Each participant will receive 2 doses of MVC-COV1901,&#xD;
      administered 28 days apart via IM injection in the deltoid region, preferably of the&#xD;
      non-dominant arm, at Day 1 and Day 29.&#xD;
