  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With increasing awareness about physician fatigue and its effect on patient safety, residency&#xD;
      programs are increasingly transitioning to a night float call system. In other industries,&#xD;
      multiple night shifts in a row can cause a disruption in the circadian rhythm, sleep debt,&#xD;
      shift work disorder, that is related to chronic medical conditions such as obesity and&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. We will evaluate the effect of different call structures on resident&#xD;
      activity, sleep and self reported measures of wellness using a commercially available Fitbit&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited via an email once they are scheduled for a week of night float&#xD;
      in the Stanford Main Operating room. Potential participants who are taking prescription&#xD;
      medications that might affect their alertness during the study period will not be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will quantify the changes in sleep pattern and activity during the week&#xD;
      before, during, and after the night float call week. Self reported aspects of well being&#xD;
      including fatigue, physical function, and positive affect will be assessed with NIH PROMIS&#xD;
      surveys at the end of each week during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use the Fitbit Alta HR data to quantify the change in total amount of&#xD;
      sleep, sleep interruption and sleep phase and steps per day. Data will be analyzed only when&#xD;
      it is coincident with heart rate data to correct for periods when the device is not used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activity will not alter from the participants normal except that they will wear the Fitbit&#xD;
      and respond to the NIH PROMIS surveys over the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from NIH PROMIS surveys, Fitbit and provided demographic information including age, sex&#xD;
      and BMI, and number of previous night float periods previously completed. After association,&#xD;
      data will be completely de-identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be normalized to the participant's baseline value during the run-in week. The&#xD;
      call week and post call week will be analyzed with a time series mixed effects model using R&#xD;
      and/or NONMEM (a program for Nonlinear Mixed Effects Modeling). The effects of the above&#xD;
      demographic variables will be assessed as potential covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that this observational study will be the first of many studies&#xD;
      looking at the effects of changing sleep patterns on activity and well-being&#xD;

    <description>Participants will take a survey prior to starting night float, at the end of night float week, and after one recovery week.

A higher score would represent increased level of positive affect.</description>

        We will recruit participants who are PGY2-5 and part of the Stanford Hospital Department of&#xD;
        Graduate Medical Education, which means they will generally be between 26-36 years of age.&#xD;
        We will aim to recruit an equal number of males and females which is reasonable give the&#xD;
        demographic distribution of Anesthesia residents. Finally, we aim to have a people with a&#xD;
        variety of races and ethnicity involved but this will not be specifically targeted or&#xD;
        evaluated due to the limited pool of eligible subjects.&#xD;
