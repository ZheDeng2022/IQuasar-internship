  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although there are several licensed vaccines for SAR-CoV-2 (COVID-19) in Canada, none of them&#xD;
      are approved for use in children under the age of 12, leaving five million children under 12&#xD;
      years unvaccinated. There is a need to find methods of mass rapid point of care testing in&#xD;
      unvaccinated populations such as in schools that can be performed by a lay individual. This&#xD;
      multi-center study will evaluate the clinical sensitivity of buccal swabs with the ID NOW&#xD;
      COVID-19 device in comparison to standard of care COVID-19 testing at 15 pediatric emergency&#xD;
      centres across Canada.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will enroll approx 2882 participants under the age of 18 at 15 pediatric emergency&#xD;
      centres across Canada. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the clinical sensitivity of&#xD;
      buccal swab testing using Abbott ID NOW COVID-19device to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection among&#xD;
      children aged 0-&lt;18.0 years old presenting to the emergency department with an indication for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 testing as determined by the clinical care team. The study also seeks to identify&#xD;
      factors that influence the accuracy of the testing approach and to examine the feasibility&#xD;
      and perception of self/caregiver buccal swab sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study, we will compare the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 device with the&#xD;
      reference gold standard nasal, nasopharyngeal (NP) or throat swabs as the deemed standard of&#xD;
      care at participating sites and with specimens collected by a qualified health professional&#xD;
      and assessed by local laboratory services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals presenting to the emergency department that are identified as meeting the&#xD;
      criteria as per local guidelines to be tested for SARS-CoV-2 (i.e. droplet precautions) will&#xD;
      be appropriately consented and screened for participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible consented participants will have their past medical history, COVID-19 symptom&#xD;
      assessment, vaccination status, and physical exam findings collected from their charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualified healthcare professional will obtain a standard of care RT-PCT Swab from the&#xD;
      participant. The results from this swab will be collected from the participants chart once&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on age, the study team will then train the participant/caregiver how to perform and&#xD;
      obtain a buccal swab from the inside of the cheek. The collected buccal swab will be analyzed&#xD;
      by the study team using the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 device and results obtained within approx&#xD;
      15 mins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and their families will be notified of the qualitative result from the buccal&#xD;
      swab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and their caregivers will be asked to complete pain assessment and acceptability&#xD;
      questionnaires for both the standard of care and buccal swab tests.&#xD;
