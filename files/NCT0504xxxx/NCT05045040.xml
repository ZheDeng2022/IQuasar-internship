    <textblock>
      Background: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in&#xD;
      Oncology: palliative care recommends discussing advance care planning (ACP) when patients'&#xD;
      estimated life expectancy is reduced from a year to months. Discussions about ACP focus on&#xD;
      communication among patients, their caregivers, and healthcare providers to achieve&#xD;
      cancer-related treatment and care that is consistent with the patient's preferences based on&#xD;
      the values and goals of the patient's life. ACP can improve outcomes for patients and&#xD;
      caregivers; however, ACP rates remain low. One reason given might be the complexity of ACP in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Question Prompt List (QPL) is a structured question list encouraging patients to ask their&#xD;
      queries to physicians and promote discussion between patients and physicians during medical&#xD;
      consultations. Our preliminary study found that face-to-face interventions by nurses or&#xD;
      clinical psychologists using QPL about treatment and care, which is consistent with the&#xD;
      patient's preferences based on the values and goals of the patient's life, after standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy for patients with advanced cancer promoted more empathic communication between&#xD;
      patients and their physicians. In recent years, however, ensuring adequate time during&#xD;
      outpatient visits has become difficult due to increased numbers of outpatients and shortages&#xD;
      of corresponding medical personnel. Therefore, intervention methods not restricted by&#xD;
      location or time are needed. Thus, we developed a mobile-based empathic communication support&#xD;
      program, including a QPL, to facilitate discussions about patients' values and goals with&#xD;
      their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study examined whether a mobile-based empathic communication support program,&#xD;
      which intends to promote ACP discussions in earlier stages of advanced cancer treatment,&#xD;
      improves the empathic communication behaviors of patients with advanced cancer and their&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main contents of the intervention: Patients in the intervention group will be provided a&#xD;
      mobile-based empathic communication support program-an application (app) on a mobile phone.&#xD;
      The app comprises QPL (46 questions in eight categories) and questions about the patient&#xD;
      preferred treatment and end-of-life based on the values and goals of the patient's life.&#xD;
      After registering with the app, patients are first given a program overview and instructions&#xD;
      for using the app. They can then proceed with the content themselves, at home or anywhere&#xD;
      else, at any time. Between app registration and the next outpatient visit, the patient will&#xD;
      be interviewed (by phone or in person) by a nurse or a clinical psychologist, who will help&#xD;
      them prepare for the discussion with the physician and ask questions based on the patient's&#xD;
      app responses for 30 minutes to an hour. During the outpatient visit, patients and their&#xD;
      physicians will be provided feedback based on the interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects: In sum, 264 patients with advanced or recurrent cancer will be recruited,&#xD;
      which will occur in four departments (respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, hepatobiliary&#xD;
      medicine, and oncology) in the outpatient clinic of the National Cancer Center Hospital,&#xD;
      Japan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement: The primary outcome of this trial is the Reassurance and Emotional&#xD;
      support score of physician behavior measured using the SHARE model at the next visit after&#xD;
      the intervention. SHARE is a conceptual communication skills model comprising 26 items and&#xD;
      four subscales, categorized as S: Supportive environment, H: How to deliver bad news, A:&#xD;
      Additional information, and RE: Reassurance and Emotional support. Reassurance and Emotional&#xD;
      support assesses physicians' behavior in providing reassurance and addressing patients'&#xD;
      emotions with empathic responses (e.g., remaining silent out of concern for patient's&#xD;
      feelings or accepting patient's expression of emotions). The conversation between patients&#xD;
      and the physicians will be audio-recorded, and a third person's impression of the physician's&#xD;
      communication behavior during the outpatient consultation will be scored on a 5-point scale&#xD;
      from 0: not applicable at all to 4: strongly applicable. Scoring is conducted by multiple&#xD;
      raters blinded to the assignment. Raters will be trained in conversation analysis with a&#xD;
      manual, and inter-rater and intra-rater agreements will be checked in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are as follows: 1) the patient-physician behavioral assessment based on&#xD;
      the conversation analysis manual, 2) number of conversations about ACP, 3) psychological&#xD;
      distress, 4) quality of life, 5) medical care use, 6) app use, 7) feasibility of intervention&#xD;
      program, 8) patients' satisfaction of the consultation, 9) care goals, and 10) preferred&#xD;
      place for future care. We chose these outcomes for their comparability with previous studies.&#xD;

      After obtaining written informed consent, patients who satisfy the criteria are assigned&#xD;
      using a minimizing method to either an intervention or control group with stratification&#xD;
      factors of the clinical department (respiratory medicine, gastroenterology, hepatobiliary&#xD;
      medicine, and oncology), gender (male and female), and age (at age 64 years or younger/65&#xD;
      years or older). Within strata, patients will be randomized to the intervention arm and usual&#xD;
      arm in 1:1.&#xD;

    <description>The HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) is a 14-item self-administered questionnaire that measures psychological distress in patients. It includes subscales for depression (7 items) and anxiety (7 items). Responses are selected from four options and scores range from 0 to 21 for each subscale. The cut-off scores are 4/5 points on the depression scale, 7/8 points on the anxiety scale, and 10/11 points on a total score. Higher scores suggest the possibility of having symptoms.</description>
