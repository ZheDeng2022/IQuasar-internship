  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the use of the semi-autonomous control algorithm (condition 1) with the standard&#xD;
      of care myoelectric system used with the TASKA prosthetic hand (condition 2). Able bodied&#xD;
      subjects will enroll in a laboratory based experimental session at the University of Colorado&#xD;
      at Boulder. In a randomized order, subjects will be fitted with a by-pass prosthesis which&#xD;
      enables the able-bodied subject to control the prosthetic hand using the myoelectric signals&#xD;
      on their able limb. A TASKA prosthetic hand will be sensorized using the Point Touch&#xD;
      technology. Then, the subjects will perform the ACMC outcome measure using each experimental&#xD;
      condition. Trained observers will record the measure. Then, a direct comparison can be made&#xD;
      both within subject performance and across subjects for the semi-autonomous control algorithm&#xD;
      developed in Aim 2.1 and the standard of care myoelectric system used in the TASKA prosthetic&#xD;
      hand.&#xD;

    <description>The proctor for the measure chooses an everyday activity, such as setting up a table for snacks or replanting a flower, that is relevant to the study population. As the participants perform the chosen task, a trained rater will assess their capacity for control of their myoelectric prosthesis as represented by 30 items reflecting 6 aspects of quality of myoelectric control. These 6 aspects are &quot;the need for external support,&quot; &quot;grip force and opening width,&quot; &quot;coordination of both hands, &quot;in different positions and in motion (timing),&quot; &quot;repetitive grip and release,&quot; and &quot;the need for visual feedback.&quot; Each item is scored on a 4-point scale and converted into linear measures of myoelectric control using Rasch analysis methods on the ACMC website. ACMC is the only measure that has been validated for individuals with upper limb (UL) loss who use myoelectric control and has been shown to demonstrate good test-retest reliability</description>
