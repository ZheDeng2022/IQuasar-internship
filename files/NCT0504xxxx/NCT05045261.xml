      The ANRS HB07 IP-cure-B study is a proof of concept Phase II clinical trial in HBeAg negative&#xD;
      virally suppressed non-cirrhotic CHB patients. It will explore whether stopping NUC or&#xD;

      Epidemiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major public health care issue worldwide and one of the&#xD;
      principal causes of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
      Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths globally, with the highest burden of&#xD;
      disease found in regions where HBV is endemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO estimates that in 2015, 257 million people were living with CHB infection (defined as&#xD;
      hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positivity) representing a worldwide prevalence of 3.9%,&#xD;
      with considerable geographic variability. In 2015, hepatitis B resulted in an estimated&#xD;
      887,000 deaths, mostly from cirrhosis and HCC, placing it among the top 20 causes of&#xD;
      mortality worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of 2016, 27 million people (10.5% of all people estimated to be living with hepatitis B)&#xD;
      were aware of their infection, while 4.5 million (16.7%) of the people diagnosed were on&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard-of-care for CHB treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nucleos(t)ide (NUC) analogs, administered orally, are the standard of care treatment for CHB,&#xD;
      providing durable suppression of viral replication, defined by the decline of serum HBV DNA&#xD;
      below the lower limit of quantification of diagnostic assays. NUC induced viral suppression,&#xD;
      which is observed in the vast majority of patients (&gt; 95%), results in long-term clinical&#xD;
      benefits with a reduced risk of liver complications, i.e. decreased risk of: i) liver&#xD;
      fibrosis progression, ii) hepatic decompensation in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis, and&#xD;
      iii) HCC development. However, treatment with NUC rarely results in clearance of HBsAg and&#xD;
      seroconversion to HBsAb even after long-term administration. In highly selected patient&#xD;
      populations, the rate of HBsAg loss can reach 10% after 5 years of Tenofovir disoproxil&#xD;
      fumarate (TDF) administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New treatment options that enhance rates of HBsAg clearance with or without seroconversion&#xD;
      are needed. Such treatments will allow patients to discontinue life-long oral antiviral&#xD;
      therapy and provide an option for a functional cure with a finite duration of treatment. A&#xD;
      therapy with a finite duration of treatment is expected to be applicable to a broader&#xD;
      population of chronically infected patients with HBV, including those that are not currently&#xD;
      considered eligible for treatment with available therapies by the current clinical practice&#xD;
      guidelines. For example, immunotolerant patients and inactive carriers do not fall within the&#xD;
      current treatment indications. Different treatment strategies aimed to increase the HBsAg&#xD;
      loss rates, either different regimens of currently available medications or regimens&#xD;
      including new direct acting antivirals or immune modulators, are being explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The host immune response to HBV infection plays a pivotal role in whether acute infection is&#xD;
      resolved or becomes chronic. It is also pivotal for control of intrahepatic viral cccDNA,&#xD;
      which acts as a viral minichromosome. Individuals who are able to clear HBV infection&#xD;
      spontaneously following an acute infection display a vigorous, polyclonal, HBV-specific CD8+&#xD;
      and CD4+ T cell response and maintain trace amounts of intrahepatic cccDNA. In contrast, CHB&#xD;
      is associated with a limited and dysfunctional CD8+ T cell response, impaired natural killer&#xD;
      (NK) cell antiviral function, the persistence of transcriptionally active cccDNA, and active&#xD;
      viral replication. Novel approaches under investigation to achieve functional cure include&#xD;
      direct inhibition of the viral replication cycle, targeting of cccDNA, and the stimulation of&#xD;
      antiviral immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANRS HB07 IP-cure-B study is a proof of concept Phase II clinical trial in HBeAg negative&#xD;
      virally suppressed non-cirrhotic CHB patients. It will explore whether stopping NUC or&#xD;
      stopping NUC after SLGN administration can increase the rate of HBsAg decline compared to&#xD;
      standard of care CHB treatment. Exploratory analyses will help elucidate whether&#xD;
      modifications in the liver immune environment are responsible for HBsAg decline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ANRS HB07 IP-Cure-B PoC clinical trial will be conducted in virally-suppressed&#xD;
      HBeAg-negative CHB subjects to minimize safety risks and maximize efficacy benefits&#xD;
      associated with SLGN. Because they achieve long-term viral suppression under NUC therapy,&#xD;
      these subjects have lower levels of HBV DNA in the serum as well as lower expression of HBV&#xD;
      antigens, especially HBsAg. A virally suppressed population may have a higher chance of&#xD;
      responding to SLGN, as suggested by the observation that immune responsiveness of CHB&#xD;
      patients is improved in patients who are on chronic suppressive antiviral therapy with low&#xD;
      HBsAg levels. Of note, only subjects with excellent hepatic reserve, i.e. non-cirrhotic&#xD;
      patients with normal liver function tests, will be included in this study to further maximize&#xD;
      safety. Moreover, in virally suppressed patients with normal liver function, any alteration&#xD;
      of liver enzymes will be easier to interpret.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A similar line of reasoning applies for the stopping NUC strategy, since patients with lower&#xD;
      HBsAg levels have a higher chance of losing HBsAg after NUC cessation. The enrolment of&#xD;
      patients without extensive liver fibrosis, per EASL clinical practice guidelines, will also&#xD;
      minimize the risk of severe ALT flares after NUC withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis tested in this trial is built on previous clinical investigations of the&#xD;
      stopping NUC strategy and of SLGN administration in patients with CHB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators expect that the modification of the liver immune environment induced&#xD;
      by SLGN administration should amplify the modifications of the immune responses induced by&#xD;
      NUC withdrawal and lead to a restoration of effective intrahepatic innate immunity and&#xD;
      HBV-specific T cell responses. In this PoC clinical trial, the investigators will explore, in&#xD;
      HBeAg negative virally suppressed HBV patients, whether a TLR8 agonist (SLGN) treatment&#xD;
      followed by NUC discontinuation can increase the rate of HBsAg decline.&#xD;
