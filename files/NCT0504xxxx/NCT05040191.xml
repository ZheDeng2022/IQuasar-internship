      This research was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study to evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of haptic interactive virtual reality and computer-based simulation technologies on&#xD;
      students' knowledge, skills, anxiety, satisfaction in learning and self-confidence in&#xD;
      teaching nasogastric tube application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research population consisted of students who enrolled in a foundation university nursing&#xD;
      department and took the &quot;Basic Principles and Practices in Nursing II&quot; course in the Spring&#xD;
      Semester of the 2020-2021 academic year, and the sample consisted of 90 students who met the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria of the study. During nasogastric tube application, the Control Group&#xD;
      (n=30) trained with the Standard Curriculum, Experimental Group 1 (n=30) trained with Haptic&#xD;
      Interactive Virtual Reality Simulation Technology, and Experimental Group 2 (n=30) trained&#xD;
      with Haptic Interactive Computer-Based Simulation. n=30) was performed. Research data were&#xD;
      collected with &quot;Structured Student Introduction Form&quot;, &quot;Nasogastric Tube Application Skills&#xD;
      Examination&quot;, &quot;Nasogastric Tube Application Skill Checklist&quot;, &quot;State-Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory&quot;, &quot;Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale&quot;. Appropriate&#xD;
      statistical methods were used in the analysis of the data.&#xD;

      Traditional learning methods and environments are thought to be insufficient to respond to&#xD;
      the differing expectations of generation z, who were born and raised in a digital age. For&#xD;
      this reason, it has become mandatory for educational institutions to renew their curricula&#xD;
      and support them with advanced technologies. All over the world, higher education programs&#xD;
      are trying to expand their educational capacities by applying innovative strategies to meet&#xD;
      the future workforce needs. Nursing educators also report that fundamental changes in&#xD;
      existing curricula are necessary for innovation. Since nursing is a profession that requires&#xD;
      the acquisition of cognitive, psychomotor and attitudinal behaviors, it is important to use&#xD;
      innovative practices in education. While these applications increase the attention of the&#xD;
      student, they save the education from monotony and ensure the permanence of the education by&#xD;
      ensuring the active participation of the student. Due to the fact that today is the age of&#xD;
      technology, the use and development of new learning tools has increased at every stage of the&#xD;
      nursing education process. These developments in technology and education have brought&#xD;
      together these two fields and the use of simulation applications used to increase technical&#xD;
      and non-technical skills in nursing education has become widespread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasogastric tube (NGT) application, which is one of the interventions that students should&#xD;
      develop in nursing education, is an invasive intervention that is frequently applied for&#xD;
      enteral nutrition, drug administration and gastric decompression and is the responsibility of&#xD;
      health professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the beginning of professional nursing education, different teaching methods have been&#xD;
      applied to improve nasogastric tube application skills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to traditional teaching methods, in teaching NGT practice skill, educators explain&#xD;
      the purpose, indications, complications, application method, necessary materials and nursing&#xD;
      interventions that need attention in the classroom. Then, demonstration of NGT application&#xD;
      skill on a model is made in order to transform theoretical knowledge into behavior in nursing&#xD;
      skills laboratories. Due to the fact that it is an invasive procedure with various&#xD;
      complications, NGT application by students in the clinical field is limited, so the&#xD;
      development and reinforcement of the behavior is left after graduation. It is envisaged that&#xD;
      in the teaching of NGT application skill with haptic interactive virtual reality simulation&#xD;
      technology, students' knowledge, skills and self-confidence levels will increase, allowing&#xD;
      them to feel like a nurse in the patient room that reflects the real hospital conditions, and&#xD;
      they will develop and reinforce the NGT application skill, which is a complex initiative in a&#xD;
      risk-free environment before graduation. Based on this information, the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to reveal the effects of haptic interactive virtual reality and computer-based simulation&#xD;
      technologies on students' knowledge, skills, anxiety, satisfaction in learning and&#xD;
      self-confidence in teaching nasogastric tube application.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;Clinical tvr (tactile simulator)&quot; produced by a foreign commercial company used in nursing education was used. Clinical tvr simulation applications can be accessed online or downloaded to a computer. This simulator; It functions by using an interactive, visually enhanced 2D, animated, haptic arm that can be held by students like a pen. It includes applications such as nasogastric tube placement, urinary bladder catheter placement, heart massage. These applications can be realized through both mouse and haptic arm computer input devices. clinical tvr; It is a simulator that incorporates the enhanced benefits of haptic feedback through the use of haptic technology. This simulator provides a near-realistic sensory experience where the learner can practice a skill as it actually is. Computer-based simulation with haptic interaction was used in this study with the haptic arm in NGT application skill.</description>
