      1.1.Obstetric Anal Sphincter Injuries (OASIs) Obstetric anal sphincter injuries (OASIs) are&#xD;
      serious complications of vaginal birth with a reported incidence throughout Europe and&#xD;
      globally, from 1-10% with recent UK data demonstrating a steadily rising incidence of this&#xD;
      type of trauma over the past 12 years .&#xD;
&#xD;
      OASIs is one of the most significant risk factors for anal incontinence in young women as&#xD;
      well as other complications of long-term dyspareunia and perineal pain.Despite optimal&#xD;
      primary repair, approximately 39% of women who sustain an OASIs will suffer from anal&#xD;
      incontinence. Several studies have reported a much higher risk of anal incontinence with&#xD;
      subsequent deliveries and the potential for symptoms to progress with time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Prediction of OASIs With the wealth of population based databases that are now available&#xD;
      prediction models are being developed to assist in clinical decision making. Several large&#xD;
      population based cohort studies have identified various independent risk factors for&#xD;
      sustaining primary or recurrent OASIS. These include nulliparity, increased birth weight,&#xD;
      operative vaginal delivery, persistent occipito-posterior position, prolonged pushing phase,&#xD;
      induction of labour, use of epidural analgesia and shoulder dystocia, although findings&#xD;
      across studies are contradictory.However there is paucity of information relating to the&#xD;
      impact of risk factors that can only be known prior to the actual birth both on the&#xD;
      likelihood of OASIs occurring de-novo and the usefulness of such information for counselling&#xD;
      women at potential risk of sustaining a primary OASIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although members of the investigators group have previously demonstrated that some of these&#xD;
      prediction models have been suggested to have good discriminatory value, they do not&#xD;
      necessarily confer a good clinical value. Although the model was useful in ruling out risk of&#xD;
      OASIs in women with no risk factors, it was not as good in ruling-in an OASIS - that means&#xD;
      that a women presenting with all of the known clinical risk factors cannot be differentiated&#xD;
      at any higher risk than a women with a smaller subset of these risk factors. Hence limiting&#xD;
      its clinical usability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Ultrasound and OASIs management Transperineal and endoanal ultrasound scanning is&#xD;
      currently used for the diagnosis and management of OASIs. Indeed, they form part of the&#xD;
      recommended practice for determining the best mode of birth in pregnancies following OASIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have also assessed some transperineal sonographic parameters, like the ano-vaginal&#xD;
      distance (AVD), as a way of alerting clinicians to the possibility of OASIs. This measure has&#xD;
      been used postnatally and a it was concluded that a short AVD could be a warning sign of&#xD;
      possible external sphincter injury before suturing. The authors of this study suggested that&#xD;
      an AVD of 20 mm seemed to indicate a cutoff level of the occurrence of external sphincter&#xD;
      injury. Nevertheless, The authors of this study stressed on the need of further evaluation of&#xD;
      their findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A However, to the investigators knowledge such parameter has not been assessed as an&#xD;
      intrapartum tool, in combination with other radiological or clinical parameters, in the&#xD;
      prediction of the risk of OASIs.&#xD;
