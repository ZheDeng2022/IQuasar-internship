  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity plays an important role in reducing the adverse effects of cancer&#xD;
      treatment. There are few studies using prehabilitation to improve peri-operative outcomes in&#xD;
      patients undergoing cancer surgery. This study will pilot a program of structured activity&#xD;
      for women undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy with the intent to improve their physical state&#xD;
      prior to surgical intervention and thus improve outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown that patients with advanced ovarian cancer may suffer from high levels of&#xD;
      cancer -specific distress, depression and anxiety. It has also been proposed that&#xD;
      psychological resilience can favorably affect psychological and treatment-related outcomes in&#xD;
      cancer patients. Most current studied mindfulness-based interventions are limited by the time&#xD;
      commitment required by the patient, which is difficult for patients with advanced cancer&#xD;
      undergoing treatment, therefore a virtual program has been created that is more easily&#xD;
      accessible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frailty is thought to be mediated by senescent cells and their dynamic secretome, referred to&#xD;
      as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Senescent cells contribute to&#xD;
      age-related tissue deterioration, inflammation, and fibrosis. A group of novel frailty&#xD;
      biomarkers obtained at the time of diagnosis has been examined in advanced OC patients.&#xD;
      Preliminary data show that these biomarkers strongly correlate with the clinical frailty&#xD;
      phenotype, and define a frail subgroup of patients with higher treatment related morbidity&#xD;
      and worse survival. These markers may represent important surrogate clinical trial endpoints,&#xD;
      as well as deepen the understanding of aging in women with ovarian cancer. In this pilot,&#xD;
      these markers and other surrogate endpoints for future novel translational research in the&#xD;
      science of aging will be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With a rapidly growing older American population, the overall incidence of cancer, including&#xD;
      ovarian cancer (OC) is rising. Addressing aging in older OC patients represents a clinically&#xD;
      important unmet need. Interventions designed to improve resilience against loss of function,&#xD;
      psychological distress, complications and premature mortality in older patients are lacking&#xD;
      in OC treatment. Current OC treatment strategies are purely tumor-directed, and do not&#xD;
      address host factors. Our overall goal is to test whether a holistic prehabilitation program&#xD;
      can be implemented alongside standard tumor-directed therapy in the older OC patient and will&#xD;
      improve function, quality of life, and reduce morbidity and mortality. The 12-week period of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to cytoreductive surgery is an ideal window of opportunity to&#xD;
      utilize such a strategy. Prehabilitation must be: i) practicable at the institutional level,&#xD;
      ii) feasible at the participant level, and iii) provide demonstrable benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial will examine baseline function of all patients diagnosed with advanced&#xD;
      ovarian cancer who are intending on curative intent treatment. Patients will have a range of&#xD;
      assessments including functional, psychologic, and biomarkers. Patients undergoing primary&#xD;
      debulking surgery will be in an observational arm alone. Patients undergoing neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be assigned to a trimodal prehabilitation program that involves exercise,&#xD;
      resilience training, and nutritional support. Patient will be evaluated on this arm at&#xD;
      baseline, prior to surgery, post-operatively and at the completion of treatment.&#xD;
