  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) and their relation to the development of an alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder (AUD) will be measured with fMRI.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the impact of ACE on stress sensitivity, cue-reactivity,&#xD;
      and emotion processing in individuals with AUD at a longitudinal level. For this,&#xD;
      participants (excluding healthy controls) from the first project (see&#xD;
      https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03758053) will be re-examined after 2 to 2.5 years to&#xD;
      explore the involvement of these mechanisms in relation to (long-term) relapse risk, which is&#xD;
      a central issue in substance use disorders. Furthermore, we will investigate cognitive&#xD;
      functions, specifically response inhibition and working memory, in the relationship between&#xD;
      ACE and AUD. Additional participants may be recruited to mitigate sample attrition from the&#xD;
      first project and to achieve the desired sample size. To assess cognitive functions and data&#xD;
      from new participants in relation to relapse risk, we will perform a 3-month follow-up.&#xD;
      (Neuro-)biological and physiological mechanisms underlying AUD after ACE will be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neural correlates of stress-sensitivity, emotion processing, alcohol cue-reactivity and&#xD;
      cognitive functions will be assessed using fMRI. Furthermore, blood and saliva samples will&#xD;
      be used to assess biological and physiological mechanisms (e.g. salivary cortisol level or&#xD;
      genetic markers of AUD and possible gene-environment-interactions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current project is interested in the extent to which ACE severity modulates neural&#xD;
      activation in specific brain regions during the execution of fMRI paradigms as well as&#xD;
      alcohol-related measures (e.g., craving and alcohol consumption). Of particular interest is&#xD;
      the question whether these neural and alcohol-related measures are associated with relapse&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 individuals (60 individuals with AUD and varying levels of ACE) will be examined using&#xD;
      interviews, questionnaires and fMRI tasks as well as saliva and blood samples. Depending on&#xD;
      ACE severity, participants will be divided into two groups, namely one group with no or mild&#xD;
      ACE and another group with moderate to severe ACE. All ethical votes and informed consents of&#xD;
      participants are and will be obtained according to the declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
