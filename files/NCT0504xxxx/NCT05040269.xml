  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      wheezing&quot; is defined as a musical sound caused by the passage of air through narrow&#xD;
      respiratory tract airways . Recurrent wheeze is defined as three or more episodes of&#xD;
      parentally reported wheeze in the past 12 months of Various risk factors are associated with&#xD;
      recurrent wheezing and asthma: small airway caliber; decreased lung function at birth; viral&#xD;
      respiratory infections; environmental pollution; pets; early daycare attendance; passive&#xD;
      smoking; parental history of asthma or atopy; obesity; and socioeconomic factors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      There has been growing recognition of the critical extra-skeletal roles for vitamin D in&#xD;
      recent years with an explosion of interest in vitamin D across health disciplines including&#xD;
      lung disease. Recently, vitamin D was found to be low in patients with recurrent wheezes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D, whether produced in the skin upon sun exposure or ingested from various dietary&#xD;
      sources, is converted in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D]. The latter is the major&#xD;
      circulating form of vitamin D and is thus used for evaluating the vitamin D status of&#xD;
      patients . The flesh of fatty fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils&#xD;
      are among the best sources of vitamin D and the fortified cereals and milk provide adequate&#xD;
      amounts as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animal models and humans have demonstrated an association of low vitamin D&#xD;
      concentrations with atopy and respiratory tract conditions. The mechanism that explains this&#xD;
      association is still unclear. It has been suggested that this mechanism is due to the effects&#xD;
      of vitamin D status on the regulation of the immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vitamin D receptor is expressed in various cells of the immune system, such as&#xD;
      macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells, as well as in B and T&#xD;
      lymphocytes. Binding of the active form of vitamin D to its receptor leads to an increase in&#xD;
      immunomodulatory activity that maintains the balance between the cellular immune response&#xD;
      (Th1) and the humoral response (Th2), in addition to stimulating regulatory T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypomagnesaemia (serum Mg level &lt;0.74 mmol.L-1) has been also suggested to be associated with&#xD;
      increased incidence of wheeze, airway hyperreactivity, and impairment of lung function. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of action of magnesium (Mg) on respiratory airways are multiple and include&#xD;
      relaxation of airways smooth muscle, bronchodilatation, anticholinergic effect, and&#xD;
      stabilization of the mast cells&#xD;
