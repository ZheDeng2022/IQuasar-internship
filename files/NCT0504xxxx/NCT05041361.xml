      This single-arm intervention trial administers up to 8 weekly whole-body hyperthermia (WBH)&#xD;
      sessions and 8 weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) sessions to adults aged 18 years or&#xD;
      older with major depressive disorder (MDD).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major Depressive Disorder afflicts more than 300 million people worldwide and is the leading&#xD;
      cause of life years lost to disability. Current treatments have important limitations in&#xD;
      efficacy and, in the case of medication, substantial side-effects. There is thus a compelling&#xD;
      need for additional effective, well-tolerated treatments. One such potential treatment is&#xD;
      whole-body hyperthermia (WBH). The investigators hypothesize that WBH may be particularly&#xD;
      effective in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), an established treatment&#xD;
      for depression. This single-arm trial will pilot and optimize procedures for integrating WBH&#xD;
      (8 weekly sessions) with CBT (8 weekly sessions). This work holds important promise to&#xD;
      improve treatment of depression and advance understanding of the role of integrated mind-body&#xD;
      therapies for mood disorders.&#xD;
