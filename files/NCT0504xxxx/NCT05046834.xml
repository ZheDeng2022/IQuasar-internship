      Purpose of the research:In this study, the effect of cold application used during and after&#xD;
      breast tube removal on pain and life signs in infants and children aged 0-3 years will be&#xD;
      examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: children who have cold application around the tube 15 minutes before chest tube removal&#xD;
      have low pain scores during chest tube removal compared to other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Children whose skin temperature is lowered below 13.60 C before breast tube removal have&#xD;
      lower pain scores compared to other groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: The cold application technique in the group of children affects the crying time after the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4: The cold application technique in the group of children affects the signs of life before&#xD;
      and after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is a study in randomized controlled, prospective and cross-sectional design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the study will be collected using the Patient Identification Information Form,&#xD;
      FLACC Pain Scale, Life Signs Follow-up Form.&#xD;

    <description>Oral paracetamol 10 mg/kg, which is administered as standard 60 minutes before the procedure, will be given to patients who have decided to remove the chest tube by the physician and comply with the limitations of the study. After that, initial pain severity and vital signs of the patient will be recorded using FLACC 15 minutes before the start of the chest tube removal process (1.MEASURE). After this measurement, the cold gel package will be wrapped in gauze and placed directly on the skin, covering the area around the chest tube with a radius of about 5 cm. The cold gel package will remain on the skin surface for about 20 minutes. After 15 minutes, the cold package will be removed and the chest tube will be removed by the doctor.</description>
