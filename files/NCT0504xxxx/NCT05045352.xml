      Randomized controlled intervention study comparing echogenic needles with non echogenic&#xD;
      needles for ultrasound guided venous access in the subclavian vein.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing certain surgical procedures and patients in intensive care unit require a&#xD;
      central venous catheter (CVC) for infusion of medicaments and for monitoring. Central venous&#xD;
      access (CVA) can be performed both with a blind technique or an ultrasound guided technique.&#xD;
      A common place for CVA is the subclavian vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While many guidelines recommend the use of ultrasound for jugular access, there are no&#xD;
      explicit recommendations for subclavian CVA For ultrasound guided CVA procedures good needle&#xD;
      visualization is important to successfully place the needle and catheter in the correct&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echogenic needles can give better needle visualization when performing ultrasound guided CVA&#xD;
      procedures. Theoretically, the use of echogenic needles should improve performance time and&#xD;
      success rates, and reduce complication rates due to a better needling control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the use of echogenic needles for vascular access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective randomized controlled trial design will be used. Echogenic needles will be&#xD;
      compared with non-echogenic (standard) needles. The main null hypothesis states that there is&#xD;
      no difference in access time between the needles.&#xD;
