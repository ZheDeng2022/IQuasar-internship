  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the previous studies, progressive resistance training (PRT) has significantly improved the&#xD;
      muscle strength and disease severity of Parkinson's disease. However, there is currently no&#xD;
      consensus on the impact of PRT on physical function such as balance and walking ability for&#xD;
      Parkinson's patients. Therefore, this study focuses on developing a visual feedback system&#xD;
      added to the original POWER rehabilitation system, and to investigate whether the training&#xD;
      through this &quot;interactive POWER rehabilitation system&quot; can produce the clinical benefits, as&#xD;
      well as improving the daily life of patients with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous&#xD;
      system with complex etiology. This disease is related to the consumption of dopamine in the&#xD;
      substantia nigra of the brain, and it is currently believed that the main factors of&#xD;
      consumption of dopamine are (1) heredity (2) aging (3) environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there are many rehabilitation treatments available for patients with Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease, such as: progressive resistance training, yoga, Tai Chi, dancing, cognitive&#xD;
      training, balance training, gait training, bicycle, and treadmill training, etc. During the&#xD;
      recent years, the POWER rehabilitation system from Japan (Procedure Outcome Worthwhile for&#xD;
      Elderly Rehabilitation, referred to as POWER rehabilitation) including six types of equipment&#xD;
      for strengthening different body parts has been applied to frail elderly or neurological&#xD;
      patients gradually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parkinson's patients are often considered to have major difficulties in responding to motion&#xD;
      disturbances (inability to respond appropriately), leading to learning, insufficient&#xD;
      attention and motivation problems. Therefore, maintenance of motivation and feedback on&#xD;
      performance are key factors that affect the participation of exercises in patients with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of virtual reality in patients with PD is becoming more and more effective.&#xD;
      An integrated rehabilitation system can not only enable the clinicians to check the&#xD;
      rehabilitation status during the treatment, but also provide feedbacks to the patient through&#xD;
      the interactive visual feedback screen. For Parkinson's patients, providing visual feedback&#xD;
      through virtual reality intervention may be of particular clinical value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase of this study, a virtual reality-like visual feedback system will be&#xD;
      developed and combined with the original &quot;POWER rehabilitation system&quot; to form the so-called&#xD;
      &quot;Interactive POWER Rehabilitation System&quot;, and then system verification will be carried out.&#xD;
      In the second phase of this study, this newly developed system will be applied to the&#xD;
      rehabilitation training for patients with Parkinson's disease, and to explore whether the&#xD;
      combination of POWER rehabilitation with visual feedback can produce the clinical benefits,&#xD;
      as well as improving the daily life of patients with PD. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      into three groups: interactive POWER, functional training, and control group. Single blind&#xD;
      data collection will be used. Patients will be evaluated at baseline and post 12-week&#xD;
      interventions. Outcome measures will include mini-BESTest, Unified Parkinson's disease rating&#xD;
      scale, muscle strength of upper and lower extremities, timed up and go, 6-minute walking&#xD;
      test, gait, and Parkinson's disease questionnaire PDQ-39.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the &quot;Interactive POWER Rehabilitation System&quot; can promote the learning&#xD;
      ability of patients with Parkinson's disease by adding visual feedbacks and enhance the&#xD;
      treatment effects. It also offer rehabilitation clinicians more treatment options, lower the&#xD;
      administrative costs of supporting staffs, reduce commuting costs for the patients, and&#xD;
      elevate patients' desire to comply with the treatment program.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline and post-intervention at 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A comprehensive assessment of both motor and non-motor symptoms associated with Parkinson's. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is made up of 42 items. These items are divided into six sections which are separately &quot;evaluation of mentation, behavior, and mood&quot;, &quot;self-evaluation of the activities of daily life&quot;, &quot;clinician-scored monitored motor evaluation&quot;, &quot;complications of therapy&quot;, &quot;Hoehn and Yahr staging of severity of Parkinson's disease&quot; and &quot;Schwab and England ADL scale&quot;.The evaluation score for the first item to the 39th item is 0 to 4 points. The evaluation score for the 40th to the 42th item is 0 to 1 points. The higher score meand the worse condition. The sum of all the items'score is the score of the scale. Higher Rating Scales'scores indicate severe symptoms.</description>
