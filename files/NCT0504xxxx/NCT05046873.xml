  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, participants will receive semaglutide and NNC0480-0389 together at the same&#xD;
      time. Semaglutide is a medicine that can already be prescribed, whereas NNC0480-0389 is a new&#xD;
      potential medicine. Giving the medicines at the same time will be investigated once by using&#xD;
      two separate syringes and once by using only one syringe containing both medicines&#xD;
      (&quot;co-formulation&quot;). The co-formulation will be given together with an injection of placebo.&#xD;
      Both medicines are tested for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Giving the two complementary&#xD;
      medicines at the same time is intended to lower blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
      NNC0480-0389, in combination with semaglutide, is already being investigated in an ongoing&#xD;
      human clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to compare the amount of medicine (semaglutide and NNC0480-0389) in&#xD;
      the blood: after participants received the medicines at the same time (0.5 mg semaglutide and&#xD;
      5 mg NNC0480-0389) using only one syringe (co-formulation)after participants received the&#xD;
      medicines separately using two syringes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, the amount of semaglutide and NNC0480-0389 in the blood will be measured&#xD;
      after participants received the medicines in co-formulation and after participants received&#xD;
      the medicines using separate syringes. There will be two treatment periods: One period where&#xD;
      participants receive the two medicines as two separate injections and another period where&#xD;
      participants receive the two medicines in one injection (co-formulation), together with an&#xD;
      injection of placebo. It will be randomly determined in which order participants will receive&#xD;
      the 2 treatments (separate injections first or co-formulation first).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both treatments the study medicines will be injected into a skin fold in the left and&#xD;
      right stomach using a thin needle.Giving the medicines in the two treatment periods will take&#xD;
      place at an interval of at least 8 weeks. The study can last for up to 19 weeks for each&#xD;
      participant. This includes a screening period (up to 4 weeks), two treatment periods (5 weeks&#xD;
      each) and a washout period (3 - 5 weeks). The washout period ensures that the given&#xD;
      treatments and their effects have disappeared from the body. Participants will not receive&#xD;
      any study medicines during this time. Participants will have 21 clinic visits. Some of the&#xD;
      visits include overnight stays. Participants will have blood tests at every clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 4 visits (Visits 2, 11, 12 and 21; Day 1 and 36 of each period) participants must not&#xD;
      have had any food or drink (water is allowed) for up to 8 hours before participantsr body&#xD;
      weight is measured. Participants must be healthy and have a body mass index (BMI) between&#xD;
      20.0 and 29.9 kg/m2. If participants are a woman participants can only take part in this&#xD;
      clinical study, if participants cannot get pregnant, for example, after menopause. A hormone&#xD;
      test will be done to confirm this.&#xD;
