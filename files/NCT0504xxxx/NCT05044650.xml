      The study compares between standard dose regimen of KOVIR combined with background treatment&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients and only background treatment in COVID-19 patients. The study will&#xD;
      enroll 700 participants to KOVIR group and 300 participant to Non-KOVIR group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be treated and followed up in 14-day period. In case the participant&#xD;
      meets the discharge criteria before 14 days, discontinuing the study drug will be done at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedures occur at Day 1. Periodic assessments are conducted daily from Day 2-14.&#xD;
