  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frail older adults are commonly prescribed blood pressure medication, yet it is unclear if&#xD;
      blood pressure medication is actually beneficial for them. Observational studies in this&#xD;
      population suggest blood pressure medication has limited benefit and may even be harmful,&#xD;
      including an increased risk for falls and cognitive impairment. Randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      are needed to confirm this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized controlled trial of blood pressure medication deprescribing,&#xD;
      amongst long-term care residents with systolic blood pressure lower than 135 mmHg. In the&#xD;
      intervention group, with physician consent, the facility pharmacist will reduce blood&#xD;
      pressure medication until the blood pressure reaches the target systolic blood pressure of&#xD;
      140 ±5 mmHg. The control group will receive usual care. The primary outcome is all-cause&#xD;
      mortality but the study will also be tracking all-cause hospitalization or emergency room&#xD;
      visits, hip fractures, cost of medication, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that avoiding unnecessarily low systolic blood pressure is beneficial in a&#xD;
      frail, end-of-life population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Observational evidence suggests antihypertensive medications have limited benefit and may&#xD;
      even be harmful in the frail older adult population. Although more modest blood pressure&#xD;
      targets are already recommended, the impact of deprescribing antihypertensive medication on&#xD;
      mortality and morbidity in the frail older adult population has yet to be confirmed by&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine, in hypertensive long-term care residents with a&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure below 135 mmHg, whether &quot;deprescribing&quot; antihypertensive medications&#xD;
      to achieve a systolic blood pressure of 140 ±5 mmHg, compared to no change in prescribing,&#xD;
      will delay all-cause mortality (our primary outcome). The investigators will secondarily&#xD;
      examine other outcomes including adverse events, quality of life, and cost of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an event-driven 2-parallel group randomized controlled trial, to be conducted in&#xD;
      participating Alberta long-term care (LTC) facilities. The trial operates under a waiver of&#xD;
      consent, as the intervention is recommended care, with residents, physicians, and family&#xD;
      having the ability to opt individual residents out of the study before eligibility is&#xD;
      determined. Eligibility will be determined using linked administrative claims databases&#xD;
      holding physician diagnoses and medication dispensed, and by using usual care systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure collected by the LTC facility. The provincial data steward (Alberta Health Services&#xD;
      Research Data Services) will access this data, determine eligibility, individually randomize&#xD;
      eligible residents who have not opted out, and advise the facility pharmacist which patients&#xD;
      are in the intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facility pharmacists will then stop or reduce doses of antihypertensive medication in the&#xD;
      intervention group according to a pre-defined deprescribing algorithm. The data steward will&#xD;
      track outcomes using administrative claims data, and the study will end once 247 primary&#xD;
      outcome events have been observed. This is anticipated to occur 3-years post the start of&#xD;
      randomization. An interim data safety monitoring board, chaired by Dr. James Wright,&#xD;
      hypertension specialist and Coordinating Editor of the Cochrane Hypertension Working Group,&#xD;
      will convene upon observing 124 primary outcomes. This group will recommend whether or not&#xD;
      the study should stop early based on observed efficacy, or safety concerns.&#xD;
