    <textblock>
      This study has two aims. The first is to understand more of what may be typical health&#xD;
      trajectories after mass trauma for children and adults and what predicts these trajectories.&#xD;
      The second is to understand what may be effective early interventions to prevent long-term&#xD;
      health and psychosocial problems for youth (6-19). Participants are recruited from an&#xD;
      outreach program implemented after a landslide killed 11 persons and destroyed 33 houses in&#xD;
      Gjerdrum in Norway. One third of the inhabitants were evacuated. All evacuated are contacted&#xD;
      and screened for trauma related difficulties. Those who have significant post-trauma&#xD;
      reactions are offered trauma focused interventions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two short step-wise interventions are developed for this study as an early intervention after&#xD;
      mass trauma based on components from TF-CBT to test the relative importance of dosage and the&#xD;
      sequencing of components.&#xD;
