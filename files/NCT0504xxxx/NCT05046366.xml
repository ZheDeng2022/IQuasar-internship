    <textblock>
      To improve accurate diagnosis and treatment of common malignant tumors and major infectious&#xD;
      diseases in the respiratory system, we aim to establish a large medical database that&#xD;
      includes standardized and structured clinical diagnosis and treatment information such as&#xD;
      electronic medical records, image features, pathological features, and multi-omics&#xD;
      information, and to develop a multi-modal data fusion-based technology system for&#xD;
      individualized intelligent pathological diagnosis and therapeutic effect prediction using&#xD;
      artificial intelligence technology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main aims are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish a medical big data platform for multi-modal information fusion of common&#xD;
           tumors and major infectious diseases (lung cancer/pulmonary nodules, tuberculosis, and&#xD;
           COVID-19) based on the existing pathological image features and clinical multi-omics&#xD;
           information database: The medical big data platform supports the acquisition of the&#xD;
           patient's clinical electronic medical records (including routine clinical detection),&#xD;
           full view digital section of pathological image data, medical imaging (CT, MRI,&#xD;
           ultrasound, nuclear medicine, etc.), multiple omics data (genome, transcriptome, and&#xD;
           metabolome, proteomics) omics data, etiology, pathology, and associated graphic data&#xD;
           reports and multimodal medical treatment data. We aim to realize the storage, sharing,&#xD;
           fusion computing, privacy protection, and security supervision of multi-modal and&#xD;
           cross-scale biomedical big data. Our work will open up key business processes and links&#xD;
           across regions, across hospitals, between different terminals, between hospitals and&#xD;
           doctors, and between departments, so as to promote continuous data accumulation and&#xD;
           knowledge precipitation in hospitals and promote medical collaboration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To create a multimodal information fusion database with pathologic features, imaging&#xD;
           features, multi-omics (pathologic, genomic, transcriptome, metabolome, proteomics,&#xD;
           etc.), and clinical information of patients at different stages of lung cancer/pulmonary&#xD;
           nodules, tuberculosis, and COVID-19. The database scale includes multimodal data of at&#xD;
           least 600 lung cancer/pulmonary nodules, 200 tuberculosis, and 200 COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
           Moreover, there will be more than 10 biomarkers significantly related to the diagnosis&#xD;
           and treatment of patients with lung cancer/pulmonary nodules, tuberculosis and COVID-19&#xD;
           were excavated through association analysis, providing parameters for artificial&#xD;
           intelligence model construction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We will make use of artificial intelligence technology to create the multi-modal medical&#xD;
           big data cross-analysis technology and the above disease individualized accurate&#xD;
           diagnosis and curative effect prediction models. In order to solve the three key&#xD;
           problems of multi-modal data fusion mining, such as unbalanced, small sample size, and&#xD;
           poor interpretability, we will establish an ARTIFICIAL intelligence recognition&#xD;
           algorithm for image images and pathological images, and use image processing and deep&#xD;
           learning technologies to mine multi-level depth visual features of image data and&#xD;
           pathological data. In addition, we will use bioinformatics analysis algorithms to&#xD;
           conduct molecular network mining and functional analysis of molecular markers at the&#xD;
           level of multiple omics technologies (pathologic, genomic, transcriptome, metabolome,&#xD;
           proteome, etc.).&#xD;
