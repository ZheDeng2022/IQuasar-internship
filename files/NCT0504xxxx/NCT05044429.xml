      This study aims to compare the effectiveness of a regional anesthetic block vs systemic&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) lidocaine in controlling post-operative pain in kidney transplantation&#xD;
      patients. Regional anesthetic blocks and lidocaine infusions are effective alternatives to&#xD;
      opioid medications and are already in use at many institutions. However, there has been no&#xD;
      prospective study comparing their effectiveness when used in conjunction with the current&#xD;
      standard of care patient controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps. This study is a prospective,&#xD;
      randomized evaluation of both treatment methods.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adequate postoperative pain control is an important part of the patients' recovery. Renal&#xD;
      transplant patients often have multiple comorbidities, that when combined with poorly&#xD;
      controlled postoperative pain, can lead to tachycardia, hypertension, and increased risk of&#xD;
      respiratory complications, which can in turn affect overall recovery and graft survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pumps is currently considered the standard of&#xD;
      care in treating surgical pain in the immediate postoperative period. Although a traditional&#xD;
      mainstay of therapy, opioids have an unfavorable side effect profile that includes&#xD;
      respiratory depression, nausea, postoperative ileus, sedation, and pruritus. Additionally,&#xD;
      long-term opioid use is linked with opioid tolerance, addiction, and patient death. Patients&#xD;
      that have high-level opioid use in the first year posttransplant have been found to have high&#xD;
      rates of death and all-cause graft failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, there has been a shift in post-operative pain management to utilize a multimodal&#xD;
      approach of both non-pharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies. As a result, the use of other&#xD;
      non-opioid therapies, such as lidocaine infusions and regional anesthetic techniques, like&#xD;
      transverse abdominis plane blocks, have recently increased in popularity in perioperative&#xD;
      pain management of renal transplant patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous lidocaine has an off label indication as analgesic and has good evidence for use&#xD;
      in other areas such as colorectal surgery, trauma and orthopedics. Lidocaine infusions have a&#xD;
      strong record of safety with relatively benign adverse side effects. Although data is&#xD;
      promising, there is little established evidence of perioperative lidocaine infusions in renal&#xD;
      transplant populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transverse abdominis plane (TAP) blocks and quadratus lumborum (QL) blocks have emerged as a&#xD;
      significant regional technique in the application of multimodal analgesia for abdominal&#xD;
      surgeries. Historically, TAP and QL catheters are avoided due to concern about infection near&#xD;
      the operative site in immunosuppressed transplant patients. Establishing intravenous&#xD;
      lidocaine as an effective treatment option will allow physicians to avoid the side effects of&#xD;
      opioids and the infection risks of TAP and QL catheter blocks.&#xD;
