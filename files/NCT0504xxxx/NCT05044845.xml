  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gene therapy is a paradigm-shifting treatment for hemophilia B patients, particularly in&#xD;
      resource-limited countries where factor availability remains low. Transparent and culturally&#xD;
      sensitive communication around gene therapy is vital to the success of a high-quality&#xD;
      consenting process. Current literature on knowledge, beliefs and attitudes about gene therapy&#xD;
      in resource-limited countries is inadequate. In addition, few educational resources to&#xD;
      explain basic gene therapy concepts exist in languages other than English. This study aims to&#xD;
      address these gaps in knowledge and aid for the development of educational resources to&#xD;
      assist the informed consent processes for gene therapy in resource-limited countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess baseline knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes about gene therapy held by hemophilia B&#xD;
      patients at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and in resource-limited countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To explore healthcare workers' (i.e., physicians, nurses, social workers,&#xD;
           educators/academic coordinators) perspectives regarding the education needs of&#xD;
           hemophilia B patients in resource-limited countries and at St. Jude&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore healthcare workers beliefs and attitudes about gene therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify preferences of patients with hemophilia B and their healthcare workers on&#xD;
           how/by what method or pathway educational content should be provided.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective cohort study will use qualitative methods, specifically semi structured&#xD;
      interviews to evaluate knowledge, beliefs, and attitude about gene therapy in patients 12&#xD;
      years and older with a diagnosis of moderate and severe hemophilia B (≤2% FIX activity only),&#xD;
      caregivers/parents and healthcare workers who care for them at St. Jude and resource limited&#xD;
      countries. Participants will be interviewed virtually using an online video-conferencing&#xD;
      platform, phone or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interviews will be performed by experienced qualitative interviewers in the official language&#xD;
      of each participating site. Interviews will last approximately 45-60 minutes and will be&#xD;
      performed only once. All interviews will be audio recorded and obtained information will be&#xD;
      analyzed using semantic content analysis to identify common themes.&#xD;
