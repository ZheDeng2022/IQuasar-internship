  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goals of this cross-sectional study on a racially diverse group of children (3-10y) and&#xD;
      their mothers are to determine whether the relationship between sweet taste phenotypes&#xD;
      differed among mother-daughter and mother-son dyads and to determine the predictive value of&#xD;
      a hair biomarker (delta13C). Given the widespread overconsumption of added sugars, and the&#xD;
      associated burden of disease, improving surveillance measures and developing strategies to&#xD;
      reduce added sugar intake, especially among the youngest members of society, are public&#xD;
      health priorities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site cross-sectional study designed to investigate the relationship of sweet&#xD;
      taste phenotypes among mother-child dyads and assess the predictive value of a hair biomarker&#xD;
      for sweet taste phenotypes. For each participant, we will collect 2-day 24-hour dietary&#xD;
      recalls to determine added sugar intake; directly assess the level of sweet taste most&#xD;
      preferred; measure liking/disliking of sweet tasting foods and beverages; collect&#xD;
      anthropometric measures; and collect at least 3 cm of hair for biomarker analyses. Mothers&#xD;
      will also complete a variety of questionnaires on parenting and child behavior.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diet intake</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, average 2 and a half years</time_frame>
    <description>Two days of dietary intake will be obtained by having mothers report all the foods and beverage eaten during past day using the Automated Self-Administered Recall System (ASA24). Mothers will complete for herself and her child on two separate days. From these data, we will obtain daily energy intake (kcal/d), sugar (g/d; kcal/d) intake</description>

    <measure>PALS/ALS Liking surveys</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, average 2 and a half years</time_frame>
    <description>Liking of different types of foods will by assessed by Preschool Adapted Liking Survey (PALS) for children [range -100 (maximal dislike) to 100 (maximal like)] and the Adult Liking Survey (ALS) for adults [range -100 (maximal dislike) to 100 (maximal like)]</description>

    <measure>Hair Biomarker for added sugar intake</measure>
    <time_frame>After study completion, 2022</time_frame>
    <description>Three cm of each hair sample will undergo stable isotope ratio mass spectrometry that will yield the concentration of carbon-13 relative to carbon-12 (added sugar biomarker, which has been shown to be associated with added sugar intake in older children and adults. Each cm reflects the added sugar intake of one month.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anthropometry</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, average 2 and a half years</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure each participant's height (in cm) and weight (in kg). From these two measures, we will combine to calculate BMI (kg/m2) as well as determine the corresponding BMI-for-age percentile in children and BMI in adults.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Eating Behavior constructs</measure>
    <time_frame>Through study completion, average 2 and a half years</time_frame>
    <description>Mothers will complete the 35-item Adult Eating Behavior Questionnaire to describe her eating behaviors and the 26-item Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire to describe her child's eating behaviors. Each item is scored from 1 (disagree/never) to 5 (agree/always) and are averaged and categorized into the following eating behavior constructs: enjoyment of food, food responsiveness, satiety responsiveness, emotional overeating; emotional undereating, and food fussiness. Higher numbers reflect more of the behavior.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Waist-to-Hip ratio</measure>

    <description>We will measure each participant's waist and hip in cm from which the ratio is calculated.</description>
