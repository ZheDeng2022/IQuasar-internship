  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The sacro-iliac joint is a large joint that can be the source of chronic pain. Many treatment&#xD;
      options have been proposed to treat SIJ pain, with variable efficacy. The next step in&#xD;
      managing those patients who can't get sustained pain relief from conservative treatment is&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of the SIJ's posterior innervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the success rate of SIJ RFA, as determined by the proportion of patients reporting&#xD;
      greater than 50% pain relief 6 months after the intervention, varies substantially across&#xD;
      studies, ranging from 38-71 %. This may be explained partly by the fact that there may be&#xD;
      incomplete lesioning of the target nerves supplying the joint. To overcome these&#xD;
      particularities, two RFA techniques have emerged: cooled RFA and bipolar RFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cooled radiofrequency is the one that has been studied the most, and good evidence supports&#xD;
      its efficacy. However, its superiority to conventional RF for the treatment of SIJ pain is&#xD;
      not confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, a bipolar RFA technique using conventional radiofrequency needles and&#xD;
      equipment can be used. The efficacy of this relatively newer technique has been demonstrated&#xD;
      by only one study, and although the results were promising, it is not known whether they&#xD;
      could be replicated. The success of the palisade technique could be enhanced by using&#xD;
      multi-tined expandable electrodes, such as the 3-tined Trident cannulas, with only small&#xD;
      increases in cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, the palisade technique using 3-tines needles is routinely used.&#xD;
      However, its efficacy has not been formally evaluated. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      prospective cohort study will be to determine the success rate of the palisade SIJ RFA (P-RF)&#xD;
      technique using the 3-tined needles, determined as the proportion of patients reporting &gt;50%&#xD;
      pain relief, 6 months after the procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Single center, prospective cohort study. Thirty patients from the Maisonneuve-Rosemont's Pain&#xD;
      center with chronic low back pain of SIJ origin who are candidates for SIJ RFA will be&#xD;
      invited to participate in this study. SIJ RFA will be performed using the palisade technique&#xD;
      using 3-tined needles. The patients will be followed for a period of 10 months to determine&#xD;
      pain relief, opioid use, satisfaction and impact on disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, cohort study Population: Patients who are scheduled to receive a&#xD;
      SIJ RFA at the Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital's Chronic Pain Clinic Duration of study: 2 years&#xD;
      Patient included in the study will be followed up for 10 months. Sample size: 30 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Study procedure This study's methodology will follow the standard practice for&#xD;
      treating patients with SIJ pain at the Maisonneuve-rosemont Hospital First, an intraarticular&#xD;
      SIJ injection of local anesthetic with a corticosteroid is offered to patients presenting&#xD;
      with pain of presumed SIJ origin (predominantly axial low back pain, below the L5 vertebrae,&#xD;
      positive SIJ provocation maneuvers). Patients who experience significant pain relief for more&#xD;
      than 3 months will be offered a repeat steroid SIJ injection when pain recurs, and none of&#xD;
      their data will be included in this study. Patients who experience significant pain relief&#xD;
      lasting less than 3 months will be offered a SLBB according to the previously described&#xD;
      technique (15). According to standard practice, all patients receiving a SLBB file a pain&#xD;
      diary that evaluates the pain intensity over a 36h period following the block. This diary is&#xD;
      sent back by e-mail to the treating physician and will be deemed positive if &gt;50% pain relief&#xD;
      is reported for at least 2h but lasting less than 24h. Only patients with a positive SLBB&#xD;
      will be considered for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of this study, the data from all the diaries will be collected to determine&#xD;
      the rate of positive SLBBs among patients who had significant but not sustained pain relief&#xD;
      from intraarticular SIJ injection. This information is not yet known and is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recrutement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The result of all block diaries of all patients who received a multi-site, multi-depth SLBB&#xD;
      will be transmitted to the research nurse after being evaluated by the treating physician.&#xD;
      Patients with a negative block will not be included in the study but the result of their&#xD;
      block will be filed in order to determine the positive rate of SLBB among patients who had&#xD;
      significant but non sustained pain relief from intra articular corticosteroid injection.&#xD;
      Patients with a positive block will be considered for inclusion in the study. Additionally,&#xD;
      every Friday, a member of the research team will review the list of procedures that are&#xD;
      scheduled during the following week to screen for patients scheduled for SIJ RFA to make sure&#xD;
      that the result of their post block diary was computed and that no patients are missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's file will be reviewed to confirm inclusion and exclusion criteria. All eligible&#xD;
      patients will then be contacted by phone by a member of the research team to introduce them&#xD;
      to the study protocol. A copy of the patient consent form will be sent by e-mail to patients&#xD;
      who show interest in participating to the research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will then be contacted again by phone the day prior to the procedure to answer any&#xD;
      question and confirm their interest in participating to the study. Patients who wish to&#xD;
      participate will be met by the research team on the day of their procedure and written&#xD;
      consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RF Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures will be performed according to the standard of care for SIJ RFA at the&#xD;
      Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital's Chronic Pain Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-RF:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P-RF is performed using a conventional temperature-controlled RF generator (Kimberly Clark&#xD;
      PMG V4.0, Roswell, GA, USA) generating monopolar lesions at 85°C for 150 sec, with a 30 sec&#xD;
      ramp time. Four, 18 Gauge 3-tined, 90 mm cannulas with an active tip of 10 mm (RF Trident;&#xD;
      Diros Technology) will be used along with a four-output radiofrequency generator configured&#xD;
      for bipolar output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesioning the sacral lateral branches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Under fluoroscopic guidance in the anteroposterior view, the C-arm is angulated cephalad&#xD;
           in order to align the superior end plate of S1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a radiopaque marker, the superior border of the S1 posterior foramen is identified&#xD;
           and the marker is placed slightly superior to this level, between the posterior foramen&#xD;
           lateral border and the SIJ line. The overlying skin is marked with a sterile pen. The&#xD;
           same marking procedure is accomplished, slightly inferior to the inferior border of the&#xD;
           S3 posterior foramen. Using a sterile disposable ruler, a line connecting these two dots&#xD;
           is drawn on the patient's skin and marked every 10 millimeters. The resulting line will&#xD;
           typically be 55-60 mm long, and can be extended 5 mm in its superior and/or inferior&#xD;
           part to allow sufficient space to place the uppermost and/or lowermost needle, allowing&#xD;
           an inter-needle distance of 10 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The skin is anesthetized with 1% lidocaine at each of the 10 mm marks, and four 3-tined&#xD;
           RF needles are inserted under fluoroscopic guidance at the four uppermost marks.&#xD;
           Intermittent fluoroscopy is used to ensure that the needles stay parallel to one&#xD;
           another, perpendicular to the dorsal surface of the sacrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once contact with the dorsal surface of the sacrum is obtained, the C-arm is turned to&#xD;
           obtain a lateral view to confirm that none of the needles went into the sacral foramen&#xD;
           or landed on the posterior iliac crest (too shallow), and the tines are deployed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Needles 1 and 2 and needles 3 and 4 are connected to outputs 1 and 2, respectively, of&#xD;
           the four-output radiofrequency generator. A motor stimulation test is carried out at&#xD;
           each of the two pairs to ensure absence of motor stimulation in the lower limbs (2.0 V,&#xD;
           2 Hz), and 0,5 ml of 1% lidocaine is injected through the side port of each cannula. The&#xD;
           RF energy is then delivered, making two bipolar lesions at a time. Then, the uppermost&#xD;
           cannula (1) is removed and inserted at the fifth mark, using the same technique as&#xD;
           previously described, and another set of two bipolar lesions is created (between needles&#xD;
           2 and 3 and 4 and 5) This procedure is repeated at the remaining target sites by&#xD;
           leapfroging the needles, until the entire length is lesioned, requiring a total of 3 to&#xD;
           4 outputs of RF energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesioning the L5 dorsal ramus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Under fluoroscopic guidance in the anteroposterior view, the inflexion between the ala of&#xD;
      the sacrum and the S1 superior articular process, is visualized. The RF needle is inserted&#xD;
      from a point slightly lateral and inferior to the target until contact with the bone is made.&#xD;
      Using a lateral view, the needle is confirmed to be no deeper than the anterior-posterior&#xD;
      midline of the S1 superior articular process. The tines are deployed, and motor testing is&#xD;
      performed to ensure absence of motor stimulation in the lower limb (2.0 V, 2 Hz). Sensory&#xD;
      testing will not be performed as its benefits regarding clinical outcome are not endorsed by&#xD;
      clinical guidelines. Then, 1 ml of 1% lidocaine is injected through the side port and the RF&#xD;
      energy is delivered, creating a monopolar lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
