  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site cluster-randomized trial to assess efficacy and implementation outcomes&#xD;
      of deprescribing interventions in 72 older adults with polypharmacy (PP) and curable cancers&#xD;
      initiating chemotherapy. Oncologists (as the cluster) will enroll 6 patients each and will be&#xD;
      randomized to either a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention or patient education&#xD;
      intervention. Initial focus groups with oncologists, nurses, pharmacists, primary care&#xD;
      physicians, and patients will provide data for initial adaptations to the pharmacist-led&#xD;
      intervention arm, and 8 patients will be enrolled as a pre-trial cohort to further refine and&#xD;
      adapt the pharmacist-led intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polypharmacy (PP), or the concurrent use of multiple medications, affects up to 92% of older&#xD;
      adults with cancer. It has been associated with adverse outcomes in these patients including&#xD;
      poor adherence to and tolerance of cancer therapy, decrease in physical functioning,&#xD;
      unplanned hospitalizations, falls, increased symptoms, and lower survival. &quot;Deprescribing,&quot;&#xD;
      or the planned discontinuation of medications which may be potentially unsafe or&#xD;
      inappropriate, is an intervention strategy which has the potential to decrease PP and improve&#xD;
      outcomes. Deprescribing has not been studied in older adults with cancer receiving&#xD;
      chemotherapy. The proposed study will adapt and refine potentially scalable deprescribing&#xD;
      interventions, investigate the effects of deprescribing interventions on relative dose&#xD;
      intensity and other adverse outcomes in older adults undergoing curative-intent chemotherapy,&#xD;
      and identify barriers and facilitators of deprescribing interventions for patients,&#xD;
      oncologists, and pharmacists. Focus groups and interviews with pharmacists, oncologists,&#xD;
      nurses, primary care providers, and patient advocates will allow initial adaptation of the&#xD;
      proposed interventions. A &quot;pre-pilot&quot; cohort of 8 patients with PP and cancer planned to&#xD;
      receive curative-intent chemotherapy will undergo a pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention&#xD;
      with additional iterative adaptations. Then, 72 patients will be allocated to a&#xD;
      pharmacist-led deprescribing intervention versus patient education intervention in a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial of 12 oncologist clusters.&#xD;
