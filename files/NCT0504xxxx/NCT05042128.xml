  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the ASCEND clinical trial is to measure the effect of adding CEND-1, compared&#xD;
      to placebo, to chemotherapy (gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel) in patients who have untreated&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer. The study will assess the duration which the cancer remained&#xD;
      stable or improved, the number of patients who responded to treatment, overall survival, side&#xD;
      effects and quality of life.&#xD;

             adenocarcinoma or poorly differentiated carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Archival tumour tissue for tertiary correlative studies (biopsy or resection of&#xD;
             primary or metastasis). Fine needle aspirate (FNA) or brushings will not be accepted.&#xD;

          -  Adequate hepatic function, defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bilirubin &lt;1.5 X ULN (Upper Limit of Normal), AST or ALT ≤ 5x ULN. If a person was recently&#xD;
        stented with improving bilirubin, the person can be randomised with bilirubin up to 3 x ULN&#xD;
        provided chemotherapy is not administered until within the stated thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to comply with all study requirements, including treatment, timing&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Malignancy that was treated with curative intent and for which there has been no&#xD;
                  known active disease for ≥2 years prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Curatively treated non-melanoma skin cancer, cervical cancer in situ, superficial&#xD;
                  transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder, stage 1 endometrial carcinoma,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Concurrent illness, including severe infection that may jeopardise the ability of the&#xD;
             person to undergo the procedures outlined in this protocol with reasonable safety.&#xD;
