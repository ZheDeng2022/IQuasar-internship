  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn about the use of [13C]pyruvate as an imaging agent for&#xD;
      MRI scans. In past studies, researchers have seen that [13C]pyruvate can improve imaging with&#xD;
      MRI scans. However, they would like to know more about how the imaging agent is distributed&#xD;
      in healthy organs and tissues. This study will provide additional information about the use&#xD;
      of [13C]pyruvate as an imaging agent for MRI scans, and it will show us how the substance is&#xD;
      metabolized (changed into energy) in the organs and tissues of healthy volunteers.&#xD;

          -  Age between 18-80&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative serum or urine pregnancy test for female volunteers of childbearing age and&#xD;
             potential (as defined by MSKCC Standards &amp; Guidelines), from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study enrollment. Urine pregnancy tests are only valid for the day of test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

          -  History of metabolic (e.g. diabetes) and renal functional disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g., due to claustrophobia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, systemic malignant&#xD;
             diseases, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Standard MRI safety screening will be applied (MRI screening questionnaire);&#xD;
             volunteers with MR unsafe devices, or conditional devices where research mode is not&#xD;
             allowed, will be excluded.&#xD;
