      Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common conditions diagnosed in&#xD;
      gastroenterology practice. Acute infectious gastroenteritis represents the strongest known&#xD;
      risk factor for IBS development; a condition known as post-infection IBS (PI-IBS). PI-IBS&#xD;
      patients are more likely than sporadic IBS patients to exhibit a diarrhea-predominant&#xD;
      phenotype. The investigators plan to prospectively recruit two groups of patients: patients&#xD;
      with diarrhea-predominant post-infectious IBSand patients with diarrhea predominant classical&#xD;
      IBS (non PI-IBS) who will be used as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients included in the study will receive for 28 days a capsule containing Tamarind seed&#xD;
      polysaccharide containing xyloglucan, combined with a pea protein reticulated with grape seed&#xD;
      extractand a prebiotic, the xilooligosaccharide (Gelsectan, Devintec Sagl) twice daily.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional disorder of alimentary system, which is&#xD;
      recently considered as an erroneous gut-brain interaction. IBS is one of the most common&#xD;
      conditions diagnosed in gastroenterology practice. Its prevalence ranges between 7-16% in&#xD;
      western countries and is more common in females and younger individuals. Although the&#xD;
      etiology of IBS is still obscure, its pathophysiology is dominated by a combination of both&#xD;
      psychological factors and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Recent efforts have allowed&#xD;
      identification of several peripheral micro-organic abnormalities. These include changes in&#xD;
      gut microbiota, low grade mucosal inflammation, and epithelial dysfunction. Acute infectious&#xD;
      gastroenteritis represents the strongest known risk factor for IBS development; a condition&#xD;
      known as post-infectiousIBS (PI-IBS). According to a recent survey PI-IBS accounts for around&#xD;
      13% of all IBS. Today the diagnostic criteria for PI-IBS proposed by the Rome Foundation&#xD;
      Working Team are based on the Rome IV criteria. These criteria were not part of the original&#xD;
      Rome IV document as they were prepared after the release of Rome IV publications and need to&#xD;
      be fulfilled for the last 3 months with symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis. The&#xD;
      acute infectious gastroenteritis is ideally diagnosed by stool culture (although only&#xD;
      occasionally obtained in community subjects), validated molecular biology analyses (e.g.,&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction) or by the presence of â‰¥2 of the following: fever, vomiting, or&#xD;
      diarrhea. The investigators plan to prospectively recruit two groups of patients: patients&#xD;
      with diarrhea-predominant post-infectious IBSand patients with diarrhea predominant classical&#xD;
      IBS (non PI-IBS) who will be used as controls. Patients included in the study will receive&#xD;
      for 28 days a capsule containing Xyloglucan, Pea Protein and Grape Seed Extract and a&#xD;
      prebiotic Xylo-oligosaccharides (Gelsectan, Devintec sagl) twice daily. Drugs that might have&#xD;
      any effect on intestinal motility or secretion will not be allowed during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients responding to treatment will be those in whom diarrhea disappeared, i.e. reported&#xD;
      two or less non-watery stools emissions per day (stool of type 5 or less on the Bristol&#xD;
      scale). Response to treatment will be assessed in the two group of patients immediately after&#xD;
      the end of the 28-day administration of Gelsectan; however all patients will be followed for&#xD;
      another 3 months and long term response to treatment will be assessed in that time period as&#xD;
      well. The presence and intensity of abdominal pain and flatulence will also be measured on a&#xD;
      seven-point Likert scale (7 very much better, 6 much better, 5 somewhat better, 4 same, 3&#xD;
      somewhat worse, 2 much worse, 1 very much worse). These measurements will be made in all&#xD;
      patients immediately at the end of the 28-day administration of Gelsectan and at the end of&#xD;
      the 3 month follow up period as well. Treatment response will be compared between the two&#xD;
      groups using the chi squared test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and tolerability will be monitored during the entire study period through adverse&#xD;
      events occurence.&#xD;

        predominant classical IBS (non PI-IBS) who will be used as controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of IBS will be made according to the ROME iV criteria as following:&#xD;

             diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diagnosis of post infectious IBS will be made according to the Rome Foundation Working Team&#xD;
        criteria as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Recurrent abdominal pain, on average, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, with&#xD;
        symptom onset at least 6 months before diagnosis, associated with two of the following:&#xD;

             resolution of acute infectious gastroenteritis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Infectious gastroenteritis should be defined by positive stool culture in a symptomatic&#xD;
        individual or presence of two of the following acute symptoms (when stool culture not&#xD;
        available):&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. fever&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not meet criteria for IBS before onset of acute illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
