      Prolonged prone position ventilation reduces the 30-day mortality in acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS) and in COVID-19 infection. The evidence showed that a large number&#xD;
      of patients with COVID-19 suffered from new-onset cardiac disease due to inflammatory&#xD;
      processes or cytokine storm, therefore, ECG is crucial for making the diagnosis including&#xD;
      arrhythmias and myocardial infarction. However, there is limited data on the effects of prone&#xD;
      position on the ECG in COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we aimed to identify differences of&#xD;
      electrical parameters between prone position and standard ECG including the difference in&#xD;
      amplitude and duration of P, QRS, PR interval, QT interval, ST-segment between both positions&#xD;
      (supine and prone). Furthermore, we aimed to compare clinical diagnosis from EKG between&#xD;
      prone position and standard ECG by the cardiologists.&#xD;
