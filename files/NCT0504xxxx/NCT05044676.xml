      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.&#xD;
      Treatment options for advanced HCC remain very limited. Until recently, multikinase inhibitor&#xD;
      were the gold standard for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma but associated with poor outcome&#xD;
      and important side effects. Recently, the positive results of the Imbrave 150 study (a&#xD;
      randomized study comparing Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab versus Sorafenib) prompted us to&#xD;
      redefine our management strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma by proposing the&#xD;
      combination of Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab as treatment first-line in patients with advanced&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma. However, only 1/3 of the patients will respond to the combination&#xD;
      of treatment and identifying predictive factors of response and new immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors in order to target more tumors appear as a major issue. In this context, recent&#xD;
      work has underlined the importance of the activating CD226/DNAM-1 receptor as an original&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic target in various cancers (solid and hematopoietic tumors). CD226 is a&#xD;
      transmembrane receptor that is part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is expressed by&#xD;
      most T lymphocytes (CD8+, CD4+), by Natural Killer (NK) cells, by promoting their&#xD;
      cytotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to prospectively analyze the frequency and phenotype (expression of&#xD;
      CD226) of circulating immune cells before the initiation of treatment with&#xD;
      Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab, 3 weeks after the first injection and its variation to determine&#xD;
      whether this biomarker could predict the response to the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is now widely accepted that inflammation is an essential element in tumor development.&#xD;
      Liver tissue is very sensitive to inflammation and harbors immune system effectors capable of&#xD;
      preventing the onset of a chronic inflammatory response. However, in case of chronic liver&#xD;
      diseases, chronic inflammation will favor fibrosis progression and tumor development.&#xD;
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide.&#xD;
      Treatment options for advanced HCC remain very limited. Until recently, multikinase inhibitor&#xD;
      were the gold standard for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma but associated with poor outcome&#xD;
      and important side effects. Recently, immune checkpoint inhibitors, have emerged as an&#xD;
      innovative anti-tumor strategy to restore an anti-tumor immune response, as illustrated by&#xD;
      recent positive results of immunotherapy in oncology with prolonged responses in some&#xD;
      patients. The initial results of immunotherapy in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma as&#xD;
      monotherapy have been disappointing. However, combinations of immunotherapy and anti-VEGF&#xD;
      antibodies or between immunotherapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors are currently being tested&#xD;
      in order to potentiate the effect of immunotherapy and to obtain higher rates of anti-tumor&#xD;
      response. Recently, the positive results of the Imbrave 150 study (a randomized study&#xD;
      comparing Atezolizumab + Bevacizumab versus Sorafenib) prompted us to redefine our management&#xD;
      strategy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma by proposing the combination of&#xD;
      Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab as treatment first-line in patients with advanced hepatocellular&#xD;
      carcinoma. However, only 1/3 of the patients will respond to the combination of treatment and&#xD;
      identifying predictive factors of response and new immune checkpoint inhibitors in order to&#xD;
      target more tumors appear as a major issue. In this context, recent work has underlined the&#xD;
      importance of the activating CD226/DNAM-1 receptor as an original immunotherapeutic target in&#xD;
      various cancers (solid and hematopoietic tumors). CD226 is a transmembrane receptor that is&#xD;
      part of the immunoglobulin superfamily. It is expressed by most T lymphocytes (CD8+, CD4+),&#xD;
      by Natural Killer (NK) cells, by promoting their cytotoxicity. The ligands for CD226 are the&#xD;
      molecules CD112 and CD155, which are overexpressed in many tumors and are associated with a&#xD;
      poor prognosis for patients. Recent data show that the decrease in CD226 expression on the&#xD;
      surface of anti-tumor-containing immune effectors may be associated with resistance to&#xD;
      anti-PD1/PDL1 immunotherapies. To date, the involvement of CD226 and its ligands in liver&#xD;
      tumorigenesis is completely unknown. The use of Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab in France is a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to conduct a pilot study on clinical, biological, histological, molecular&#xD;
      and immune prognostic and predictive factors in patients treated with the&#xD;
      Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothese that a decrease in CD226 expression on the surface of CD8+ T&#xD;
      lymphocytes (CTLs) and NK cells before the initiation of treatment with&#xD;
      Atezolizumab/Bevacizumab could be associated with decrease response to the treatment and&#xD;
      therefore associated with poor outcome of the patient. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      prospectively analyze the frequency and phenotype (expression of CD226) of circulating immune&#xD;
      cells before the initiation of treatment with Atezolizumab/ Bevacizumab, 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      first injection (day of the second infusion) and its variation to determine whether this&#xD;
      biomarker could predict the response to the treatment. The investigators will also perform an&#xD;
      analysis of the histological and pathology characteristics of the tumor and non-tumor liver&#xD;
      of the same patient before the initiation of treatment with Atezolizumab/ Bevacizumab with&#xD;
      the ultimate objective of developing a predictive prognostic score for treatment response.&#xD;
