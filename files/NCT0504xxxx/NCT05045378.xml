  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past decades, the prevalence of adolescent depression and suicide increased&#xD;
      significantly in Taiwan and worldwide. To date, the suicide mortality is the second mortality&#xD;
      cause in the adolescent and young adult population in Taiwan. Previous studies reported that&#xD;
      up to 40% of adolescents with major depressive disorder did not respond to at least two&#xD;
      traditional antidepressants with the optimal dose and adequate duration. Those patients would&#xD;
      be considered the cases with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), which is related to the&#xD;
      poor prognosis, chronic depressive course, higher suicidal risk, severer cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, and greater family burdens. However, much less studies investigated the&#xD;
      treatment strategy for adolescent TRD compared with that for adult TRD. In this decade,&#xD;
      low-dose ketamine infusion has been proved as a rapid-acting antidepressant for adult&#xD;
      patients with TRD. In recent 5 years, the investigators study team finished two randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, and placebo-control trials to support the rapid antidepressant and&#xD;
      anti-suicidal effect in Taiwanese adult patients with TRD. The investigators published&#xD;
      several SCI studies about the investigators clinical findings and the underlying brain&#xD;
      mechanisms. In the following 4 years, the investigators will conduct a new randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, and placebo-control trial in the adolescent TRD. It will be the first clinical&#xD;
      trial for ketamine effect in adolescent TRD worldwide. The investigators will enroll 54&#xD;
      adolescents aged between 13 and 19 with TRD in four years. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      low-dose ketamine will be effective and well tolerable for adolescents with TRD.&#xD;
