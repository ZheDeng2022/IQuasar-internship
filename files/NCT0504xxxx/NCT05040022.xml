  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of low-pressure pneumoperitoneum seems to be able to reduce complications such as&#xD;
      postoperative pain. However, the quality of evidence for most studies evaluating this&#xD;
      relationship is considered low. The absence of concealment of pneumoperitoneum pressure and&#xD;
      the lack of description of neuromuscular blockade characteristics are the main causes of&#xD;
      bias. The purpose of this study will be to evaluate by means of a prospective, randomized and&#xD;
      double-blinded trial, the quality of recovery (QoR-15) questionnaire of patients undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy under moderate neuromuscular blockade, using low&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum pressure or &quot;standard&quot; pressure. Eighty patients submitted to laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy and randomly distributed in two groups will be included: low pneumoperitoneum&#xD;
      pressure (10 mmHg) or &quot;standard&quot; pressure (14 mmHg). The value of abdominal pressure will be&#xD;
      kept hidden for all participants, except for the nurse responsible for the operating room.&#xD;
      Moderate neuromuscular blockade will be maintained according to Train-of-four count (TOFc) =&#xD;
      3 for all cases.&#xD;

      METHODS After obtaining approval from the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medical&#xD;
      and Health Sciences of PUC-SP on August 10th 2021, CAAE 49753621.1.0000.5373, patients 18 to&#xD;
      70 years of age, with physical status I and II according to the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA), undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy at Hospital Santa&#xD;
      Lucinda will be evaluated for participation in this clinical, prospective, and randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. Patients will be excluded before randomization if: (i) refuse to participate;&#xD;
      (ii) present inability to communicate due to altered level of consciousness or due to the&#xD;
      presence of neurological or psychiatric illness; (iii) present contraindication to the use of&#xD;
      any of the drugs employed in the study; (iv) present history of alcohol or drug addiction;&#xD;
      (v) body mass index (BMI) ≥ 35; (vi) and the presence of chronic pain or use of opioids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized according to the sequence of random numbers generated by a&#xD;
      computer using a specific program (www.random.org). For each patient, an opaque envelope&#xD;
      containing the group to which the patient will be allocated will be prepared, sealed, and&#xD;
      numbered sequentially. On the day of the surgery, after the pre-anesthetic evaluation and the&#xD;
      necessary explanation about the study, study consent will be obtained. Age, gender, physical&#xD;
      status, body mass index (BMI) and risk classification for post-operative nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      (PONV) will be recorded as proposed by Apfel et al. All patients will be instructed on the&#xD;
      numerical scale of post-operative pain and on the QoR-15 questionnaire. No pre-anesthetic&#xD;
      medication will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia and surgery After entering the operating room, all patients will be monitored&#xD;
      with ASA standard monitoring. NMB will be assessed using acceleromyography (TOF Watch SX®;&#xD;
      Schering-Plow) as recommended for use in clinical research. The acceleration transducer will&#xD;
      be attached to the volar side in the distal phalanx of the thumb. Anaesthesia will be induced&#xD;
      using 0.5 µg/kg remifentanil for 3 minutes, followed by propofol (2 mg/kg), and rocuronium&#xD;
      (0.3 mg/Kg). After tracheal intubation anesthesia will be maintained with 1.5%-3% sevoflurane&#xD;
      and 0.1-0.5 µg/kg/min remifentanil, both necessary to maintain an adequate anesthesia plane.&#xD;
      The ventilation will be controlled with the tidal volume and respiratory rate adjusted aiming&#xD;
      for an end-tidal CO2 between 30 and 40 mmHg. Additional doses of rocuronium (0.05 mg/kg) will&#xD;
      be administered to maintain TOFc = 3 until gallbladder removal. TOF stimulation will be&#xD;
      applied every 15 minutes and the time under moderate or deep NMB will be registered.&#xD;
      Hydration will be achieved using lactated Ringer's solution (500 ml in the first 30 minutes&#xD;
      followed by 2 ml/kg/h maintenance). All patients will receive dexamethasone (8 mg) and&#xD;
      ketoprofen (100 mg) at the beginning of the surgery and ondansetron (4 mg) 15 minutes before&#xD;
      the end of the procedure. Atropine (0.02 mg/kg) and neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) will be&#xD;
      administered to obtain T4/T1 &gt; 0.9 and, after awakening, extubation will be performed. The&#xD;
      time elapsed between the discontinuation of the anesthetic agents and awakening will be&#xD;
      recorded. Furthermore, the duration of the surgery and the total dose of rocuronium will be&#xD;
      noted. Local anesthetic infiltration of the trocar insertion sites will be performed by the&#xD;
      surgical team using 20 ml of 0.75% ropivacaine under direct visualization, and included the&#xD;
      aponeurosis, the subcutaneous tissue, and the skin. The abdomen will be inflated with carbon&#xD;
      dioxide to maintain the intra-abdominal pressure at 10 mmHg (group 10) or 14 mmHg (group 14).&#xD;
      The display of the insufflation pressure value was blinded to the surgical team and the&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, but not the operating room nurse. At the end of surgery, irrigation of the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity and the surgical site will be performed using saline solution. The&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum will be completely decompressed in all patients using manual compression.&#xD;
      Surgery will be performed by the same surgical team comprised of two experienced&#xD;
      laparoscopists and two resident clinicians. At the end of the procedure, the surgical team&#xD;
      will be asked to classify the surgical conditions (good visualization, adequate working&#xD;
      space) using a 5-point Likert scale of 'very bad' (1) to 'excellent' (5). The patients will&#xD;
      be transferred to the PACU and monitored until the criterion for discharge were met (score&#xD;
      according to the Aldrete and Kroulik modified scale = 10). During the PACU stay, the&#xD;
      magnitude of pain, nausea, vomiting, and PACU length of stay will be documented. Pain will be&#xD;
      evaluated every 15 minutes using a verbal numeric scale (VNS) of 0-10, where 0 was 'no pain'&#xD;
      and 10 the 'most severe pain imaginable'. Intravenous morphine will be administered every 5&#xD;
      minutes to obtain a score &lt;3 (2 mg for pain &lt;7 and 3 mg for pain ≥7). PONV will be treated&#xD;
      with intravenous dimenhydrinate 30 mg. Following PACU discharge to the ward, patients will&#xD;
      receive 100 mg of ketoprofen every 12 hours and 1 g of dipyrone every 6 hours intravenously.&#xD;
      Whenever the patient considers the analgesic regimen to be insufficient, tramadol 100 mg will&#xD;
      be administered orally at intervals of up to 8 hours. In case of nausea and/or vomiting,&#xD;
      ondansetron 8 mg will be administered intravenously. Pain intensity (VNS) will be recorded at&#xD;
      4, 8, 12 and 24 hours after arrival on the ward. Tramadol utilization as well as the&#xD;
      occurrence of nausea, vomiting and other complications will be documented. As per&#xD;
      institutional protocol, all study patients remain in hospital for a period of 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaire QoR-15 The interviews will be conducted: immediately after opening the envelope&#xD;
      that will define the group in which the patient will be included. The preoperative&#xD;
      questionnaire (QoR-15) will be applied by a physician of the residency program in&#xD;
      anesthesiology and, after surgery, by one of three medical students, unrelated to the&#xD;
      anesthetic procedure performed. The QoR-15 has 15 questions divided into 5 dimensions:&#xD;
      emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence and pain.&#xD;
      Each question should generate a score based on a numerical scale of 11 points (zero to 10),&#xD;
      totaling zero (poor recovery) up to 10 (excellent recovery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The sample size was calculated considering a power of 90% to detect a&#xD;
      difference of 8 points in the QoR-15, which indicates the need to include 35 participants in&#xD;
      each group. Considering possible losses, the final sample will include 80 patients.&#xD;
