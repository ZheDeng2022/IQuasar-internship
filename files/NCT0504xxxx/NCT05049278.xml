  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to investigate whether two major vasopressors&#xD;
      (norepinephrine vs. phenylephrine) used for treatment of hypotension during breast&#xD;
      reconstruction with free flap transfer surgery have different effects on blood flow of the&#xD;
      flap vessel measured by transit time flowmetry. Since there are few prior studies that&#xD;
      compared the effects of these two vasopressors on the blood flow of the flap, this study will&#xD;
      be conducted in the form of a pilot study in order to establish the evidence for the future&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
