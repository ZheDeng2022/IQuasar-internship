  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim for surgical treatment of unstable Tile B2 &amp; C1 pelvic ring injuries is an anatomical&#xD;
      reduction to allow early weight-bearing, pain relief and to prevent future pelvic asymmetry.&#xD;
      So, we usually used combined posterior &amp; anterior ring fixation, relying on the fact that&#xD;
      anterior pelvic ring adequate reduction and fixation better augment posterior ring fixation&#xD;
      and enhance overall pelvic stability. However, anterior ring fixation requires a second&#xD;
      incision with a longer operation time and more blood loss. The main disadvantage of the&#xD;
      second incision is the higher risk of wound infection, either superficial or deep, which&#xD;
      questions its necessity and raises concerns about the possibility of isolated posterior ring&#xD;
      fixation in managing Tile B2 &amp; C1 pelvic ring injuries with good outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental algorithm was the questionable need for additional anterior ring fixation in&#xD;
      managing Tile B2 and C1 pelvic ring injuries combined with posterior ring fixation, whether&#xD;
      the incidence of postoperative complications, radiological and clinical outcomes differed&#xD;
      between these two groups. After reviewing the literature, we found a lack of knowledge in the&#xD;
      prospective assessment of such outcomes between the two fixation groups. So, This RCT aims to&#xD;
      reach a satisfactory result and prove or deny the questionable need for anterior ring&#xD;
      fixation in managing Tile B2 and C1 pelvic ring injuries. Our hypothesis was that PR fixation&#xD;
      is at least as good as APR fixation.&#xD;

      Type of Study: Prospective randomized controlled clinical trial Randomization technique:&#xD;
      Block Randomization. Study Setting: The operations were held in Ain Shams university&#xD;
      hospitals. Study Period: From 2019 till 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tile B2 and C1 pelvic ring injuries Nakatani zone II pubic rami fractures with intact&#xD;
      inguinal ligament Age between 16-60 years old Recent pelvic ring injuries less than three&#xD;
      weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tile A pelvic ring injuries Nakatani zone I &amp; III pubic rami fractures neglected pelvic ring&#xD;
      injuries exceeding three weeks Age less than 16 years and older than 60 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method: convenient sample. Sample Size: 40 feet subdivided randomly via Block&#xD;
      Randomization into 2 groups, 20 feet for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Patients treated by combined posterior and anterior ring fixation Group B: Patients&#xD;
      treated by posterior ring fixation alone&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations: were followed by obtaining the hospital Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      approval and written informed consents from the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were evaluated by the following: -&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Pre-operative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete ATLS protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary survey: airway, breathing, circulation and disability with complete exposure,&#xD;
      including: CXR and pelvis anteroposterior view Secondary survey: head to toe examination,&#xD;
      complete cervical clinical and radiological clearance and detailed AMPLE history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed history:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History-taking included age, mode of trauma, physiological status, haemodynamics, associated&#xD;
      internal organ injuries, medical comorbidities and detailed surgical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete Orthopaedic examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full and thorough examination of the patient was done from head to toes with complete&#xD;
      inspection, palpation and range of motion examination of the whole body, together with&#xD;
      detailed neurovascular examination of both lower limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      X-Rays pre and post-operative Preoperative: to assess the fracture pattern, location and for&#xD;
      surgical planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively: to assess the quality of reduction immediate postoperative and at each&#xD;
      follow up visit (two weeks, six weeks, three months, six months and one year) to follow up&#xD;
      union rate, fixation failure, secondary dislocation and secondary loss of reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT pelvis preoperative will be done to accurately describe fracture pattern, identify occult&#xD;
      radiological instability and more comprehensive surgical planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the patients by clinical Majeed pelvic scoring system&#xD;
&#xD;
      II.Operative technique Group A: combined posterior and anterior ring fixation Group B:&#xD;
      Isolated Posterior ring fixation&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Postoperative management and evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We followed a partially assisted weight-bearing protocol for six weeks for both groups (using&#xD;
      axillary or forearm crutches that take about 50% of the body weight through the injured lower&#xD;
      extremity). In addition, we did x-ray films &amp; neurovascular examination postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits were at two weeks, six weeks, three months, six months &amp; 1-year&#xD;
      postoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We performed radiological and clinical assessments: Radiological using Matta &amp; Tornetta&#xD;
      radiological principles via plain x-ray pelvis showing both hips: anteroposterior, inlet and&#xD;
      outlet views &amp; CT pelvis if available; we evaluated five criteria on X-ray films&#xD;
      postoperatively: residual posterior displacement, vertical displacement, pubic symphyseal&#xD;
      translation, sagittal rotation, and gapping of the sacroiliac joint; according to the grading&#xD;
      of Matta and Tornetta, we classified the results into Excellent (less than or equal 4 mm),&#xD;
      Good (4-10 mm), Fair (10-20 mm), and Poor (more than 20 mm). In addition, clinical assessment&#xD;
      by Majeed pelvic scoring system evaluated and calculated at each follow-up visit with the&#xD;
      mean value presented, Postoperative complications and need for another operation were&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In week two, we encouraged passive and active-assisted hip ROM. Then we started an unassisted&#xD;
      weight-bearing and physiotherapy program to strengthen abductors and quadriceps muscles in&#xD;
      week six. While complete full weight-bearing and return to work were after three months.&#xD;
      After six months, a full radiological and clinical assessment were done + return to&#xD;
      pre-injury mobility status and athletic sports. Finally, after one year, we did clinical and&#xD;
      radiological reevaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV- Statistical analysis of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V- Outcome measures of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes: radiological (using Matta &amp; Tornetta radiological principles) &amp; clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (using the Majeed pelvic scoring system), and postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes: operative time, amount of blood loss, intraoperative assessment of&#xD;
      reduction, need for another operation, length of hospital stay, ability to weight bear&#xD;
      postoperative, and pain control metrics.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>An independent doctor created the randomization sequence using Excel 2016 (computerized random numbers) with a 1:1 allocation via random block sizes of 2, 4, and 6; he assigned the sample numbers equally to each group and assigned the block. Patients and physicians allocated to each intervention group were aware of the allocation; however, the data analysts and the outcome assessors were kept blinded to the allocation. We prospectively carried out this study on 40 patients with Tile B2 &amp; C1 injuries between March 2019 and July 2020 that met our inclusion criteria. The independent doctor allocated the 40 cases to two groups: Group A (20 cases): combined posterior and anterior ring fixation (APR fixation group), group B (20 cases): isolated posterior ring fixation (PR fixation group).</intervention_model_description>
