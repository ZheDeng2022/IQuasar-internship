  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized trial to evaluate the optimal number of passes required during&#xD;
      endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle biopsy for molecular profiling in pancreatic cancer&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle tissue acquisition is currently the gold standard&#xD;
      for sampling solid pancreatic masses. By using novel fine needle biopsy (FNB) needles during&#xD;
      EUS-guided tissue sampling, core tissue samples can also now be obtained, with diagnostic&#xD;
      adequacy of &gt;90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular profiling is becoming increasingly important in the management of pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma for targeted therapy. As the procurement of core tissue is possible with&#xD;
      EUS-FNB, adequate tissue can now be obtained for molecular profiling. However, the number of&#xD;
      passes required during EUS-FNB to obtain sufficient quantity of core tissue to successfully&#xD;
      perform molecular profiling is unknown, although usually 2-3 passes are performed as standard&#xD;
      of care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is therefore to elucidate the optimal number of passes required&#xD;
      during EUS-FNB to procure adequate tissue for molecular profiling in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
