  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After being informed about the investigation and the potential risks, all subjects giving&#xD;
      written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study entry. At&#xD;
      week 0, subjects who meet the eligibility requirements will be randomised in open,&#xD;
      intra-patient investigation, treated with BIOpH+ Psoriasis Medical Bath on one side, and&#xD;
      comparative treatment on the other side for 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score from Baseline compared to week 8.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>The PASI score is a validated, investigator instrument assessing the severity of psoriasis. The severity is combined with the percentage of affected area.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>A quality of life instrument and will evaluate how much the skin problems affects the study subject's daily life. It is a 10-question questionnaire. Each question contains four response categories: 0=not at all, 1=a little, 2=a lot, and 3=very much. A higher score means worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2 and week 4</time_frame>
    <description>It combines the severity (erythema, induration and desquamation) and percentage of affected area. A high score means worse outcome.&#xD;
The body is divided into 4 sections:&#xD;
Head, weight = 0.1&#xD;
Arms, weight = 0.2&#xD;
Trunk, weight = 0.3&#xD;
Legs, weight = 0.4&#xD;
For each section, the percent of area of skin involved is estimated and graded:&#xD;
0. 0% of involved area&#xD;
&lt;10% of involved area&#xD;
10-29% of involved area&#xD;
30-49% of involved area&#xD;
50-69% of involved area&#xD;
70-89% of involved area&#xD;
90-100% of involved area Within each area, the severity is estimated for 3 clinical signs: erythema (redness), induration (thickness) and desquamation (scaling). Severity is measured on a scale from 0-4, from none to maximum.&#xD;
The sum of all 3 severity parameters is calculated for each body section, multiplied by the area score for that area, and multiplied for the weight of the body section, for a maximum score of 72.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physician Global Assessment (PGA)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 2, 4, and 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Physician Global Assessment, is a 5-point scoring system that will be used to assess the overall disease severity. This treatment response on each visit will be scored: 0 =cleared, 1=almost clear, 2=mild 3=moderate, and 4=severe. A higher scores mean worse outcome.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tolerability assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 2, 4 and week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>Subject tolerability assessment completed by the subject about local tolerance regarding experience of pruritus and burning/stinging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Usability /satisfaction assessments</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 8</time_frame>
    <description>A questionnaire to be answered by subject about investigational device usability and satisfaction.</description>
