  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the original publication on the erector spinae plane (ESP) block in 2016, the technique&#xD;
      of the ESP block has evolved significantly in the last few years. Current reports suggest&#xD;
      that the ESP block provides adequate analgesia in thoracic and abdominal sites in a&#xD;
      post-surgical and chronic pain patient. However, there were still inconsistencies and unclear&#xD;
      spread of local anesthetics in ultrasound guide ESP block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focusing on the spread of local anesthetic in ESP block under ultrasound and&#xD;
      fluoroscopy and possible mechanisms of action.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The erector spinae plane (ESP) block was first described by Forero et al. Considering the&#xD;
      spread of local anesthetic in the ESP block, it can block more extensive spinal nerves.&#xD;
      Therefore, since the first publication, the ESP block has been reported as an effective&#xD;
      analgesic for several types of pain and has been used mainly in thoracic surgery. It also&#xD;
      used in abdominal surgery, nephrectomy, hernia surgery, and hip surgery, among others.&#xD;
      Additionally, the ESP block used not only acute pain management but also chronic pain&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spread of local anesthetic in the ESP block investigated in several ways, such as&#xD;
      computed tomography (CT) imaging of cadavers, fluoroscopy, chest radiography, and patients'&#xD;
      CT imaging. These investigations show that local anesthetics in the ESP block spread to the&#xD;
      upper and lower sides of the interfascial plane between the erector spine muscle and the&#xD;
      underlying transverse process. Additionally, the local anesthetic spreads beyond the&#xD;
      transverse process to reach the costotransverse junctions, after which it permeates the&#xD;
      paravertebral space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the many publications on ESP blocks, there are still inconsistencies and unclear&#xD;
      aspects of the technique, such as the spread of local anesthetic and action mechanisms This&#xD;
      study focuses on the spread of local anesthetic in ESP block under ultrasound and fluoroscopy&#xD;
      and possible mechanisms of action.&#xD;
