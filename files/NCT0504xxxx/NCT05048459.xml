  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare standard surveillance with telemedicine surveillance&#xD;
      (tele-surveillance) and find out which surveillance approach is best for people with&#xD;
      HPV-associated head and neck cancer who have no evidence of disease after treatment. The&#xD;
      researches will look at how the two approaches affect participants' quality of life, health&#xD;
      outcomes, and expenses (for example, costs of routine visits and procedures). They will also&#xD;
      determine doctors' and patients' satisfaction with tele-surveillance.&#xD;

    <description>Any pathologic evidence of tumor progression in the head and neck will be counted as a LRR. Patients without concerning symptoms as determined by the treating physician at the time of the tele-visit will be determined to be free of LRR. If imaging or biopsies or ordered at any time and are consistent with tumor progression, then these patients will be counted as having a LRR event. both the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-HN43 Scores of all scales and single-item measures range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating better quality of life.</description>

    <description>Tele-surveillance involves the participant staying at home while their healthcare providers follow their condition and give them the care they need. They can communicate with their healthcare team through face-to-face video conferencing on their desktop computer, laptop, smart phone, or tablet. They can also communicate with their healthcare team by phone.</description>

    <description>The tele-surveillance visit occurs annually after completion of therapy and consists of a phone call with or without video conferencing between the patient and the treatment team (physician, nurse, and/ or nurse practitioner). The use of video conferencing is strongly encouraged. Clinic visits, endoscopies, and imaging studies can be performed at the discretion of the treatment team for concerning patient symptoms.</description>

          -  ECOG 0-3&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically (histologically or cytologically) diagnosis of HPV associated squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the oropharynx (tonsil, base of tongue, or oropharyngeal walls)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No evidence of disease on post-treatment PET/CT within 9 months of completing&#xD;
             radiation therapy. No evidence of disease is a consensus determination by the&#xD;
             patient's radiation, medical, and surgical oncologist. If the first PET/CT is&#xD;
             equivocal, then a second PET/CT can be obtained within 9 months of completing&#xD;
             radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to speak and read English fluently&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients on clinical trials related to head and neck cancer that have protocol defined&#xD;
             follow up activities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Incomplete response or recurrent disease on post-treatment PET/CT&#xD;
&#xD;
