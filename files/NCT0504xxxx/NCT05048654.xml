    <textblock>
      This is an observational cohort study to examine the use of a novel proposed ovarian reserve&#xD;
      monitoring algorithm to (1) identify patients who are at risk of DOR and POI from gonadotoxic&#xD;
      therapy, (2) minimize time from treatment to utilization of assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technologies, and (3) improves prognosis for successful ART based on AFC for patients who&#xD;
      pursue fertility or fertility preservation.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is an observational cohort study to examine the use of a novel proposed&#xD;
      ovarian reserve monitoring algorithm to (1) identify patients who are at risk of DOR and POI&#xD;
      from gonadotoxic therapy, (2) minimize time from treatment to utilization of assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technologies, and (3) improves prognosis for successful ART based on AFC for&#xD;
      patients who pursue fertility or fertility preservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: Prospectively, survivors will be evaluated by a member of the FPRLE team in the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic at 12 months post-therapy completion and every 6 months to 36 months as&#xD;
      part of clinical care. AMH and FSH will be drawn at each time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Retrospectively, we will abstract AMH and FSH from survivors seen at CHCO and UCH&#xD;
      from October 1st, 2016 to September 31st, 2019 and assess time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach Aim 1: The Investigator will assess AMH and FSH in both groups and evaluate whether&#xD;
      the monitoring algorithm allows for early identification of DOR prior to the occurrence of&#xD;
      POI. The investigator will calculate time from end of treatment to diagnosis of DOR and POI&#xD;
      to evaluate if the monitoring algorithm detects these conditions earlier than historical&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The investigator will provide descriptive statistics and time to event&#xD;
      analysis by group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: The Investigator will assess time from end of treatment to utilization of ART as&#xD;
      defined by ovulation induction with or without insemination, in vitro fertilization, and/or&#xD;
      third-party reproduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The Investigator will provide descriptive statistics and time to event&#xD;
      analysis by group (A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: The Investigator will assess if early identification of DOR improves prognosis for&#xD;
      successful ART for Group B as compared to Group A. The Investigator define success as an AFC&#xD;
      greater than or equal to 6 at time of evaluation by REI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: The Investigator will provide descriptive statistics for the prevalence&#xD;
      of AFC greater than 6 by group (A and B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: The Investigator will characterize barriers to utilization of ART by surveying&#xD;
      participants who were referred to REI. The Investigator will assess the following: (1) if&#xD;
      participants declined or accepted referral, (2) if they accepted, were they successful, and&#xD;
      (3) if they declined, reasons for declining.&#xD;
