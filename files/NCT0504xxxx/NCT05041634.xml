      Our aims are to 1) test that our intervention that can be measured with high fidelity. 2)&#xD;
      determine the feasibility of the intervention including recruitment, procedures, measures,&#xD;
      intervention acceptability and resources . 3)We will also test the outcomes of this 14-week&#xD;
      fitness and wellness program based at a YMCA Healthy Living Center to gauge the effects of&#xD;
      exercise and activity on patients with behavioral diagnoses including bipolar disorder,&#xD;
      schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia. We also want to explore the influence of&#xD;
      participating in such a program on the perceptions of mental illness among rehabilitation&#xD;
      sciences students.&#xD;

      participating in such a program on the perceptions of mental illness among rehabilitation&#xD;
      sciences students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses are 1) that a fitness and activity program using physical activity, group&#xD;
      discussion, and education delivered in a fitness facility will reduce anxiety and depression&#xD;
      and strengthen hope, self-esteem, and improve overall quality of life; and 2) that student&#xD;
      perceptions of mental illness will improve after participating in such a fitness and activity&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      How does a program of exercise and activity influence the physical health of people with&#xD;
      behavioural diagnoses as it relates to venous blood plasma measures of haemoglobin,&#xD;
      cholesterol, lipids, insulin, glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoproteins; height,&#xD;
      weight, abdominal girth, blood pressure and heart rate; strength; and capacity for physical&#xD;
      activity? How does a program of exercise and activity influence the psychosocial health of&#xD;
      people with behavioural diagnoses as it relates to measures of hope, depression, anxiety, and&#xD;
      self-esteem? How does a program of exercise and activity influence occupational performance&#xD;
      and satisfaction of people with a behavioural diagnoses? How does a program of exercise and&#xD;
      activity influence quality of life for people with a behavioral diagnoses ? How does&#xD;
      participating in a program of exercise and activity influence the overall perceptions of&#xD;
      people with behavioural diagnoses? What is the feasibility and fidelity of this 14-week&#xD;
      intervention? How does being part of a program of exercise and activity for people with&#xD;
      behavioural diagnoses influence perceptions of rehabilitation sciences students about mental&#xD;
      illness?&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This follow up study involves a group of up to ten past participants recruited from patients&#xD;
      being treated by the OU-Tulsa IMPACT Team. We will conduct interviews and baseline measures&#xD;
      to compare to past progress. This study will serve to inform future cohorts for the original&#xD;
      study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROPOSED PROCEDURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments include biophysical markers of health, self-reported psychosocial measures, and&#xD;
      records of exercise and activity. Specifically, we will measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cholesterol, lipids, and glucose/ A1C via blood specimens collected as a routine part of the&#xD;
      patient's care Height and weight via stadiometer and digital scale, abdominal girth (the&#xD;
      narrowest point between the xiphoid process and the navel) using a Gulick tape measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure using a sphygmomanometer &amp; heart rate by counting the pulse for 60 seconds&#xD;
      using a digital timer Cardiovascular endurance via the three-minute step test Depression via&#xD;
      the PHQ9 scale Anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Test Interview/Focus Group&#xD;
      Mental Illness Clinician Attitude Scale (MICA) This brief follow up study will assess&#xD;
      participants who are one year out from the program or more. The study will take place in&#xD;
      their residence and include the measures stated above and an interview. Researchers want to&#xD;
      understand how the program is beneficial after one year and what can be improved to maintain&#xD;
      benefits if any. Findings will be used to adjust the original protocol if needed to continue&#xD;
      the original study. The assessments and interviews will be completed by researchers and&#xD;
      occupational and physical therapy students under the supervision of their faculty. In&#xD;
      addition, participants will be offered educational materials to help resume healthy habits.&#xD;
