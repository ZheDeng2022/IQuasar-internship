  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational clinical trial recruiting Smouldering Myeloma patients (SMM) or potential SMM&#xD;
      patients. Study involves collecting blood and bone marrow samples to determine the features&#xD;
      of the tumour genome and BM microenvironment, including immune dysfunction that are key&#xD;
      drivers of progression from precursor conditions (MGUS and SMM) to MM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      MM is a cancer of plasma cells characterised by bone marrow infiltration by malignant plasma&#xD;
      cells, kidney impairment, bone pain and elevated calcium levels1. There are approximately&#xD;
      5,500 new cases diagnosed annually in the UK, with a median survival of 5 years2.&#xD;
      Significantly, despite improvements in conventional treatment options, MM remains incurable;&#xD;
      patients inevitably relapse and will eventually die from their disease.3 MM is always&#xD;
      preceded by defined precursor conditions, termed MGUS, and SMM. However, only 7% of MGUS&#xD;
      patients and 50% of SMM patients progress to MM over a 5-year period4. In the UK, current&#xD;
      practice favours commencing treatment only when there is evidence of end organ damage as the&#xD;
      overall benefit of initiating early therapy is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an increasing understanding that progression is determined by evolving changes in&#xD;
      the tumour genome5 and changes in the immune microenvironment which support tumour growth,&#xD;
      leading to progressively dysfunctional anti-tumour immunity. This project correlates changes&#xD;
      in the tumour genome and immune microenvironment in individual patients with tumour&#xD;
      progression and also aims to compare characteristics in patients with good and poor clinical&#xD;
      outcomes with the objective of defining the drivers for disease progression. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      aim to explore the use of blood samples to monitor tumour dynamics and immune function.&#xD;
      Finally, we will also study the spatial distribution of immune cells and tumour cells in the&#xD;
      bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical impact: A deeper understanding of the pathogenesis of MM will allow us to risk&#xD;
      stratify patients with MGUS and SMM, and manage them accordingly as well as identifying&#xD;
      subgroups of patients with MM who require different types of therapies, eg. more intensive&#xD;
      multi-drug approaches for patients with adverse risk genetics.&#xD;

      BM aspirates and blood samples will be processed to extract tumour and non-tumour cells, as&#xD;
      well as plasma and sera. Mononuclear cells (MNCs) will be prepared from these samples by&#xD;
      centrifugal sedimentation, or red cell lysis, and plasma cells will be selected using&#xD;
      immuno-magnetic beads coupled to monoclonal antibody specific to the plasma cell marker,&#xD;
      CD138. In some cases, purified MM cells will be isolated by negative selection using&#xD;
      RosetteSep method, which depletes immature progenitors, T-lymphocytes and NK cells. Immune&#xD;
      cells, including CD4 and CD8 T cells will be separated by similar means for further&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MM cells, immune cells and bulk MNCs will be frozen and stored for future DNA and RNA&#xD;
      extraction. Cell lysates will be made for immuno-blotting and live cells will be frozen for&#xD;
      use in functional assays.&#xD;
