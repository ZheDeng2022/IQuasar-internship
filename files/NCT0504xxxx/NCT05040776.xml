  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, single cohort study of patients with confirmed COVID-19&#xD;
      syndrome who based on clinical judgment require care in an intensive care unit, regardless of&#xD;
      whether or not mechanical ventilation is in use or is anticipated. Patients should be&#xD;
      enrolled on the first day of the ICU stay; withdrawal of prior thromboprophylaxis, if any,&#xD;
      will follow specific protocol guidance. Enrolled patients will thereafter be administered&#xD;
      intravenous EP-7041 until disposition from the hospital (including post-ICU non-critical care&#xD;
      management)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the COVID-ThromboprophylaXIs Study is to determine the safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      two doses of EP-7041 for the prevention of thromboembolism in the management of COVID-19&#xD;
      patients, compared to control patients managed with institutional standard care&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis regimens. Dosing of EP-7041 for the first 30 patients enrolled will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to 0.6 mg/kg/hr IV (n=15) or 1.0 mg/kg/hr IV (n=15) for the duration of the&#xD;
      index hospitalization. Enrollment will be paused after treatment of these 30 patients, at&#xD;
      which time a dedicated DSMB will evaluate all collected safety data through 7 days post-index&#xD;
      hospital discharge. If no adverse safety signal is identified for the 1.0 mg/kg/hr dose,&#xD;
      enrollment will be resumed with the study dose of EP-7041 randomized 2:1 to 1.0 mg/kg/hr or&#xD;
      institutional standard care for thromboprophylaxis in ICU patients with COVID-19. If safety&#xD;
      concerns are identified for the higher dose and not for the lower dose, then open-label&#xD;
      randomized enrollment vs institutional standard of care for thromboprophylaxis will proceed&#xD;
      with an EP-7041 dose of 0.6 mg/kg/hr. The second phase of the study will enroll 60 additional&#xD;
      patients, with 40 in the EP-7041 dosing arm, and 20 in the standard care arm.&#xD;
