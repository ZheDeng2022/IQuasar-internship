  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic overuse is common and antibiotic prescribing contributes to rising rates of&#xD;
      antimicrobial resistance. Primary care physicians prescribe the majority of all antibiotics&#xD;
      and there is large inter-physician variability in prescribing that cannot be explained by&#xD;
      differences in patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Ontario, audit and feedback (A&amp;F) is routinely offered to primary care providers from a&#xD;
      variety of sources. Ontario Health - an agency created by the Government of Ontario -&#xD;
      provides A&amp;F via email to physicians who voluntarily sign up for their &quot;MyPractice&quot; reports.&#xD;
      These are multi-topic reports with aggregated (physician-level) data. As of November 2021,&#xD;
      the MyPractice reports for family physicians will include data on antibiotic prescribing. To&#xD;
      date, less than half of Ontario family physicians have signed up for the MyPractice reports&#xD;
      from Ontario Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, the investigators will conduct a trial to investigate the effect of adding&#xD;
      viral prescription pad resources to family physician A&amp;F received through a MyPractice:&#xD;
      Primary Care report. This evaluation provides an opportunity to determine if the addition of&#xD;
      this resource to an A&amp;F intervention increases changes to antibiotic prescribing.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine ways to optimize the effects of A&amp;F for antibiotic prescribing in&#xD;
      primary care. This study will aim to determine if emphasis (or not) on the use of a viral&#xD;
      prescription pad developed by Choosing Wisely Canada (CWC) can help physicians act upon the&#xD;
      feedback from their MyPractice report to reduce their antibiotic prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic prescribing feedback within the multi-topic MyPractice: Primary Care report will&#xD;
      be sent to family physicians who signed up for this program from Ontario Health. This report&#xD;
      includes a link to the Choosing Wisely viral prescription pad. Physicians will be randomized&#xD;
      to the control group or intervention group. Physicians in the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      additional emphasis on the use of the viral prescription pad and will also have a paper copy&#xD;
      of the prescription pad mailed to their practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One month after the initial intervention, participants will be invited to complete a process&#xD;
      evaluation survey to determine why or why not the intervention worked and how individual&#xD;
      factors can affect physician motivation, willingness, and ability to engage in new practices.&#xD;
      Intervention participants will also be invited to take part in a process evaluation&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;

    <description>Physicians in this group will receive their usual MyPractice: Primary Care report from Ontario Health. This report will include antibiotic prescribing indicators as well as a link to the viral prescription pad. As part of the intervention, these physicians will also receive additional emphasis on the viral prescription pad by 1) encouraging it in the dissemination email of the MyPractice feedback report, and (2) mailing a paper version of the viral prescription pad with instructions on embedding the viral prescription pad into the recipient's EMR.</description>
