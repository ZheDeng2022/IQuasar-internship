      In order to assess the burden of respiratory syncytial virus on infant mortality in Pakistan,&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab sampling and minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) will be conducted&#xD;
      on deceased infants under 6 months of age. The specimens will be analysed by the microbiology&#xD;
      and histopathology labs at Aga Khan University, Karachi, Pakistan. Verbal consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from parents of deceased infants, and a cause of death lab report and grief&#xD;
      counseling services will be offered to enrolled parents who gave consent for specimen&#xD;
      collection. The study is funded by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in affiliation with&#xD;
      Research Triangle Institute (RTI) MITS Surveillance Alliance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a respiratory pathogen with potentially high disease&#xD;
      burden in Lower middle income country (LMIC). This pathogen is a potential target for&#xD;
      maternal immunization strategies to prevent disease and early death in young infants.&#xD;
      Majority of current studies estimate the burden of disease in terms of facility-based (e.g.&#xD;
      hospital) deaths. There is a knowledge gap regarding the proportion of community-based deaths&#xD;
      due to RSV. There are many challenges to generating evidence for the burden of RSV, such as&#xD;
      lack of resources for hospital and community surveillance and diagnostics, and difficulty in&#xD;
      obtaining specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parent study: In January 2018, the Community-based Infant RSV Mortality Study was initiated&#xD;
      in collaboration with Emory University, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.&#xD;
      Following a formative phase involving interviews with community stakeholders, in August 2018&#xD;
      a pilot surveillance stage was initiated, in which upon receiving death alerts from key&#xD;
      community partners about the recent death of an infant (&lt;6 months) in the 4 catchment areas&#xD;
      of Karachi, a team of nurses and health workers mobilize to identify and approach the&#xD;
      household of the infant's primary caregivers. Upon obtaining verbal consent from the parents,&#xD;
      the nurse obtains nasopharyngeal specimens from the left and right nostrils of the recently&#xD;
      deceased infant. These specimens are tested for respiratory syncytial virus and Bordetella&#xD;
      pertussis through real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, and lab results are&#xD;
      reported to the parents along with verbal autopsy findings in a cause of death consultation.&#xD;
      Enrolled bereaved parents are also offered grief support home visits and grief counseling&#xD;
      services by the community health workers and study psychologist. The surveillance phase&#xD;
      continued from August 2018 to March 2020, when specimen collection was paused due to&#xD;
      coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) distancing measures. In 20 months, 490 nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      specimens were collected out of 713 households approached upon death alerts. Of these 490, 14&#xD;
      tested positive for RSV and 1 positive for pertussis. Following a training on disinfection,&#xD;
      personal protective equipment (PPE) protocols, distancing measures, as well as a&#xD;
      study-specific training on mental health, communication, and counseling skills June-July&#xD;
      2020, surveillance and specimen collection is planned to resume from August 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposal for current study: While nasopharyngeal swab sampling with PCR testing is the gold&#xD;
      standard for detection of RSV, little is understood about lung morphology in relation to&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract infections in neonate and infant mortality. The objective of this&#xD;
      study is to assess and analyze the burden and determinants of RSV mortality in infants in 2&#xD;
      peri-urban areas of Karachi Pakistan and to provide a cause of death consultation for the&#xD;
      families of the recently deceased infants under 6 months of age in the catchment areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RSV-MITS Study will be merged with the ongoing parent study of Community-based Infant RSV&#xD;
      Mortality. With the additional procedure and analysis of minimally invasive tissue sampling&#xD;
      (MITS) of the lungs/thorax, we aim to examine lung morphology through microbiology and&#xD;
      histology specimens. Designated staff (nurses) will require additional MITS training, and the&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal swab specimens and lung/thorax MITS specimens will be collected in the&#xD;
      designated study ambulance parked near the household or transported to the closest partner&#xD;
      hospital. The target sample size is 150 lung/thorax MITS and nasopharyngeal specimens from&#xD;
      deceased infants under 6 months of age; stillbirths and miscarriages excluded. This study&#xD;
      will be conducted in 2 Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) catchment areas:&#xD;
      Bhains Colony and Ali Akbar Shah Goth. The MITS Study is funded by the MITS Surveillance&#xD;
      Alliance.&#xD;
