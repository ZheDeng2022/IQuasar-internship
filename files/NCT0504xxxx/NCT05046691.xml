  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Teachers in Hong Kong are susceptible to professional stress and its associated psychosomatic&#xD;
      illnesses. To enhance teachers' well-being, mindfulness training is conducted in local&#xD;
      schools. The present study is a randomized controlled trial to explore 1) the relationship&#xD;
      between mindfulness, common humanity, self-compassion, compassion, and well-being of school&#xD;
      teachers; 2) whether mindfulness and common humanity are the antecedents of self-compassion&#xD;
      and compassion; 3) the conditions under which compassion and self-compassion are highly&#xD;
      correlated. Participants will be randomized to either intervention (8-week .b Foundations&#xD;
      course) or waiting-list control condition. They will complete an online survey before&#xD;
      (baseline), after (post-intervention), and two-months (follow-up) after the intervention.&#xD;
