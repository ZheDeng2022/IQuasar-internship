  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) are at risk of developing clinically significant&#xD;
      portal hypertension (CSPH). In the Baveno VI consensus a new term &quot;compensated advanced&#xD;
      chronic liver disease (cACLD)'' has been proposed to better reflect that the spectrum of&#xD;
      severe fibrosis and cirrhosis is a continuum in asymptomatic patients. Liver stiffness by TE&#xD;
      is sufficient to suspect cACLD in asymptomatic subjects with known causes of CLD. TE values&#xD;
      &lt;10 kPa in the absence of other known clinical signs rule out cACLD; values between 10 and 15&#xD;
      kPa are suggestive of cACLD but need further test for confirmation; values &gt;15 kPa are highly&#xD;
      suggestive of cACLD. Patients with a liver stiffness &lt;20 kPa and with a platelet count&#xD;
      &gt;150,000 have a &lt; 5 % risk of having varices requiring treatment, and can avoid screening&#xD;
      endoscopy. SSM can also predict the presence of CSPH and varices requiring treatment. Some&#xD;
      studies have shown superiority of splenic stiffness over liver stiffness in predicting&#xD;
      varices requiring treatment likely attributable to the better performance of SSM compared&#xD;
      with LSM in more severe portal hypertension because it reflects better the hemodynamic&#xD;
      component of portal hypertension. However, there are few studies on NAFLD and most are on&#xD;
      viral hepatitis related cACLD. Moreover, very few studies are published on splenic stiffness&#xD;
      from Indian subcontinent. Similarly baseline HVPG is an important predictor of disease&#xD;
      progression patients of NAFLD related cACLD, but requires invasive hepatic vein&#xD;
      catheterization. Hence, we intend to do the study assessing diagnostic utility of splenic and&#xD;
      liver stiffness in predicting varices needing treatment in NAFLD related cACLD and compare&#xD;
      from other noninvasive markers and its correlation with HVPG.&#xD;

      Aim - to study the diagnostic accuracy of liver stiffness and splenic stiffness in predicting&#xD;
      esophageal varices needing treatment in patients of NASH related cACLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the utility of liver stiffness and splenic stiffness in making a composite score to&#xD;
      predict presence of esophageal varices needing treatment in patients of NASH related cACLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the correlation of liver stiffness and splenic stiffness with grade of&#xD;
           esophageal varices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To study utility of other noninvasive scores, such as Baveno VI criteria, expanded&#xD;
           Baveno VI criteria, LSPS (LS x spleen diameter / platelet ratio score), platelet count&#xD;
           to spleen diameter ratio (PSR), AST/ALT ratio, APRI, FIB-4, in predicting presence of&#xD;
           esophageal varices needing treatment in patients of NASH related cACLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To study utility of noninvasive tests in predicting presence of esophageal varices&#xD;
           needing treatment in patients of HBV or HCV related cACLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To study correlation of liver and splenic stiffness with HVPG and MELD score in patients&#xD;
           of NASH related cACLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           (b) Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Study population: Consecutive patients of NASH related cACLD (Liver Stiffness ≥10&#xD;
                kPa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients of viral hepatitis (HBV / HCV) related cACLD during the study period&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be taken as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study design: An observational cross-sectional study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study period: 15 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size with justification: This is a cross-sectional prevalence study. All the&#xD;
           patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria during the period October 2021 to&#xD;
           December 2022 undergoing liver stiffness, splenic stiffness and upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
           endoscopy will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: Patients of NASH related cACLD and controls (viral hepatitis related&#xD;
           cACLD) will undergo upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, liver and splenic stiffness&#xD;
           measurement, ultrasound abdomen, Doppler study and routine laboratory tests. Varices&#xD;
           needing treatment will be defined by Baveno VI criteria as medium or large size&#xD;
           esophageal varices or the presence of high-risk stigmata findings (red wale marks,&#xD;
           cherry red spots). HVPG will be done in the patients only if clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monitoring and assessment: Transient Elastography will be performed in morning hours&#xD;
           using the FibroScan apparatus (Echosens), which consists of a 5-MHz ultrasound&#xD;
           transducer probe mounted on the axis of a vibrator. The tip of the transducer (M-or XL&#xD;
           probe) will be placed perpendicularly in the intercostal space, with the patient lying&#xD;
           in dorsal decubitus position with the right arm in the maximal abduction. The operator&#xD;
           will choose a liver portion within the right liver lobe, at least 6-cm thick and free of&#xD;
           large vascular structures, and the gallbladder. Liver stiffness (LS) will be measured on&#xD;
           a cylinder of hepatic tissue of 1 cm of diameter and 4 cm of length. For assessing the&#xD;
           splenic stiffness (SS), the patient will be in supine position with left arm in maximum&#xD;
           abduction. Ultrasonography will be used to identify and locate the spleen parenchyma, to&#xD;
           choose the right place for SS measurement, and to measure the spleen diameter (long&#xD;
           axis). A median value of 10 successful acquisitions, expressed in kPa, will be kept as a&#xD;
           representative of the LS and SS measurements. The LS and SS measurement failure will be&#xD;
           recorded when no value will be obtained after at least 10 shots. The results will be&#xD;
           considered unreliable in the following circumstances: valid shots fewer than 10, success&#xD;
           rate &lt; 60%, or interquartile range / LS &gt;30 %. Liver and splenic stiffness, LSPS score&#xD;
           (LS measurement × spleen diameter / platelet count), Platelet count to spleen diameter&#xD;
           ratio (PSR) will be calculated. Patient will also undergo upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
           endoscopy. HVPG will be done if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical Analysis: Data will be entered into Microsoft Excel and will be analyzed&#xD;
           using SPSS version 22. Stastical test applied will be student t test or Mann Whitney&#xD;
           test to compare continuous data among patients with and without high-risk esophageal&#xD;
           varices. Categorical data will be analyzed using Chi square test or Fisher Exact test&#xD;
           whichever applicable. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression will be applied&#xD;
           for finding the predictor of esophageal varices needing treatment. Composite score model&#xD;
           will be formed using liver stiffness, splenic stiffness and radiological / laboratory&#xD;
           tests to predict esophageal varices needing treatment keeping negative predictive value&#xD;
           at least 0.95. Diagnostic test will be applied to find the cutoff value for liver&#xD;
           stiffness and splenic stiffness by using AUROC. The correlation of liver and splenic&#xD;
           stiffness with HVPG will be studied with Pearson's correlation coefficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse effects: No&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stopping rule of study: No&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Utility of liver and splenic stiffness will be assessed to form a composite score to&#xD;
           predict presence of esophageal varices needing treatment in patients of NASH related&#xD;
           cACLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation of the liver and splenic stiffness with HVPG in patients of NASH related&#xD;
           cACLD will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Utility of various noninvasive tests will be assessed in predicting presence of&#xD;
           esophageal varices needing treatment in patients of HBV or HCV related cACLD.&#xD;
