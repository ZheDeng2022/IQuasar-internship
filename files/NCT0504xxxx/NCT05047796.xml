  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is responsible for several changes in the body, such&#xD;
      as balance, gastrointestinal and autonomic disorders and are associated with impairments in&#xD;
      the clinical prognosis of these individuals. In this sense, therapies capable of minimizing&#xD;
      this impact are extremely important. Osteopathy has become an alternative treatment for&#xD;
      individuals with neurological disorders and has been shown to be effective in treating&#xD;
      various conditions, including PD. Objective: a) to evaluate the acute effect of visceral&#xD;
      manipulation directed to the intestines and visceral plexuses in the autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      of PD patients; b) identify the effect of this approach, after four visits, on balance,&#xD;
      plantar pressure, gastrointestinal disorders and autonomic nervous system in this population.&#xD;
      Materials and Methods: For this randomized clinical trial, 28 adults diagnosed with PD will&#xD;
      be recruited. Subjects will be randomized to protocols in two groups: intervention protocol&#xD;
      and placebo protocol, where both will consist of 4 visits twice a week. The intervention&#xD;
      protocol will consist of osteopathic manipulative techniques and the sham protocol will&#xD;
      consist of simulation of therapy, where the therapist will place his hands in the same&#xD;
      regions of the intervention protocol, with superficial contact and without therapeutic&#xD;
      intention in each region. The outcome measures of the study will consist of Berg balance&#xD;
      assessment and plantar pressure, Rome survey on gastrointestinal disorders, and assessment of&#xD;
      autonomic modulation by means of heart rate variability analysis. Volunteers and evaluators&#xD;
      will be blind to the protocol and not informed of their order. Only the person responsible&#xD;
      for the intervention will not be blind to the protocol. Data will be analyzed according to&#xD;
      normality (Shapiro-Wilk test), and comparisons of outcomes between the moments (pre and post)&#xD;
      will be performed using the T-student test for paired data or Wilcoxon, as normal and for&#xD;
      comparisons between protocols. placebo and intervention, Student's T-test for unpaired data&#xD;
      or Mann-Whitney test according to normality will be applied. The adopted statistical&#xD;
      significance will be fixed at 5%.&#xD;

    <description>For balance analysis we will use the Berg balance scale, validated for the Brazilian population. The overall score is 56 points. A score from 0 to 20 represents impairment of balance, 21 to 40 is acceptable balance, and 41-56 is good balance.</description>
