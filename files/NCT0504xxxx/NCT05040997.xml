      Rationale Although the majority of asthma patients can be effectively treated with currently&#xD;
      available medications, a substantial subset remains severe, causing a considerable proportion&#xD;
      of resource expenditure. Severe asthma is now widely accepted to be a heterogeneous syndrome&#xD;
      consisting of multiple phenotypes identified by specific biomarkers and targeted by tailored&#xD;
      biological therapies. However, much remains unclear regarding the best approaches to manage&#xD;
      these patients, or concerning the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small airways (SA) are defined as those airways with an internal diameter &lt;2 mm. In patients&#xD;
      affected by asthma, it has been reported that SA are the predominant site of airflow&#xD;
      resistance. Peripheral airways are thickened in asthma due to chronic inflammation in the&#xD;
      epithelium, submucosa and muscle area. It has been suggested that the outer wall is more&#xD;
      inflamed than the inner wall, with a higher number of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and&#xD;
      neutrophils associated to an increased mRNA expression of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and&#xD;
      eotaxin. Moreover, it is well documented that SA inflammation and dysfunction contributes&#xD;
      significantly to the clinical impact of asthma and that 50-60% of asthmatics have a SA&#xD;
      involvement across all disease severities. An important question is whether SA disease in&#xD;
      asthma is variable among distinct asthma phenotypes and whether it occurs in all patients.&#xD;
      Cluster analyses have been recently used to identify specific asthma phenotypes, but markers&#xD;
      of SA function have not been investigated. However, evidence is accumulating to support the&#xD;
      concept that SA dysfunction and inflammation may contribute to distinct asthma phenotypes.&#xD;
      Recent findings indicate that SA are significantly affected in severe asthma and that their&#xD;
      involvement is associated with worse disease outcomes. It has been reported that patients&#xD;
      with asthma and a history of frequent exacerbations per year had a significant SA involvement&#xD;
      Furthermore, peripheral airways significantly contribute not only to the level of asthma&#xD;
      control, but also to patients' quality of life and perception of symptoms. At last more&#xD;
      thickened SA and higher numbers of eosinophils are detectable in subjects with fatal asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of SA represents a big challenge and requires qualified expertise and&#xD;
      sophisticated techniques including body plethysmography, single and multiple breath nitrogen&#xD;
      washout, impulse oscillometry (IOS), fraction exhaled NO at multiflow, sputum induction and&#xD;
      high-resolution chest CT (HRCT). Such procedures can either provide functional information on&#xD;
      the degree/extent of ventilation heterogeneity and air trapping or facilitate the&#xD;
      understanding of the inflammatory and remodeling processes. These measures are not usually&#xD;
      part of the evaluation of asthmatic patients and in the monitoring of the effects of drugs&#xD;
      recommended for severe asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mepolizumab represents an innovative weapon for the treatment of severe eosinophilic asthma.&#xD;
      In most of these patients the drug controls inflammation, improves lung function, ameliorates&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, reduces exacerbations and has a marked steroid-sparing effect. However,&#xD;
      there is still a significant proportion of non-responders and a lack of validated predictive&#xD;
      biomarkers in such subpopulation. In regard to this, very limited findings are available&#xD;
      about the effect of mepolizumab on SA. At the best of our knowledge, the only paper available&#xD;
      in literature, addressing the topic, is the study of Farah and co-workers. The authors found&#xD;
      that an early improvement in SA function was associated with better asthma control and&#xD;
      represented a significant contributor to the therapeutic response. However, the study was&#xD;
      conducted in a limited cohort of patients, assessing SA only through multi breath nitrogen&#xD;
      washout, and not considering the relationship between SA disease and levels of&#xD;
      peripheral/sputum eosinophils. Also, a study was recently initiated at the Hopitaux de Paris&#xD;
      to evaluate airway remodelling during mepolizumab treatment (REMOMEPO, NCT03797404).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better definition of severe asthma phenotypes and endotypes, as well as the identification&#xD;
      of novel disease targets and biomarkers to predict treatment response and monitor efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of biological drugs over time, would favor a Precision Medicine approach&#xD;
      translating in both improved disease management and reduced healthcare costs and social&#xD;
      burdens. This is considered a crucial unmet need and further research in the field is&#xD;
      strongly recommended by international guidelines, respiratory scientific societies,&#xD;
      healthcare systems and regulatory boards.&#xD;

      Study hypothesis We hypothesize that mepolizumab has a significant beneficial effect on small&#xD;
      airways disease in severe asthmatics and that the evaluation of small airways before and&#xD;
      during treatment may represent a distinctive marker of response and a novel target for a&#xD;
      preferential use of this drug vs other biologics available for severe eosinophilic asthmatic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate a wide panel of validated small airways endpoints in eosinophilic severe&#xD;
           asthmatics before mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate longitudinal changes of these endpoints at different time points during&#xD;
           mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To relate small airways endpoints recorded at baseline and their changes over time to&#xD;
           other functional, laboratory, clinical and patient reported outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study center The study will be conducted at the Asthma Center of the Fondazione Policlinico&#xD;
      Universitario A. Gemelli, IRCCS, Respiratory, Allergy and ENT Physicians closely and&#xD;
      sinergically collaborate in the framework of the Asthma Center with shared clinical and&#xD;
      research activities aimed to an optimal management of asthma and its comorbidities, as well&#xD;
      as with regular meetings for multidisciplinary clinical case discussion and collective&#xD;
      decisions on treatment strategies. The Asthma Center is part of the Italian Severe Asthma&#xD;
      Network (SANI) and will be soon one of the coordinating centers for the newborn Italian&#xD;
      Mild-Moderate Asthma Network (MANI), therefore representing a center of excellence and&#xD;
      reference at a national level, with easy and wide access to the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Asthmatic patients referred to the Asthma Center and eligible for starting&#xD;
      Mepolizumab, after having optimized adherence, inhalation technique and comorbidity&#xD;
      management following multidisciplinary assessment, will enter a single-site oservational&#xD;
      prospective longitudinal cohort study. Subjects will be monitored for 12 months and SA&#xD;
      endpoints will be recorded at the beginning of the biological therapy (T0) and after 3,6,12&#xD;
      months (T3, T6, T12). SA endpoints will be also related to other functional, clinical and&#xD;
      patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;

      severe asthma as defined by ATS/ERS guidelines (≥12months high-dose ICS + additional&#xD;
      controller treatments), ≥2 exacerbations (corticosteroid and/or ED visit and/or&#xD;
      hospitalization in the previous 12 months), blood eosinophil ≥150 cells/µl at study entrance&#xD;
      or ≥300cells/µl historically and a smoking history &lt;2 pack/year.&#xD;
&#xD;
