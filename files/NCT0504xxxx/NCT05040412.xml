  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes Mellitus is known to be a risk factor for difficult laryngoscopy. Several studies&#xD;
      showed that diabetes mellitus is responsible for 30% of difficult laryngoscopy.Insulin and&#xD;
      oral antidiabetic drugs are two main current medication prescribed for diabetes&#xD;
      patients.Insulin is responsible for muscle hypertrophy and weigh gain.Oral antidiabetic drugs&#xD;
      induces muscle atrophy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in the difficult&#xD;
      laryngoscopy as a general anesthetic component in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) using&#xD;
      either insulin or oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      DM is accepted as a risk factor for difficult intubation.OAD and insulin are two main&#xD;
      pharmacological treatment component of DM.Insulin induces respiratory smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction.Otherwise, OAD drugs ca affect muscle atrophy in patients with type II DM&#xD;
      patients.The use of these drugs may affect laryngoscopy during endotracheal intubation,which&#xD;
      is a component of general anesthesia.Metformin causes muscle atrophy and weight loss.Some in&#xD;
      vitro studies have shown an induction of cell apoptosis with therapeutic doses of&#xD;
      sulfonylureas which can lead to atrophy.Glinides can cause atrophy in experimental&#xD;
      animals.Hypoglycemia and weight gain are two important side effects of intensive insulin&#xD;
      therapy.İnsulin is the major anabolic hormone in the body. Insulin binds to receptors on&#xD;
      adipose tissues and potentiate inhibition of lypolysis and storage of triglycerids.And this&#xD;
      cause obesity.This is one of the reasons that suggest the relationship between insulin and&#xD;
      difficult airway.The effect of insulin on airway smooth muscle leads to increased airway&#xD;
      contraction,cell proliferation,and the thicker,stiffer and more hypercontractile airway.In&#xD;
      some studies,type II DM patients with duration of more than 5 years switched to insulin&#xD;
      therapy and airway hypersensitivity was observed in the first three months.Insulin plays an&#xD;
      anabolic role in skeletal muscle by enhancing amino acids transport in skeletal muscle and by&#xD;
      increasing the rate of protein synthesis.İnsulin induces air way smooth muscle contraction&#xD;
      through the production of contractile prostaglandins, which in turn are dependent on&#xD;
      Rho-kinase for their contractile effects.Prostaglandins also stimulate IL-6 and MuRF-1&#xD;
      transcription in human skeletal muscles.Prostaglandin regulates skeletal muscle mass and&#xD;
      function.Therefore,insulin may cause airway skeletal muscle contraction and may be the reason&#xD;
      of difficult laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the differences in the difficult laryngoscopy as a&#xD;
      general anesthetic component in patients with Diabetes Mellitus (DM) using either insulin or&#xD;
      oral antidiabetic drug (OAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS After the approval of the local ethics committee of our hospital, a study was planned&#xD;
      for a total of 230 patients including Type I and Type II DM patients and non-DM patients as a&#xD;
      control group who would undergo elective surgery between 25.01.2020-30.04.2020.Age, gender,&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI), Mallampati scores, thyromental distance (TMD), sternomental distance&#xD;
      (SMD), inter-incisor distance (ID) and neck extension measurements were taken.Preoperative&#xD;
      HbA1C levels, DM type, diagnosis time and duration of insulin or OAD use were&#xD;
      recorded.Patients without DM, patients using insulin and patients using OAD were grouped as&#xD;
      group C, group I and group D, respectively.DM patients were planned to be operated as first&#xD;
      patient in the morning.50 mg of ranitidine,10 mg of metoclopramide and 1 gr of cefazolin for&#xD;
      surgical prophylaxis were administered intravenously 30 minutes before anthesia&#xD;
      induction.Patients were preoxygenated with 100% O2 for 3 minutes.As diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      patients are under high risk of aspiration due to gastroparesis,we applied rapid sequence&#xD;
      induction technique.1 mcg/kg fentanyl citrate,2 mg/kg propofol,1mg/kg rocuronium bromide were&#xD;
      given intravenously according to patient's adjusted body weight.After low tidal volume&#xD;
      ventilation with face mask,the trachea was intubated by using DL (Macintosh&#xD;
      laryngoscope).During intubation, the following data were documented:Cormack-Lehane grade,&#xD;
      number of laryngoscopic attempts, intubation time, intubation success at the first attempt,&#xD;
      performance of backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) maneuver and requirement of use of&#xD;
      different airway equipments were compared between the groups. Adverse events related to&#xD;
      tracheal intubation were evaluated: desaturation (SPO2&lt;94), hypercabia (ETCO2&gt;35),&#xD;
      hypertension (mean arterial pressure &gt;20% above baseline values), tachycardia (heart rate&#xD;
      &gt;20% above baseline values), new onset arrhythmia, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, airway trauma&#xD;
      and sore throat in PACU). The primary outcome measures are mallampati score,thyromental&#xD;
      distance,Cormack-Lehane grade and the time to intubation,secondary outcome measures are&#xD;
      first-attempt intubation success,number of laryngoscopic attempts,performance of&#xD;
      backward-upward-rightward pressure (BURP) maneuver and requirement of use of different airway&#xD;
      equipments.&#xD;
