    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the effects of specific standardized modifications to&#xD;
      trans-femoral prosthetic sockets in a randomized within-subject design. This is in&#xD;
      preparation for a subsequently planned clinical trial to validate the findings by&#xD;
      implementing them into a fitting method for individual sockets.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: Lower limb amputees experience chronic health challenges such as residual limb&#xD;
      skin problems, low back pain, and osteoarthritis. These problems are exacerbated by high&#xD;
      physical activity levels and by poor prosthetic socket fit. Prosthetists believe that&#xD;
      limiting residual femur and skin motion will improve force coupling and thereby address these&#xD;
      problems. However, there are no data demonstrating how changes in socket design affect&#xD;
      residual femur and skin motion, and, by extension, lead to improved patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/Hypothesis: Goal of this research is to improve the current socket design&#xD;
      optimization process that involves trial and error and relies heavily on the prosthetist's&#xD;
      experience and intuition by using a quantitatively informed optimization process. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that modifiable in-socket mechanics, i.e. residual femur motion, skin strain,&#xD;
      and pressure within the socket, are related to socket design and patient outcomes, and can be&#xD;
      estimated using readily available clinical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: First aim is to identify the key characteristics of in-socket mechanics that&#xD;
      are related to physical function and patient-reported comfort and function. The second aim is&#xD;
      to identify readily available clinical measurements that are associated with the in-socket&#xD;
      mechanical characteristics that are related to outcomes. The purpose of this aim is to&#xD;
      correlate our laboratory findings from Aim 1 with more conventional modalities for clinical&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Strategy: Preliminary data demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed research&#xD;
      plan and will progress to a pilot clinical trial. The two aims will involve 30 transfemoral&#xD;
      amputees. A highspeed biplane radiography system is used to image the residual limb while&#xD;
      participants walk on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill both in their current socket and in&#xD;
      sockets with purposely altered volume, brim height, cross-sectional geometry, and stiffness.&#xD;
      Three-dimensional (3D) skin motion within the socket will be determined by tracking the&#xD;
      motion of 40 to 50 small metal beads placed in a grid pattern on the skin of the residual&#xD;
      limb before donning the socket. Residual femur motion within the socket will be determined&#xD;
      with submillimeter accuracy using a validated tracking process that matches subject-specific&#xD;
      bone models obtained from CT to the biplane radiographs. Discrete in-socket pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded at four locations using pressure sensing pads. Readily available clinical&#xD;
      measurements will be collected as well, including gait analysis, foot loading patterns,&#xD;
      ground reaction forces, residual limb tissue stiffness, and hip range of motion hip strength.&#xD;
      Each participant will complete clinical questionnaires to qualitatively evaluate comfort,&#xD;
      fit, and overall satisfaction after wearing each socket. The different socket modifications&#xD;
      are intended to affect the in-socket mechanics of the residual limb, physical function and&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes (Aim 1). These relationships will be assessed using a generalized&#xD;
      linear model. Correlation between the research grade measurements and accessible clinical&#xD;
      measures (Aim 2) will be evaluated using bivariate correlation analyses. The information&#xD;
      gained in Aims 1 and 2 will be used to develop a quantitatively-informed socket optimization&#xD;
      process, wherein the clinical measurements associated with in-socket mechanics will be used&#xD;
      to inform socket design optimizations.&#xD;

The number of participants is smaller than the number of possible permutations. Therefore the enacted ordering is randomly selected from the pool of possible orderings.
