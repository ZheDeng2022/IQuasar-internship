  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotic resistance is a growing global health problem of great concern, especially&#xD;
      multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In recent years some new antibiotics targeting&#xD;
      these bacteria have been developed. The aim of this study is to investigate how these new&#xD;
      antibiotics are used in Sweden. Information will be collected on patients, types of&#xD;
      infections, dosing strategies, treatment outcome and occurrence of antibiotic resistance&#xD;
      during treatment. The overall goal is to increase the knowledge about how these antibiotics&#xD;
      are prescribed and how to optimize the use of them in clinical practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emergence and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is one of the greatest threats facing&#xD;
      human health today. Multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria constitutes the biggest challenges&#xD;
      and particularly carbapenem-resistant bacteria, against which available treatment options&#xD;
      usually are very limited and the mortality is high (&gt;50%) in severly ill patients. In recent&#xD;
      years some new antibiotics have been developed with in-vitro effect against those bacteria.&#xD;
      Still, clinical data regarding those antibiotics are limited and resistance development has&#xD;
      been reported. Combination therapy with two or more antibiotics are often used to treat&#xD;
      multi-resistant Gram-negative bacteria and are sometimes applied also with the newer drugs.&#xD;
      Combination therapy is supported mainly by in vitro studies rather than clinical evidence.&#xD;
      More research is needed to investigate which antibiotic combinations has the biggest&#xD;
      potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to assess current use of the following antibiotics in&#xD;
      Swedish university hospitals: cefiderocol, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam,&#xD;
      fosfomycin, meropenem-vaborbactam and imipenem-relebactam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent, all patients treated with any of the study drugs at one of the&#xD;
      seven university hospitals in Sweden can be included in the study. Guardian approval is&#xD;
      needed to include study participants &lt;15 years of age. Besides routine testing with&#xD;
      biomarkers and cultures within clinical practice, bacterial cultures will be taken seven days&#xD;
      after start of treatment with the study drug, from the sample site where the infecting&#xD;
      pathogen was first identified (e.g., blood, wound, nasopharynx, urine), to assess&#xD;
      microbiological cure. Screening for multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria in feces will&#xD;
      also be conducted with screening cultures seven days after initiated therapy with study drug&#xD;
      to detect emergence of resistance in the intestinal microbiota. The cultures will be analyzed&#xD;
      at the local clinical microbiology departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on patient characteristics (age, gender, comorbidity etc.), site of infection,&#xD;
      infecting pathogen and associated resistance profile, severity of infection, choice of&#xD;
      treatment (drug, dose, treatment duration and eventual antibiotic combination therapy) will&#xD;
      be obtained from the electronical medical records. Further treatment outcome including&#xD;
      mortality, treatment failure, increasing need of intensive care, duration of hospitalization,&#xD;
      suspected side effects and occurrence of Clostridioides difficile enteritis will also be&#xD;
      extracted. The follow-up period is 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient names and personal identification numbers will be replaced by a number. Personal data&#xD;
      will be stored at the Department of infectious diseases, at respective hospital where the&#xD;
      study participant has been included. Only the responsible researchers will have access to the&#xD;
      code key and be able to link personal information to the individual participants. All&#xD;
      information will be handled in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)&#xD;
      and all analyses and presentation of data will be performed using anonymous data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine antibiotic resistance profiles of the infecting pathogens, bacterial isolates&#xD;
      will be sent to the reference laboratory at Uppsala University. The strains will be&#xD;
      characterized with phenotypical methods for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)&#xD;
      determination (e.g., microdilution, agar dilution) as well as genetical testing with&#xD;
      whole-genome sequencing determining the presence of resistance genes and genetic mutations&#xD;
      (e.g., production of beta lactamases, porin loss and efflux). In case of repeated growth of&#xD;
      the same bacterial species in clinical or screening samples seven days from start of&#xD;
      treatment, the two strains (prior and post treatment start of study drug) will be compared by&#xD;
      MIC determination and whole-genome sequencing to detect emergence of antibiotic resistance&#xD;
      during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the isolates will undergo in-vitro testing at the reference laboratory at Uppsala&#xD;
      University, where the efficacy of different antibiotic combinations will be investigated with&#xD;
      multiple in vitro methods including automated time-lapse microscopy and bacterial time-kill&#xD;
      experiments with static and dynamic antibiotic concentrations. Bacterial killing, bacterial&#xD;
      growth and selection of resistant subpopulations will be determined.&#xD;
