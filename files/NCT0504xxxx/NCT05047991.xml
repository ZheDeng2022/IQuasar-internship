      This is a multicenter, randomized, open-lable, parallel-controlled phase II study of&#xD;
      irinotecan liposome injection-containing regimens versus nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the differences of safety and efficacy of irinotecan liposome&#xD;
      injection-containing regimens versus nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

      This is a multicentre randomized, open-label, parallel-controlled, phase II study to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of irinotecan liposome injection-containing regimens. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomly divided into two cohorts at a ratio of 2:1. The patients in cohort&#xD;
      1 (the experimental group) will receive irinotecan liposome injection combined with&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV) and oxaliplatin.The patients in cohort 2 (the control&#xD;
      group) will receive nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine.&#xD;
