      Controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD) refers to organ donation (OD) from&#xD;
      patients whose death is defined using circulatory criteria and from whom circulatory death&#xD;
      occurs after a planned withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST) in intensive care units&#xD;
      (ICUs). During cDCD, the patient is still alive while OD process is being discussed and&#xD;
      organized. Caregivers can be particularly uncomfortable in this scenario. In the specific&#xD;
      context of cDCD, developing knowledge on the perceptions and experiences of relatives and ICU&#xD;
      caregivers regarding OD is crucial but remains poorly investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a prospective multicentric observational research to better understand&#xD;
      relatives' and ICU caregivers' experience of cDCD. Better understanding their perceptions and&#xD;
      experiences will enable to develop interventions to support and guide them throughout this&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies (WLST) decision occur significantly more&#xD;
      frequently in intensive care units (ICUs), controlled donation after circulatory death (cDCD)&#xD;
      evolves end-of-life care and produces a new end-of-life (EOL) model: EOL care now includes&#xD;
      the opportunity to donate organs and tissues after death. During cDCD, the patient is still&#xD;
      alive while OD process is being discussed and organized. Caregivers can be particularly&#xD;
      uncomfortable in this scenario where EOL care and OD in effect overlap. Thus, the&#xD;
      implementation of a cDCD program in France, as elsewhere, raised the issue of the potential&#xD;
      impact of OD on WLST decision-making processes and EOL practices (particularly sedation). As&#xD;
      other countries, the national protocol is nonetheless clear that the decision for WLST must&#xD;
      be made in the bests interest of the patient and independent of any consideration of OD, and&#xD;
      the donation pathway must not change EOL care. The challenge is not only to identify patients&#xD;
      suitable as potential donors but also to provide support to grieving families and to make&#xD;
      HCPs comfortable with OD in this particular context. In the specific context of cDCD,&#xD;
      developing knowledge on the perceptions and experiences of relatives and ICU caregivers&#xD;
      regarding OD is crucial but remains poorly investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to conduct a prospective multicentric observational research to better understand&#xD;
      relatives' and ICU caregivers' experience of cDCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A relative and/or at least two caregivers (1 physician and 1 or 2 paramedics) are included&#xD;
      for any situation of death of a patient in ICU following a decision to withdraw LST and for&#xD;
      which OD has been discussed with the relatives, whether or not the organ procurement finally&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two situations are distinguished:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WLST without OD possibility: the WLST is initiated while OD is no longer considered for&#xD;
           one of the following reasons: medical unsuitability, expressed intend not to be a donor&#xD;
           or family refusal, legal issues, logistical problems, hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WLST with OD possibility: the WLST is initiated while OD is still considered, whether or&#xD;
           not OD finally occurs for one of the following reasons: circulatory death declared &gt; 180&#xD;
           minutes, excessive warm ischemia time due to normothermic regional perfusion dysfunction&#xD;
           or hypoperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the discussion about OD with the relatives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The screening for inclusion will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If 1 relative volunteers to participate in the study (non-opposition noted by the&#xD;
           investigator), the situation is included in CARE-M3 &quot;relative&quot; section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If no relatives volunteer to participate in the study, the situation can be included in&#xD;
           CARE M3 for the caregiver section after the patient's death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient death, wether or not OD occurs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 caregivers (1 physician and 2 paramedics) can be included. These are the caregivers&#xD;
           who are present at the time the WLST is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If at least two caregivers volunteer to participate in the study, the situation is&#xD;
           included in CARE-M3 caregiver section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives concerning the relatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: to study their risk of developing symptoms of post-traumatic stress&#xD;
           disorder in the months following the patient's death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives: assessment of symptoms of anxiety, depression, complicated grief,&#xD;
           assessment of understanding of the decision process to withdraw LST and the cDCD&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives concerning the ICU caregivers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary objective: to study their risk developing anxiety relating to the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives: evaluation of the impact of the cDCD procedure on the WLST&#xD;
           decision-making process, end-of-life practices, support at the end-of-life (EOL) and&#xD;
           quality of the EOL.&#xD;

        The relatives of patients who have died in ICU are the first attendant of the patient at&#xD;
        the end-of-life EOL. During this procedure, relatives are particularly solicited because&#xD;
        they are strongly involved in the decision-making process. The most involved relative in&#xD;
        the relationship with the resuscitation team will be asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Caregivers included in the study are caregivers from ICU who are present at the time the&#xD;
        withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies WLST is initiated: at least 1 physician and 1 or 2&#xD;
        paramedics.&#xD;
