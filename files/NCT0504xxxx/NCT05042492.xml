    <textblock>
      This study will investigate whether the recovery of muscle function of total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty is accelerated with the use of the gekoTM device along with its effect on&#xD;
      reducing symptoms such as oedema and inhibition of the muscle function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate total knee arthroplasty patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One group gets standard of care (i.e. performing exercises &amp; guidance by a&#xD;
           physiotherapist via a CE-marked mobile application, called moveUP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second group gets standard of care + GekoTM device (i.e. non-invasive neuromuscular&#xD;
           electrostimulation applied at the peroneal nerve for 10 days after the operation date.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the post-operative effect of gekoTM on&#xD;
      formation of oedema (measured by perometer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the gekoTM device on the muscle function &amp; the overall recovery will be also&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To collect parameters, the patient will be asked to complete questionnaires, including the&#xD;
      following patient reported outcomes (PROMs): Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score&#xD;
      (KOOS), Knee Society Score (KSS), Euroqol Health questionnaire EQ5D, Forgotten Joint Score&#xD;
      (FJS), Oxford Knee Score (OKS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of the PROMs will give an indication on outcome and overal recovery in the 2&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;

    <description>In group 1: moveUP (class 1, CE-marked, medical device) is being used as the rehabilitation solution after TKA. It has become a valid digital rehabilitation solution and is recognised by the Belgian government as mobile health application in rehabilitation of hip and knee arthroplasty surgeries. It's a full service with daily personalized and individualized follow up by certified physical therapists and certified health care providers. The use of tele-rehabilitation for TKA patients has been internationally recognized with the 2018 John N. Insall Award during the American Knee Society Meeting</description>

    <description>In group 2: Next to SC (moveUP), the application of a single gekoTM device is used on the operated leg after surgery (day 0). This device will be worn for 24 hours and at least 8 hours from day 1 until day 10.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>gekoTM</intervention_name>
    <description>The gekoTM device is a small, transcutaneous nerve stimulator that is placed non-invasively on the skin, whereby the surface electrodes will be attached close to the peroneal nerve. Activation of the peroneal nerve causes contraction of the calf muscle pump, which will increase blood circulation that corresponds to 60% of walking. The increased blood circulation reduces the pressure difference between capillaries and the surrounding tissue and transfers the tissue fluid back into the veins and lymph fibers</description>
