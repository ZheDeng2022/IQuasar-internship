    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is to prove that the treatment group of Medicurtain® is non-inferior to&#xD;
      the treatment group of Guardix-sol®, test equipment on adhesion after endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery, upon the aspects of adhesion prevention efficacy and safety.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was conducted based on multi center, randomized, assessor blind, matched&#xD;
      pair design, active-controlled clinical study. After signing consent and fulfilling the&#xD;
      standards for selection/exclusion, test subjects went through required treatments following&#xD;
      endoscopic surgery; subsequently, according to the order of registration after 2 to 3 days&#xD;
      from the surgery, the subjects were applied with a medical device for the clinical test and a&#xD;
      medical device for the control test to both of their nasal cavities based on randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For procedures, bleeding was treated and prevented through packing, by soaking Merocel with&#xD;
      saline solution following the ESS (Endoscopic sinus surgery) on subjects; and after 2 to 3&#xD;
      days (or upon discharge), it was to treat applied regions of the subjects with assigned&#xD;
      medical device after confirming sufficient hemostasis by removing Merocel. Being matched pair&#xD;
      active-controlled clinical study, this clinical trial was designed to treat a single subject&#xD;
      with both medical devices for clinical test and control test where it was kept unknown which&#xD;
      device would be assigned to which nasal cavity based on randomization until the procedure was&#xD;
      actually performed. For the time and method of evaluation, observation and evaluation were&#xD;
      allowed to be conducted based on the images through endoscopy when subjects visited at 1st,&#xD;
      2nd and 4th weeks following the treatment with medical device. The process of procedure was&#xD;
      assured for an identical researcher to perform procedures in order to minimize the effect&#xD;
      from the procedure method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All endoscopic image records of test subjects were delivered by independent assessors, while&#xD;
      information on medical device used for treatment was excluded; and independent assessors&#xD;
      evaluated each image record according to the evaluation standards prescribed by this clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the determination of the researcher during and following the surgery, subjects were&#xD;
      administered with 2nd or 3rd generation Cephalosporin Antibiotics. Following the surgery,&#xD;
      subjects were instructed to use normal saline solution nasal spray 2 to 3 times a day on both&#xD;
      nasal cavities by utilizing bulb-shape tube or syringe. In addition, subjects were also&#xD;
      instructed to use intranasal steroid sprays.&#xD;
