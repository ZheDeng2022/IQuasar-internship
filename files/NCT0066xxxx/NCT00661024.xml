    <textblock>
      Some recent studies have shown that intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) can aid the&#xD;
      recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) identification during thyroid surgery. However, the role of&#xD;
      IONM in reducing the incidence of RLN injury rate and the value of this method in predicting&#xD;
      postoperative RLN function remain controversial. Only a few published series represent level&#xD;
      III of evidence and grade C of recommendation according to the evidence-based criteria&#xD;
      (Sackett's classification, modified by Heinrich). Thus, the aim of this randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial was to compare the impact of RLN visualization versus IONM on their morbidity following&#xD;
      thyroid surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apart from hypoparathyroidism, dysfunction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) is the most&#xD;
      common complication following thyroid surgery. In consequence, the voice impairment leading&#xD;
      to communication work-related problems and affecting psychological and social aspects of the&#xD;
      individual's functioning diminishes the overall quality of life, being the common reason for&#xD;
      medicolegal claims and litigation. The reported RLN palsy rate varies in the literature from&#xD;
      0% (for first-time thyroid surgery performed by an experienced endocrine surgeon) to as much&#xD;
      as 20% (for reoperative thyroid surgery or thyroid malignancy surgery performed in low-volume&#xD;
      centers), depending mostly on the type of thyroid disease (benign vs. malignant goiter), type&#xD;
      (first-time vs. reoperation) and the extent of thyroid resection (subtotal vs. total&#xD;
      thyroidectomy), surgical technique (with or without routine RLN identification) and the&#xD;
      surgeon's experience (low-volume vs. high-volume thyroid surgery center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1938, Lahey from Boston reported a significantly lower incidence of RLN injuries following&#xD;
      thyroidectomy with dissection and visualization of the nerves as compared to operations&#xD;
      without nerve identification. Since that time, many prospective studies have confirmed this&#xD;
      observation, advocating routine RLN identification as the gold standard in safe thyroid&#xD;
      surgery. But even in the most experienced hands RLN palsy occurs occasionally, with an&#xD;
      average frequency below 1% of nerves at risk due to variability in RLNs anatomy and&#xD;
      difficulties in nerve identification by visual or palpation control in challenging conditions&#xD;
      (e.g. advanced thyroid malignancy or reoperative thyroid surgery). On the other hand, the use&#xD;
      of intraoperative electrical stimulation for identifying the RLN nerve was described in 1966.&#xD;
      However, the technique of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of RLN did not gain any&#xD;
      widespread popularity until the late nineties of the last century, when several commercial&#xD;
      user-friendly systems based on electromyographic signal recording became available. In these&#xD;
      IONM systems, the RLN nerve stimulation is registered by elicited laryngeal muscles activity&#xD;
      through the endoscopic insertion of the electrodes into the vocal cords, open insertion of&#xD;
      the needle electrodes into the vocal muscles through the cricothyroid ligament or with the&#xD;
      use of endotracheal tube surface electrodes. In addition to a plethora of signal acquisition&#xD;
      techniques used in IONM, there is no consensus regarding the optimal method for nerve&#xD;
      activity recording (continuous recording of spontaneous nerve activity versus repetitive&#xD;
      stimulation) and no agreement as to which quantitative electromyographic parameter should be&#xD;
      used as a predictor of postoperative vocal cord dysfunction (supramaximal versus minimal&#xD;
      stimulation of the nerve at the end of the operation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some recent studies have shown that IONM can aid the RLN identification. However, the role of&#xD;
      IONM in reducing the incidence of RLN injury rate and the value of this method in predicting&#xD;
      postoperative RLN function remain controversial. Only a few published series represent level&#xD;
      III of evidence and grade C of recommendation according to the evidence-based criteria&#xD;
      (Sackett's classification, modified by Heinrich). Large, prospective, randomized trials&#xD;
      addressing these issues and allowing for grade A recommendations are lacking due to some&#xD;
      ethical concerns and large numbers of patients in each arm (more than 7000 patients) needed&#xD;
      to reach the appropriate power of the study. To fulfill this gap in evidence, we designed a&#xD;
      medium-size, single-center, prospective randomized study suitable for drawing more meaningful&#xD;
      conclusions. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the impact of RLN visualization&#xD;
      versus IONM on their morbidity following thyroid surgery.&#xD;
