  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In retrospective studies, acceleration of hepatic fibrosis has been seen in Nevirapine (NVP)&#xD;
      treatment when compared with Protease Inhibitors (PI) boosted with ritonavir treatment in&#xD;
      patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection. The&#xD;
      high incidence in our country of HIV-HCV co-infection, the availability of a new Kaletra&#xD;
      (LPV/r) formulation (more convenient and better tolerated than soft capsules) as well as the&#xD;
      possibility of analyzing hepatic fibrosis evolution in a fast and bloodless way, make&#xD;
      attractive a study that, in a prospective way, could check the benefits of substituting NVP&#xD;
      by LPV/r on hepatic fibrosis in this community.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of the HIV-HCV co-infection in Spain is one of the highest because both&#xD;
      infections are strongly related to parenteral drugs use; so, from 61 to 69 % of HIV infected&#xD;
      patients are also HCV infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute HCV infection is asymptomatic in 60 to 70% of cases, being the chronification the&#xD;
      natural illness evolution. 20% of the patients will develop hepatic cirrhosis after 20 to 30&#xD;
      years of being infected by the HCV. In cirrhosis cases, the hepatocellular carcinoma appears&#xD;
      in a rate of 2 to 4% per year, according to studies done with HCV mono-infected patients.&#xD;
      Fibrosis progression depends basically on the duration of HCV infection and on the age of&#xD;
      infection, but also on other factors, like gender (is faster in men), alcohol consumption&#xD;
      (worst over 50 g per day) and HIV co-infection. Several epidemiologist studies have described&#xD;
      the negative impact of HIV co-infection, accelerating the progression to cirrhosis and the&#xD;
      hepatocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Highly Active Antiretroviral Treatment (HAART) has a positive impact on survival on&#xD;
      co-infected patients, although the three drug families used in HAART can cause hepatic&#xD;
      toxicity in this group of patients. Hepatic toxicity appears in 5 to 20% of patients, being&#xD;
      more serious and common, but not exclusive, in case of NVP treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On their part, not all PI have the same hepatotoxic profile. An association between serious&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity and ritonavir at full strength, indinavir and indinavir plus saquinavir&#xD;
      boosted with ritonavir has been found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as fibrosis is concerned, there are studies that show that in HIV/HCV co-infected&#xD;
      patients PI-based regimens are associated with a lower progression to fibrosis, while the&#xD;
      progression rate to cirrhosis is higher in NVP-based regimens, mainly in those patients with&#xD;
      advanced hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatic biopsy is considered the reference test to assess hepatic fibrosis, nevertheless it&#xD;
      is an invasive, painful and with a low but potentially serious risk for the patient's life.&#xD;
      Moreover, the viability of a hepatic biopsy can be doubted due to sampling error or&#xD;
      interobservation variability. For that reason, several biochemist tests have been developed&#xD;
      to reflect the hepatic fibrosis extent or stage in a reliable way. Recently a hepatic&#xD;
      rigidity measure through elastography has been presented as a non-invasive and very promising&#xD;
      method to assess hepatic fibrosis.&#xD;
