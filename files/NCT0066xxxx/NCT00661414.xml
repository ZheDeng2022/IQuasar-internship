  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability and highest dose of ASONEP&#xD;
      that can safely be administered to patients with cancer who are no longer being helped by&#xD;
      standard treatments.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) is a humanized monoclonal antibody that possesses&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic and anti-tumor activity in animal models of human cancer. ASONEP™ binds&#xD;
      sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), a bioactive lipid signaling molecule that possesses potent&#xD;
      pro-growth effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies with ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) and LT1002 (murine homolog of LT1009),&#xD;
      demonstrate the potential of an anti-S1P treatment to reduce tumor volumes and metastatic&#xD;
      potential, likely as a result of inhibiting new blood vessel formation needed to support&#xD;
      tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lpath is developing ASONEP™ (sonepcizumab/LT1009) for the following therapeutic indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASONEP™ [parenteral sonepcizumab (LT1009) for the treatment of cancer] is indicated for use&#xD;
      in combination with TBD cytotoxic agents and other anti-angiogenic agents as second-line&#xD;
      therapy to treat patients with an unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic TBD&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
