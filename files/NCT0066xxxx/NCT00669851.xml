  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluated and optimized settings for, and evaluated the performance of,&#xD;
      AI-700-enhanced echocardiographic imaging on several ultrasound imaging platforms, as well as&#xD;
      collected additional safety data for AI-700 in healthy volunteers and stable cardiac&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Because the quality of AI-700-enhanced images is in part determined by the ultrasound (US)&#xD;
      settings selection, the continuing study of different imaging modes and/or techniques is&#xD;
      required in order to provide US settings recommendations for the many available systems.&#xD;
      Therefore AI-700-enhanced imaging was performed in this study using imaging platforms and&#xD;
      modes not previously tested and the AI-700 dose and administration methods employed in&#xD;
      previous Phase 3 studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two cohorts of subjects were studied at each site. Enrollment commenced with Cohort A and&#xD;
      included normal (healthy) volunteers and stable cardiac patients. Settings optimization was&#xD;
      performed in Cohort A using a single platform and real-time imaging. If the Sponsor agreed&#xD;
      that the images and settings acquired in Cohort A were acceptable, the site was authorized to&#xD;
      begin enrollment in Cohort B using the platform and settings that were defined in Cohort A.&#xD;
      Authorized sites enrolled stable cardiac patients in Cohort B; no healthy volunteers were&#xD;
      studied. For Cohort B subjects, the first 0.04 mL/kg dose of AI 700 was used to evaluate&#xD;
      real-time imaging with the settings defined in Cohort A. The second dose of AI-700 for Cohort&#xD;
      B subjects may have been used to confirm the data obtained with the first dose, or to explore&#xD;
      imaging in a second mode (e.g. 3D/4D) and/or using real-time, high mechanical index triggered&#xD;
      imaging on a second platform.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Cohort A, men and non-pregnant/non-lactating women in good health who are 18 to 70&#xD;
             years of age and who have a low chance of CAD will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For Cohort B, men and non-pregnant/non-lactating women in good health who are 18-70&#xD;
             years of age who have had a prior MI and/or coronary artery revascularization&#xD;
             intervention &gt;90 days before AI-700 administration, without new or recurrent angina&#xD;
             will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy volunteers in Cohort A who have or have had any of the following conditions&#xD;
             will be excluded from the study: clinically significant intra-cardiac shunts or any&#xD;
             other cardiovascular structural and/or severe functional abnormalities on the&#xD;
             Qualification Echo, unless deemed not clinically relevant by the Investigator and&#xD;
             subsequently approved by the Sponsor; ejection fraction (EF, estimated from the&#xD;
             Qualification Echo) that is ≤55% (outside normal range), history or clinical&#xD;
             manifestations of significant mental illness or significant pulmonary, hematological,&#xD;
             renal, hepatic, central nervous, cardiovascular, genitourinary, or gastrointestinal&#xD;
