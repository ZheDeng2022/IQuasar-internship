  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RATIONALE: Androgens can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such&#xD;
      as triptorelin, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving triptorelin and&#xD;
      radiation therapy soon after surgery or later after surgery is more effective in treating&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying giving triptorelin and radiation therapy&#xD;
      soon after surgery to see how well it works compared with giving them later after surgery in&#xD;
      treating patients who have undergone surgery for intermediate-risk stage III or stage IV&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of event-free survival at 5 years, of immediate&#xD;
           radio-hormonal therapy immediately after prostatectomy for tumor pT2, R1, pN0, or pNx&#xD;
           versus radio-hormonal therapy at biochemical relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the metastasis-free survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the acute and late toxicities of these regimens in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the functional dependence of patients over 75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (delayed treatment): Patients receive triptorelin intramuscularly on day 1 and&#xD;
           then 3 months later. Patients also undergo conformal radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week,&#xD;
           for 7 weeks. Treatment begins at biochemical relapse (PSA is more than 0.2 ng/mL) and&#xD;
           before PSA is more than 2 ng/mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (immediate treatment): Patients receive treatment as in arm I, but treatment&#xD;
           begins within 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;

    <description>The National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3 (NCI-CTCAE v3.0) is widely accepted in the community of oncology research as the leading rating scale for adverse events.

    <measure>Quality of life questionnaire - Core 30 (QLQ-C30)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 years, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>Developed by the EORTC, this self-reported questionnaire assesses the health-related quality of life of cancer patients in clinical trials.&#xD;
The questionnaire includes five functional scales (physical, everyday activity, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), a health/quality of life overall scale, and a number of additional elements assessing common symptoms (including dyspnea, loss of appetite, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea), as well as, the perceived financial impact of the disease.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life Questionnaire - Prostate Cancer Module (QLQ-PR25)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, 2 years, and 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>This EORTC prostate cancer specific questionnaire is intended to supplement the QLQ-C30.&#xD;
The prostate cancer module is a 25-item questionnaire designed for use among patients with localized and metastatic prostate cancer. It includes subscales assessing urinary symptoms (9 items), bowel symptoms (4 items), treatment-related symptoms (6 items), and sexual functioning (6 items). Using a 4-point Likert scale (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;a little&quot;, 3 = &quot;quite a bit&quot;, and 4 = &quot;very much&quot;), patients indicate the degree to which they have experienced symptoms.</description>

    <description>The Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale is a self-reported questionnaire to assess independent living skills for older adults. This questionnaire, composed of 31 questions organized into 8 domains (ability to use telephone, shopping, food preparation, housekeeping, laundering, mode of transportation, responsibility for own medications, and ability to handle finances), is designed to identify improvement or deterioration of a person functioning over time. Each domain is scored 0-1 for a summary score ranging from 0 (low function, dependent) to 8 (high function, independent).</description>
