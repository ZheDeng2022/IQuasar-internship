      RATIONALE: Buthionine sulfoximine may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as melphalan, work in&#xD;
      different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing. Sometimes when chemotherapy is given, it does not stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells. The tumor is said to be resistant to chemotherapy. Giving buthionine sulfoximine&#xD;
      together with chemotherapy may reduce drug resistance and allow the tumor cells to be killed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of melphalan when&#xD;
      given as an isolated limb infusion together with buthionine sulfoximine in treating patients&#xD;
      with persistent or recurrent stage III malignant melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of melphalan when administered as an isolated&#xD;
           limb infusion in combination with a systemic infusion of buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) in&#xD;
           patients with persistent or recurrent stage IIIB or IIIC in-transit malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define the dose-limiting toxicity of regional melphalan when administered with&#xD;
           systemic BSO in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the combination of systemic BSO and regional melphalan can yield&#xD;
           clinical responses in patients who have not responded well to prior melphalan-based&#xD;
           regional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the effectiveness of systemic BSO in decreasing tumor glutathione (GSH)&#xD;
           levels and its effect on GST activity and GST expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the correlation between tumor GSH levels and GSH levels in peripheral blood&#xD;
           mononuclear cells to determine if the latter can serve as a surrogate marker for tumor&#xD;
           GSH depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of systemic BSO and regional melphalan in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if BSO alters the mRNA expression signature of melphalan resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of systemic BSO and regional melphalan in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To correlate baseline mRNA expression signature of melphalan resistance with treatment&#xD;
           efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of melphalan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) IV continuously on days 1-3 and melphalan as an&#xD;
      isolated limb infusion (ILI) over 30 minutes on day 2 in the absence of progressive disease&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo biopsies and blood sample collection at baseline, immediately before and&#xD;
      during ILI, and then at 12 weeks after ILI or at the time of disease progression. Samples are&#xD;
      analyzed for GST genotype, tumor glutathione (GSH) levels (by enzymatic assay or&#xD;
      HPLC/fluorescence detection [FLD]), drug pharmacokinetics, and mRNA expression signature of&#xD;
      melphalan resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2, 6, and 12 weeks, every 3&#xD;
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
