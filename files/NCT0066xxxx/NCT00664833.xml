  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, cluster-randomized, open-label flexible dose study with a 2x2&#xD;
      factorial design with administration of vardenafil at a dose of 5, 10 and 20 mg doses in&#xD;
      males with erectile dysfunction.The treatment period is for 12 weeks, after a 4 week&#xD;
      unmedicated period for subjects taking ED medication. For ED treatment-na√Øve subjects (ie,&#xD;
      previously not treated with ED medication), the unmedicated period can be only 2&#xD;
      weeks.Approximately 150 investigational centres may be utilised with approximately 10&#xD;
      subjects screened and entered into a 4 week treatment free period at Visit 1 to subsequently&#xD;
      enroll approximately 1380 subjects to therapy. Each centre should enroll 10 subjects. Sites&#xD;
      should try to recruit approximately 50% of subjects who have not previously tried oral PDE5&#xD;
      inhibitor therapy for erectile dysfunction. An attempt should be made to enroll subjects&#xD;
      whose partners are interested in being involved.Sites will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio&#xD;
      to receive either the education intervention at the Primary care Physician (PCP) level, at&#xD;
      the subject level, both levels or no intervention (usual care). The PCP education program is&#xD;
      an accredited CME program and included a comprehensive overview on the screening and&#xD;
      diagnosis of ED, the available treatment options and appropriate treatment selection, as well&#xD;
      as subject and partner counseling. The subject education was a two-pronged approach which&#xD;
      included physician-to-subject instruction and a direct-to-subject education method. After the&#xD;
      unmedicated period, treatment was initiated with vardenafil 10 mg tablets for 4 weeks. This&#xD;
      will be followed by a flexible dose titration period of 4 weeks during which subjects may&#xD;
      maintain the previous dosage regimen or will step up to 20 mg of vardenafil or will step down&#xD;
      to 5 mg vardenafil. There is a final 4 week treatment period where the previous dosage&#xD;
      regimen is either maintained, increased or decreased by one step according to the three&#xD;
      applicable dosage strengths of vardenafil (5, 10 or 20 mg). The highest applicable dosage&#xD;
      regimen of 20 mg vardenafil will not be exceeded. A 24 hour follow-up phone call is required&#xD;
      within 24 hours of the last dose of vardenafil to collect data concerning serious adverse&#xD;
      events, if needed.&#xD;
