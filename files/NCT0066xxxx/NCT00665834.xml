    <textblock>
      This is a 3-month, randomized, parallel-group study with 2 periods, comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      and the safety of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus atorvastatin 80 mg in patients with an acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (ACS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with ACS (acute coronary syndrome) constitute a high-risk population with unstable&#xD;
      coronary disease (CHD) that differs from stable CHD primarily in short term prognosis&#xD;
      (prediction of outcome). The 1-year rate of death or non-fatal MI (myocardial infarction or&#xD;
      heart attack) was 13% in patients with ACS in a recent controlled study (FRISC II 1999),&#xD;
      compared with less than 2% in patients with stable CHD (SAPAT 1992). Thus, despite&#xD;
      substantial progress in the treatment of ACS with antiplatelet and anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      medications (blood thinners), additional therapies are needed to reduce the additional risk&#xD;
      associated with unstable CHD. Current guidelines (NCEP 2001) recommend that patients admitted&#xD;
      with a major coronary event (MI or ACS) should be considered for treatment with a statin on&#xD;
      discharge from the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cited advantages of this approach are patient motivation to start therapy at that time and&#xD;
      prevention of a &quot;treatment gap&quot; due to inconsistent outpatient follow-up. A previously&#xD;
      randomized controlled study of statin therapy in ACS patients (MIRACL study), showed that&#xD;
      aggressive cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin 80 mg between 24 and 96 hours after&#xD;
      hospital admission in patients with ACS resulted in reduced incidence of recurrent CHD events&#xD;
      at 16 weeks. However, the study excluded patients who underwent revascularization (PCI). Thus&#xD;
      the study enrolled only a subset of the ACS population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also emerging data from clinical studies supporting the anti-inflammatory actions of&#xD;
      statins. One recent randomized controlled study demonstrated that statins decrease the levels&#xD;
      of CRP, considered to be a marker of intra-arterial inflammation and a predictor of recurrent&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events. The relative levels of various lipid measurements, such as&#xD;
      LDL-C, triglycerides and HDL-C probably influence the inflammatory and thrombotic (blood&#xD;
      clotting) properties, but the exact relationship is not clear. The anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      antithrombotic properties of different statins are likely related to their impact on the&#xD;
      lipid profile and their different pleiotropic properties (producing more than one genetic&#xD;
      effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is designed to compare the effects of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus&#xD;
      atorvastatin 80 mg started at maximum 6 days after an ACS to lipid profile (blood&#xD;
      cholesterol). Additionally, the hypothesis of beneficial effect on inflammatory markers&#xD;
      compared with statins started later will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c) Summary of study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3-month, randomized, parallel-group study with 2 periods, comparing the efficacy&#xD;
      and the safety of rosuvastatin 20 mg versus atorvastatin 80 mg in patients with an acute&#xD;
      coronary syndrome (ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study comprises a 1st double blind, placebo controlled, period that starts at the&#xD;
           admission of the patient for an ACS (clinical symptoms less than 24 hours) until&#xD;
           hospital discharge (or a maximum timeline of 6 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 2nd double blind, double dummy, period starts at Day 0 (i.e. from the hospital&#xD;
           discharge or at a maximum of 6 days after admission) and will last 3 months. After&#xD;
           validation of eligibility criteria (including a 1st local assessment of CK, creatinine,&#xD;
           ALT and an ECG) and the planning of a PCI between 24 hours and 4 days after admission,&#xD;
           patients will be randomized into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. early started rosuvastatin 20 mg from admission until the end of the study (group 1&#xD;
                - early rosuvastatin 20 mg),&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. placebo from admission until Day O (i.e. until hospital discharge or for a maximum&#xD;
                of 6 days) followed by rosuvastatin 20 mg until the end of the study (group 2 -&#xD;
                late rosuvastatin 20 mg),&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. placebo from admission until Day O (i.e. until hospital discharge or for a maximum&#xD;
                of 6 days) followed by atorvastatin 80 mg until the end of the study (group 3 -&#xD;
                atorvastatin 80 mg).&#xD;
