      To determine the effects of three different doses of bardoxolone methyl administered orally&#xD;
      on the kidney function (glomular filtration rate) in patients with diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Bardoxolone methyl is an Antioxidant Inflammation Modulator in clinical development for&#xD;
      inflammation and cancer-related indications that inhibits immune-mediated inflammation by&#xD;
      restoring redox homeostasis in inflamed tissues. It induces the cytoprotective transcription&#xD;
      factor Nrf2 and suppresses the activities of the pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      transcription factors NF-kB and the STATs. In vivo, bardoxolone has demonstrated significant&#xD;
      single agent anti-inflammatory activity in several animal models of inflammation such as&#xD;
      renal damage in the cisplatin model and ischemia-reperfusion model of acute renal injury. In&#xD;
      addition, significant reductions in serum creatinine have been observed in patients treated&#xD;
      with bardoxolone. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that bardoxolone can improve renal&#xD;
      function in patients with diabetic nephropathy through suppression of renal inflammation and&#xD;
      improvement of glomerular filtration.&#xD;
