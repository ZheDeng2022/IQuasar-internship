      Phase I Study of Bevacizumab and Sorafenib Combined with Low Dose Cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      Patients with Refractory Solid Tumors and Leukemia. Patients with solid tumors (including&#xD;
      central nervous tumors) that are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy, or for whom&#xD;
      standard therapy is not available. Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established&#xD;
      in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, the tolerability of this dose will be&#xD;
      tested in patients with refractory or recurrent leukemia and an expanded cohort of patients&#xD;
      with refractory or recurrent solid tumors.&#xD;

      Phase I Study of Bevacizumab and Sorafenib Combined with Low Dose Cyclophosphamide in&#xD;
      Patients with Refractory Solid Tumors and Leukemia. Patients with solid tumors (including&#xD;
      central nervous tumors) that are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy, or for whom&#xD;
      standard therapy is not available. Once a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been established&#xD;
      in patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors, the tolerability of this dose will be&#xD;
      tested in a maximum of 6 patients, in cohorts of 3, with refractory or recurrent leukemia and&#xD;
      a maximum of 24 evaluable patients, in cohorts of 6, with refractory or recurrent solid&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 21-24 patients with refractory solid tumors to define the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) and 6 patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia,12 patients with refractory&#xD;
      or recurrent bone or soft tissue sarcomas and 12 patients with other refractory or recurrent&#xD;
      solid tumors (including lymphomas) to test the tolerability of this MTD in patients with&#xD;
      hematological malignancies. Bevacizumab will be administered intravenously at a starting dose&#xD;
      of 5 mg/kg every 3 weeks with sorafenib by mouth every 12 hrs at a starting dose of 90 mg/m2&#xD;
      every 12 hours and cyclophosphamide by mouth daily at a dose of 50 mg/m2/day (dose level 1).&#xD;
      A course of therapy will be considered to be of 21 days duration. Once a maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of sorafenib (sMTD) in combination with bevacizumab and cyclophosphamide has been&#xD;
      determined, 6 patients with recurrent or refractory leukemia will be then be evaluated at the&#xD;
      solid tumor MTD to test the tolerability of this combination in patients with hematological&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;

             are recurrent or refractory to standard therapy or for which there is no standard&#xD;
             therapy. Histologic verification of diagnosis is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
