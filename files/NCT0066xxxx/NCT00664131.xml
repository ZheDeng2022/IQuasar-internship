      Treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia achieves high cure rate, but is potentially&#xD;
      neurotoxic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term neurologic morbidity in survivors and its effect on function are inadequately&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurologic outcomes will be assessed through an investigator administered questionnaire&#xD;
      followed by comprehensive neurologic examination by the study neurologist.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most prevalent childhood malignant disease.&#xD;
      Survival has improved from 5-10% in the early 1960s to over 80% at present. Historically, the&#xD;
      central nervous system (CNS) was the most common site of leukemia relapse. However, major&#xD;
      improvement in cure rates was achieved with the addition of CNS directed therapy using&#xD;
      initially craniospinal irradiation, and more recently, a combination of high-dose systemic&#xD;
      methotrexate and intrathecal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL mostly afflicts children in the first 12-years of life, an age when progressive&#xD;
      myelination is taking place and the central nervous system is more vulnerable to chemical and&#xD;
      radiologic injury. Many ALL studies have reported neurologic adverse events related to the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the long-term outcome of neurologic toxicity developing during&#xD;
      treatment of leukemia, or development of new late onset neurologic complications. No data is&#xD;
      available about outcomes of non-behavioral/cognitive neurologic complications, such as&#xD;
      seizures, incoordination, headache, loss of motor or sensory function, impaired energy and&#xD;
      muscle weakness. In addition, there is no data available on impact of neurologic disability&#xD;
      on quality of life of ALL survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to understand and recognize neurologic disability, its causes and impact on&#xD;
      function and quality of life so that adequate and timely remedies can be offered through&#xD;
      education and appropriate interventions can be undertaken to help prevent long-term&#xD;
      morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective observational study of ALL St. Jude Children's Research Hospital&#xD;
      survivors to determine the prevalence of different headache syndromes, as defined by&#xD;
      International Society of Headache criteria (IHS) and the prevalence and severity of seizures&#xD;
      and their relationship to leukemia treatment. We will establish incidence, type, severity,&#xD;
      and disability of sensory-motor neuropathy when present or any long term progression of&#xD;
      initial peripheral nerve injury in ALL survivors. This study will also help define whether&#xD;
      there is a higher incidence of low back pain and if there is any relation to a specific&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a one-time evaluation with an investigator administered questionnaire and&#xD;
      a neurologic examination.&#xD;

        Survivors of ALL who are currently 6-28 years of age, 5 years from ALL diagnosis, and 1&#xD;
        year off therapy who were treated on institutional protocols at St. Jude Children's&#xD;
        Research Hospital. Survivors will be recruited in the Leukemia and ACT clinics at St. Jude&#xD;
        Children's Research Hospital. We anticipate that 494 survivors are available. We plan to&#xD;
        enroll every survivor who is eligible and visits Leukemia or/ and ACT clinic at St. Jude&#xD;
        Children's Research Hospital&#xD;
