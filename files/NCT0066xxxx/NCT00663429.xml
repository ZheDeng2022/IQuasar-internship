      This study is an extension study to the Callisto protocol CP-106. Subjects must have&#xD;
      completed all 12 treatment cycles of CP-106 without disease progression as per RECIST&#xD;
      criteria,to be eligible to to be enrolled in this study. This study will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of atiprimod treatment in patients with low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine&#xD;
      carcinoma who have metastatic or unresectable local-regional cancer and who have either&#xD;
      symptoms (diarrhea, flushing and/or wheezing) despite standard therapy (octreotide) or&#xD;
      progression of neuroendocrine tumor(s).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For carcinoid, despite the many cytotoxic chemotherapy trials that have been conducted, no&#xD;
      regimen has demonstrated a response rate of more than 20% using the criterion of a 50%&#xD;
      reduction of bidimensionally measurable disease. In the more recently reported ECOG phase III&#xD;
      study of chemotherapy in carcinoid tumors (E1281), patients were randomly assigned to&#xD;
      treatment with 5-fluorouracil (5FU) plus doxorubicin or 5FU plus streptozocin. The median&#xD;
      progression free survival durations were disappointing. They were 4.5 months in the 5FU plus&#xD;
      doxorubicin arm and 5.3 months in the 5FU plus streptozocin arm. Overall survival durations&#xD;
      recorded in the trial were also suboptimal at 15 and 24 months respectively. There is no&#xD;
      clear survival benefit for cytotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II, multi-center, open-label extension study of the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      atiprimod treatment in patients with low to intermediate grade neuroendocrine carcinoma who&#xD;
      have metastatic or unresectable local-regional cancer and who have either symptoms (diarrhea,&#xD;
      flushing and/or wheezing) despite standard therapy (octreotide) or progression of&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor(s) (defined as the appearance of one or more new lesions or a 20%&#xD;
      increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions during the 6 months prior to&#xD;
      enrollment in CP-106). Atiprimod will be administered orally as a single daily dose of 60&#xD;
      mg/day for 14 days, followed by a 14-day treatment-free period (i.e., 1 treatment cycle = 28&#xD;
      days).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject was enrolled in Protocol No. CP-106 and successfully completed 12 treatment&#xD;
             cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must have been classified as a responder at the time of completion of Protocol&#xD;
             No. CP-106 [i.e., SD or better per RECIST Committee criteria or stable symptoms or&#xD;
             better (defined as an average daily frequency of bowel movements, flushing episodes&#xD;
             and/or wheezing episodes that is the same as or less than the average daily frequency&#xD;
             of bowel movements, flushing episodes and/or wheezing episodes recorded during the&#xD;
             14-day screening period prior to enrollment in Protocol No. CP-106)].&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must understand and voluntarily sign the informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject must have adequate organ function defined as follows: Absolute granulocyte&#xD;
             count (AGC) &gt;1,500/mm3, hemoglobin &gt;8 g/dl, platelets &gt;100,000/mm3, serum bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN), serum creatinine &lt;1.5 mg/dL, SGOT ≤Grade 1 per NCI&#xD;
             CTCAE, SGPT ≤Grade 1 per NCI CTCAE.&#xD;

          5. Women of child bearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy&#xD;
             test. In addition sexually active WCBP must agree to use adequate contraceptive&#xD;
             methods (oral, injectable or implantable hormonal contraceptive; tubal ligation;&#xD;
             intra-uterine devices; barrier contraceptive with spermicide; or vasectomized&#xD;
             partner).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject who was enrolled in Protocol No. CP-106 and who did not successfully complete&#xD;
             12 treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If WCBP, pregnant, lactating or not using adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Clinically relevant active infection or serious co-morbid medical conditions that are&#xD;
             uncontrolled or whose control may be jeopardized by atiprimod treatment.&#xD;

             of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, places the subject at&#xD;
             unacceptable risk if he/she were to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. As atiprimod is a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6, the use of drugs that are substrates of&#xD;
             CYP2D6 (e.g. beta blockers, antidepressants, and antipsychotic;) will not be allowed&#xD;
             while on study.&#xD;
