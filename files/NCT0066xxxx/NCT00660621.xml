    <description>Between 14 and 28 days after surgery, all subjects will begin a standard course of post-operative limited field radiation therapy to the tumor site and a surrounding margin with concomitant temozolomide at a daily dose of 75 mg/m2 (7 days/week).&#xD;
No later than 45 days after date of completion of radiation therapy, all subjects will begin dose dense temozolomide at dose of 150 mg/m2 on Days 1-7 and 15-21 of a 28 day cycle with concomitant bevacizumab 10mg/kg administered intravenously every other week.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have radiographic evidence on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             of a single, contrast-enhancing unilateral supratentorial cerebral tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery is recommended within 4 weeks of the baseline MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 60 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed&#xD;
             consent prior to any non-standard of care study procedure or no later than the start&#xD;
             of dose dense temozolomide and bevacizumab..&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have a pathological diagnosis of a high grade (IV) malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects, both men and women, must be willing to avoid pregnancy for up to 2 years&#xD;
             after wafer implantation surgery and be counseled regarding the unknown, and&#xD;
             potentially harmful, risks to the embryo or fetus from participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have had prior cytoreductive surgery for high-grade glioma. Subjects who&#xD;
             have had a diagnostic stereotactic biopsy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with more than one focus of tumor or tumor crossing the midline as assessed&#xD;
             by coronal cranial MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant significant life-threatening disease from which the subject could&#xD;
             reasonably be expected to die within the first 12 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity reactions to temozolomide, nitrosoureas or any other components&#xD;
             of the Gliadel® wafer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior CNS radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have received any prior chemotherapy for this malignant glioma prior to&#xD;
             the baseline evaluation or subjects who are currently being treated with&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with fewer than 100,000 platelets per mm3 or fewer than 3.500 leukocytes per&#xD;
             mm3.&#xD;

             urea nitrogen (BUN) equal to or greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy, or lactating females or females of childbearing potential not using&#xD;

             type of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions which do not permit&#xD;
             adequate medical follow-up and compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inadequately controlled hypertension (blood pressure systolic &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic&#xD;
             &gt; 100 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;

             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of bleeding, diathesis, or coagulopathy. Chronic full-dose anticoagulation&#xD;
             with warfarin is not permitted though subjects may be on low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
