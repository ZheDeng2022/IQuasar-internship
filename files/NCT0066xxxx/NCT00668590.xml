  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mounting evidence documents the positive impact of using patient decision aids (PtDA) to&#xD;
      facilitate shared decision-making (SDM) between patients and physicians in preference&#xD;
      sensitive contexts. But overall use of PtDAs across the broader US healthcare system remains&#xD;
      low. More compelling evidence is needed to make the case for policies that would accelerate&#xD;
      adoption of PtDAs in routine clinical practice in primary care settings that serve diverse&#xD;
      and economically disadvantaged populations. The investigators believe that it is now time to&#xD;
      move beyond the subjective evaluations of PtDAs that are commonly reported in clinical trials&#xD;
      of PtDAs, to evaluate whether these tools can also change health behavior and improve health&#xD;
      outcomes. Therefore, the investigators will build on their expertise in working with&#xD;
      community-based physicians to evaluate a newly developed PtDA focused on diabetes, using a&#xD;
      mixed-methods approach. The investigators patient sample will be drawn from primary care&#xD;
      practices serving African American, Latino and Caucasian patients. The investigators will&#xD;
      conduct a 2-group randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of the diabetes PtDA,&#xD;
      combined with telephone coaching, in increasing patient self-care and self-efficacy,&#xD;
      increasing diabetes knowledge and improving clinical measures including glycosylated&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c, lipids and blood pressure. The investigators will also explore variation in&#xD;
      effects of the patient decision aid, comparing African American, Latino and Caucasian&#xD;
      patients and conduct in-depth interviews with a randomly selected subset of trial&#xD;
      participants to explore patient perceptions of the decision aid and variation across&#xD;
      racial/ethnic groups. The investigators hypothesize that, compared to the control condition,&#xD;
      participants assigned to receiving the video PtDA program and telephone coaching will report:&#xD;
      greater self-efficacy and diabetes knowledge, more engagement in self-care behaviors, better&#xD;
      glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c, as well as lower quantitative LDL and blood&#xD;
      pressure levels. The conceptual model guiding the investigators trial is the Integrative&#xD;
      Model of Behavior Change. The model includes three primary determinants of behavior:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. attitudes toward performing the behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. perceived social norms about performing the behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. self-efficacy. The investigators expect the diabetes PtDA to affect each of these&#xD;
           constructs directly or indirectly.&#xD;
