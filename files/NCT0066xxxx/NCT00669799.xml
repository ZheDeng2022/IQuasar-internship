  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic rhinosinusitis is a pervasive and costly disease. Recent estimates describe over 20&#xD;
      million Americans suffering from this diagnosis at a cost of over $4.3 billion per year.&#xD;
      Primary intervention consists of oral antibiotics and nasal steroid sprays. A role for&#xD;
      antifungal irrigation has also been proposed. Topical antibiotics are used by some&#xD;
      physicians, but there are few reports in the published literature describing their use and&#xD;
      establishing or refuting their efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sykes in 1986 performed a randomized, prospective, double-blinded study with 50 patients&#xD;
      using topical nasal sprays with dexamethasone, tramazoline, and neomycin; dexamethasone and&#xD;
      tramazoline without antimicrobial; and placebo. Both of the treatment groups showed&#xD;
      improvement over placebo, but in those groups there was no significant difference in response&#xD;
      rates between those patients receiving neomycin and those who did not. There were no adverse&#xD;
      events reported. In the same year, Cuenant et al. reported success with neomycin-tixocortol&#xD;
      irrigations in the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scheinberg and Otsuji and Vaughn and Carvalho describe their use of various nebulized&#xD;
      antimicrobials (including aminoglycosides) in patients with recurrent sinusitis. Both are&#xD;
      uncontrolled, retrospective studies showing improvement in symptom scores. Neither study&#xD;
      reported any major side effects. Leonard and Bolger describe a case report and review their&#xD;
      success with the use of topical Ceftazidime in 50 patients. Only one patient reported&#xD;
      stinging sensation during administration. They reported no problems with antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies by Davidson et al. , and Moss and King describe the use of topical antibiotics for&#xD;
      sinusitis in patients with cystic fibrosis. They report improvement in sinusitis symptoms and&#xD;
      reduction of need for revision sinus surgery in patients treated with surgery followed by&#xD;
      topical intranasal tobramycin. They report no significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dudley described the use of topical gentamicin in a case report of a patient with atrophic&#xD;
      rhinitis. The patient had resolution of her complaints without any adverse symptoms. He also&#xD;
      describes a study by Thornell showing success with streptomycin nasal sprays and reports work&#xD;
      by Rubinstein demonstrating safe administration of gentamicin into the nose without&#xD;
      absorption by the nasal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On balance, the literature describes topical antibiotics as a safe, but variably efficacious&#xD;
      treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. There is a paucity of prospective, randomized, blinded,&#xD;
      and controlled studies. The purpose of this protocol is to describe a scientifically rigorous&#xD;
      study of the use of broad spectrum antibiotic nasal sprays for chronic sinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population for this study will consist of patients who have a history of multiple&#xD;
      sinus infections each year that require treatment with antibiotics. The patients in this&#xD;
      study will have had recurrent infections despite prior medical and surgical intervention.&#xD;
      They will fulfill the criteria for chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will include conventional treatment with oral antibiotics and a topical nasal&#xD;
      steroid. In addition, patients will be randomized to receive either topical antibiotics or a&#xD;
      vehicle placebo. The study will follow patients for a three month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for improvement in radiographic findings and quality of life when&#xD;
      compared to a randomized and double-blinded placebo group. The patient population identified&#xD;
      for inclusion in this study will also be evaluated for allergy and humoral and innate&#xD;
      immunodeficiency. Nasal lavage will be obtained from the study population and pre and&#xD;
      post-treatment comparisons will be performed.&#xD;

&#xD;
        In addition to use of the study drug or a vehicle-controlled placebo, the patient will be&#xD;

        sprays each naris QD will be substituted for patients with allergy or adverse reaction to&#xD;
        Flonase. Augmentin 875mg PO BID will be given for 21 days beginning on the first day of the&#xD;
        study period. Levaquin 500mg PO QD will be substituted for patients with allergy or adverse&#xD;
        reaction to Augmentin. The patient will not use any adjunctive therapies such as oral or&#xD;
        topical decongestants or antihistamines during the course of the study. No sinus or nasal&#xD;
        surgery is planned during the course of the study. Patients who require additional&#xD;
        treatment including surgery will be withdrawn from the study and considered treatment&#xD;
        failures.&#xD;
