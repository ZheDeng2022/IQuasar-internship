  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is about Prostate Health Cocktail, a combination supplement that contains vitamin&#xD;
      D3, vitamin E, selenium, green tea extract, saw palmetto, lycopene, and soy derivatives. This&#xD;
      product is currently available on the market, as herb and vitamin supplements are not&#xD;
      regulated by the FDA. Each ingredient has been studied in prostate cancer cells and/or in&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer. At the doses included in this supplement, no serious side&#xD;
      effects have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to find out whether Prostate Health Cocktail can lower your PSA.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will be looking to see whether taking this treatment causes any unexpected&#xD;
      side effects, and whether certain blood tests can inform us about your disease status in&#xD;
      addition to your PSA&#xD;

      Objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the PSA response in prostate cancer patients who have a PSA-only disease&#xD;
           recurrence after curative local therapy, during treatment with a combination herbal&#xD;
           supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To qualitatively and quantitatively describe the toxicity profile of this herbal&#xD;
           supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess changes in PSA doubling time for subjects treated with this supplement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure tissue GRP78, serum neuroendocrine markers, and circulating tumor cells, for&#xD;
           correlation with treatment response and prostate cancer outcomes&#xD;
