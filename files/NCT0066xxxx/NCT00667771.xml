    <textblock>
      This study will determine whether naltrexone, a medicine used to treat alcoholism, can lessen&#xD;
      the craving for alcohol during alcohol withdrawal and examine how the drug affects brain&#xD;
      activity during alcohol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People between 21 and 50 years of age who are right-handed, alcohol-dependent, and have at&#xD;
      least one family member with a history of alcoholism, may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are admitted to the NIH Clinical Center for 1 month for the following&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history, alcohol-use history and family history of alcoholism&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination, psychological tests and blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medicine to lessen alcohol withdrawal symptoms, if necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 1-7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol detoxification&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and psychological evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assignment to naltrexone or placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 7 through 28&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug treatment: Take naltrexone or placebo capsule every morning&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional alcohol-dependence treatment: Cognitive and behavioral therapies and&#xD;
           participation in self-help groups, such as Alcoholics Anonymous&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weekly questionnaires to measure mood and desire for alcohol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol craving stimulation test (day 7): Subjects handle and sniff water and then their&#xD;
           favorite alcoholic beverage. They then rate their urge to drink alcohol and their level&#xD;
           of anxiety and their heart rate is measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Alcohol infusion test (day 9): Subjects have an MRI scan during infusion through a vein&#xD;
           of saline (salt water), followed by infusion of alcohol. For this test, a catheter&#xD;
           (plastic tube) is placed in a vein in each arm, one for administering the saline and&#xD;
           then alcohol; the other for drawing blood samples to measure blood alcohol level and&#xD;
           body chemistries. Before, during and after the infusion, subjects are asked to respond&#xD;
           to questions about their feelings, cravings and mood changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are asked to participate in a 3-month outpatient assessment program involving five&#xD;
      outpatient visits (at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after discharge). At each visit, they fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires and to take a breathalyzer test and blood and urine tests for drugs. They may&#xD;
      continue naltrexone therapy and weekly group therapy sessions during this time. Subjects who&#xD;
      do not participate in the assessment program are contacted at home by phone once a week for 1&#xD;
      month and then every other week for the next 2 months to monitor alcohol abstinence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Alcoholism is a chronic, progressive, brain disorder with a profound impact on individuals'&#xD;
      lives and economic cost to society. The positive reinforcing effect of alcohol is a key&#xD;
      element in the transitional development from alcohol intake to alcohol addiction. Findings&#xD;
      from animal and human studies indicate that the rewarding properties of ethanol arise in part&#xD;
      from a complex interaction between alcohol, endogenous opioids, and dopamine (DA) systems.&#xD;
      Acute administration of ethanol increases the release of opioid peptides, which in turn,&#xD;
      increases the release of DA in the mesocorticolimbic system. Naltrexone (NTX), an opioid&#xD;
      receptor antagonist, has been studied widely in both preclinical and clinical research for&#xD;
      the treatment of alcoholism. Numerous clinical studies have shown that short-term use of NTX&#xD;
      on alcohol-dependent patients effectively prevents relapse and reduces the level of craving.&#xD;
      Genetic studies have suggested that individuals with mu-opioid receptors (OPRMs) encoded by&#xD;
      the 118G gain-of function variant allele experience a greater therapeutic response to NTX.&#xD;
      There are no data utilizing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to study the effect&#xD;
      of NTX on brain activity during an intravenous (IV) infusion of ethanol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect of NTX on the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response in the ventral&#xD;
      striatum area of the brain in response to an ethanol infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study the effect of NTX on cue reactivity (CR) to alcohol-associated cues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alcohol-dependent patients between the ages of 21-50 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete a screening telephone interview before coming to the NIAAA&#xD;
      Inpatient Unit. The interviewer will inform eligible participants about the requirements and&#xD;
      procedures associated with current protocols. Following admission to NIAAA Inpatient Unit,&#xD;
      all participants will be enrolled in the Assessment and Treatment of People with Alcohol&#xD;
      Drinking Problems protocol (#05-AA-0121). Protocol 05-AA-0121 will allow us to evaluate each&#xD;
      participant's general medical and psychiatric conditions and provide standard of care for&#xD;
      treatment seeking alcoholics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants, who fulfill the specific requirements of the NTX protocol, will be thoroughly&#xD;
      informed about the nature of the study before obtaining an informed consent. Consented&#xD;
      participants will be randomized, using a double-blind design, to receive either 50 mg of NTX&#xD;
      per day or placebo. Medications will be administered at 8:00 AM on a daily basis by the&#xD;
      nursing staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the challenge procedures (CR on Day 7 and fMRI/ethanol infusion on Day 9), a&#xD;
      clinical nurse specialist who is not involved with the protocol will re-consent each&#xD;
      participant when they are not in acute withdrawal. The re-consenting process will provide&#xD;
      reassurance that participants understand the requirements and implications associated with&#xD;
      participation in the CR and fMRI/ethanol infusion procedures. Individuals who elect not to&#xD;
      participate in the CR and fMRI/ethanol infusion sessions will be discharged from the&#xD;
      in-patient unit and encouraged to continue treatment in the NIAAA Outpatient Clinic for the&#xD;
      next three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who elect to remain in the study will take part in the CR session on Day 7 and&#xD;
      fMRI/ethanol infusion session on Day 9 (procedures are described on Page 13 under study&#xD;
      procedures). Following the fMRI/ethanol infusion session, participants will remain in the&#xD;
      hospital for approximately three weeks to monitor their craving and take part in our&#xD;
      inpatient treatment program for alcoholism. During the post-challenge hospitalization, all&#xD;
      participants will be offered 50 mg of NTX once a day. Following discharge from the hospital,&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to continue treatment in NIAAA Outpatient Clinic for three&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOLD response during the ethanol infusion challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOLD brain response to emotional facial stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-reported Alcohol Urge Questionnaires (AUQ), Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS), Obsessive&#xD;
      Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) and Profile of Mood Status (POMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormonal responses to the ethanol challenge: plasma ACTH, cortisol, and beta-endorphin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjective responses to the ethanol challenge as rated by stimulation, sedation, high, and&#xD;
      intoxication questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cue-induced craving during the CR session.&#xD;
