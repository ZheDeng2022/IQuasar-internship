  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of migraine continues to be a major health problem today, despite many new&#xD;
      pharmacological therapies. Limited clinical experience suggests that craniosacral therapy&#xD;
      (CST) may be effective in the treatment of headache, including migraine. The primary aim of&#xD;
      this proposal is to gather quality preliminary data on the usefulness of CST as an adjunct to&#xD;
      conventional care for patients with migraine and to determine the feasibility of a larger,&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of CST in patients with migraine. Craniosacral therapists use a&#xD;
      technique of gentle palpation of the head, neck and spine to release restrictions in cranial&#xD;
      and peri-spinal tissues that are believed to contribute to a variety of health problems&#xD;
      including headache. It is estimated that more than 2 million visits to CST practitioners are&#xD;
      made each year, with more than 10 per cent of those for the complaint of headache. There has&#xD;
      been no rigorous research examining the usefulness of CST for patients with migraine despite&#xD;
      the impression of beneficial effects. Our limited preliminary data show significant,&#xD;
      sustained benefit of CST in a small group of patients with migraine. The First Specific Aim&#xD;
      is to determine the feasibility of developing a clinical trial comparing craniosacral therapy&#xD;
      versus low-strength static magnets (attention-control complementary therapy) as a treatment&#xD;
      for preventing migraine headaches. Patients with migraine, with or without aura, under care&#xD;
      of a neurologist will be studied. After an 8-week baseline period, they will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of two groups: 1) usual medical care plus 8 weeks of CST; or 2) usual medical care plus 8&#xD;
      weeks of attention-control complementary treatment. Primary outcome measures will include: 1)&#xD;
      headache-related quality of life, 2) headache frequency, and 3) perceived benefit in those&#xD;
      receiving treatment. The Second Specific Aim is to identify relevant secondary outcomes&#xD;
      associated with usual care plus adjunctive craniosacral therapy for migraine. Data collection&#xD;
      will include demographics, headache intensity and duration, health status, headache-related&#xD;
      disability, health care utilization, and medication use. The Third Specific Aim is to&#xD;
      identify and find solutions for potential problems in conducting a larger clinical trial to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of CST for the prevention of migraine. Patients will be recruited from&#xD;
      the University of North Carolina Headache Clinic and from local neurological practices.&#xD;
      Duration of the study for each subject is 16 weeks. Length of the entire project is 2 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible subjects will be 12 years of age and above, either gender, meeting the 2004&#xD;
             International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) criteria for migraine with&#xD;
             or without aura, with a frequency of 5 to 14 per month and a headache history of more&#xD;
             than two years. Patients must be under the care of one of the physicians participating&#xD;
             in the study. Patients with chronic daily headache (more than 15 headache days per&#xD;
             month) will be included only if they also have between 5 and 14 migraine headaches per&#xD;
             month that can be clearly differentiated from chronic daily headache. Subjects or&#xD;
             their caregivers must be willing and able to document headache characteristics and use&#xD;
             of medications, as well as complete the assessment instruments. They must be able to&#xD;
             come in for 8 weekly CST or LSSM interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             psychosis requiring more than two psychotropic medications daily and/or more than two&#xD;
             visits a month to a mental health care provider; those undergoing current treatment&#xD;
             for a major medical illness such as malignancy, autoimmune or immune deficiency&#xD;
