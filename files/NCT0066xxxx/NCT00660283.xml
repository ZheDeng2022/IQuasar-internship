        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects, men and women, must be between ages 18 and 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must have radiographic evidence on cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             of a single, contrast-enhancing unilateral supratentorial cerebral tumor (see Section&#xD;
             8.4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3 Surgery is recommended within 4 weeks of the baseline MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Score of 60 or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Subjects must have signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent&#xD;
        prior to any non-standard of care study procedure or no later than the start of dose dense&#xD;
        temozolomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Subjects must have a pathological diagnosis of a high grade (IV) malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Subjects, both men and women, must be willing to avoid pregnancy for up to 2 years after&#xD;
        wafer implantation surgery and be counseled regarding the unknown, and potentially harmful,&#xD;
        risks to the embryo or fetus from participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects who have had prior cytoreductive surgery for high-grade glioma. Subjects who&#xD;
             have had a diagnostic stereotactic biopsy are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with more than one focus of tumor or tumor crossing the midline as assessed&#xD;
             by coronal cranial MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concomitant significant life-threatening disease from which the subject could&#xD;
             reasonably be expected to die within the first 12 months of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known hypersensitivity reactions to temozolomide, nitrosoureas or any other components&#xD;
             of the Gliadel® wafer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Prior CNS radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have received any prior chemotherapy for this malignant glioma prior to&#xD;
             the baseline evaluation or subjects who are currently being treated with&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with fewer than 100,000 platelets per mm3 or fewer than 3.500 leukocytes per&#xD;
             mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Liver function tests greater than or equal to 2.5 times the upper limit of normal&#xD;
             (transaminases (SGOT, SGPT), total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Serum creatinine equal to or greater than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, blood&#xD;
             urea nitrogen (BUN) equal to or greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnancy, or lactating females or females of childbearing potential not using&#xD;
             adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participation in any other investigational protocol in the prior twelve months for any&#xD;
             type of malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions which do not permit&#xD;
             adequate medical follow-up and compliance with the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Inadequately controlled hypertension (blood pressure systolic &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic&#xD;
             &gt; 100 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Unstable angina or history of myocardial infarction within six months prior to&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Evidence of bleeding, diathesis, or coagulopathy. Chronic full-dose anticoagulation&#xD;
             with warfarin is not permitted though subjects may be on low molecular weight heparin&#xD;
             or fondaparinux.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture.&#xD;
