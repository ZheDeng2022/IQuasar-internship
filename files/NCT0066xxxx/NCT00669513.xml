      Background: Sleep curtailment is common and is associated with increased mortality due to&#xD;
      cardiovascular causes. However, the mechanisms are not completely understood.We hypothesized&#xD;
      that partial sleep deprivation caused however significant changes in sympathetic activity and&#xD;
      endothelial function in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Thirteen young healthy male volunteers will be monitored during 12 days by sleep&#xD;
      diary and wrist actigraphy. The subjects will keep under their usual daily activities and&#xD;
      randomized to 5 nights of prolonged sleep (control) or partial sleep deprivation, interposed&#xD;
      by 2 nights of unrestricted sleep (wash out). At the end of each period, the subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluate by: 1. electrocardiogram and beat-to-beat blood pressure with spectral analysis of&#xD;
      heart rate and blood pressure in the supine position and after head up tilt test maneuver; 2.&#xD;
      resting plasma norepinephrine; 3. venous endothelial function (dorsal hand vein technique).&#xD;

      Volunteers Healthy young male volunteers from the urban area of Sao Paulo city will be&#xD;
      recruited to the study. All subjects will be clinically evaluated, including measurements of&#xD;
      weight and height. Exclusion criteria include age less than 21 and more than 45 years, body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) &gt;25 kg/m2, smoking, use of chronic medications and any established medical&#xD;
      condition including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, heart diseases and sleep&#xD;
      disordered breathing. After obtaining written informed consent, all participants will be&#xD;
      submitted to overnight polysomnography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polysomnography Overnight polysomnography will be performed to discarded sleep breathing&#xD;
      using a digital system (17 channels, EMBLA Medicare - Flaga hf. Medical Devices). All&#xD;
      polysomnograms will be performed and scored based on the guidelines for sleep studies. The&#xD;
      apnea-hypopnoea index (AHI) was defined by the number of apneas and hypopnoeas per hour of&#xD;
      sleep. Sleep disordered breathing was defined by an AHI above 5 events/hour, according to&#xD;
      standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sleep Monitoring During the study period all subjects will be continuously monitored by a&#xD;
      sleep diary and wrist actigraphy (Basic Mini Motionlogger Actigraph Ambulatory Monitoring,&#xD;
      Inc., Ardsley , New York, USA ) worn on the non-dominant hand. The actigraph will set to&#xD;
      sample movements in 1 min periods. Actigraph records will automatically process by use of the&#xD;
      AW2 software version 2.3.01 program (Ambulatory Monitoring, Inc.) to extract information on&#xD;
      sleep duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples Venous blood will be collected from all participants between 8 and 10 AM for&#xD;
      the measurement of glucose, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein, and red blood cell count. Plasma catecholamine (norepinephrine) will be measured&#xD;
      by High-Performance Liquid Chromatography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic and autonomic measurements Hemodynamic and autonomic evaluations will be&#xD;
      performed in the morning between 8 and 10 AM. The intervals between adjacent QRS complexes&#xD;
      resulting from sinus node depolarization will be determined (RR intervals). Heart rate will&#xD;
      be calculated by expressing RR intervals as beats per minute. Non-invasive beat-to-beat blood&#xD;
      pressure (Finometer, Finapres Medical System BV, Holland) and electrocardiogram (ECG) will be&#xD;
      continuously recorded by the software AT/MCA-CODAS (DATAC Instruments Inc., Akron, Ohio,&#xD;
      EUA). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz per channel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic measurements will be derived from spectral analysis of HR and systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SBP). For frequency domain analysis, power spectral density will be obtained by the&#xD;
      Fast Fourier Transformation using the Welch's method over 16,384 points with a Hanning window&#xD;
      (512) and 50% overlapping. Spectral power for low- (LF 0.04-0.15 Hz), and high- (HF 0.15-0.4&#xD;
      Hz) frequency bands will be calculated by means of power spectrum density integration within&#xD;
      each frequency bandwidth, using a customized routine (MATLAB 6.0, Mathworks). LF/HF ratio&#xD;
      will be also calculated to evaluate the sympathovagal balance. In addition, we will also&#xD;
      evaluated the power spectral analysis of SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements will be evaluated while awake in supine position (5 minutes) and&#xD;
      subsequently during head up tilt test maneuver (60 degree inclination, 5 minutes). The&#xD;
      results of tilt test will be expressed as the change between rest and head up tilt .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endothelial function Venous endothelial function will be measured by Dorsal Hand Vein&#xD;
      technique, previously described by Aellig.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, a 23-gauge butterfly needle will be inserted into a suitable vein on the back of the&#xD;
      hand, with the arm positioned at an upward angle of 30 to allow the complete emptying of&#xD;
      veins. A tripod, holding a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) (Shaevitz&#xD;
      Engineering, Pennsuaken, NJ), will be mounted on the back of the hand with the central&#xD;
      aperture of the LVDT, containing a movable metal core, at a distance of 10 mm downstream from&#xD;
      the dip of the needle. The signal output of the LVDT, which will be linearly proportional to&#xD;
      the vertical movement of the core, give a measure of the diameter of the vein. Readings will&#xD;
      be taken under a congestive pressure of 40 mm Hg by inflating a blood pressure cuff placed on&#xD;
      the upper portion of the arm under study. Results will be presented as normalized&#xD;
      dose-response curves in which the diameter of the vein during saline infusion will be defined&#xD;
      as 100% dilatation. The vein will be preconstricted to 20% of the baseline size by infusing&#xD;
      increasing doses of phenylephrine, a selective A-adrenergic receptor agonist (25-3166&#xD;
      ng/min). The infusion rate of phenylephrine inducing 80% venoconstriction will be kept&#xD;
      constant during the entire study, rate, and this degree of constriction will be defined as 0%&#xD;
      dilatation for the purpose of subsequent calculations. The vasodilator response expressed in&#xD;
      this study will be calculated as a percentage of the range between 0 and 100% dilatation.&#xD;
      Drugs will be infused using a Harvard infusion pump (Harvard Apparatus, South Natick, MA) at&#xD;
      a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. After preconstriction of the vein by using phenylephrine, a&#xD;
      dose-response curve of acetylcholine (0.36-3600 ng/min) and sodium nitroprusside (50-1000&#xD;
      ng/min) will be constructed with 6 and 2 infusion doses, respectively. Systolic and diastolic&#xD;
      BP will be determined before and after each experimental phase with a mercury&#xD;
      sphygmomanometer, and heart rate will be measured by the pulse at the radial artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design The entire study period will be of 12 nights. Using a cross over design&#xD;
      the subjects will keep under their usual daily activities and randomized to 5 nights of&#xD;
      control sleep or partial sleep deprivation, interposed by 2 nights of wash out (unrestricted&#xD;
      sleep). During control period, subjects will be instructed to sleep 8 hours, ranging from a&#xD;
      minimal of 7 hours and a maximum of 9 hours and 30 minutes. Partial sleep deprivation will&#xD;
      consist of a target sleep between of less than 5 hours, but no less than 3 hours and 30&#xD;
      minutes. Subjects who will not comply with the sleep schedule will be excluded from the final&#xD;
      analysis. All measurements described above will be made at the end of control and partial&#xD;
      sleep deprivation periods.&#xD;
