    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine the safety, maximum tolerated dose,dose limiting toxicity&#xD;
      of Terameprocol(EM-1421)and determine the pharmacokinetics (clearance from the blood)of&#xD;
      Terameprocol(EM-1421)given as intravenous infusion three times a week in patients with&#xD;
      leukemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dose of Terameprocol (EM-1421) will be escalated in successive cohorts of 3 patients.&#xD;
      Patients will be entered sequentially on each dose level. If none of the first 3 patients at&#xD;
      a dose level experience first cycle drug related dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), new patients&#xD;
      may be entered at the next higher dose level. If 1 of 3 patients experience first cycle DLT,&#xD;
      up to 3 more patients are started at that same dose level. If 2 or more experience first&#xD;
      cycle DLT, no further patients are started at that dose. The MTD is the highest dose level in&#xD;
      which &lt;2 patients of 6 develop a first cycle DLT. New dose levels may begin accrual only if&#xD;
      all patients at the current dose level have been observed for a minimum of 3 weeks after the&#xD;
      last infusion of Terameprocol (EM-1421). The recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be the MTD&#xD;
      unless significant clinical activity is seen below the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the observation period of 3 weeks, additional accrual to a previously assessed lower&#xD;
      dose level, with no documented DLTs, will be allowed with sponsor approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated three times a week, with at least one day in between infusions, for&#xD;
      two weeks followed by one week of rest. The dose for new cohorts will be escalated from 1000,&#xD;
      to 1500 and 2200 mg or de-escalated to 500 mg if 1000 mg exceeds the MTD. The principal&#xD;
      investigator will consult with the sponsor to determine the appropriate dose level for a new&#xD;
      patient. At the MTD, up to 10 additional patients may be accrued in that dose cohort to&#xD;
      further define the toxicities and response of the agent. If the initial dose level exceeds&#xD;
      the MTD, a fallback dose level of 500 mg will be implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are allowed to be treated with subsequent cycles of Terameprocol (EM-1421) until&#xD;
      disease progression or until severe toxicities occur and side effects do not outweigh the&#xD;
      benefit of study drug administration in the assessment of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intrapatient dose escalation Intrapatient dose escalation by one dose level may be permitted,&#xD;
      but only if at least 3 patients in the next higher dose level have been treated and have been&#xD;
      followed for 21 days without experiencing DLT. Decisions for intrapatient dose escalation&#xD;
      will be made jointly by the Study Sponsor, treating physician and Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terameprocol (EM-1421) as a single agent given intravenously over 6 hours three times a week&#xD;
      for two weeks followed by one week rest (two weeks on, one week off)in the following dose&#xD;
      cohorts starting with 1000 mg dose cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level -1: 500 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level 1: 1000 mg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Level 2: 1500 mg&#xD;
