      This project is a randomized controlled trial of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) compared to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of treatment resistant depression (TRD) in bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. The purpose of the trial is to document the effect size, relative effect size and&#xD;
      adverse effects of ECT in this condition. A specific purpose is to gain more knowledge about&#xD;
      the effect on cognitive function.&#xD;

      This project is a randomized controlled trial of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) compared to&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) in the treatment of treatment resistant depression (TRD) in bipolar&#xD;
      disorder. The purpose of the trial is to document the effect size, relative effect size and&#xD;
      adverse effects of ECT in this condition. A specific purpose is to gain more knowledge about&#xD;
      the effect on cognitive function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a national collaboration project the investigators will compare the antidepressant and&#xD;
      cognitive effects of ECT with the effects of a drug treatment in use for this condition; a&#xD;
      treatment algorithm combining antidepressants, mood stabilizer and antipsychotic drugs. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a neuropsychological test battery to disclose possible ECT induced&#xD;
      changes in cognitive function, and investigate any long-lasting changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, several studies have implemented inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      depression; inflammatory processes will be examined as a function of changes in clinical&#xD;
      status and of treatment modality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a national collaboration, using the Bipolar Research And Innovation Network-&#xD;
      BRAIN, and all the patients are included in the BRAIN-study. The study is funded by Helse&#xD;
      Vest RHF, Regional research network on mood disorders (MoodNet) and Norwegian hospitals.&#xD;
