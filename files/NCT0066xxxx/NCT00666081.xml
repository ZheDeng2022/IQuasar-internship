  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part study in subjects with hematologic malignancies designed to find the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of GSK690693 (Part 1). Part 2 is designed to determine the&#xD;
      efficacy of GSK690693 in a subset of subjects with hematologic malignancies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy that&#xD;
             has relapsed or is refractory after standard therapy, AND that is not associated with&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or solid organ transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed written consent provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A woman is eligible to enter and participate in the study if she is of:&#xD;
             Non-childbearing potential , or is post-menopausal .&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A man with a female partner of childbearing potential is eligible to enter and&#xD;
             participate in the study if he has either had a prior vasectomy or agrees to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (as described above) during the study, and up to 3 months after&#xD;
             last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fasting glucose that is not elevated.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Symptomatic or untreated central nervous system (CNS) involvement by the hematologic&#xD;
             malignancy (including primary CNS lymphoma). Subjects who were previously treated for&#xD;
             CNS involvement, and are asymptomatic without anti-epileptic medications or steroids&#xD;
             for at least 2 months are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who have undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unresolved toxicity from previous anti-cancer therapy as agreed to by Medical Monitor&#xD;
             and the Investigator,.&#xD;

             obtaining informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant ECG abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of medications known to prolong the QTc interval within 14 days (or 5 half-lives)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction, acute coronary syndromes, unstable angina or&#xD;
             coronary angioplasty/stenting/bypass grafting within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 50% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or&#xD;
             multiple gated acquisition (MUGA) scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of theophylline within 14 days of the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of warfarin â‰¥4 mg per day; however, low molecular weight heparin and&#xD;
             prophylactic low-dose warfarin are permitted, if PT/PTT &lt; 1.2 x ULN.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent condition that in the Investigator's opinion would jeopardize the subject's&#xD;
             ability to comply with the protocol.&#xD;
