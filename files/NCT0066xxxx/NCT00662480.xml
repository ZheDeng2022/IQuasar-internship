  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Well-documented health benefits may be achieved through prophylactic screening for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The advantages are fewer premature deaths and a reduction in the&#xD;
      number of hospital admissions and amputations. Furthermore, hospitals will benefit from the&#xD;
      derived reduction in the pressure on surgery and intensive care capacities at vascular&#xD;
      surgery departments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore seems extremely relevant to offer joint screening for abdominal aortic aneurysm,&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease and hypertension, even if the benefit and costs of such a measure&#xD;
      are not currently known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consequently, the primary objective of the study is to establish the effect and&#xD;
      cost-efficiency of a joint circulation screening programme for 40,000 men aged 65-74 years in&#xD;
      a randomised, clinically controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project manager will train six nurses to measure ABI and perform ultrasound scans of the&#xD;
      aorta. The nurses form three teams which will each be equipped with a portable Doppler, blood&#xD;
      pressure cuff and portable ultrasound scanner. Each team will operate from the hospitals in&#xD;
      the Region. Civil registration number (in Danish: CPR), name and address information will be&#xD;
      supplied by the Clinical Epidemiological Department (CED), which will also perform the&#xD;
      randomisation in groups of approx. 1,000 to avoid too long a period from data extraction to&#xD;
      invitation. Half of the randomised subjects will be invited to participate in a circulation&#xD;
      examination focused on PAD, AAA and hypertension, while the other half will be controls Men&#xD;
      with positive findings are informed and proper preventive actions is taken. Annual controls&#xD;
      are offered, and AAA exceeding 5.5 cm in diameter is offered operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficiency variables are death, cardiovascular death and AAA-death. The secondary&#xD;
      efficiency variables are hospital services related to cardiovascular conditions and costs for&#xD;
      such services in accordance with current DRG rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The entire population, the controls as well as the screening group, will be monitored for a&#xD;
      period of 10 years. Information concerning deaths, including date of death, is obtained from&#xD;
      the Civil Registration System, information on visits to outpatient clinics and hospital&#xD;
      admissions caused by cardiovascular conditions including amputations is obtained from the&#xD;
      National Patient Registry. From the Danish Causes of Death Registry information on cause of&#xD;
      death is collected. The information is classified with regards to cause; AAA or&#xD;
      cardiovascular. The cardiovascular interventions are identified in the vascular surgery&#xD;
      database (Karbasen). Major follow-up is performed at 3, 5 and 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A steering and data validation group will be formed including the project manager and a&#xD;
      representative from the Clinical Epidemiology Department. Furthermore, a vascular surgeon&#xD;
      from each of the two affected departments in the region will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total mortality, cardiovascular and AAA-related mortality and initial cardiovascular hospital&#xD;
      service are compared for the two groups using Cox proportional hazards-regression analysis&#xD;
      which facilitates description of the risk ratio. The cost-efficiency calculation will be&#xD;
      adjusted for quality of life.&#xD;
