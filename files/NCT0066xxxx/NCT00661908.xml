  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic subjects often report of problems at the workplace or when contracting insurances&#xD;
      because of their diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By distributing a self-report questionnaire to insulin-treated Type 1 and Type 2 diabetic&#xD;
      subjects we wanted to analyse the frequency of work- and insurance-related discrimination.&#xD;
      Furthermore we wanted to detect socio-demographic and diabetes-related factors which are&#xD;
      associated with increased discrimination at workplace and by insurances. We hypothesized that&#xD;
      diabetes-related discrimination at workplace and by insurances exists and that certain&#xD;
      factors like having severe hypoglycaemic events, being type 1 diabetic or being overweight&#xD;
      would be associated with more problems at work or with insurances.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our self report questionnaire included 83 items to assess treatment goals, quality of life&#xD;
      and discrimination at workplace or by insurances. 636 questionnaires were distributed and&#xD;
      were answered and returned. Anonymity was ensured. Patients were recruited from the diabetes&#xD;
      outpatient clinic of the University of Basel Hospital, 5 regional hospitals, specialist&#xD;
      practices and general practitioner practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to investigate the prevalence of discrimination at workplace and&#xD;
      by insurances due to diabetes mellitus. Furthermore we want analyse if socio-demographic&#xD;
      factors (age,gender,origin) show an impact on diabetes-related discrimination at workplace&#xD;
      and by insurances. We hypothesize furthermore that certain diabetes-related factors like&#xD;
      having severe hypoglycemias, being type 1 diabetic, having diabetic complications or being&#xD;
      overweight/obese is associated with more problems at work and with insurances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analysed by a multiple ordinal regression analysis. We will correct data for&#xD;
      age, gender, employment status and diabetes type.&#xD;

        Within a time period of two month we recruited all insulin-treated diabetic patients from&#xD;

        hospitals (n=135) in the North-western part of Switzerland and from 13 specialist practices&#xD;
        (n=107) as well as from 15 randomly selected general practioner practices (n=64)in the&#xD;
