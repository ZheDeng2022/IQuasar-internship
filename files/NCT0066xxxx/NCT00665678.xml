      Background: Innovation: Over 150,000 soldiers are currently deployed in Iraq as part of&#xD;
      Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), and 12% of returning OIF veterans have posttraumatic stress&#xD;
      disorder (PTSD). Research from our group and others showed lasting neurobiological&#xD;
      consequences of PTSD, including increased amygdala function and decreased medial prefrontal&#xD;
      function, verbal declarative memory problems, and smaller hippocampal volume that reverses&#xD;
      with treatment with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine or the anticonvulsant&#xD;
      phenytoin. Recently we found that three months of treatment with paroxetine in PTSD patients&#xD;
      resulted in an increase in hippocampal N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), a marker of neuronal&#xD;
      integrity, as well as decreased brain metabolism in the amygdala and a reversal or stress&#xD;
      induced decreases in medial prefrontal function. Subjects treated with placebo did not have&#xD;
      an increase in NAA, however subsequent treatment for three months with open label paroxetine&#xD;
      resulted in an increase in NAA to the level seen in the subjects treated with paroxetine in&#xD;
      the double-blind phase. Paroxetine was associated with a decrease in amygdala metabolism&#xD;
      measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and increased medial prefrontal function.&#xD;
      Intervening soon after the trauma is critical for long-term outcomes, since with time&#xD;
      traumatic memories become indelible and resistant to treatment. Diminished efficacy of&#xD;
      treatment over time is shown by the fact that trials of Vietnam veterans have shown less&#xD;
      efficacy over the years. Animal studies show that pretreatment before stress with&#xD;
      antidepressants reduces chronic behavioral deficits related to stress; although for ethical&#xD;
      and other reasons no studies have provided pretreatment before trauma exposure in humans. In&#xD;
      our current VA Merit funded program we are looking at the effects of early interventions for&#xD;
      Iraq soldiers with paroxetine, looking at chronicity of PTSD, cognition, cortisol response to&#xD;
      stress, hippocampal volume and NAA, as outcomes. We now propose to add measurement of neural&#xD;
      correlates of paroxetine response using PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Hypotheses: The objectives of this research are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of paroxetine versus placebo in the treatment of early PTSD in OIF&#xD;
           veterans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the effects of paroxetine versus placebo on amygdala metabolism and medial&#xD;
           prefrontal response to stress in OIF veterans with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the ability of brain imaging to predict treatment response and to identify&#xD;
           veterans with early PTSD who will benefit from early interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses are that paroxetine will be associated with: 1) an improvement in PTSD symptoms&#xD;
      compared to placebo based on the change in the CAPS from baseline to three months of&#xD;
      treatment in veterans of OIF; 2) increased medial prefrontal function and decreased amygdala&#xD;
      metabolism in veterans of OIF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare paroxetine to placebo in the treatment of early PTSD in OIF veterans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure amygdala metabolism and medial prefrontal response to stress with PET in OIF&#xD;
           veterans with PTSD before and after paroxetine or placebo treatment.&#xD;

      Study Design: Subjects returning from Iraq who meet criteria for early PTSD (N=160) will be&#xD;
      included in the study with a recruitment goal of 144 completers. A group of 80 healthy&#xD;
      subjects with a history of military service during the period of OIF without a history of&#xD;
      deployment and without PTSD and 80 healthy subjects with a history of deployment without PTSD&#xD;
      will serve as comparator groups. All subjects will undergo baseline imaging of the brain with&#xD;
      PET FDG and with measurement of brain blood flow during a memory task and with exposure to&#xD;
      trauma related reminders (slides and sounds) and MRI and baseline psychometric assessments,&#xD;
      following which PTSD subjects will be randomized to receive paroxetine or placebo for three&#xD;
      months, with repeat imaging and assessments. After this PTSD subjects will be treated with&#xD;
      three months of open label paroxetine, followed by a repeat of imaging and assessments. This&#xD;
      will be an intent to treat analysis, therefore all subjects who were randomized and took at&#xD;
      least one dose of study medication will be assessed at three months, regardless of whether&#xD;
      they were able to stay on study medication. This will complement our currently VA Clinical&#xD;
      Trial Merit funded application to measure hippocampal volume, NAA, and cortisol response to&#xD;
      stress before and after early intervention with paroxetine in returning Iraq vets with early&#xD;
      PTSD.&#xD;
