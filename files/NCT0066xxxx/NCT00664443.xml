      The overall goal of this study is to better understand the factors leading to successful&#xD;
      dispatch-assisted CPR instructions and to ultimately save the lives of more cardiac arrest&#xD;
      patients. Specific objectives are to: 1) Determine the ability of 9-1-1 dispatchers to make&#xD;
      the diagnosis of cardiac arrest over the phone; 2) Quantify the frequency and impact of&#xD;
      perceived agonal breathing on cardiac arrest diagnosis; 3) Measure the frequency with which&#xD;
      dispatch-assisted CPR instructions can be successfully completed in out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest cases; and 4) Measure the impact of dispatch-assisted CPR instructions on bystander&#xD;
      CPR and survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Cardiac arrest is the leading cause of mortality in Canada, and the overall&#xD;
      survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest rarely exceeds 5%. Survivors have a quality&#xD;
      of life similar to the general population. While bystander CPR can increase survival for&#xD;
      cardiac arrest victims up to four times, bystander CPR rates remain low in Canada (15%). Many&#xD;
      Canadian urban communities offer 9-1-1 dispatch-assisted CPR instructions to callers&#xD;
      reporting a victim in cardiac arrest. Some evidence suggests that agonal breathing can be&#xD;
      misinterpreted as a sign of life by Dispatch Officers, resulting in the inappropriate&#xD;
      withholding of dispatch-assisted CPR instructions. Dispatch-assisted CPR instructions are&#xD;
      recommended by the International Guidelines on Emergency Cardiovascular Care, but their&#xD;
      ability to improve cardiac arrest survival remains unclear according to a systematic review&#xD;
      of the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The overall goal of this study is to better understand the factors leading to&#xD;
      successful dispatch-assisted CPR instructions and to ultimately save more lives of cardiac&#xD;
      arrest patients. Specific objectives are to: 1) Determine the ability of 9-1-1 dispatchers to&#xD;
      make the diagnosis of cardiac arrest over the phone; 2) Quantify the frequency and impact of&#xD;
      perceived agonal breathing on cardiac arrest diagnosis; 3) Measure the frequency with which&#xD;
      dispatch-assisted CPR instructions can be successfully completed in out-of-hospital cardiac&#xD;
      arrest cases; and 4) Measure the impact of dispatch-assisted CPR instructions on bystander&#xD;
      CPR and survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: We will conduct a before-after, prospective cohort study that evaluates 9-1-1 call&#xD;
      reporting for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims. The study will take place in 19 urban&#xD;
      communities in Ontario providing dispatch-assisted CPR instructions since April 1st 2004. The&#xD;
      study population will include all 9-1-1 callers reporting out-of-hospital cardiac arrests for&#xD;
      which resuscitation was attempted in patients 16-years or older. The dispatch center protocol&#xD;
      consists of establishing the nature of the emergency before initiating the appropriate level&#xD;
      of response; this includes asking standardized questions to determine if cardiac arrest is&#xD;
      present. The Dispatch Officer then offers CPR instructions over the telephone while emergency&#xD;
      response vehicles are on their way to the location. Standardized data collection tools will&#xD;
      be used to extract information from: 9-1-1 call recordings, paramedic patient care reports,&#xD;
      base hospital records, fire medical records, and hospital medical records. All participating&#xD;
      centers already combine information from various sources in a cardiac arrest registry. The&#xD;
      following information will be collected: confirmation of cardiac arrest status by the&#xD;
      Dispatch Officer, presence of apparent agonal breathing, CPR instructions offered to the&#xD;
      9-1-1 callers, factors influencing the ability of 9-1-1 callers to perform CPR including&#xD;
      their proximity to the victim's location and their emotional receptiveness to instructions,&#xD;
      the time interval between the call to 9-1-1 and the initiation of CPR by the bystander.&#xD;
      Measurements will include the accuracy of cardiac arrest diagnosis, the frequency of&#xD;
      perceived agonal breathing during cardiac arrest, 9-1-1 caller's ability to receive&#xD;
      instructions and initiate CPR, bystander CPR rates, and survival to hospital discharge. Data&#xD;
      analysis for Objective #1 will include sensitivity, specificity and receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic curve; Objectives #2 and #3 will be analyzed using descriptive statistics; and&#xD;
      for Objective #4 univariate, stepwise logistic regression, and time series analysis will be&#xD;
      performed to control for trends over time and variables otherwise associated with bystander&#xD;
      CPR and survival rates in 6000 arrest victims.&#xD;
