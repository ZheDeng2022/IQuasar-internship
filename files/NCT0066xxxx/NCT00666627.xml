  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to determine if the three licensed bisphosphonates (alendronate, ibandronate and&#xD;
      risedronate):a) affect the peripheral skeleton differently, as assessed by quantitative&#xD;
      ultrasound of bone (QUS), peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) and dual-energy&#xD;
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA)? b) have different effects on bone cells and their activity as&#xD;
      assessed by flow cytometry and biochemical markers of bone cell activity? The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to compare the effects of three licensed bisphosphonates on bone quantity and&#xD;
      quality. There has been no such study before. Most of the measures of bone quantity and&#xD;
      quality used in this protocol have not been studied with any of these three agents. The&#xD;
      novelty of the study necessitates the establishment of reference ranges and this explains the&#xD;
      need for the inclusion of a group of young women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been a number of randomised controlled trials examining the effect of&#xD;
      bisphosphonates on fracture risk. The results of these trials have not been uniform,&#xD;
      especially in relation to non-vertebral fractures. We have proposed that much of the fracture&#xD;
      risk reduction with risedronate can be explained by the reduction in bone resorption markers&#xD;
      (Eastell et al, 2003). Each of these three bisphosphonates reduces bone resorption markers,&#xD;
      and alendronate and ibandronate are at least as effective as risedronate in this regard.&#xD;
      However, there have been few direct comparisons of the different bisphosphonates on surrogate&#xD;
      endpoints such as bone mineral density and bone turnover markers. This raises the question of&#xD;
      whether the bisphosphonates might affect some other aspect of bone strength, such as 'bone&#xD;
      quality'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose the study is to determine whether three licensed bisphosphonates affect the&#xD;
      skeleton differently using a variety of methods (various bone densitometry devices and&#xD;
      ultrasound measurements of the bone) at a variety of bone sites (spine, hip, fingers, heel,&#xD;
      forearm and leg). These changes will be compared to changes in other markers of bone health&#xD;
      such as biochemical markers of bone turnover to help us determine the possible mechanism of&#xD;
      action for the different treatments. The study will last for 48 weeks which should be long&#xD;
      enough to detect signfiicant changes on bone strength as measured by DXA at the spine/hip. As&#xD;
      we are interested in how these changes occur there are more visits in the first three months&#xD;
      of the study than the last 9 months of the study. This is expected to help us detect the&#xD;
      difference between the onset of the effects of the three treatments more clearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study vists will be: screening, baseline 1, baseline 2, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks,&#xD;
      13 weeks (phone calls to participants at 24 and 36 weeks), 48 weeks and 49 weeks. The two&#xD;
      baseline visits will allow duplicate measurements of bone stregth/quality on different&#xD;
      occasions at the start of the study to minimise variability. Treatment will begin at baseline&#xD;
      2 (0 days) and last for 48 weeks. The visits at 13 weeks and 49 weeks are to perform bone&#xD;
      density/quality tests in duplicate to minimise variability as at baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density of various bones (hip/spine/whole body and forearm) will be measured by&#xD;
      DXA on various devices, quantitative ultrasound will be performed at the heel and fingers,&#xD;
      and bone quality will be measured by pQCT at the forearm and tibia/3D analysis of the hip&#xD;
      scans at the baseline visits, at 12 and 13 weeks and at 48 and 49 week visits Surrogate&#xD;
      markers of bone health (biochemical markers of bone turnover) will be measured at baseline,&#xD;
      1, 2 4, 12, 13, 48 and 49 weeks. Exploratory methods included in the protocol include:&#xD;
      Assessing the number of bone breaking down cell numbers (osteoclasts) at baseline, 1 week and&#xD;
      48 weeks Assessing nail brittleness at baseline 12 and 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomised using a stratification method to ensure all groups have an equal&#xD;
      range of bone strength at study entry. Randomisation will be performed by the hospital&#xD;
      pharmacy. The study is not blinded and subjects will know which treatment they are on.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked not to discuss their assigned treatment with staff performing bone&#xD;
      measurements. There is no placebo group in this trial as all subjects will taking one of the&#xD;
      three treatments. We have chosen the active comparator design as many of the measurements&#xD;
      (especially the biochemical and cellular ones) do not change unless treatment is given; also,&#xD;
      these treatments are indicated and effective in this patients group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To generate control data we will recruit a group of 200 healthy young women aged 35-40 years.&#xD;
      The control group will undertake all the measurements of bone strength/quality that the&#xD;
      treatment group will have as well as the biochemical maerkers of bone turnover. There will be&#xD;
      only 2 study visits for the control group,baseline and 48 weeks. This data will serve as&#xD;
      internal controls and as reference ranges for each of the devices used in the study. Ethical&#xD;
      considerations for this study include the use of ionising radiation, blood sampling at each&#xD;
      study visit and the number of study visits. This may be balanced by the close monitoring of&#xD;
      the subject whilst on the study and a thorough assessment of bone health for 49 weeks.&#xD;
      Research participants, patient groups or communities were not involved in the design of this&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that bisphosphonates have varying magnitude of effect on&#xD;
      non-vertebral fractures and this is reflected in different changes in measures of bone&#xD;
      quality (QUS), bone density in the appendicular skeleton (DXA and pQCT) and novel biochemical&#xD;
      markers of bone resorption and osteoclast precursors.&#xD;
