  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The radical treatment for Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is surgery. However, it is only for&#xD;
      10 to 20% of all patients and 10 to 30% of them have relapsed every year after surgery. For&#xD;
      an inoperable case, we can consider Liver transplantation. But there is not enough organ&#xD;
      donor and it is very expensive. In that case, various treatment modalities for HCC (i.e.,&#xD;
      transcatheter arterial embolization [TAE] and percutaneous ethanol injection [PEI],&#xD;
      radiofrequency ablation etc.) have become clinically available. In addition, after these&#xD;
      treatment, radiation therapy can be conducted as a combined treatment. If it is difficult,&#xD;
      radiation therapy can be conducted alone. In this case, radiation therapy can use&#xD;
      fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy [FSRT] or 3D simulation to minimize the exposure&#xD;
      to normal tissues. In recent years, Proton therapy is a new radiation therapy which remaining&#xD;
      energy is released when they reach the tumor, delivering the most effective dose of&#xD;
      radiation. The purpose of this trial is to improve the therapeutic effects by using proton&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
