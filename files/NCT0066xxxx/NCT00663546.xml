      This study, conducted by the National Center for Parasitology, Entomology and Malaria Control&#xD;
      of Cambodia s Ministry of Health and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases, will explore whether the following factors confer protection against malaria and&#xD;
      associated anemia: certain blood groups, the hemoglobin E variant, G6PD-deficiency and&#xD;
      alpha-thalassemia. Malaria is caused by parasites (P. falciparum and P. vivax) that are&#xD;
      transmitted to humans through mosquito bites. This protocol includes two studies, a cohort&#xD;
      study and a P. vivax collection study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals are eligible for enrollment in the studies as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of all ages of Kandal, Ekapheap and Sangkumthmey villages (Thmar Da commune) who&#xD;
      plan to remain in Thmar Da commune for the next 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. vivax collection study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating in NIAID protocol 05-I- N210 ( Severe Malaria and Anti-malarial Drug Resistance&#xD;
      in Cambodia ) and diagnosed with P. vivax malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline evaluation, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Malaria history, temperature measurement and review of current symptoms, if any&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw of 300 microliters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood draw of 10 milliliters in selected adults 18 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with artesunate-piperaquine at a commune health post for subjects who develop&#xD;
      malaria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contact once a year for 5 years to determine continued residency in Thmar Da commune&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. vivax collection study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history and physical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hemoglobin level measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment with chloroquine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw 3 to 5 weeks after treatment in some patients 18 years of age or older&#xD;

      Cohort study. Hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms that give rise to HbE,&#xD;
      alpha-thalassemia, G6PD-deficiency, and ABO blood groups occur at high frequency along the&#xD;
      Thailand-Cambodia border, where Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum have been and continue to&#xD;
      be transmitted. To determine whether these Hb/RBC polymorphisms have been naturally selected&#xD;
      because they confer protection against malaria and malaria-associated anemia, we will conduct&#xD;
      a cohort study of ethnic Khmer in Cambodia. Approximately 1000 individuals of all ages will&#xD;
      be genotyped for the four polymorphisms listed above and then followed for 5 years to&#xD;
      determine the mean incidence rates for both P. vivax and P. falciparum malaria, stratified by&#xD;
      genotype. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs) will be calculated for each polymorphism relative to&#xD;
      the wildtype genotype. Differences between Hb levels during acute episodes of malaria and Hb&#xD;
      levels at baseline will also be calculated to determine if Hb/RBC polymorphisms influence the&#xD;
      degree of malaria-associated anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P. vivax collection study. Unlike P. falciparum, P. vivax cannot be efficiently cultivated in&#xD;
      vitro. Improved cultivation methods are needed to make progress on nearly all aspects of P.&#xD;
      vivax malariology, including pathogenesis, naturally-acquired immunity, vaccination, and&#xD;
      antimalarial drug resistance. We plan to improve both short- and long-term cultivation&#xD;
      methods in order to test various hypotheses of P. vivax pathogenesis and protection. Using&#xD;
      freshly obtained parasite isolates from individuals with P. vivax malaria, we will test&#xD;
      whether Hb/RBC polymorphisms influence potentially pathogenic properties of P. vivax&#xD;
      parasites, such as their ability to bind non-infected RBCs and other host cells. It is&#xD;
      believed that P. vivax selectively invades reticutocytes. This tropism has frustrated&#xD;
      attempts at long-term cultivation of this parasite, which requires a constant source of&#xD;
      reticulocyte-rich blood not easily obtained even in developed countries. The host&#xD;
      reticulocyte receptor that mediates the highly selective tropism of P. vivax has not been&#xD;
      identified. Fresh P. vivax parasites will also be used in in vitro experiments to identify&#xD;
      the putative receptor that defines reticulocyte tropism. Any P. vivax ligand that bound&#xD;
      selectively to a reticulocyte receptor will then be discovered and worked up as a promising&#xD;
      vaccine candidate.&#xD;
