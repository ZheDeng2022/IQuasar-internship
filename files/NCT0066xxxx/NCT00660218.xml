  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves two phases. Phase I of this study is designed to find out the maximum&#xD;
      dose of paclitaxel poliglumex which can be safely given to subjects when combined with&#xD;
      cetuximab and radiotherapy in head and neck cancer. Once the maximum safe dose of paclitaxel&#xD;
      poliglumex is found, Phase II of the study will continue to find out whether the addition of&#xD;
      paclitaxel poliglumex increases tumor response and survival compared to treatment with&#xD;
      cetuximab and radiotherapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional 20 patients have been added, to balance data. These patients must be HPV&#xD;
      negative.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with locally advanced (stage III and IV) head and neck cancer are often managed by&#xD;
      radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy because most of them have unresectable tumor,&#xD;
      require too extensive surgery, or are medically unfit to go through radical surgery. However,&#xD;
      the treatment results from conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for locally advanced head&#xD;
      and neck cancers are poor in terms of local control and survival. Therefore, combinations of&#xD;
      radiation and chemotherapy have been studied to improve treatment results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential radiation-chemotherapy (most given in neo-adjuvant setting) has been studied&#xD;
      extensively in prospective pilot and large randomized trials. So far, a survival advantage&#xD;
      over standard radiotherapy has not been demonstrated, but organ preservation has been&#xD;
      achieved in many patients. Response rates to chemotherapy are high, and decrease in distant&#xD;
      metastases has been demonstrated in some trials. Despite a high response rate in trials&#xD;
      comparing neoadjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy to radiotherapy alone, improved&#xD;
      locoregional control (LRC) has not been shown. Concurrent radiation and cisplatin-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy has shown survival advantage over radiotherapy alone in meta-analysis. However,&#xD;
      the administration of cisplatin-based chemotherapy is associated with significantly increased&#xD;
      local and systemic toxic effects, which may preclude many patients from proceeding with&#xD;
      combined therapy. Therefore, there is a great interest in defining an active regimen that&#xD;
      does not contain cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative approach to concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy has emerged with the&#xD;
      development of molecular targeted agents. A recently reported randomized phase III study&#xD;
      demonstrated improved duration of control of locoregional disease and overall survival with&#xD;
      the addition of the antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor, cetuximab, to&#xD;
      definitive radiotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&#xD;
      Importantly, cetuximab administration did not increase radiation-related toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most commonly used chemotherapy other than cisplatin chemotherapy for the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced head and neck cancer is paclitaxel. There are many studies showing improvement of&#xD;
      tumor control when paclitaxel was added to the radiotherapy. Paclitaxel poliglumex (PPX,&#xD;
      CT-2103, Xyotax) is a macromolecule that consists of a biodegradable, water-soluble polymer&#xD;
      of glutamic acid, a naturally-occurring amino acid, linked to paclitaxel. Preclinical studies&#xD;
      suggest increased tumor uptake of PPX compared with paclitaxel, resulting in enhanced tumor&#xD;
      cell kill. PPX may potentiate tumor radiocurability without affecting acute normal tissue&#xD;
      injury. Moreover, a synergistic increase in tumor cell death was observed when paclitaxel&#xD;
      poliglumex was administered with cetuximab in a preclinical tumor model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will assess the rational combination of PPX with radiotherapy and&#xD;
      cetuximab. This regimen is of great interest and has the potential to improve the therapeutic&#xD;
      ratio compared with an approach of either cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy&#xD;
      and cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is also an optional tissue submission component of this study, in which subjects who&#xD;
      require surgery following their treatment can give permission for a block of tumor tissue&#xD;
      removed at the time of their surgery to be sent to Cell Therapeutics, Inc. (the manufacturer&#xD;
      of PPX) for evaluation of PPX accumulation, level of cathepsin B, and estrogen receptor&#xD;
      expression. This information will be used to correlate the tumor response and survival of&#xD;
      patients in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the initiation of this study, the relationship of HPV to head and neck cancer has&#xD;
      become very evident. Our initial results have many more HPV positive subjects, and therefore&#xD;
      we have added 20 more HPV negative patients to the study, to determine if this status affects&#xD;
      the outcome.&#xD;
