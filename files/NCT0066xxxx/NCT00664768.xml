      This study involves the use of 2 different Neocate formulas: a control formula called Neocate&#xD;
      Infant and a test Neocate formula. These kinds of formulas are for use in children from birth&#xD;
      to 8 months of age with Cow Milk Allergy (CMA), other food allergies, and other&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disorders. The purpose of this study is to compare the control and test&#xD;
      Neocate formulas for safety, tolerability, and effectiveness (in promoting growth) when used&#xD;
      in subjects with CMA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also look at the test Neocate formula to see if it is hypoallergenic when&#xD;
      used in subjects with CMA.&#xD;

      Infants who qualify will begin a 7-day milk protein elimination diet that excludes all milk&#xD;
      or products which contain milk. Parents will be asked to keep a food diary of everything the&#xD;
      child eats during the week following the Screening Visit. During this week, the child can&#xD;
      continue to drink their current hypoallergenic formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed at seven study visits at baseline, two weeks, four weeks and then&#xD;
      monthly until the end of the study period, where the following will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 1 (Day -7): Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be carried out at entry to the trial to collect baseline data; at this visit&#xD;
      subjects will under go the following assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;

      exam and clinical assessment Medical history and assessment including SCORing Atopic&#xD;

      venous blood sample The following is to analysed by the central lab; Plasma total&#xD;
      protein/albumin and prealbumin Blood urea nitrogen, electrolytes and creatinine Complete&#xD;
      blood count with differential Alkaline phosphatase. Serum Iron, Total Iron Binding Capacity&#xD;
      and Ferritin Plasma fatty acid analysis Provide stool lab kits and explain to&#xD;
      parent/caregiver how to collect stool sample during the pre-evaluation week Provide one-week&#xD;
      subject diary (Subject Diary 1) and instruct parent/caregiver on how to complete record,&#xD;
      clinical symptoms and stool characteristics (frequency, consistency and color) in subject&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provide the one-week Food Frequency Diary A and instruct the parent/caregiver on how to&#xD;
      complete this assessment Provide information on following a milk protein exclusion diet, with&#xD;
      or without the exclusion of other allergenic food proteins as advised by the subject's&#xD;
      physician Record all concomitant medications taken within two weeks prior to the Baseline&#xD;
      Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visit 2 (Day 0): Once subjects have completed the pre-evaluation period subjects will&#xD;
      undergo the following assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Review Subject Diary 1 and Food Frequency Diary A, for study compliance Randomisation&#xD;
      assignment to one of the two study formulas Perform physical exam and clinical assessment&#xD;
      Obtain weight, length/height and head circumference Provide two-week subject diary (Subject&#xD;
      Diary 2a) and instruct parent/caregiver on how to record clinical symptoms and stool&#xD;
      characteristics in subject diary.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Phone review (Day 7)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be reviewed at this time point by telephone to review if any clinical symptoms&#xD;
      have occurred while ingesting study formula. If it is determined by the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator that the subject has had any clinically significant reaction(s) to the study&#xD;
      formula, the subject must return to the clinic for evaluation. Subjects will progress to&#xD;
      Phase II and continue feeding with the formula they have consumed as part of the seven-day,&#xD;
      post-challenge feeding period.&#xD;
&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is attained growth (i.e. incremental gains in weight) over the study period. Length and head circumference measures will also be collected and analysed. Both the growth velocities of the group as a whole (cross-sectional group data) and individuals (longitudinal individual data) will be reviewed and analysed. In assessing group data, comparisons of increments per unit of time will be made. Due to the varying ages of the subjects recruited to the study, growth measures will be concerted to z-scores using an appropriate reference population to allow a meaningful comparison of the ability of the formulas to promote growth. In assessing the growth of individual infants, data will be plotted on National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth charts and assessed qualitatively.</description>
