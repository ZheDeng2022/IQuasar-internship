    <textblock>
      This study uses the drugs Abraxane (also called ABI-007) and Vandetanib (also called Zactima&#xD;
      and ZD6474). Abraxane has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for the&#xD;
      treatment of breast cancer. Vandetanib is an experimental drug and has not been approved by&#xD;
      the FDA for the treatment of any condition. Vandetanib has shrunk some non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer, prostate cancer and thyroid cancer in some studies in humans. This combination of&#xD;
      drugs is not approved for the treatment of any condition by the FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being done in two phases. The first phase of the trial has two main objectives:&#xD;
      1) To find the highest daily dose of vandetanib that can be given safely with once weekly&#xD;
      Abraxane and 2) To find the highest daily dose of vandetanib that can be given safely with&#xD;
      Abraxane given every three weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a&#xD;
      coin) to receive Abraxane weekly (Arm A) or once every three weeks (Arm B). The dose of&#xD;
      Abraxane given will remain the same for the whole study - 100 mg/m2 when given weekly and 260&#xD;
      mg/m2 when given every three weeks. Participants will be entered onto each arm of the study&#xD;
      in groups of three, and higher doses of vandetanib will be given each group of participants.&#xD;
      The increase of vandetanib will stop once more than one participant has serious side effects.&#xD;
      The highest dose of vandetanib that can be given with Abraxane (without serious side effects)&#xD;
      in each Arm will be called the pilot dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study twenty participants will be randomly assigned to Arm A or&#xD;
      Arm B and receive the pilot dose of vandetanib that was reached in the first phase of the&#xD;
      study. The purpose of the second phase of the study is to see how many tumors shrink when&#xD;
      participants receive the pilot dose of the drug combination on each Arm, as well as to gather&#xD;
      more information about the side effects.&#xD;
