    <textblock>
      Diverticulosis (bulges in the bowel wall) affects two third of the elderly population in the&#xD;
      UK. Diverticular disease and its complications are responsible for 68000 hospital admissions&#xD;
      and 2000 deaths per year. It commonly produces recurrent short lived abdominal pain, changes&#xD;
      in bowel habit and incontinence. The causes of symptoms are not known and the treatments&#xD;
      unsatisfactory. Recent studies have found an association between inflammation, alteration of&#xD;
      bowel nerves and symptoms. Mesalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug used in inflammatory bowel&#xD;
      conditions, such as ulcerative colitis and crohn's disease. We plan to perform a randomized&#xD;
      double blind (neither the patients or the doctors known which treatment the patient is&#xD;
      taking) placebo (sham medication) controlled trial of mesalazine in symptomatic diverticular&#xD;
      disease patients. We anticipate a reduction in the amount of inflammation, bowel nerve&#xD;
      changes and symptoms in patients taking mesalazine compare to those taking the placebo.&#xD;

      Diverticular disease affects two thirds of the elderly population in the United Kingdom. Only&#xD;
      a small fraction of individuals with diverticulosis develop symptoms, perhaps 1 in 10, for&#xD;
      reasons which are not well understood. The symptoms however are quite disabling as we found&#xD;
      in a recent survey which indicated that around 36% suffered recurrent abdominal pain.&#xD;
      Surprisingly, given the severity of the disability there has been very little research into&#xD;
      the factors predicting the development of painful diverticular disease. Recent studies have&#xD;
      indicated however that there may be an inflammatory component since the best predictor of&#xD;
      recurrent abdominal pain is a previous episode of acute diverticulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Just what initiates an attack of acute diverticulitis is poorly understood but may include&#xD;
      the inspissation of fecal material in the diverticulum which then leads to pressure on the&#xD;
      lining epithelium and a break down of barrier function. This allows colonic bacteria to enter&#xD;
      the lamina propria where they cause acute inflammation, attracting pus cells from the&#xD;
      circulating blood and creating micro-abscesses. The resolution of this involves fibrosis and&#xD;
      scaring together with muscular hypertrophy which may well lead to secondary motor&#xD;
      abnormalities. Patients with symptomatic diverticular disease are known to have higher&#xD;
      intraluminal pressures, both at baseline and in response to stimuli such as a meal or&#xD;
      prostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent report in which patients admitted with acute diverticulitis were followed for two&#xD;
      years found that a very high proportion of such individuals subsequently develop recurrent&#xD;
      chronic abdominal pain. Recent work has indicated that this leaves a permanent change in&#xD;
      mucosal innervation. Markers of nerve injury including galanin and substance P are&#xD;
      upregulated in patients with symptoms as opposed to those without. This is the first time&#xD;
      that an objective marker has been shown to distinguish patients on the basis of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While acute diverticulitis may be the initiating insult, a chronic low level inflammation may&#xD;
      also be required to maintain visceral hypersensitivity. Where detailed quantitative histology&#xD;
      has been performed in diverticular disease, some individuals have been identified with a&#xD;
      lymphocytic infiltration. In other circumstances, chronic inflammation sensitises mucosal&#xD;
      nerves and is associated with visceral hypersensitivity, something which has also been noted&#xD;
      in symptomatic diverticular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether anti-inflammatory agents could reverse this process is as yet unknown but there are&#xD;
      currently available safe and effective treatments for inflammatory bowel disease such as 5&#xD;
      amino-salicylic acid or budesonide which might well be effective and allow further evaluation&#xD;
      of the role of low grade inflammation in symptomatic diverticular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to investigate the inflammatory, neurological and symptomatic effects of&#xD;
      mesalazine in diverticular disease.&#xD;
