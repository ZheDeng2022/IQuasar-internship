      Asthma is the most common chronic disease of childhood and a major cause of morbidity in the&#xD;
      United States. If asthma symptoms are controlled, a child with asthma can stay well and lead&#xD;
      a normal life. Daily use of inhaled steroids controls symptoms and reduces morbidity and&#xD;
      emergent health care utilization in children with persistent asthma, and is safe for&#xD;
      long-term use. However, inhaled steroids are underused in community asthma care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Telephone Asthma Program (TAP) is a series of brief, telephone calls with a trained coach&#xD;
      to help the parent manage the child's asthma care. The coach will teach self-management&#xD;
      skills, help the parent to use the child's asthma medicines effectively, provide support and&#xD;
      remind the parent to go for follow-up care with the pediatrician. We hypothesized that the&#xD;
      Telephone Asthma Program will reduce the incidence of acute exacerbations of asthma that&#xD;
      require emergent care, improve the quality of life of children with asthma and their parents,&#xD;
      and increase the daily use of inhaled steroids in children with persistent asthma. We&#xD;
      evaluated the Telephone Asthma Program in a randomized controlled trial involving 362&#xD;
      children aged 5 to 12 years old cared for by community pediatricians. Eligible children were&#xD;
      randomized to the TAP program or usual care by their pediatrician.&#xD;

      Asthma morbidity is largely preventable with effective maintenance care. National guidelines&#xD;
      recommend 1) daily treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to prevent asthma symptoms&#xD;
      and activity limitations, minimize acute exacerbations and maintain normal lung function; 2)&#xD;
      early intervention guided by a written Asthma Action Plan for worsening symptoms;3) a&#xD;
      partnership between the primary care provider, the patient and their family to develop shared&#xD;
      treatment goals, select an appropriate treatment plan, resolve asthma-related concerns, and&#xD;
      provide support for day-to-day care, and 4) periodic assessments (every 1 to 6 months) by the&#xD;
      physician to monitor asthma control and assess if the goals of therapy are being met, with&#xD;
      asthma self-management education provided at diagnosis and reinforced at every opportunity.&#xD;
      Despite widespread dissemination of these guidelines, under-use of controller medications is&#xD;
      pervasive, home management of an acute exacerbation is often delayed and inadequate, and only&#xD;
      50% of asthmatic children report maintenance care visits twice a year. Most primary care&#xD;
      pediatricians do not provide education about use of preventive treatments or self-management&#xD;
      behaviors citing lack of confidence in their ability to effect change, logistical issues such&#xD;
      as lack of time, educational materials, support staff, and inadequate reimbursement as&#xD;
      significant barriers to these activities. Practical, efficient interventions to improve&#xD;
      maintenance asthma care in office-practice are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In response to complaints from community pediatricians in our practice-based research network&#xD;
      that few children with persistent asthma used their controller medications as prescribed we&#xD;
      collaborated with local asthma experts and the telephone triage service at our children's&#xD;
      hospital to develop and evaluate a 12-month telephone-coaching program to provide education&#xD;
      and support to parents to improve asthma self-management for their children. The Telephone&#xD;
      Asthma Program (TAP) was provided in addition to usual care, and was evaluated in a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TAP program was based on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change developed by James&#xD;
      Prochaska. This model postulates a series of 5 ordered stages of readiness to change to a&#xD;
      desired behavior (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action and Maintenance). The&#xD;
      desired behaviors for TAP were: 1) using controller medications as prescribed, 2)&#xD;
      administering rescue medications at the child's first signs of an asthma exacerbation, 3)&#xD;
      having an up-to-date asthma action plan readily available for all who may need it, and 4)&#xD;
      having a collaborative relationship with the child's PCP that included regular asthma&#xD;
      check-up visits at least every 6 months. Our goal was that all 4 behaviors would be addressed&#xD;
      by the coach for each parent throughout the 12-month program period. Guided by computerized&#xD;
      telephone protocols the coach provided tailored care advice appropriate for the parent's&#xD;
      stage of readiness for behavior change. In this way, the coach could provide education and&#xD;
      support to help the parent to provide effective asthma care at home for their child, and&#xD;
      supplement the care provided by the physician.&#xD;
