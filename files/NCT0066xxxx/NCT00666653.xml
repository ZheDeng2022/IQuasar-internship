  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a benefit to giving a dopamine&#xD;
      agonist to a patient with Parkinson's disease who is already being treated with levodopa.&#xD;

      Patients with idiopathic PD based on London Brain Bank criteria as determined by an OHSU&#xD;
      movement disorder specialist entered the study. They gave informed consent to a protocol&#xD;
      approved by the Oregon Health and Science University Institutional Review Board and General&#xD;
      Clinical Research Center (GCRC) Review Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were on long-term levodopa therapy, and had motor fluctuations and dyskinesia as&#xD;
      determined during screening. Subjects were screened with finger tapping (FT) in the&#xD;
      practically defined OFF motor state, having been off LD overnight, and in the practically&#xD;
      defined ON motor state. To qualify, they had to have a minimum 10% improvement in the ON&#xD;
      state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study with subjects on&#xD;
      pramipexole for 4 weeks and an identically appearing placebo for 4 weeks. The response to&#xD;
      two-hour LD infusions at 0.5 (threshold) and 1.0 (suprathreshold) mg/kg/hr were examined at&#xD;
      the end of each 4 week treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was finger-tapping speed, as a surrogate marker of bradykinesia, over a&#xD;
      seven hour time period. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated as finger taps x&#xD;
      minutes (FTM). Secondary outcomes measured included peak motor response, as measured by FT,&#xD;
      walking speed, dyskinesia, time-to-ON (defined as a 10% increase in finger tapping speed over&#xD;
      the baseline), and effects of LD infusion on subjects' perceived mood, anxiety and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized to receive either pramipexole (PPX) or placebo for the initial 5&#xD;
      weeks of the study. The PPX and placebo was titrated up over 9 days to a target dose of 1.0mg&#xD;
      TID. If they were already taking a DA, this was tapered and discontinued while the study&#xD;
      medication was titrated upward. Their LD was continued according to the subjects normal&#xD;
      schedule during this time period, as well as any other antiparkinsonian medications they were&#xD;
      taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a maintenance phase of 4 weeks on study medication (PPX 1.0mg TID or placebo TID)&#xD;
      subjects were admitted in the evening to the inpatient GCRC at OHSU. Their last LD dose was&#xD;
      given no later than 10 pm and all other PD medications were withheld after 10 pm. They&#xD;
      practiced FT sessions on the night of admission. At 7 AM the next morning, a dose of the&#xD;
      study drug was given and an IV line was placed. An IV levodopa infusion was administered&#xD;
      starting at 9 am, continuously over 2 hours at a rate of either 0.5mg/kg/hr or 1.0 mg/kg/hr.&#xD;
      The infusion rate was blinded and randomized. The infusion was stopped at 11 am. After 2:00&#xD;
      PM and when subjects were deemed &quot;off&quot;, the usual antiparkinson medications were&#xD;
      reinstituted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FT, tremor, walking (timed and # of steps), dyskinesia, and a &quot;global&quot; PD scale were measured&#xD;
      by research nurses, and subjects completed visual analogue scales (VASs) for anxiety, fatigue&#xD;
      and mood every 30 minutes from 7:00 AM until 2:00 PM.&#xD;
