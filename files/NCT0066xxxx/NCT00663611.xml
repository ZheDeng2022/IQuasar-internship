      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In elderly individuals, an age-associated decline in the immune system s ability to&#xD;
      function is believed to contribute to increased incidence of infection, autoimmune disorders,&#xD;
      and cancer. This decline in immune system function may be related to the decline in the body&#xD;
      s production of growth hormone, which helps regulate human development and may contribute to&#xD;
      the health of the immune system. Researchers are interested in studying whether growth&#xD;
      hormone, given as an infusion over time, can improve the function of the immune system and&#xD;
      other body systems associated with good health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effects of growth hormone administration on the immune systems of healthy men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy men between 25 and 50 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This protocol will involve three separate studies: Study I, Study IB, and Study II.&#xD;
           Participants in Study I and Study IB may participate in Study II as directed by the&#xD;
           researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a full medical history and physical examination, and&#xD;
           will provide blood, urine, and stool samples; have a glucose tolerance test; and have&#xD;
           other tests as required by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have an infusion pump with a small catheter inserted beneath the skin&#xD;
           to administer the study chemicals (either growth hormone or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study I and Study IB participants will receive pulses of growth hormone through the&#xD;
           infusion pump at regular intervals to monitor the body s response to the hormone. Study&#xD;
           IB participants will receive a higher dose of growth hormone than Study I participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout the study period, all participants will have frequent blood and urine tests,&#xD;
           as well as tests of glucose tolerance and metabolism, imaging studies, and other tests&#xD;
           as required by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study II participants will be divided into two groups. The first group will receive&#xD;
           pulses of either growth hormone or placebo infusion at intervals throughout the day for&#xD;
           4 weeks, followed by an 8-week period without infusions. The second group will receive&#xD;
           conventional once-a-day infusion of growth hormone or placebo for 4 weeks, followed by&#xD;
           an 8-week period without infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Throughout the study period, all participants will have frequent blood and urine tests,&#xD;
           as well as tests of glucose tolerance and metabolism, imaging studies, and other tests&#xD;
           as required by the researchers.&#xD;

      Objectives and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to investigate whether growth hormone, administered in a physiological or pulsatile&#xD;
      fashion, can elicit relevant changes in the human immune system while at the same time&#xD;
      associated with no change or even an improvement in the metabolic profiles such as insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-eight healthy men, age 25-50, will be recruited for this study. There are three parts&#xD;
      to this study: Study I, Study IB and Study II. Study I and IB each involve six subjects and&#xD;
      are designed to test the hypothesis that pulsatile subcutaneous infusion of GH via a&#xD;
      subcutaneous infusion pump will yield a reasonable pulsatile GH pattern. The dose of GH used&#xD;
      in Study IB will be three-fold higher that that in Study I. Study I and IB will be done first&#xD;
      before proceeding to Study II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study II is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week study involving 26&#xD;
      subjects divided into 2 groups: Group A and Group B. Group A will involve 13 subjects&#xD;
      receiving pulsatile GH or placebo infusion for 4 weeks with 8-week washout after&#xD;
      intervention. Group B will involve 13 subjects receiving conventional once a day subcutaneous&#xD;
      infusion of GH or placebo for 4 weeks with 8-week washout after intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical Relevance and Expected Outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will ascertain the significance of the effect of pulsatile growth hormone&#xD;
      administration on the human immune system and metabolic profile.&#xD;
