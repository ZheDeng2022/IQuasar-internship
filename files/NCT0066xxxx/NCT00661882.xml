      RATIONALE: Gathering information about patients with cancer may help doctors learn more about&#xD;
      the disease and plan early diagnosis and treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying computer tools for improving early diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment in patients with pancreatic cancer, are at risk for pancreatic cancer, or have a&#xD;
      non-cancerous pancreatic disorder.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop Integrated Biomedical Computing Tools (IBCT) for the better understanding and&#xD;
           treatment of pancreatic cancer by using the power of computer and informatics sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Continue development of the Pancreatic Cancer Collaborative Registry (PCCR)&#xD;
           infrastructure to act as a repository for socio-demographic, environmental, clinical,&#xD;
           and family history data collected from individuals and interested family members with a&#xD;
           personal and/or family history of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participate in an international pancreatic registry known as the PCCR by sharing&#xD;
           information collected for research purposes only, to be used by pancreatic cancer&#xD;
           research collaborators from other institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect and bank excess biological materials (i.e., pancreatic tissue, tumor tissue,&#xD;
           and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer tissue, and/or paraffin-embedded tissue), blood, and&#xD;
           serum from registry participants for future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood and pancreatic tissue collection. Normal, tumor, and/or metastatic&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer tissue, and/or paraffin-embedded tissue from prior surgery or biopsy are&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients provide or complete personal information about themselves, their medical history,&#xD;
      their diet and lifestyle habits, any past or current environmental exposures, and re-create&#xD;
      their family tree for any cancers that have occurred in any of their family members. Clinical&#xD;
      data is collected annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High Risk participants provide blood samples and complete questionnaires at baseline.&#xD;
      Clinical data is collected annually.&#xD;

    <description>Provide or complete personal information about themselves, their medical history, their diet and lifestyle habits, any past or current environmental exposures and to re-create their family tree for any cancers that have occurred in any of their family members. In accordance with OPRR guidelines, no identifying information such as name, address, or date of birth will be used for relatives, but the affected status (cancer, age of onset, age of death) will be recorded. This information will be collected by whichever method they prefer; completing the questionnaires on hardcopy (to then be entered into the PCCR by a data manager) or by logging on to the PCCR website to complete the questionnaires by obtaining a user id and password to enter their information directly into the PCCR. Study participants who are in the EDRN project are required to complete the questionnaires on hardcopy (to then be entered into the PCCR by a data manager).</description>
