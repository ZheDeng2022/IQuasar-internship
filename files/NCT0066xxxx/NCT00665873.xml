      BACKGROUND: The growing use of totally implantable venous access devices (TIVAD) has caused&#xD;
      the simultaneous increase of various complications. The infection of the TIVAD or the&#xD;
      subcutaneous pocket in which the device is positioned is one of the most encountered&#xD;
      complications. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of the antibiotic in the&#xD;
      prevention of the infection of the surgical site and the TIVAD until 30 days after the&#xD;
      implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS: The authors enrolled one hundred consecutive patients divided into two randomized&#xD;
      arms: group A (antibiotic), group B (no antibiotic), each of 50 patients. All the patients&#xD;
      were affected by solid tumors needing chemotherapy continuously. TIVADs were implanted&#xD;
      surgically in cephalic vein. Signs or symptoms considered were: pain, localized swelling,&#xD;
      redness, and heat. White cell count was considered on the first, third, and seventh&#xD;
      postoperative days, and the tests were made in the in-hospital laboratory. Body temperatures&#xD;
      were checked twice daily for 7 days.&#xD;

      PATIENTS AND METHODS One hundred consecutive patients were enrolled for the present study&#xD;
      from January 2004 to September 2006. The patients were divided into two arms, each of 50&#xD;
      patients, and they were randomized using sealed envelopes that were opened only in the&#xD;
      operating room 30 min before the start of the procedure. All the patients were aged more than&#xD;
      18 years and were affected by solid tumors. In all the patients, the TIVAD was necessary to&#xD;
      infuse chemotherapy continuously. The type of device utilized in all patients was composed of&#xD;
      a catheter of polyurethane and a titanium portal reservoir covered with polysulfone&#xD;
      (PORT-A-CATH, Smiths Medical Inc., MN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age, gender, comorbidity (cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, coagulopathy, diabetes),&#xD;
      white cells, platelets, prothrombin time (less than 70%), kind of tumoral disease, numbers of&#xD;
      chemotherapeutical cures before the surgical procedure, experience of surgeons (resident or&#xD;
      surgeon), preparation of the skin of the patients, time and kind of hand scrub of the&#xD;
      surgeons, kind of antibiotic used, and time of administration were considered for the present&#xD;
      study. All the devices were implanted in the operating room using the cephalic vein dissected&#xD;
      surgically; the technique used has been previously described.3 White cell count was&#xD;
      considered on the first, third, and seventh postoperative days, and the tests were made in&#xD;
      the in-hospital laboratory. Body temperatures were checked twice daily for 7 days. Eight days&#xD;
      after the surgical procedure, sutures of the skin were removed. The skin wound was covered&#xD;
      with a sterile drape until the ninth postoperative day. After this time, the patients used&#xD;
      any skin protection, but the skin wound was checked one time each week for a total of 30&#xD;
      days. All the devices were used to infuse chemotherapy drugs 10 days after the surgical&#xD;
      procedure. From the 10th to the 30th days, the devices were used, at minimum, one time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single dose of cephalosporin (1 gr of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid ) was administered&#xD;
      intravenously 10 min before the skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the surgical site infections (SSI), the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, Georgia,9 were applied. By these criteria, SSIs are classified as&#xD;
      being either incisional or organ/space. Incisional SSIs are further divided into those&#xD;
      involving only skin and subcutaneous tissue (superficial incisional SSI) and those involving&#xD;
      deeper soft tissues of the incision (deep incisional SSI). Organ/space SSIs involve any part&#xD;
      of the anatomy (e.g., organ or space) other than incised body wall layers that was opened or&#xD;
      manipulated during the operation (Fig. 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following signs or symptoms for defining a superficial incisional infection were&#xD;
      considered: pain, localized swelling, redness, and heat.9 Infection was considered if these&#xD;
      signs and symptoms occurred within 30 days after the surgical procedure, and the end points&#xD;
      were considered to be a body temperature more than 37.5°C, white cells more than 11,000 K/æL,&#xD;
      and one or more of the following signs: pain, localized swelling, redness, or heat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The state of the skin was evaluated in people with the same surgical team, which was composed&#xD;
      of the surgeons (one skilled, with more than 400 previous procedures, and one resident, with&#xD;
      20 previous procedures) and two nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following these rules, depending on the results of a computer-generated randomization&#xD;
      enclosed in sealed envelopes, 100 patients were divided into two groups of 50 patients: group&#xD;
      A (patients were submitted to the short-term prophylaxis with cefalosporin 10 min before skin&#xD;
      incision) and group B (patients without any antibiotic prophylaxis). All the patients were&#xD;
      hospitalized the night after the surgical procedure. A statistical study, to compare the&#xD;
      means and standard deviations of each group, was performed using Student's t-test&#xD;
      (independent, two-sided).&#xD;
