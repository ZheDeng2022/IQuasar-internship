  <brief_summary>

      We propose to recruit 150 case families (i.e., families with a schizophrenia proband), 150&#xD;
      control families, and 45 control subjects who exhibit schizophrenia spectrum personality&#xD;
      symptoms in the absence of a family history of schizophrenia. Participants will undergo a&#xD;
      number of clinical, electrophysiological, perceptual, and cognitive assessments. These data&#xD;
      will be used to identify phenotypes likely to be associated with genetic risk for&#xD;
      schizophrenia, and to determine how these phenotypes aggregate in families. Some of the&#xD;
      analyses will focus on examining associations between candidate genes and these alternative&#xD;
      phenotypes. Thus if we are not able to recruit relatives we may still collect these&#xD;
      phenotypic data in probands and their genetic sample for future genotype/phenotype&#xD;
      association studies. Testing procedures require a 10-12 hour time commitment and testing will&#xD;
      be completed over 2 or more days. Participants will be asked to give a blood (or saliva if&#xD;
      difficult to obtain blood sample for instance because of fear of blood draws), which will be&#xD;
      stored for future genetic analyses.&#xD;

      Specific aims of the proposed study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the hypothesis that abnormalities in predictive pursuit, antisaccade&#xD;
           performance, working memory, visual attention (CPT), sensory gating (PPI and P50) and&#xD;
           other measures of information processing mark the liability for schizophrenia. Secondly,&#xD;
           we will examine the pattern of familial aggregation of these measures to determine&#xD;
           whether observed deficits are likely to reflect genetic and/or environmental effects.&#xD;
           The hypothesis will be supported if (a) the frequency of these neurophysiological&#xD;
           deficits is higher in relatives of schizophrenic probands than in relatives of control&#xD;
           probands; (b) the prevalence of neurophysiological abnormalities is higher in case&#xD;
           relatives with SSP symptoms than in nonSSP case relatives; (c) risk is increased among&#xD;
           case relatives of &quot;affected&quot; probands vs. case relatives of &quot;unaffected&quot; probands (i.e.,&#xD;
           risk in relatives of case probands who exhibit an abnormality vs. relatives of case&#xD;
           probands who do not).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis that some physiological deficits reflect a common underlying&#xD;
           phenotype, while others mark independent aspects of disease risk. To test this&#xD;
           hypothesis (a) we will examine correlation matrices (adjusted for within family&#xD;
           correlation) for neurophysiological assessments among case relatives and control&#xD;
           relatives. Factor structures in the two groups will be examined using exploratory factor&#xD;
           analyses, followed by confirmatory factor analyses using validation samples of&#xD;
           case/control relatives. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) will also be used to&#xD;
           determine how factor solutions based on case/control relatives fit the data of case&#xD;
           probands. (b) Factor scores for correlated measures will be derived and the familial&#xD;
           risk for composite measures of neurophysiological functioning estimated using the&#xD;
           methods described in Specific Aim 1. (c) Secondary within family analyses will be&#xD;
           performed to estimate the heritability of derived factor scores and to determine whether&#xD;
           patterns of familial correlations suggest a genetic or environmental cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate whether particular domains of psychopathology are marked by different&#xD;
           putative phenotypic markers. We will specifically test the hypotheses that predictive&#xD;
           pursuit, working memory, and sensory gating measures are more strongly associated with&#xD;
           positive psychotic symptoms, while smooth pursuit initiation and processing speed&#xD;
           measures are more strongly associated with primary negative symptoms. The relationships&#xD;
           between clinical domains and other measures or clusters will be examined in an&#xD;
           exploratory hypothesis-generating framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We propose to collect blood samples (or rarely saliva sample) from each participant to&#xD;
           be stored for future association studies, as well as formal linkage analyses using&#xD;
           phenotypes identified in specific aims 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. We plan to examine how nicotine dependence may run in families and to examine if&#xD;
           patterns of nicotine use may be related to a family history of schizophrenia.&#xD;
           Participants will be asked about their smoking history and current smoking habits.&#xD;
           Current smokers will be asked more specific questions about their smoking behaviors to&#xD;
           estimate level of current nicotine dependence. It is hoped that this information will&#xD;
           give us clues about why so many individuals with schizophrenia smoke.&#xD;
