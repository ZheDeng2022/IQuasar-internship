  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Almost everyone who has a traumatic limb amputated will experience a phantom limb - the vivid&#xD;
      impression that the limb not only still is present, but also in many cases, painful.&#xD;
      Preliminary data from study WRAMC WU# 05-71034, &quot;Pilot study to assess the efficacy of&#xD;
      mirror-box and mental visualization treatments on phantom limb pain&quot; demonstrates that 4&#xD;
      weeks of mirror therapy is effective for treating phantom limb pain (PLP) and suggests that&#xD;
      vision is a key component modulating PLP and may be the explanation for the efficacy of&#xD;
      mirror therapy, as subjects view the reflected image of their intact limb while attempting to&#xD;
      move the amputated, or phantom, limb. We propose conducting a study using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions critical for the mirror effect and to&#xD;
      study the relationship of visual activation to the sensation of phantom pain. Subjects will&#xD;
      have an fMRI scan prior to starting therapy, 2 weeks after starting mirror therapy and again&#xD;
      after 4 weeks of mirror therapy. Data will be gathered daily on the number of episodes of&#xD;
      phantom limb pain, the average length of episodes, and the average intensity of pain.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective trial that will use fMRI to identify brain regions critical to the&#xD;
      generation of PLP, examine the role of mirror therapy and the visual system in the&#xD;
      de-activation of pain pathways, and observe how changes in the brain may be correlated with&#xD;
      the level of PLP. Subjects must have PLP and have sustained a unilateral lower extremity&#xD;
      amputation prior to enrollment. All subjects will be screened initially by a neurologist,&#xD;
      physiatrist, or research coordinator according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. A&#xD;
      detailed medical history will be taken and documented, and a neurologist will conduct a&#xD;
      documented physical examination. Subjects who do not meet the study inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      not be eligible to participate in this research study, but will continue to receive current&#xD;
      best practice of care. If a subject's pain becomes severe during the course of the study,&#xD;
      pain medication will be available to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects willing to participate in the study will be required to sign a DA 5303-R (see&#xD;
      appendix for Voluntary Agreement Affidavit) prior to enrollment in the study. Once enrolled,&#xD;
      all subjects will undergo baseline entry evaluations quantifying their current pain&#xD;
      perception using the following evaluation tools: the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the&#xD;
      short version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Appendix 1) along with a short questionnaire&#xD;
      on phantom limb pain frequency and duration (Appendix 5). Subjects will also be queried about&#xD;
      their use of current pain medications along with the dosages on a weekly basis. Although&#xD;
      helpful tools in the standard of care, the questionnaires completed by the subjects and the&#xD;
      list of medications reported by the subjects in this study are for research data collection&#xD;
      purposes only. In order to maintain subject confidentiality, only the subject's&#xD;
      identification code-and not the subject's name-will appear on the questionnaires and&#xD;
      evaluation forms. Subjects will be identified only through the use of coded identifiers. For&#xD;
      instance, amputees would be coded as RLE1, RLE2, LLE1, LLE2, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Jack Tsao, Katie Hughes, and Lindsay Hussey-Andersen will administer both the treatments&#xD;
      and the questionnaires. They will train all research subjects on the appropriate technique&#xD;
      for using a 2' X 4' mirror and perform the cognitive tests. Unilateral limb amputee subjects&#xD;
      will be asked to place their intact foot in front of a mirror and then to view the mirror&#xD;
      image of the intact foot moving while performing a series of foot movements with the&#xD;
      amputated, or phantom, foot. The sequence of foot movements include: abduction of the great&#xD;
      toe, adduction of the great toe, flexion of the foot, extension of the foot, inversion of the&#xD;
      foot, eversion of the foot, rotation of the foot, flexion of the toes, and extension of the&#xD;
      toes. These sessions will be supervised by a clinician or research coordinator and will occur&#xD;
      5 times a week for 4 weeks (20 days), with each session lasting 15 minutes. Prior to each&#xD;
      daily treatment period, subjects will be asked to report PLP using the VAS and McGill forms&#xD;
      and also to report the number and duration of PLP in the previous 24 hours. All subjects will&#xD;
      also participate in rehabilitation therapy (muscle-strengthening exercises, use of&#xD;
      prosthesis, and range of motion exercises) per standard medical care for limb amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concurrent use of pain medications and muscle relaxants is permitted and will be recorded by&#xD;
      the research assistant in a medication diary (Appendix 2). Scores on the VAS and McGill pain&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to assess the subject's level of disability and to evaluate&#xD;
      outcomes. Subjects will be evaluated weekly in the hospital for quantification of the amount&#xD;
      of analgesic medications used (NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, opioids), and VAS and McGill scores&#xD;
      will be quantified daily for 4 weeks. The primary outcome will be changes in brain areas&#xD;
      which are activated at weeks 2 and 4 compared to areas activated prior to starting mirror&#xD;
      therapy. Secondary outcomes will be pain relief on the VAS, with responders defined as&#xD;
      subjects with a significant decrease in the VAS score. All respondents will be released from&#xD;
      the study after the final pain evaluation at 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research assistant will provide transportation to and from the National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health (NIH) where the fMRI scans will take place. Amputee subjects will be asked to first&#xD;
      use mental visualization to move their phantom foot and report their pain level, followed by&#xD;
      viewing of their intact foot moving in a mirror while moving their phantom foot. fMRI&#xD;
      scanning will be performed during both types of phantom foot movements to determine which&#xD;
      additional brain regions are activated with visual observation. A fMRI will be done at the&#xD;
      beginning of the study to establish a baseline and follow-up scanning will occur 2 and 4&#xD;
      weeks after daily mirror therapy begins to assess changes in brain activation. Fourteen (14)&#xD;
      control subjects will be recruited and asked to perform the same tasks during the fMRI scans&#xD;
      but will not undergo mirror therapy. Control subjects will complete the McGill pain&#xD;
      questionnaire as well as the VAS during each of their 3 visits to NIH for fMRI scanning. All&#xD;
      subjects will be queried about their current medication use on a weekly basis. Both amputee&#xD;
      and control subjects will be a part of this study for one month; both will undergo 3 fMRI&#xD;
      scanning sessions, interspersed by the same 2 week period. fMRI evaluations will take up to&#xD;
      two (2) hours per session and mirror therapy will last fifteen (15) minutes, totaling six (6)&#xD;
      hours of fMRI and five (5) hours and fifteen (15) minutes of mirror therapy.&#xD;
