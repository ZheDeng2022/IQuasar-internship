      Hypothesis:DCI 1020 capsules are safe and effective in treating exocrine pancreatic&#xD;
      insufficiency in CF patients &lt;= 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study are intended to be submitted to the FDA as part of the NDA package&#xD;
      for marketing approval of PANCRECARB (DCI 1020).&#xD;

      A large body of data supporting the safety and efficacy of PANCRECARB® (pancrelipase)&#xD;
      Capsules is available in patients above age 2. This study is being performed to gather the&#xD;
      data to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of DCI1020 in pediatric CF patients (≤ 2 years)&#xD;
      with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. This study also takes into consideration an &quot;age&#xD;
      appropriate&quot; dosing form. Specifically, the enzymes will be administered orally by opening&#xD;
      the capsules and emptying the microspheres into a small amount of applesauce as an example of&#xD;
      a slightly acidic soft food such as jelly, jello, etc. for feeding.&#xD;
