  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunodeficiency virus/Hepatitis B virus (HIV/HBV) co-infections are frequently&#xD;
      observed due to shared routes of transmission, with reported figures indicating 6-9% of&#xD;
      HIV-infected individuals in developed countries are chronically infected with HBV. HIV&#xD;
      infection impacts on the natural progression of HBV infection, increasing levels of HBV&#xD;
      replication and the risk of liver-associated mortality. Liver diseases associated with HBV&#xD;
      are affected by the antiviral drugs used for HIV infection (toxic side effects), the current&#xD;
      immune function in the patient, by improvements in the immune system brought about by control&#xD;
      of the HIV infection, and by the development of resistance to the antiviral agents used for&#xD;
      both the hepatitis B and the HIV infection. Tenofovir (TDF) is a newer antiviral drug that is&#xD;
      frequently used for HIV infection and is also highly active against hepatitis B; however it&#xD;
      is still unknown whether resistance to TDF will eventually develop and how this will affect&#xD;
      the long-term outcomes&#xD;

      Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a nucleotide analogue that can inhibit both HIV and&#xD;
      HBV DNA polymerases, and is active against wild-type HBV and HBV strains that contain&#xD;
      lamivudine-associated polymerase gene mutations (Dore, Cooper et al. 2004). TDF was approved&#xD;
      for use, in combination with other antiretrovirals, for HIV therapy in April 2002 in&#xD;
      Australia. It is not currently approved for use in Australia for treatment of HBV&#xD;
      mono-infection. TDF has only recently become available in Thailand where HIV/HBV co-infected&#xD;
      individuals are predominantly infected with genotype B and C. In contrast, in Australia and&#xD;
      Europe, the dominant HBV genotype in HIV/HBV co-infected individuals is A and D. As with all&#xD;
      antiviral agents there is concern with long-term use and the development of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a report of a signature mutation leading to TDF resistance at rtA194T (Sheldon&#xD;
      et al., 2005). We recently conducted a retrospective study of HIV/HBV co infected individuals&#xD;
      in Melbourne who had received TDF for at least 3 months. Twenty-eight patients had samples&#xD;
      available on TDF of which four (~14%) had detectable HBV DNA by PCR. We did not identify the&#xD;
      mutation rtA194T or rtV214A/Q215S in individuals failing TDF and found that the only&#xD;
      persisting mutations were LMV-resistant mutations. These findings highlight the need for a&#xD;
      surveillance system for HIV-HBV co-infected individuals receiving TDF for the detection of&#xD;
      novel mutations in the four major HBV genotypes. In addition, it is important to determine&#xD;
      the clinical and virological risk factors for TDF failure. This is particularly important&#xD;
      given that these agents will be used indefinitely in this patient population and with the&#xD;
      development of unique drug resistant mutations there will be implications for progression of&#xD;
      liver disease and future therapeutic choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit patients who are co-infected with HIV and HBV, and are currently&#xD;
      taking or who are about to commence the anti-HIV drug TDF. The study cohort will include&#xD;
      HIV-HBV co-infected individuals from the Alfred Hospital and Melbourne Sexual Health Clinic.&#xD;
      Other sites, not covered by this application, are St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney and King&#xD;
      Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to identify any changes in the HBV DNA that might be associated with&#xD;
      resistance to TDF, to determine how long any changes take to occur and to determine the&#xD;
      effect of these changes on the clinical response to TDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be achieved by 6 monthly assessment over a 2 year period, with medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, routine clinical investigations, hepatitis B activity and HBV DNA&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
