    <textblock>
      Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is the term for medical products and/or&#xD;
      practices that are not part of the current standard of care. Standard care is what medical&#xD;
      doctors, doctors of osteopathy and allied health professionals, such as registered nurses and&#xD;
      physical therapists, practice. Alternative medicine means treatments that you use instead of&#xD;
      standard ones. Complementary medicine means nonstandard treatments that you use along with&#xD;
      standard ones. The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is any improvement in&#xD;
      symptoms reported by patients with chronic painful bladder syndrome when participating in&#xD;
      alternative medical therapy/ exercise and meditative techniques. The specific alternative&#xD;
      techniques participants will be randomized to in this trial include: Tai Chi instruction or&#xD;
      walking exercise combined with sitting meditation.&#xD;

      Participants will be referred for trial screening if they have a diagnosis of painful bladder&#xD;
      syndrome/IC in the opinion of the investigator. Participants will be required to read the&#xD;
      informed consent form and sign it prior to the screening of any medical information. The&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be reviewed and participants who qualify will complete the visit&#xD;
      one study screening procedures. Participants will be asked to track there daily pain level&#xD;
      and medication use for 7 days prior to randomization an in addition will be required to&#xD;
      complete one 24-hour void diary during this same screening time period. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to give a urine sample on the day of screening and the day of randomization to screen&#xD;
      for bladder infection. Female participants will be asked to provide a urine sample for&#xD;
      pregnancy testing prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be required to be on a stable medical regime for 30 days prior to&#xD;
      randomization. No new IC therapy or new pain treatments will be allowed to begin during the&#xD;
      screening period and/or the 3 month study trial period. Participants will be allowed to&#xD;
      continue on any IC/pain therapy they have used prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization to the treatment groups will occur 5-7 days prior to treatment start date. At&#xD;
      that visit the patient#s medical history will be reviewed for eligibility and adverse events.&#xD;
      The recorded pain scores collected and all quality of life measurements obtained.&#xD;
      Participants who continue to qualify will be randomized to the specified treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once 12 participants have been screened and are ready for randomization the participants will&#xD;
      be scheduled for the randomization visit--Participants assigned to the Tai Chi group will be&#xD;
      instructed on the logistics of the class, participants in this group will attend two&#xD;
      classes/week- each class will be 1.5 hours in duration. The first 30 minutes will consist of&#xD;
      standing meditation and progressive relaxation, the remaining 60 minutes will be TaiChi form&#xD;
      instruction. The classes will meet bi-weekly for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by the blinded coordinator at 2 week intervals to assess pain&#xD;
      level, medication use, and adverse event monitoring, all data will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise/meditation group will receive guided imagery CD and a pedometer to record the&#xD;
      distance walked/bimonthly assessment. Participants will be asked to reserve 90 minutes twice&#xD;
      weekly to complete the 30 min of walking exercise followed immediately by the 60 min of&#xD;
      relaxation/mediation using the CD provided to them by the study. Participants will be asked&#xD;
      to complete the exercise on the same days and times each week. The study coordinator will&#xD;
      contact the participants every 2 weeks to assess pain level, medication use, and monitor for&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will not be responsible for the costs of the Tai Chi classes, pedometer, and&#xD;
      relaxation-guided imagery CD. Participants will be required to provide the CD player;&#xD;
      patients will not be eligible if they do not have access to one. Participants will not be&#xD;
      reimbursed for travel costs to the Tai Chi classes. Participants will be seen in clinic for&#xD;
      the end-point evaluation 3-7 days after 3 month treatment period.&#xD;
