  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present study is to examine the utility of probiotics as an adjunctive&#xD;
      therapy (in addition to patients' pharmacotherapy) for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that specifically selected probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L.&#xD;
      reuteri RC-14, can alleviate symptoms of RA and thereby increase the daily activity of these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients between 18 - 80 years old who have Rheumatoid arthritis with at least 4 swollen and&#xD;
      tender joints will be randomized to receive by mouth two capsules containing placebo or&#xD;
      probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and L. reuteri RC-14, daily. The subjects will&#xD;
      continue to take the placebo or probiotic, in addition to their RA medications (i.e. ongoing&#xD;
      medication and/or other therapy, such as physiotherapy are permitted, except immunotherapy)&#xD;
      for three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 0 (visit #1) (when recruited and just prior to starting to take capsules), at day 45&#xD;
      (visit #2), and at day 90 (visit #3), blood samples of approximately 40 ml of blood (8&#xD;
      teaspoons) will be collected by clinical technicians working in the Lab Test Centre at St.&#xD;
      Joseph's Health Center. The blood samples will be used to evaluate Erythrocyte Sedimentation&#xD;
      Rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein level. In addition, immunological markers like TNFα, IL-12,&#xD;
      IL-10 and G-CSF will also be measured. Serum creatinine and liver function will be evaluated&#xD;
      as parameters of any side effects of the probiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probiotics/placebo will be dispensed from the pharmacy and provided to the subjects by the&#xD;
      study investigator at the first visit (for the first 45 days) and second visit (for the final&#xD;
      45 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 0, 45 and 90 (visits 1, 2 and 3) a physical exam will be completed, where the&#xD;
      physician will count the number of swollen and tender joints and complete the Physician&#xD;
      Global Assessment of Disease activity. In addition, at these times, the patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete the following self-administered questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's Global Assessment of Disease Activity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Assessment of Pain and Assessment of Duration of Morning stiffness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked about feeling fatigued or sleepy, as these are standard questions&#xD;
      that come with the above-mentioned questionnaires. These are simple questionnaires that will&#xD;
      take approximately 15 minutes to complete. In visit 2 and 3 the physician will confirm if the&#xD;
      participant is taking the study capsule/placebo correctly, review any new medications the&#xD;
      patient has taken since the last visit and will ask about adverse events that may have&#xD;
      occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At day 90, subjects will stop taking capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up phone call will take place 30 days after the completion of the study medication&#xD;
      (day 120). If a patient is withdrawn or withdraws from the study prematurely, he/she will be&#xD;
      asked to receive a follow-up telephone call 30 days from the date they last took the study&#xD;
      product. During the phone call, which should not take more than 10 minutes, the participant&#xD;
      will be asked about any medications taken in the past month and about any possible side&#xD;
      effects (unwanted effects or health problems) that they may have experienced.&#xD;
