  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over half of adults in this country are overweight. This increases risk for heart and blood&#xD;
      pressure problems, cancer, stroke and arthritis. While it is difficult to lose large amounts&#xD;
      of weight and keep it off, even small amounts of weight loss can improve health. Furthermore,&#xD;
      fat is increasingly recognized as a source of substances that increase inflammation. It may&#xD;
      be that some of the adverse consequences of being overweight are due to increased&#xD;
      inflammation. We are asking you to volunteer for a research study in which you may lose a&#xD;
      moderate amount of weight and increase your activity. It is important that you read and&#xD;
      understand the information on this form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of these studies are to determine the influence(s) of age and body composition&#xD;
      on the production of inflammatory chemicals by fat (adipose tissue), the mechanisms&#xD;
      controlling this, and if a weight loss and aerobic exercise intervention results in a&#xD;
      decrease in inflammation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adipose tissue is increasingly recognized as more than an inert depot serving not only to&#xD;
      accept and store excess energy in the form of triglycerides, but also to secrete hormones and&#xD;
      adipokines that have substantial effects on lipid and glucose metabolism. Furthermore, there&#xD;
      are depot differences in metabolic function, as well as adipokine content. However, the&#xD;
      physiology both underlying and consequential to these observations remains unknown. This&#xD;
      research is therefore designed to examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) the effects of aging and obesity on regional adipokine secretion and expression, 2)&#xD;
      whether elevated adipokine levels in older obese people are due to increased macrophage&#xD;
      infiltration into subcutaneous adipose tissue and/or related to total, subcutaneous or&#xD;
      visceral abdominal fat (SAT or VAT) distribution, and 3) the relationship of adipokines to&#xD;
      insulin resistance and the constituents of the metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, we aim to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. if the expression and secretion of a) the inflammatory markers SAA, IL-6, TNF-a, MCP-1&#xD;
           is greater, and b) the anti-inflammatory hormone adiponectin is lower in SC abdominal&#xD;
           and gluteal adipose tissue from older, compared to middle-aged and younger obese&#xD;
           subjects across a narrow range of obesity and waist circumference;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. if these age-associated changes in adipokine production are a)due to the degree of&#xD;
           macrophage infiltration of regional adipose tissue, and/or differences in a greater&#xD;
           degree of visceral and/or differences in ABD fat distribution (SAT, VAT), and b) related&#xD;
           to glucose and lipid metabolic profiles of the subjects; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the effects of a WL+AEX intervention on regional adipokine expression and secretion,&#xD;
           circulating levels of CRP and the above adipokines, and glucose and lipid metabolism in&#xD;
           a subset of obese sedentary individuals with greater than two components of the&#xD;
           metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
