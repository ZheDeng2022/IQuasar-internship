    <textblock>
      ALV003-0812 is a study of the safety and tolerability of a study drug (ALV003) in healthy&#xD;
      adult volunteers and in patients with well-controlled celiac disease, following a meal that&#xD;
      contains gluten.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ALV003-0812 (the FED study) is designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      dose of the study drug, ALV003, administered at one of four different dose levels, and&#xD;
      following a test meal containing a small amount (1 gram) of gluten. ALV003 has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to proteolyze (assist with the digestion of) various forms of gluten (gluten&#xD;
      flour, wheat bread) in laboratory studies and in animals. Celiac disease has been estimated&#xD;
      to affect 1% of the population of the United States, is related to gluten, and has a wide&#xD;
      range of clinical manifestations including chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, malabsorption,&#xD;
      and bone disease.&#xD;
