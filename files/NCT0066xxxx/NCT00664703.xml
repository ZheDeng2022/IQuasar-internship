      The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the nonstimulant medication lobeline in&#xD;
      improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 8 million adults in the&#xD;
      United States. Adults with ADHD may experience difficulty concentrating, poor organization&#xD;
      ability, mood swings, and trouble completing work. If not managed properly, ADHD can lead to&#xD;
      behavioral, emotional, academic, social, and work-related problems. Neurobiological research&#xD;
      has shown that people with ADHD exhibit low levels of dopamine, a neurotransmitter of the&#xD;
      brain that controls a person's ability to concentrate and focus on surroundings. Lobeline, a&#xD;
      nonstimulant medication that acts to alter dopamine uptake, may be effective in improving&#xD;
      abnormalities in brain dopamine levels. Although lobeline has been successfully used as a&#xD;
      smoking cessation aid because of its ability to inhibit nicotine-induced hyperactivity, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of lobeline as a treatment for ADHD has not been explored. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of lobeline in improving adult ADHD symptoms, specifically&#xD;
      inattention, impulsivity, and memory problems. This study will also evaluate any side effects&#xD;
      of lobeline treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last between 4 and 5 weeks, during which participants will&#xD;
      attend 10 study visits at the General Clinical Research Center (GCRC). Participants will&#xD;
      first undergo a medical evaluation visit that will include a physical exam, electrocardiogram&#xD;
      (EKG), blood draw, urine testing, and breath sampling. Participants will then return for an&#xD;
      orientation visit to complete questionnaires and to receive training on the computer and on&#xD;
      memory tasks to be performed during later visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next 7 visits will comprise the laboratory testing and medication treatment portion of&#xD;
      the study. Each visit will last 4.5 hours and will include urine and breath sampling,&#xD;
      computer and memory tasks, questionnaires, vital sign measurements, and medication&#xD;
      distribution. Participants will be randomly assigned to take two different pills at each lab&#xD;
      visit. One pill will be a placebo of lobeline or methylphenidate, a medication stimulant used&#xD;
      in treating ADHD, and the other pill will be active lobeline or methylphenidate. Drug&#xD;
      combinations and doses will vary each day, but participants will never receive two active&#xD;
      pills on the same day. All participants will undergo a follow-up evaluation between 7 and 14&#xD;
      days after the final lab visit. The evaluation will include questions about side effects from&#xD;
      study medication, breath and urine sampling, a blood draw, and a physical exam.&#xD;
