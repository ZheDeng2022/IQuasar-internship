      After surgery, patients who have cardiogram changes consistent with a lack of oxygen to the&#xD;
      heart muscles, also known as myocardial ischemia, have been found to have 9 times the chance&#xD;
      of having an event such as a heart attack during the subsequent 30 days. It is not known if&#xD;
      monitoring and treating ischemia will prevent events such as heart attacks. It is not known&#xD;
      if such monitoring and treatment can be done on the regular surgical wards. In this pilot&#xD;
      study, we hope to demonstrate that such a study is feasible, and the maintenance of blinding&#xD;
      is possible. The primary outcomes are to show that such monitoring after surgery is possible&#xD;
      in ≥ 95% of patients, to show that response and treatment to such ischemia in ≤ 1 hour is&#xD;
      possible in ≥ 90% of patients, and that blinding between the standard and active treatment&#xD;
      groups is possible for 50% ± 1 s.d.. With the pilot study data, if successful, we will be&#xD;
      applying for peer-reviewed funding for a full study.&#xD;

      Perioperative myocardial ischemia has been studied in the pre-, intra-, and postoperative&#xD;
      periods. The intraoperative incidence is similar to the preoperative period but the&#xD;
      postoperative incidence is doubled that of the preoperative period. These results have two&#xD;
      implications: postoperative myocardial ischemia cannot be predicted by preoperative&#xD;
      ambulatory ECG monitoring since only half of those are seen preoperatively; the postoperative&#xD;
      period is when significant myocardial ischemia occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of myocardial ischemia, especially prolonged ischemia, in perioperative myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (PMI) has been recognized by a number of investigators. In the presence of&#xD;
      postoperative myocardial ischemia, the relative risk of a postoperative cardiac event was 16&#xD;
      in one study and the odds ratio for an ischemic cardiac event was 9.2 in another. Using&#xD;
      12-lead continuous monitoring, one study found that all PMI were preceded by myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ambulatory ECG in the postoperative period has been well reported in the past. Recently,&#xD;
      Landesberg reported the sensitivity and specificity of lead placements to detect myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia in the postoperative period. Lead combinations were compared with continuous 12-lead&#xD;
      ECG in 185 consecutive patients. Combining two precordial leads, the sensitivity for&#xD;
      detecting ischemia was 97.4% for V3 + V5; 92.1% for V4 + V5; and for infarction was 100% for&#xD;
      V3 + V5 or V4 + V5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that the pathogenesis of PMI is multifactorial. Apart from the coronary anatomy&#xD;
      and the vulnerable plaque, stress hormones and catecholamine surges in the perioperative&#xD;
      period are well reported. Stress increases systolic BP, which is a major determinant of LV&#xD;
      wall tension, and hence, myocardial oxygen demand. The oxygen cost of &quot;pressure work&quot; is&#xD;
      greater than &quot;volume work&quot;, with the area-under-the-curve for LV pressure closely correlating&#xD;
      with myocardial oxygen demand. Hypercoagulable state has also been implicated in PMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With so many possible pathogenesis, it is our belief therefore that postoperative myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia may be one of the final pathways just before postoperative ischemic cardiac&#xD;
      complications. This is especially so when all PMI were preceded by myocardial ischemia in one&#xD;
      study. With potentially multiple pathogenesis, it is unknown if postoperative myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia is amenable to treatment. It is, however, our belief that postoperative myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia can be aborted using existing treatment modalities. The implication is that the&#xD;
      reduction of postoperative myocardial ischemia may reduce the incidence of postoperative&#xD;
      ischemic cardiac complications, including PMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current standard of care does not include telemetry or real-time ST monitoring on surgical&#xD;
      patients. Traditional telemetry would impede low-risk patients in their postoperative&#xD;
      recovery by limiting them to their beds. In the context of real-time monitoring for ST&#xD;
      changes in low-risk patients, the cost of traditional telemetry with nursing may also be&#xD;
      prohibitive. We propose a novel technological application, transmitting wireless ST segment&#xD;
      monitoring and alarms to a Blackberry. This will alert the research team to verify via &quot;full&#xD;
      disclosure&quot; on the ST monitor and respond directly. SpaceLab, GlobeStar, and Research in&#xD;
      Motion (RIM) have developed the hardware and software respectively. We currently have written&#xD;
      assurances and support from SpaceLab, GlobeStar, and RIM to conduct a pilot study for this&#xD;
      novel application (see attached). We therefore propose a pilot study to determine the&#xD;
      feasibility of wireless ST-segment monitoring and its treatment in post-surgical patients.&#xD;
