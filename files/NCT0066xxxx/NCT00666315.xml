      New haemostatic techniques have been developed with the advent of laparoscopic surgery. Among&#xD;
      other things, ultrasound instruments have been used for the dissection, division and&#xD;
      coagulation of vessels and other tissue. Previous studies in Thyroidectomy observed a&#xD;
      clinically and economically significant reduction in operating time with no increase in the&#xD;
      complication rate when the Harmonic device has been used. The aim of the present clinical&#xD;
      trial is to evaluate potential advantages of a new Harmonic device (FOCUS), developed&#xD;
      especially for Thyroid procedures, in the use of HS in thyroidectomies when compared with EC&#xD;
      in terms of operative time, number of ligatures, QoL, blood loss, pain intensity at the&#xD;
      surgical site, amount of drainage, and complications, including the incidence of RLN palsy&#xD;
      and hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;

      Thyroidectomy is one of the most frequently performed operations in endocrine surgery.&#xD;
      Results are generally excellent, and morbidity and mortality are usually negligible. The&#xD;
      operation requires proper identification of important structures such as the recurrent&#xD;
      laryngeal nerve (RLN) and the parathyroid glands. Meticulous dissection and exhaustive&#xD;
      hemostasis are important to ensure a dry field and to avoid inadvertent damage to the&#xD;
      adjacent structures. The two most common techniques for hemostasis are suture ligatures and&#xD;
      electrocoagulation. The use of electrocoagulation (EC) to control bleeding has the potential&#xD;
      risk of injuring the surrounding structures from lateral dispersion of heat. New haemostatic&#xD;
      techniques have been developed with the advent of laparoscopic surgery. Among other things,&#xD;
      ultrasound instruments have been used for the dissection, division and coagulation of vessels&#xD;
      and other tissue. Previous studies in Thyroidectomy observed a clinically and economically&#xD;
      significant reduction in operating time with no increase in the complication rate when the&#xD;
      Harmonic device has been used. The aim of the present clinical trial is to evaluate potential&#xD;
      advantages of a new Harmonic device (FOCUS), developed especially for Thyroid procedures, in&#xD;
      the use of HS in thyroidectomies when compared with EC in terms of operative time, number of&#xD;
      ligatures, QoL, blood loss, pain intensity at the surgical site, amount of drainage, and&#xD;
      complications, including the incidence of RLN palsy and hypoparathyroidism.&#xD;
