  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Split thickness skin grafting is the transplantation of a patient's own cutaneous tissue&#xD;
      harvested from an area of normal skin, to replace an area of skin loss or injury. The split&#xD;
      thickness skin graft (SSG) is one of the most commonly performed operations in plastic and&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery1. Indications for split skin grafting include: reconstruction after&#xD;
      the surgical removal of cutaneous malignancies, to replace tissue lost in full-thickness&#xD;
      burns and to cover chronic non-healing cutaneous ulcers. As with all grafting procedures, a&#xD;
      donor site wound is created, and, in the case of SSGs, the wound is a partial-thickness wound&#xD;
      that heals by re-epithelialisation. Often, the graft donor site is the slowest to heal, and&#xD;
      it is the source of most of the postoperative discomfort. In patients who have sustained&#xD;
      major burns affecting large percentages of their cutaneous surface area, early closure of&#xD;
      burn wounds with autologous skin grafts can be limited by the lack of adequate donor sites.&#xD;
      These donor sites may need to be re-harvested to provide further skin cover; however a delay&#xD;
      of 2 to 3 weeks is often required to allow these sites to heal prior to re-harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment to accelerate the healing of SSG donor sites produced after harvest would address&#xD;
      an area of high medical need, not only by providing an area available for re-harvest, but&#xD;
      also by reducing the potential associated morbidities to the patient including pain and&#xD;
      infection. This could also reduce length of hospital stay with associated reduced healthcare&#xD;
      costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transforming growth factor betas (TGF-beta), are a naturally occurring protein which plays a&#xD;
      central role in the wound healing response. Juvidex is being developed by Renovo as a&#xD;
      therapeutic agent administered to accelerate the healing of acute wounds. The proposed&#xD;
      mechanism of action is antagonistic and involves inhibiting the activation of TGF-beta 1 and&#xD;
      TGF beta 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using healthy volunteers is an ideal way of studying the healing process on split thickness&#xD;
      skin graft donor sites since the donor sites can be created so that they are exactly&#xD;
      anatomically matched. These matched pairs can then be used to compare drug against placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is being undertaken to assess the effects of intradermally injected and topically&#xD;
      applied Juvidex on the healing of small skin graft donor sites in volunteer subjects. The&#xD;
      trial will also compare the effects of a placebo treatment with standard care alone in the&#xD;
      healing of the donor sites. This will enable any placebo effect to be accurately measured and&#xD;
      allow an accurate assessment of actual drug effect.&#xD;
