  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total joint arthroplasty are common operations among the elderly population. The&#xD;
      postoperative patients' rehabilitation process may be influenced by a variety of factors,&#xD;
      such as age, BMI, perioperative hemoglobin levels, pain perception, comorbidities, etc.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, only a few well controlled studies evaluated the effect of various factors on&#xD;
      patients' rehabilitation short-term outcome. Furthermore, no scale has been developed, that&#xD;
      can predict patients' rehabilitation and functioning levels 6 weeks postoperatively. In the&#xD;
      current study we wish to evaluate the effect on patients' function that the following factors&#xD;
      have: age, BMI, admission and discharge hemoglobin levels, pain perception, type of operation&#xD;
      (TKA versus THA), intensity of postoperative physiotherapy, involvement of other joints by&#xD;
      the primary pathology, comorbidities, and self assessed health status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to quantify patients' level of functioning, several tests will be used: hand grip&#xD;
      strength, Timed up and go test (TUG) and Oxford knee and hip score. The factors that will be&#xD;
      found statistically significantly associated with level of functioning, will be used in an&#xD;
      attempt to develop a scale that will predict the level of functioning 6 weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a scale can allow preoperative identification of patients at high risk of postoperative&#xD;
      low functioning levels and the application of a unique rehabilitation program, for only these&#xD;
      patients, in order to optimize their functioning.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, analytical, approximately 6 months long study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately a 100 patients, scheduled for an elective arthroplasty will be recruited for&#xD;
      the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Males and females above 18 years of age, speaking Hebrew, English or Russian, scheduled&#xD;
           for an elective unilateral (one joint) primary total joint arthroplasty of hip or knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Available for follow up 1.5-2 months after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient above the age of 18 and eligible to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Scheduled for elective unilateral (one joint), primary total joint arthroplasty of hip&#xD;
           or knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stepping with the operated leg is allowed after the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients unwilling to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with complications preventing regular rehabilitation, e.g. Myocardial&#xD;
           Infarction, Pulmonary Embolism, Pneumonia, and infection or fracture of the joint.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with any complication that prevents stepping with the operated leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prior to the scheduled operation, the following data regarding the patient will be&#xD;
           collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gender, age, height, weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Comorbidities (using Katz Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Type of scheduled operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Involvement by the primary pathology of joints other than the one being operated&#xD;
                (by patient questioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hemoglobin level at admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Self assessed health status (by patient questioning).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain perception in the operated leg (using VAS Score).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In addition, the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of muscle strength using handgrip machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Evaluation of motor functioning level using the TUG test and the Oxford knee and&#xD;
                hip score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During the postoperative hospitalization period, hemoglobin and CRP levels will be&#xD;
           checked, and the patients will be evaluated for complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In the follow up visit, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Complications after discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood transfusions in this period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Duration of time in rehabilitation program, and intensity of physiotherapy given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the visit, the following tests will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of muscle strength using handgrip machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of motor functioning level, similar to the one performed preoperatively,&#xD;
           using the TUG test and the Oxford knee and hip score.&#xD;
