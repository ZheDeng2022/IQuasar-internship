      The primary objective of this randomized, parallel group, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study is to determine whether treatment with metformin enhances insulin sensitivity in a&#xD;
      group of ethnically diverse obese insulin-resistant adolescents with normal glucose&#xD;
      tolerance.&#xD;

      First Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who agree to participate in this research study, will have an initial screening&#xD;
      where the subject will be asked about his/her health, a sample of blood will be drawn, the&#xD;
      subject will be examined, and an oral glucose tolerance (OGTT) test will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OGTT: The study takes about four hours and will begin on an &quot;empty stomach.&quot; A small&#xD;
           I.V. will be placed in a vein in the subject's arm. The I.V. will allow a member of the&#xD;
           research team to take small amounts of blood for measuring glucose and other substances&#xD;
           that circulate in the blood. About 7 tablespoons of blood will be drawn in total during&#xD;
           the OGTT. The I.V. will remain in place all during the study. At the beginning of the&#xD;
           study, the subject will be asked to drink about 8 ounces (one cup) of a high sugar cola-&#xD;
           or orange-flavored drink.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject meets all the requirements to be in the study and has a normal glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test, he/she will be randomized to either the intensely (Euglycemic&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic clamp) or standard studied group and have the following six or seven tests&#xD;
      performed: DEXA scan and Tanita, exercise step test, PAT test, MRI (Abdominal scan), MRS (leg&#xD;
      scan), and Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (intensely studied group only). All of the tests&#xD;
      are described below. Females will have a urine pregnancy test before each of these tests. If&#xD;
      positive, the subject will not be allowed to participate/continue with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA / Tanita: The DEXA scan will measure how much muscle and fat is in the subject's&#xD;
           body and how dense the subject's bones are using an x-ray technique. Directly after the&#xD;
           DEXA Scan, the subject's percentage of body fat will be measured using a Tanita scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exercise Step Test: The subject will be asked to step up and down two steps 20 times at&#xD;
           their own pace. We will measure the subject's heart rate directly before and for three&#xD;
           minutes after this exercise. After a ten minute break, the test will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peripheral Arterial Tonometry (PAT): This test will allow us to evaluate the response of&#xD;
           the small blood vessels in the subject's arm to changes in nerve signals to them. During&#xD;
           this test, we will put a probe (similar to a tight-fitting glove) on one finger of each&#xD;
           of the subject's hands and take some measurements for about five minutes. The probes&#xD;
           contain latex, so this test will not be performed on subjects who are allergic to latex.&#xD;
           Following these measurements, we will block blood flow to one of the hands for five&#xD;
           minutes by putting a blood pressure cuff on one of the arms and inflating the cuff.&#xD;
           After the pressure in the cuff is released, we will take more measurements for about&#xD;
           five minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI (Belly Scan): Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) will be used to take pictures of the&#xD;
           subject's belly. These pictures will allow us to calculate how much fat the subject has&#xD;
           just below the skin and how much fat is deeper inside the belly. We will also be able to&#xD;
           estimate the percentage of fat in the subject's liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRS (Leg scan): We will measure how much fat is in the subject's calf muscle using&#xD;
           magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Insulin, Glucose and Glycerol Infusion Study (Euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp): A&#xD;
           small I.V. will be placed into a vein in each arm. One I.V. will be used to take out&#xD;
           small amounts of blood for measuring the blood sugar and other substances that circulate&#xD;
           in the blood. The other I.V. will be used to infuse insulin, glucose, and glycerol into&#xD;
           the subject's blood. Insulin is a hormone that helps bring blood sugar into the cells.&#xD;
           Glycerol is a component of fat that is normally present in a person's body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This infusion will not affect the subject's blood sugar in a harmful manner. It will allow us&#xD;
      to follow the release of glucose from the liver and glycerol from fat tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's blood sugar will be checked closely during the study by taking blood samples&#xD;
      from the second I.V. Readings of the blood sugar on each sample will be made at the bedside.&#xD;
      If the blood sugar starts to fall, it can be fixed right away. At the end of another three&#xD;
      hours, the infusion will be stopped and the subject will eat a meal that will be provided for&#xD;
      him/her. The infusion of glucose will be reduced while the subject is eating until the&#xD;
      subject's blood sugar is stable. This test takes about 6 hours. The total amount of blood&#xD;
      drawn during this test will be less than 8 tablespoons or about half a cup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect calorimetry is a way to measure how much sugar and fat a person is burning when we&#xD;
      give insulin. Testing how much fat and sugar a subject burns is an important part of the&#xD;
      insulin, glucose, and glycerol infusion study. Therefore we will ask the subject to wear a&#xD;
      plastic hood (like an astronaut space helmet) before starting the infusion of insulin and at&#xD;
      two other times during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking Metformin or Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the subject has completed the six (standard studied group) or seven (intensely studied&#xD;
      group only) tests described above, as well as two urine tests for protein, he/she will be&#xD;
      randomized to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take Metformin; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take a placebo pill&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will begin by taking one pill (either Metformin or placebo) every day, just&#xD;
      before supper. The dose will be slowly increased as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1: Before breakfast = 0 and Before supper = 1 (500mg); Week 2: Before breakfast = 1&#xD;
      (500mg) and Before supper = 1 (500mg); Week 3-14: Before breakfast = 1 (500mg) and Before&#xD;
      supper = 2 (500mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject will be taking the pills for 3 1/2 months, during which time we will ask that&#xD;
      he/she keep a diary of any complaints, problems, or symptoms. Neither the subject, the&#xD;
      subject's doctor, nor any of the members of the research team will find out which pill the&#xD;
      subject was taking until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monthly Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to come back every month for a physical exam. We will measure their&#xD;
      height, weight, and blood pressure each time. A urine pregnancy test will be done on all&#xD;
      female participants at every visit. At the subject's first follow up visit we will draw a&#xD;
      small amount of blood and run tests to make sure the subject is healthy. We will ask the&#xD;
      subject and his/her parent about any symptoms that the subject has had, any pills that he/she&#xD;
      might have missed taking, and the use of other medications. We will measure the subject's&#xD;
      vitamin B12 level on his/her third follow up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      About three months after the subject begins taking the Metformin or placebo pills, he/she&#xD;
      will repeat the tests described above (oral glucose tolerance test, DEXA and Tanita, exercise&#xD;
      step test, PAT test, MRI, and MRS). In the sub-group of participants who had the glucose,&#xD;
      insulin, and glycerol infusion test, this will also be repeated at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open Label Phase (Taking Metformin)&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the tests described above are completed, all participants (even if they had been&#xD;
      assigned a placebo pill) will be given the choice of taking Metformin for the next six&#xD;
      months. If the subject does choose to continue, we will continue to monitor him/her monthly,&#xD;
      as described in the section above on monthly follow-up. At the end of the additional six&#xD;
      months, we will repeat all the tests that the subject had at the beginning of the study. For&#xD;
      the intensely studied group, this includes the insulin, glucose and glycerol infusion.&#xD;
