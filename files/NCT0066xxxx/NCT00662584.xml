  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive method that holds&#xD;
      promise for treating several psychiatric disorders. Yet the most effective location and&#xD;
      parameters for treatment need more exploration. Also, whether rTMS is an effective treatment&#xD;
      for individuals with a DSM-IV diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) has not been&#xD;
      empirically tested. The goal of this pilot study is to evaluate whether fMRI guided rTMS is&#xD;
      effective in reducing symptoms of GAD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study utilized a 3-week open-label design to evaluate the efficacy of fMRI guided rTMS&#xD;
      in the treatment of GAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We first used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during the gambling task to&#xD;
      localize anxiety-related brain activations in each individual participant, and then used this&#xD;
      information to guide treatment with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TMS was delivered to the target site at a frequency of 1 Hz for 20 minutes (900 total&#xD;
      pulses). The intensity of the TMS was set to 90% of the passive motor threshold for each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy measures include the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)&#xD;
      and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Response to treatment was defined as a&#xD;
      reduction of 50% or more on the HARS and symptom remission was defined as a CGI-I score of 1&#xD;
      or 2 (&quot;much improved&quot; or &quot;very much improved&quot; respectively) and a score â‰¤ 8 on the HARS. Data&#xD;
      was entered anonymously into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed by the UCLA Semel Institute&#xD;
      Statistical Core. The analysis was done on the intent to treat sample using last observation&#xD;
      carried forward (LOCF). A one-sample paired t-test was used to compare endpoint to baseline&#xD;
      means on the HARS, with a significance level set at p= 0.05, two-tailed.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is male or female outpatients age 18 to 65 years, inclusive&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject meets DSM-IV criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder as determined by&#xD;
             the MINI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active female patients of childbearing potential must be practicing at least&#xD;
             one or more the following methods of contraception during the study: intrauterine&#xD;
             device (IUD), barrier method in combination with a spermicide, oral/hormonal&#xD;
             contraception or abstinence. Female patients of childbearing potential must have a&#xD;
             negative pregnancy test prior to receiving study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from the subject prior to study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject is in good medical health or with chronic medical conditions which are&#xD;
             currently stable.&#xD;
