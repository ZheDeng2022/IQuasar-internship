  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intubation is frequently required for trauma patients as part of the resuscitative effort.&#xD;
      When the stability of the cervical spine is unknown, the potential for spinal cord damage&#xD;
      during intubation is significant; the question of the safest intubating technique has not&#xD;
      been resolved. Previous Studies have evaluated Macintosh Laryngoscopy, Bullard Laryngoscope,&#xD;
      face mask ventilation, fibre-optic guided oral and nasal intubation, esophageal Combitube®,&#xD;
      Laryngeal Mask Airway® (LMA), and Intubating Laryngeal Mask Airway® (ILMA) use with respect&#xD;
      to cervical spine movement. Our previous study evaluated the Intubating Lighted Stylet&#xD;
      (Lightwand®) and GlideScope® versus the Macintosh Laryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another method of securing endotracheal intubation, approved and in routine use, is the&#xD;
      AirTraq® videolaryngoscope (ProMedic, Inc, Bonita Springs, FL, USA). The AirTraq&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope is a videolaryngoscope with an external video display of the glottic&#xD;
      opening and an endotracheal tube track to guide the ETT through the vocal cords&#xD;
      (www.airtraq.com). When a clear view of the vocal cords is obtained, the endotracheal tube&#xD;
      may be advanced into the trachea. This technique can be performed rapidly and safely and&#xD;
      there is the perception that it involves less cervical spine movement than direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study the AirTraq videolaryngoscope to determine if its use would result in&#xD;
      reduced cervical spine movement during intubation.&#xD;

      With the surgeon's consent, informed and written consent will be ob¬tained from patients who&#xD;
      are undergoing elective surgery requiring general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
      Preoperative clinical assessment of the patients will include routine airway evaluation of&#xD;
      dentition, mouth opening, tongue size, Mallampati score, and neck mobility, as well as&#xD;
      height, weight, and age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While awake, the patients will be placed on the operating room table with a rigid board under&#xD;
      their head, neck, and torso in order to simulate the table on which patients involved in&#xD;
      trauma are placed in the emergency room. In-line stabilization (ILS), as recommended by the&#xD;
      ATLS guidelines, will be applied to maintain the patient's head in the neutral position and&#xD;
      reduce neck movement dur¬ing laryngoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After standard pre-oxygenation, anesthesia will be induced in routine fashion with 2 3 mg/kg&#xD;
      propofol and 2-5 mcg/kg fentanyl; rocuro¬nium 0.8 mg/kg will be administered to effect muscle&#xD;
      paralysis. The patient will be then be ventilated with 100% O2 via bag/mask for 3 minutes.&#xD;
      (Oxygenation with 100% O2 provides an oxygen reservoir for at least 5 minutes while&#xD;
      laryngoscopy is completed.) This is the standard of care in anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient is anesthetized, a sealed envelope containing computer a generated random&#xD;
      assignment will be opened. Laryngoscopy will then be performed two times, with the Macintosh&#xD;
      laryngoscope and with the AirTraq videolaryngoscope, in random order as determined by the&#xD;
      envelope. Between laryngoscopies, the patient will be ventilated with sevoflurane in 100%&#xD;
      oxygen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male patients will be intubated with an 8.0 mm inner diameter endotracheal tube (ETT) and&#xD;
      women with a 7.0 mm or 7.5 mm ETT at the discretion of the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For AirTraq videolaryngoscopy, the AirTraq will be inserted and a view of the vocal cords&#xD;
      will be obtained. The ETT will be advanced through the track until the tip of the ETT is&#xD;
      visible at the glottic opening and then removed with the AirTraq videolaryngoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For direct Macintosh laryngoscopy, a size 3 laryngoscope blade will be recommended in all&#xD;
      patients, but the anesthesiologist may choose another size if deemed necessary. With&#xD;
      laryngoscopy, the glottis will be exposed to enable positioning of the endotracheal tube at&#xD;
      the vocal cords.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the second laryngoscopy in the above sequence, the trachea will be intubated. The&#xD;
      study is then complete. The hard board will be removed and the surgery will proceed in the&#xD;
      usual fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The laryngoscopy and intubation will be recorded by a portable fluoroscopy unit for&#xD;
      subsequent review by the radiologist to assess cervical spine movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laryngoscopy time will be defined as the time from when the laryngoscope blade or AirTraq&#xD;
      videolaryngoscope passes the teeth of the patient until the time the endotracheal tube is&#xD;
      positioned at the opening of the larynx. If the intubation sequence is longer than 120&#xD;
      seconds, it will be deemed a failure and recorded as such.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cormack-Lehane score, representing the degree of glottic exposure, of the larynx will be&#xD;
      recorded for all patients. Blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure will be&#xD;
      recorded every minute during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To minimize inter-operator variability, all bag-mask ventilation, laryngoscopy, and&#xD;
      intubation will be completed by one person.&#xD;
