  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single institution non-randomized phase I/II trial for patients with malignant&#xD;
      mesothelioma stage II and above, who have not received prior chemotherapy for their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this phase is to select a dose of VEGF-AS (antiangiogenesis drug)to be given&#xD;
      with standard doses of pemetrexed followed by cisplatin on day 1 of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;

      The Study Objectives in Phase I are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the safety of the combination of VEGF-Antisense Oligonucleotide (VEGF-AS,&#xD;
      Veglin™) plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin in subjects with advanced Malignant Mesothelioma,.via&#xD;
      a dose escalation protocol. To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Dose Limiting&#xD;
      Toxicity (DLT) of VEGF-AS plus Premetrexed and Cisplatin. To determine the time to disease&#xD;
      progression To determine the objective response rate of the combination of VEGF-AS plus&#xD;
      Pemetrexed and Cisplatin for the treatment of advanced malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study Objectives in Phase II are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further characterize the toxicity experienced by patients with malignant mesothelioma&#xD;
      treated with VEGF-AS plus Cisplatin and Pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine median and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Laboratory objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To measure plasma VEGF levels before, during, and after therapy as a correlate of outcome. To&#xD;
      determine the pharmacokinetic profile of VEGF-AS plus Pemetrexed and Cisplatin.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant pleural&#xD;
             mesothelioma, epithelial, sarcomatoid, or mixed subtype&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease,using RECIST criteria.Pleural effusions and&#xD;
             ascites are not considered measurable lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pleural mesothelioma must be IMIG stage ≥II&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 2 and an estimated survival of at least&#xD;
             3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to1,500 Platelets greater than or equal to&#xD;
        100,000 Total bilirubin less than or equal to2.0x the upper limits of institutional normal&#xD;
        AST/ALT less than or equal to 2.0x the upper limits of institutional normal Creatinine&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of VEGF-AS on the developing human fetus are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pemetrexed may cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and is&#xD;
             classified pregnancy category D. There are no studies of pemetrexed in pregnant women.&#xD;
             Cisplatin is also categorized as FDA Pregnancy Category D. There is positive evidence&#xD;
