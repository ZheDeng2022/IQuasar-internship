    <textblock>
      This pilot study will examine one issue only in weight loss - food cravings in overweight&#xD;
      (i.e. BMI between 25-29.9) or obese (BMI greater than 30) consumers. Food craving is&#xD;
      hypothesized to be an important intervening causal variable and the development of obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized clinical trial will explore whether a relatively under researched energy&#xD;
      based therapeutic procedure, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), can reduce food cravings in&#xD;
      participants under laboratory-controlled conditions, and compare this to a waitlist group.&#xD;
      The following foods will be tested: chocolate, salty foods (e.g. chips, crisps, salted nuts),&#xD;
      sweet carbohydrate foods (eg. cakes, biscuits, soft/soda drinks), carbohydrate foods which&#xD;
      are neither sweet nor salty such as white refined foods such as bread), and caffeinated&#xD;
      items.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research examining energy based procedures (e.g. EFT) combines cognitive strategies with&#xD;
      somatic procedures adapted from acupuncture and related systems for altering the cognitive,&#xD;
      behavioural, and neurochemical foundations of psychological problems. It is often referred to&#xD;
      as &quot;psychological acupuncture&quot;. Few adequately controlled studies have been conducted on EFT&#xD;
      however acupuncture has been quite extensively studied, with hundreds of research reports&#xD;
      published (see attached references).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening will occur over the telephone with one of the chosen self report questionnaires -&#xD;
      the Food Craving Inventory (FCI; White et al., 2002). The FCI is a reliable and valid measure&#xD;
      for the assessment of cravings for specific types of foods: High Fats, Sweets,&#xD;
      Carbohydrates/Starches, and Fast Food Fats, all of which comprise the higher order construct&#xD;
      of &quot;food craving&quot; or the FCI Total score (White et al., 2002). Higher numbers for each of the&#xD;
      subscales reflect greater cravings for that food type with the highest score being 185.&#xD;
      Scores of 93 or higher during the screen will be used to admit subjects to the next&#xD;
      diagnostic interview phase of the trial. In addition, subjects will be asked their weight and&#xD;
      height in order to ascertain their BMI and this will be confirmed in the diagnostic interview&#xD;
      with a standardized weight machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID-II; Spitzer, Williams, Gibbon, &amp; First, 1990) has 12&#xD;
      groups of questions corresponding to12 personality disorders and will be used as a diagnostic&#xD;
      tool in a face-to-face interview with subjects who are suitable from the telephone screen.&#xD;
      The aim is to exclude any active diagnoses from the DSM-IV in order to obtain the purest non&#xD;
      clinic sample possible. All subjects will be notified by letter of the outcome of their&#xD;
      diagnostic interview and those unsuitable for the trial will be told they did not meet&#xD;
      selection criteria. Suitable practitioners who would be able to provide individual support&#xD;
      for the food cravings will be provided in written format. Subjects who meet a diagnostic&#xD;
      category will be informed of this and appropriate referral will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned (using the NHMRC Clinical Trials Centre service) to a&#xD;
      free group EFT treatment condition or a non treatment waitlist control condition of the same&#xD;
      duration (4 weeks). This design ensures that potential treatment gains are neither due to the&#xD;
      mere passage of time nor regression to the mean. To limit attrition from waitlist conditions,&#xD;
      several contacts will be made with the waiting clients. Prescheduled phone contacts, for&#xD;
      example, may maintain adherence to the waitlist condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to treatment all subjects will be weighed and height measured for their BMI status and&#xD;
      food craving outcome measures (pre, post and follow-up) will be measured using:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SUDS rating (subjective) in daily food diaries (food diaries were chosen as a method&#xD;
           that best measures real-life eating behaviour)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Power of Food Scale (Didie, 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Food Craving Inventory (White et al., 2002)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three aspects of eating behaviour will be measured using the Revised Restraint Scale (Herman&#xD;
      &amp; Polivy, 1980). The items are summed for a total score that ranges from 0 to 40. High scores&#xD;
      indicate chronic dieting in which the individual is constantly cycling on and off the diet,&#xD;
      typically without any substantial weight loss. Dietary restraint appears to play a causal&#xD;
      role in the development of eating disorders and obesity and loss of control over intake. Food&#xD;
      cravings may trigger these eating behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Symptom Assessment 45 (SA-45, Strategic Advantage, 1998) will be used to assess&#xD;
      symptomatology across nine psychiatric domains and as measures of the outcome of the&#xD;
      psychological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic information will be collected in questionnaire format at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EFT intervention will consist of 4 sessions (2 hours duration) with homework and will be&#xD;
      based on standard delivery of EFT, as per founder Gary Craig's training for level 1 EFT&#xD;
      certification ( see http://www.emofree.com/WorkShop/workshop-guidelines.htm#Level%201).&#xD;

      Participants will be recruited through community announcements in print advertisements,&#xD;
      radio, and television. Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be highlighted in the&#xD;
      advertising. Criteria will consist of: participants being (l) over 18 years old and under 60&#xD;
      years and not suffering any severe psychological impairment, (2) not currently receiving&#xD;
      treatment (psychological or medical) for their food cravings, (3) agree to be contacted for&#xD;
      follow-up testing. Women and men will be included, and (4) active diagnoses from the SCID II&#xD;
      and subjects taking 'heavy' psychotropic (see attached list) which can suppress feelings,&#xD;
      cravings and sensitivity will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known sufferers of diabetes (Type I and II) and hypoglycemia will be excluded due to any&#xD;
      physiological aetiology (effects related) to food cravings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible applicants will be offered participation in the study through an informed consent&#xD;
      procedure. Self report questionnaires will be issued as part of the study and a demographic&#xD;
      questionnaire will be included in this. All identifying information will be destroyed once&#xD;
      data has been analysed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unsuitable participants will be advised in letter form that they did not meet selection&#xD;
      criteria, and a list of suitable practitioners will be included should they wish to address&#xD;
      their food craving.The study will use a Research Assistant to screen participants, administer&#xD;
      questionnaires and collate data. Separate qualified clinicians to the investigating&#xD;
      researchers will be used to deliver the EFT treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments will be delivered in a number of appropriate venues. Analysis will examine pre&#xD;
      versus post effects for each intervention to highlight any differences in self report, and a&#xD;
      repeated measures ANOVA will examine the effect of time on all the self report scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following questions will be addressed: does EFT reduce food cravings and weight more than&#xD;
      no intervention? It is anticipated that because this is a pilot study, results may indicate&#xD;
      positive direction for these questions only. Due to anecdotal suggestion that EFT has long&#xD;
      lasting effects (see http://www.emofree.com/articles.aspx?id=19), it is hypothesised that&#xD;
      food cravings will reduce significantly with the EFT intervention and remain consistent at&#xD;
      follow-up points. It is expected that the waitlist condition will remain unaffected prior to&#xD;
      any treatment condition. Increases in eating restraint and decreases in SUDS ratings and&#xD;
      general psychopathology are expected with the EFT intervention post treatment and are&#xD;
      expected to stay constant at 3-, 6- and 12-month follow-up. Gender and age will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standard process will be used for informed consent, including a general information sheet&#xD;
      for subjects and consent form indicating any areas of psychological risk, benefits of the&#xD;
      study, self report questionnaire details and follow-up procedures. Detailed information about&#xD;
      what constitutes a food craving will be given to all subjects as well as information about&#xD;
      voluntary involvement and study withdrawal.&#xD;
