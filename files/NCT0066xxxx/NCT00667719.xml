    <measure>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Death</measure>
    <time_frame>54 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was defined as the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug, even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. An SAE was defined as an event which was fatal or life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constituted a congenital anomaly/birth defect, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, was medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Weeks 28 and 54 endpoint</time_frame>
    <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. A calibrated sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the participant in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic blood pressure were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements. A negative change indicates improvement. Week 28 Endpoint was the last non-missing post-baseline measurement value on or before Week 28, and Week 54 Endpoint was the last non-missing measurement value after Week 28.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 28 and 54 endpoints</time_frame>
    <description>Blood pressure control was defined as having a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg and a mean sitting systolic blood pressure &lt;140 mmHg. Percentage of participants achieving the blood pressure control of &lt; 140/90 mmHg were reported. Week 28 Endpoint was the last non-missing post-baseline measurement value on or before Week 28 and Week 54 Endpoint was the last non-missing measurement value after Week 28.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 28 and 54 endpoints</time_frame>
    <description>Diastolic Blood pressure response was defined as a mean sitting diastolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg or a &gt;=10 mmHg reduction from baseline value. Week 28 Endpoint was the last non-missing post-baseline measurement value on or before Week 28, and Week 54 Endpoint was the last non-missing measurement value after Week 28.</description>

Following Week 2, participants were force titrated up to aliskiren 300 mg plus amlodipine 10 mg plus hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg for 26 to 52 weeks (Weeks 28 to 54). All study medications were taken orally with water, once daily in the morning.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Any Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Death</title>
        <description>An AE was defined as the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom, or medical condition occurring after starting the study drug, even if the event is not considered to be related to study drug. An SAE was defined as an event which was fatal or life-threatening, resulted in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, constituted a congenital anomaly/birth defect, required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, was medically significant, i.e. defined as an event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Mean Sitting Diastolic Blood Pressure (msDBP)</title>
        <description>The arm in which the highest sitting diastolic pressures were found at study entry was the arm used for all subsequent readings. A calibrated sphygmomanometer and appropriate size cuff were used to measure arterial sitting blood pressure (BP) at trough with the arm supported at the level of the heart. At each study visit, after having the participant in a sitting position for five minutes, systolic/diastolic blood pressure were measured 3 times at 1-2 minute intervals. A mean was calculated from the 3 measurements. A negative change indicates improvement. Week 28 Endpoint was the last non-missing post-baseline measurement value on or before Week 28, and Week 54 Endpoint was the last non-missing measurement value after Week 28.</description>
