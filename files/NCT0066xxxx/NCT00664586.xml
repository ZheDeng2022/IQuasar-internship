  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I continuous infusion study designed to explore if constant concentration&#xD;
      over time adds to the effectiveness of terameprocol without increasing toxicity. It will also&#xD;
      explore weekly dosing as an option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor response assessments will be performed following every two (2) cycles of therapy. All&#xD;
      subjects will undergo a follow-up visit 30 days following their last dose of terameprocol.&#xD;
      Circulating tumor cells (CTC) will be quantified pre dosing and on day 15 after first dose of&#xD;
      each cycle. Needle biopsy specimens will be taken prior to therapy and one week after first&#xD;
      dose, if possible, to assess for tumor markers (cdc-2 and survivin). Tumor markers, for&#xD;
      example prostate specific antigen (PSA) will also be measured on day 15 of each cycle (if&#xD;
      elevated on study entry). Pharmacokinetic parameters will be derived from analysis of blood&#xD;
      samples collected during the first 24 hour infusion.&#xD;

      Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled to receive&#xD;
      terameprocol as a weekly 24 hour intravenous infusion, three weeks out of four. Serial&#xD;
      measurements of safety will be performed prior to dosing. Subjects will be screened within 28&#xD;
      days of Cycle 1. Hematologic, serum chemistry, tumor marker, and pregnancy testing will be&#xD;
      performed. Circulating tumor cell assays will be performed. Needle biopsy specimens will be&#xD;
      taken prior to therapy and one week after first dose, if possible, to assess for tumor&#xD;
      markers (cdc-2 and survivin). Subjects meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      enrolled in groups of 3-6 subjects to receive terameprocol as a weekly 24 hour intravenous&#xD;
      infusion. The terameprocol dose levels to be studied include 100mg/hr, increasing by 25 mg/&#xD;
      hr increments in the next cohort assuming no DLT is reached. Serial measurements of safety&#xD;
      will be performed at each visit. The MTD will be assessed after the first Cycle of treatment&#xD;
      at a dose level. The use of myeloid colony-stimulating factors will not be allowed&#xD;
      prophylactically in cycle 1 but may be used if clinically indicated and will be allowed&#xD;
      during subsequent cycles to prevent the development of neutropenia in subjects with an&#xD;
      established history of this adverse event in earlier cycles. Each subject in a cohort will be&#xD;
      treated at the same dose and on the same schedule of weekly infusions. Dose escalation in a&#xD;
      subject may be allowed after safe evaluation of a higher dosage, and two cycles being&#xD;
      completed with stable disease or better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terameprocol (EM-1421) will be administered as an intravenous infusion over 24 hours, weekly.&#xD;
      Dose will commence in the first cohort with 100 mg per hour (2400 mg in a 24 hour period)with&#xD;
      escalation in the 5 cohorts of 3 to 6 patients with increments of 25 mg per hour to a maximum&#xD;
      of 200 mg/hr (4800 mg/24 hour period) or until MTD is defined. When the MTD has been&#xD;
      declared, then 11 additional subjects will be enrolled at the MTD dose level (to total 14&#xD;
      subjects treated in dosage cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A. will receive weekly Terameprocol 100 mg per hour (2400 mg in a 24 hour period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort B. will receive weekly Terameprocol 125 mg per hour (3000 mg in a 24 hour period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort C. will receive weekly Terameprocol 150 mg per hour (3600 mg in a 24 hour period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort D. will receive weekly Terameprocol 175 mg per hour (4200 mg in a 24 hour period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort E. will receive weekly Terameprocol 200 mg per hour (4800 mg in a 24 hour period)&#xD;

             negative serum pregnancy test within one week of entering the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women of child-bearing potential who are unwilling to use two medically acceptable&#xD;
             forms of contraception during the course of the study (surgical sterilization,&#xD;
