      Primary Aim # 1: Determine the willingness of the public to participate in an intervention&#xD;
      trial - NutritionQuest's Alive!TM - available in a public forum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #1 Hypotheses: Less than 10% of individuals visiting the NutritionWeek site will register&#xD;
      to participate in the Alive!TM Intervention; 70% of these individuals will complete the full&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim # 2: To determine among individuals enrolled in the Alive!TM intervention,&#xD;
      changes in measurements of body composition from pre- to post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim #2 Hypotheses: Participation in Alive!TM will result in positive changes in body&#xD;
      composition, including reduction of body weight, percent body fat and blood LDL and an&#xD;
      increase in blood HDL cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Educate the public on the relationship between diet, weight and chronic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Collect data for future research&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. For participants of the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry (OMSI) portion of this&#xD;
           study, we also provide a diet assessment and optional 3-month intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will have a display at OMSI coincidental with the Body Worlds 3 exhibit and at&#xD;
      local health fairs. Participants will be recruited from the attendees of the OMSI Body Worlds&#xD;
      3 exhibit as well as general OMSI visitors from July through October 2007 and from health&#xD;
      fairs at later dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No identifiable information will be collected; only gender, year of birth, race and ethnicity&#xD;
      are collected on any participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects under age 18 can participate in any or all of the following: a brief online,&#xD;
      touch-screen assessment of eating and physical activity (health screening for immediate,&#xD;
      printed feedback), physiologic measurements (height, weight, hip and waist circumference,&#xD;
      percent body fat, blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are age 18 and over can participate in any or all of the following: a brief&#xD;
      online, touch-screen assessment of eating and physical activity (health screening for&#xD;
      immediate, printed feedback), physiologic measurements (height, weight, hip and waist&#xD;
      circumference, percent body fat, blood pressure), finger prick to assess blood glucose and&#xD;
      lipid levels as well as DNA sample (mouthwash swish).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants of the OMSI portion of this study, adults may also choose to join a 3-month&#xD;
      online lifestyle intervention (Alive!â„¢). Participants who enroll in the 3-month intervention&#xD;
      will receive 12 intervention messages over a 3-month period. Each of the messages will take&#xD;
      about 5 to 10 minutes to read. At the end of this 3-month period, participants will receive a&#xD;
      post-assessment health screening at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University (OHSU) Clinical&#xD;
      and Translational Research Center. This post-assessment will include completion of a diet and&#xD;
      physical activity assessment, fasting blood measures of glucose and lipids, blood pressure,&#xD;
      weight and height.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All visitors to the display area and all research subjects will be offered educational&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments used, for OMSI participants only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Alive!TM lifestyle intervention is a web-based diet assessment program designed to help&#xD;
      individuals evaluate their diet and make healthy changes via tailored e-mail correspondence.&#xD;
      This program is operated by NutritionQuest out of Berkeley, California; utilizing the Block&#xD;
      questionnaires, designed and validated over many years by Dr. Gladys Block, and now in use by&#xD;
      researchers and health practitioners world-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      De-identified data will be stored for future analyses and will be used in descriptive&#xD;
      analyses to provide information on the distribution of body size variables and how they&#xD;
      relate to reported dietary intake. DNA data from cheek cell samples will be linked by&#xD;
      identification number to dietary intake and physiologic measures. Though de-identified, this&#xD;
      data may still be used to identify genetic profiles of individuals with various physiologic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For OMSI participants only:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alive!TM lifestyle intervention data will be used to determine predictors of change in&#xD;
      physiologic and reported intake measures pre and post-intervention, using analysis of&#xD;
      variance. At the time of analyses ALL data (including Alive!TM participant data) will be&#xD;
      de-identified.&#xD;
