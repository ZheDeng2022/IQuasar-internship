        <title>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Total Score at Week 1</title>
        <description>The HVLT-R is an instrument used to measure verbal learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and yes/no delayed recognition. The total recall score was the sum of 3 'free recall' learning trials, and reflects the participant's ability to learn. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 36 (best memory). Higher score indicated best memory.</description>

        <title>Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) Total Score at Week 13</title>
        <description>The HVLT-R is an instrument used to measure verbal learning and memory (recognition and recall). It consists of 3 learning trials: free recall, delayed recall, and yes/no delayed recognition. The total recall score was the sum of 3 'free recall' learning trials, and reflects the participant's ability to learn. The total score ranges from 0 (no memory) to 36 (best memory). Higher score indicated best memory.</description>

        <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = none to 100 = extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC 3.1 Subscales Scores at Week 2</title>
        <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = none to 100 = extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 2 (Part 1 and 2)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who had received full single intravenous dose of study medication and had at least one entry of electronic diary in both pre and post treatments. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those who were evaluable for this measure. It was planned to report combined data for Part 1 and 2.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC 3.1 Subscales Scores at Week 4</title>
        <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = none to 100 = extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4 (Part 1 and 2)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who had received full single intravenous dose of study medication and had at least one entry of electronic diary in both pre and post treatments. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those who were evaluable for this measure. It was planned to report combined data for Part 1 and 2.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC 3.1 Subscales Scores at Week 8</title>
        <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0=none to 100= extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 8 (Part 1 and 2)</time_frame>
        <population>FAS included all participants who had received full single intravenous dose of study medication and had at least one entry of electronic diary in both pre and post treatments. Here, 'overall number of participants analyzed' signifies those who were evaluable for this measure. It was planned to report combined data for Part 1 and 2.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in WOMAC 3.1 Subscales Scores at Week 13</title>
        <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = none to 100 = extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Week 13 (Part 1 and 2)</time_frame>

          <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = none to 100 = extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>

        <description>WOMAC 3.1: participant assessed questionnaire consists of 24 questions divided into 3 domains; pain (5 questions), stiffness (2 questions), function (17 questions). Functional domain provided information of ability to perform activities of daily living. The participant performed test directly on electronic diary, using validated electronic VAS ranging from 0 to 100 (0 = none to 100 = extreme). Each domain scored by averaging VAS scores of component questions. Total subscale score for each of the 3 domains range from: 0 to 100, lower score indicated better daily living.</description>
