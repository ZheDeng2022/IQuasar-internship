  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Compassionate Use Supplement to the IDE Protocol is to assure and monitor&#xD;
      the safety of six Subjects (in the United States) implanted with ARCHIMEDES until all&#xD;
      remaining implanted pumps are explanted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pain management has been a long-standing challenge to the medical community, specifically the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic pain. On October 3, 2002, FDA approved Codman's IDE Study of Codman's&#xD;
      Implantable Constant-Flow Infusion Pump System (ARCHIMEDES). The first Subject was implanted&#xD;
      on February 12, 2003. Since then, ten Subjects have had the ARCHIMEDES implanted, with one&#xD;
      Subject, implanted twice. Codman notified the FDA in 2004 that it wished to discontinue&#xD;
      enrollment into the study &amp; bring it to a close because of projected slow enrollment and&#xD;
      waning physician interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Codman felt there was no readily acceptable alternate therapy that would not require a pump&#xD;
      explant first. It is possible to replace the ARCHIMEDES with another pump system, which is&#xD;
      already approved for use in the United States. However, such an action would necessitate the&#xD;
      removal or explant of the ARCHIMEDES, thereby exposing the Subjects to additional risks&#xD;
      inherent in such a surgical procedure, including those associated with anesthesia. Since&#xD;
      these Subjects have been treated with the investigational device for at least 2 years without&#xD;
      experiencing any unanticipated adverse device effects, Codman felt that the risk of&#xD;
      explanting the pump was significantly greater than the risk of continuing treatment with the&#xD;
      investigational device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It should also be noted that this pump does not have a battery and that replacement is&#xD;
      dictated by the number of times the septum is punctured (500). This translates into&#xD;
      approximately twenty years of therapy if the septum is punctured an average of 20 times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FDA approved Codman's Compassionate Use Protocol in 2005.&#xD;
