    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat when given&#xD;
      together with paclitaxel and radiation therapy and to see how well it works in treating&#xD;
      patients unable to tolerate cisplatin with stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that&#xD;
      cannot be removed by surgery. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.&#xD;
      Giving vorinostat together with paclitaxel and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of vorinostat when administered in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety and toxicity of vorinostat when administered in combination with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in patients with locally advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the radiological response rate, by computed tomography (CT) scan, of&#xD;
      vorinostat when administered in combination with paclitaxel and thoracic radiation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced NSCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To describe the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of this&#xD;
      regiment over 3 years of follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive vorinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD), 5 days a week and paclitaxel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour once a week. Patients also undergo radiation therapy QD, 5&#xD;
      days a week. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, 12 weeks, every 3&#xD;
      months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 1 year.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicity was graded according to the National Institutes of Health Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse event with the exception of alopecia, fatigue, or anorexia. Nausea and/or vomiting that persisted &gt; 48 hours despite optimal medical management at grade 3 or higher was considered a DLT. Hematologic dose-limiting toxicity was defined as either: Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 7 days in duration, Grade &gt; 3 febrile neutropenia with/without infection, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 5 hematologic toxicity.</description>

        <description>Defined as the highest dose level at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Toxicity was graded according to the National Institutes of Health Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 3.0. A DLT was defined as any Grade 3 or higher non-hematologic adverse event with the exception of alopecia, fatigue, or anorexia. Nausea and/or vomiting that persisted &gt; 48 hours despite optimal medical management at grade 3 or higher was considered a DLT. Hematologic dose-limiting toxicity was defined as either: Grade 4 neutropenia lasting for ≥ 7 days in duration, Grade &gt; 3 febrile neutropenia with/without infection, Grade 4 thrombocytopenia or Grade 5 hematologic toxicity.</description>
