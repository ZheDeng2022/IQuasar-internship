      We evaluated the preventive impact of vaccination on subsequent death events in 117 severe&#xD;
      congestive heart patients requiring ventilator support without endotracheal intubations and&#xD;
      aggressive medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were randomly allocated in a single-blind manner as a unique intramuscular influenza&#xD;
      vaccination or as controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first primary outcome evaluated at 6 months follow-up - cardiovascular death - occurred&#xD;
      in 3% of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 17% in controls (p=0.022). The composite end&#xD;
      point occurred in 33% of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 74% in control group, p =&#xD;
      &lt;0.001.&#xD;

      Background: Recent reports detected that one of the barriers that vaccination against&#xD;
      influenza infection is that, physicians do not strongly recommend its applications to&#xD;
      cardiovascular patients at risk. We evaluated the preventive impact of vaccination against&#xD;
      death in severe congestive heart failure hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Results: A total of 117 severe congestive heart failure patients (New York Heart&#xD;
      Association class III and IV) admitted in the first 12 hours who required ventilator support&#xD;
      without endotracheal intubations and high doses of loop-diuretics, were included in a&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter log, during the winter season. Congestive heart patients received&#xD;
      intravenous vasodilators and loop-diuretics plus standard therapies, and then were randomly&#xD;
      allocated in a single-blind manner as a unique intramuscular influenza vaccination or as&#xD;
      controls. Death, and combined end points (death, and re-hospitalization for any reason) were&#xD;
      assessed at 6 months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first primary outcome - cardiovascular death - occurred in 3% of the patients in the&#xD;
      vaccine group Vs 17% in controls (odds ratio with vaccine as compared with controls: 0.16; 95&#xD;
      percent confidence interval, 0.33 to 0.79; p=0.022). The composite end point occurred in 33%&#xD;
      of the patients in the vaccine group Vs 74% in controls, p = &lt;0.001. The need of adding&#xD;
      inotropic drugs occurred in 8% of patients receiving vaccination, and in 12.5% in the control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patient's &gt; 21 years of age with a severe congestive heart failure (New&#xD;
             York Heart Association class III or IV) requiring an immediate administration of&#xD;
             intravenous vasodilators drugs, oxygen therapy, and no less than 160 mg of intravenous&#xD;
             furosemide were eligible for inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Definite evidence of underlying heart failure was also required as shown by at least&#xD;
             two of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  a) Orthopnea on admission&#xD;
&#xD;
