  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the CollaRx Bupivacaine Implant&#xD;
      (bupivacaine sponge) is safe and effective in reducing the amount of narcotic pain medication&#xD;
      needed to control pain during the first 24 hours after gastrointestinal (GI) surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrointestinal (GI) surgery encompasses a range of surgical procedures that involve&#xD;
      abdominal incision. Gastrointestinal surgery may be performed to treat an abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, gallbladder disease, bile duct disease and&#xD;
      morbid obesity. Although less invasive laparoscopic procedures are performed when warranted,&#xD;
      open abdominal surgery is required for certain indications and for more complicated or&#xD;
      advanced cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.&#xD;
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin&#xD;
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes for cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When&#xD;
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the&#xD;
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the&#xD;
      surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the amount of narcotic pain medication required after surgery in&#xD;
      patients who receive the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant or a plain collagen sponge.&#xD;
