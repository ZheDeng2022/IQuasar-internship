      Briefly, this multisite study is designed to identify endophenotypes (i.e., heritable&#xD;
      biomarkers) associated with either schizophrenia or bipolar disorder alone, or both together.&#xD;
      The subsequent genetic analyses will search genomic loci and candidate genes associated with&#xD;
      each of the independent endophenotypes. This is a five site study that is slotted for NIMH&#xD;
      funding.&#xD;

      We propose to recruit 100 case probands with a diagnosis of SZ, 100 case probands with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of BP Disorder I with history of psychosis; BPI-P) and 400 1st degree case&#xD;
      relatives. All 1st degree family members who are willing to participate will provide clinical&#xD;
      information and blood sample, only a proportion will be eligible for endophenotypic studies).&#xD;
      Individuals with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified are also eligible for testing.&#xD;
      Their data will be incorporated with the schizophrenia or bipolar data upon confirmation of&#xD;
      diagnosis. Family members of individuals with psychotic disorder not otherwise specified will&#xD;
      not be tested unless the individual has a later confirmed diagnosis of schizophrenia or&#xD;
      bipolar disorder. Probands will not be tested during the acute phase of the illness as judged&#xD;
      clinically e.g., significant increase in core symptoms from their stable baseline that&#xD;
      requires a change in treatment such increased dose of medication, drug change, or&#xD;
      hospitalization). As part of another existing protocol, we have collected most of the&#xD;
      endophynotypic information in schizophrenia probands and 1st degree relatives other than&#xD;
      brain imaging and few other tests. We will attempt to recruit these subjects to complete the&#xD;
      imaging studies and the data will be used in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 100 healthy comparison subjects from the community in order to describe the&#xD;
      distribution of normal values for our endophenotype procedures in a demographically matched&#xD;
      sample. The SZ and BPI-P probands, and 50 healthy control subjects, will be frequency matched&#xD;
      on age, sex ratio, and head of the household's socio-economic status (SES). Another group of&#xD;
      50 healthy control subjects will be similarly matched to the relative groups recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo a number of clinical, electrophysiological, structural brain&#xD;
      imaging, perceptual, and cognitive assessments. These data will be used to identify&#xD;
      phenotypes likely to be associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia and/or bipolar&#xD;
      disorder, and to determine how these phenotypes aggregate in families. Some of the analyses&#xD;
      will focus on examining associations between candidate genes and these alternative&#xD;
      phenotypes. Thus if we are not able to recruit relatives we may still collect these&#xD;
      phenotypic data in probands and their genetic sample for future genotype/phenotype&#xD;
      association studies. Family members may elect to participate only in the clinical and blood&#xD;
      draw portions of the study. Testing procedures require a 12 -15 hour time commitment and&#xD;
      testing will be completed over 2 or more days. Participants will be asked to give a blood (or&#xD;
      saliva if difficult to obtain blood sample for instance because of fear of blood draws),&#xD;
      which will be stored for future genetic analyses. Data from the previous family study will be&#xD;
      combined with the data collected in this protocol for some of the analyses.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants 15 years of age and above.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Case probands will include individuals who meet DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia,&#xD;
             schizoaffective, or bipolar disorder with psychosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Control subjects who meet DSM-IV criteria for any lifetime psychotic illness or BP, or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  A number of exclusions are necessary because they potentially affect&#xD;
             neurophysiological measures. Exclusions will be applied to all groups to maintain&#xD;
             consistency in recruitment. As a result, the following individuals will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects under 15 years of age will be excluded. Subjects with serious medical,&#xD;
             neuro-ophthalmological or neurological illness (e.g., cancer, seizure disorders,&#xD;
