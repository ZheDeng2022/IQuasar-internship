  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a sudden, unexpected loss of heart function. It is a leading&#xD;
      cause of death, and more than 400,000 people in the United States die each year as a result&#xD;
      of SCA. This study will analyze genetic samples of people who have experienced SCA and people&#xD;
      who have not experienced SCA to determine if there is a genetic basis for SCA.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCA occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating. When this happens, blood&#xD;
      stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. Ninety-five percent of people who&#xD;
      experience SCA die from it, most within minutes. SCA is usually caused by abnormal heart&#xD;
      rhythms, known as arrhythmias, which can be triggered by several factors, including coronary&#xD;
      artery disease, physical stress, and structural changes in the heart. Certain genetic factors&#xD;
      may also increase the likelihood of experiencing SCA. Study researchers will analyze genetic&#xD;
      samples from people affected by SCA and people unaffected by SCA to identify and characterize&#xD;
      genetic variations that are associated with an increased risk of SCA in European Americans&#xD;
      and African Americans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will examine previously collected blood samples from people who have experienced&#xD;
      SCA and were participants in the Cardiac Arrest Blood Study (CABS) and the Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Health Study (CHS). These participants will not attend any study visits or be contacted by&#xD;
      study researchers. People who experience SCA in the first 4 years of this study will have&#xD;
      blood drawn from paramedics at the time of SCA. If these participants survive, they will be&#xD;
      asked whether study researchers can review their medical records. Study researchers will also&#xD;
      examine previously collected blood samples from participants who have not experienced SCA and&#xD;
      were participants in CABS, CHS, and the Heart and Vascular Health Study. These participants&#xD;
      will not attend any study visits or be contacted by study researchers. Study researchers will&#xD;
      also enroll a new control group of people who have not experienced SCA. These participants&#xD;
      will attend one study visit for blood collection and a medical record review.&#xD;
