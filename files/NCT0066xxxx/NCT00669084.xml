    <textblock>
      This study, sponsored by NIAID and the University of Bamako, Mali, will identify genetic and&#xD;
      other factors that may protect against severe malaria in some children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children between 6 months and 17 years of age who live in Kenieroba, Fourda or Bozokin&#xD;
      villages in Mali may enroll in the study. Participants have a blood sample collected by&#xD;
      finger prick with a small needle. The blood is examined for gene variants that influence the&#xD;
      severity of disease in children exposed to the malaria parasite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children who develop a fever or other symptoms of malaria are evaluated and treated in&#xD;
      Kenieroba s health center for up to 5 years from entering the study, or until they reach 18&#xD;
      years of age. The children are treated with artesunate and amodiaquine. Children with severe&#xD;
      disease are treated with quinine. One tablespoon of blood is drawn from the children for&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the dry season and the wet season, a subset of 200 healthy children are asked&#xD;
      to provide 1 or 2 tablespoons of blood, drawn through a needle placed in a vein in the arm.&#xD;
      Additional research blood samples may be requested from children between 2 and 17 years old.&#xD;
      Blood will not be taken from any child more than twice a year.&#xD;

      Hemoglobin (Hb) and red blood cell (RBC) polymorphisms that give rise to HbS, HbC,&#xD;
      alpha-thalassemia, G6PD-deficiency, and ABO blood groups occur at high frequency in Mali. To&#xD;
      determine whether these Hb/RBC polymorphisms are associated with protection against mild&#xD;
      malaria and malaria-associated anemia, we will conduct a cohort study in Mali. Approximately&#xD;
      1300 children will be genotyped for five Hb/RBC polymorphisms and followed for 5 years to&#xD;
      compare mean incidence rates for mild malaria, stratified by polymorphism. Differences&#xD;
      between Hb levels during acute malaria episodes and at baseline will be calculated to&#xD;
      determine if Hb/RBC polymorphisms influence the degree of malaria-associated anemia. To&#xD;
      investigate whether Hb/RBC polymorphisms impair monocyte activation, we will obtain parasites&#xD;
      from children with malaria, culture them in RBCs of different genotype, and compare the&#xD;
      parasitized RBCs for their ability to activate monocytes in vitro. Plasma samples from&#xD;
      children with malaria will also be compared for their levels of monocyte-derived cytokines. A&#xD;
      variety of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in immune response genes have recently been&#xD;
      identified in African populations. To determine whether these polymorphisms are associated&#xD;
      with protection against severe malaria, we will compare the prevalence of SNPs in groups of&#xD;
      children with severe or mild malaria. Blood Collection Study. Components of the innate immune&#xD;
      system (e.g., Toll-like receptors) expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC) provide the&#xD;
      first line of defense against microbial infection and frame the nature and scale of adaptive&#xD;
      immune responses. To investigate whether APC from malaria-experienced individuals respond to&#xD;
      TLR ligands in vitro stimulation assays, we will obtain blood samples from 100 healthy&#xD;
      children in the dry season and again in the wet season. Immunological memory is a key feature&#xD;
      of adaptive immunity and involves memory T cells. Clinical trials in which malaria-nafve&#xD;
      human volunteers were vaccinated with merozoite MSP-1 antigens enabled us to study the&#xD;
      development of immunological memory by measuring memory T cell cytokine production and&#xD;
      expression of surface activation markers. To investigate whether memory T cells from&#xD;
      malaria-experienced individuals respond similarly to AMA-I/MSP-1 ligands in vitro stimulation&#xD;
      assays, we will obtain blood samples from an additional 100 healthy children in the dry&#xD;
      season and again in the wet season. These collections of paired samples will enable us to&#xD;
      explore the possibility that TLR- and AMA-1/MSP-l-induced immune responses are boosted during&#xD;
      a transmission season and increase with age (a surrogate for disease controlling immunity).&#xD;
