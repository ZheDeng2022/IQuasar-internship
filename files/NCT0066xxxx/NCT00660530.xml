  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) commonly develop hyperphosphatemia due to the&#xD;
      loss of excretory function of the kidney. This in turn may lead to the development of&#xD;
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) and renal osteodystrophy. Lanthanum carbonate, a&#xD;
      phosphate binding agent, works by releasing lanthanum ions in the gastrointestinal tract to&#xD;
      bind dietary phosphate and is effective in the management of hyperphosphatemia and in&#xD;
      preventing secondary hyperparathyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients taking lanthanum carbonate as part of their phosphate binder therapy are counseled&#xD;
      to chew the tablets completely before swallowing, with or immediately after meals. However,&#xD;
      ESRD patients who are intubated or are receiving enteral tube feedings are unable to chew the&#xD;
      lanthanum carbonate tablets. For such patients, medications are commonly crushed and&#xD;
      administered through a gastrostomy tube (G-tube). Some patients may also prefer to crush the&#xD;
      lanthanum carbonate tablets and mix it with food instead of chewing. To date, it is not known&#xD;
      if crushing the lanthanum carbonate tablets prior to administration and taking it with food&#xD;
      will be as efficacious as chewing it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of phosphate binding between chewed&#xD;
      and crushed lanthanum carbonate in patients undergoing hemodialysis.&#xD;

      Study subjects Men and women at least 18 years of age, receiving HD for at least 3 months,&#xD;
      with serum P concentrations 45.5 mg/dL at the end of the washout period, and on a stable dose&#xD;
      of P binder and/or active vitamin D (if prescribed previously) for at least 1 month before&#xD;
      the study were eligible for study participation. Patients were excluded if they did not&#xD;
      respond to P binder therapy previously, had a known noncompliance with oral medications&#xD;
      (e.g., failure to ﬁll a prescription or to take medications as prescribed), severe&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism deﬁned as intact-PTH (i-PTH) 4500 pg/mL, were taking any calcium (Ca)-,&#xD;
      magnesium-, or aluminum-containing antacids or used an investigational agent within 30 days&#xD;
      of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study was approved by the University of Illinois at Chicago Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board. Informed consent was obtained from the subjects before any study procedures&#xD;
      were initiated. One week before the administration of crushed or chewed lanthanum, the&#xD;
      subjects were in-structed to discontinue their P-binding agents (calcium carbonate, calcium&#xD;
      acetate, sevelamer hydrochloride, and/or lanthanum carbonate), if prescribed previously. At&#xD;
      the end of the 1-week washout period, subjects whose serum P exceeded 5.5 mg/dL were&#xD;
      randomized to receive, in a crossover fashion, lanthanum 1000 mg (Fosrenol, Shire US Inc.,&#xD;
      Wayne, PA, USA) 3 times daily to be chewed with meals (chewed LAN) or lanthanum 1000 mg&#xD;
      crushed into a ﬁne powder and taken with meals 3 times daily (crushed LAN), for 4 weeks each.&#xD;
      The lanthanum tablets were crushed into a ﬁne powder using a mortar and pestle by the&#xD;
      investigators, individually wrapped in powder packets and dispensed to the subjects on a&#xD;
      weekly basis. The subjects were instructed to empty the powder into a small plastic cup&#xD;
      provided, mix with 2 tablespoonfuls of applesauce and take it with meals. After each&#xD;
      treatment (chewed or crushed LAN), there was a 1-week washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the course of the study, the subjects were asked to keep a constant dietary P&#xD;
      intake. In addition, each subject was provided with a dietary log for recording their daily&#xD;
      dietary intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection and study endpoints Blood samples were collected at the end of each washout&#xD;
      period (baseline) and weekly (weeks 1-4) during lanthanum treatment for the determination of&#xD;
      serum P, Ca, i-PTH, and albumin (alb) concentrations. Changes in serum P from baseline for&#xD;
      crushed and chewed lanthanum were compared. In addition, the study subjects were asked to&#xD;
      complete a questionnaire to assess the presence of any study-related adverse events at the&#xD;
      end of each treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Assuming a coefﬁcient variation of 15% to 25% for serum P&#xD;
      concentrations, a sample size of 11 to 15 was estimated to provide at least 80% power to&#xD;
      detect a 25% difference in serum P between study treatments, using a 2-sided test and a of&#xD;
      0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW (SPSS), version 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics were used to report all results. The changes in serum P, Ca, i-PTH,&#xD;
      and alb were compared between the 2 treatment arms using paired sample t test. A P value&#xD;
      &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
