      The Remote Physiological Monitoring System (RPM™) is a wireless technology for physiological&#xD;
      monitoring. The RPM™ is designed to capture, transmit and remotely monitor the vital signs of&#xD;
      a patient or group of patients. The RPM™ allows the patient to carry an unobtrusive unit and&#xD;
      sensor array, which is able to store and/or forward its data via existing communication&#xD;
      networks. This data is archivable and can be made available to a monitoring station or&#xD;
      stations. This approach obviates the need to provide new and expensive infrastructure to&#xD;
      support the system since it is designed to 'piggy-back' on the existing network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major clinical advantage of the RPM™ and the principal reason why it may offer a benefit to&#xD;
      patients, is that it provides continuous remote monitoring of vital signs, in contrast to the&#xD;
      current situation for ward patients, where there is intermittent vital signs monitoring. This&#xD;
      is a major advantage for patients and hospital staff, since there is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      demonstrate early recognition and treatment of clinical events, e.g., shock, can save lives;&#xD;
      the concurrent cost and labour saving is a further obvious benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RPM™ uses wireless technology to overcome the portability problems associated with&#xD;
      conventional patient monitoring systems. The RPM™ consists of the following system&#xD;
      components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiological Monitoring Unit (PMU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Aggregation Server (DAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Monitoring Position (CMP) To validate the RPM™ device for regulatory approval,&#xD;
           BRYTECH will evaluate the RPM™ in a clinical setting, thereby ensuring that the system&#xD;
           is trustworthy and acceptable to health professionals as a monitoring system in&#xD;
           patients. The study proposes to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the RPM™&#xD;
           compared to monitors commonly used in the medical practice under the standard conditions&#xD;
           of medical practice The study also proposes to evaluate notification and alarm systems,&#xD;
           the communications interface and non-interference with existing systems, devices,&#xD;
           networks and procedures as well as the incremental nursing workload associated with the&#xD;
           integration of the RPM™ in a clinical environment. The RPM™ and reference physiological&#xD;

      BRYTECH STUDY SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Remote Physiological Monitoring System (RPM™) is a wireless technology for physiological&#xD;
      monitoring. The RPM™ is designed to capture, transmit and remotely monitor the vital signs of&#xD;
      a patient or group of patients. The RPM™ allows the patient to carry an unobtrusive unit and&#xD;
      sensor array, which is able to store and/or forward its data via existing communication&#xD;
      networks. This data is archivable and can be made available to a monitoring station or&#xD;
      stations. This approach obviates the need to provide new and expensive infrastructure to&#xD;
      support the system since it is designed to 'piggy-back' on the existing network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major clinical advantage of the RPM™ and the principal reason why it may offer a benefit to&#xD;
      patients, is that it provides continuous remote monitoring of vital signs, in contrast to the&#xD;
      current situation for ward patients, where there is intermittent vital signs monitoring. This&#xD;
      is a major advantage for patients and hospital staff, since there is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      demonstrate early recognition and treatment of clinical events, e.g., shock, can save lives;&#xD;
      the concurrent cost and labour saving is a further obvious benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RPM™ uses wireless technology to overcome the portability problems associated with&#xD;
      conventional patient monitoring systems. The RPM™ uses off the shelf computer technology such&#xD;
      as standard displays, as well as secure, wireless, 802.11 networking protocols and consists&#xD;
      of the following system components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiological Monitoring Unit (PMU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data Aggregation Server (DAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Monitoring Position (CMP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the RPM™ device for regulatory approval, BRYTECH will evaluate the RPM™ in a&#xD;
      clinical setting, thereby ensuring that the system is trustworthy and acceptable to health&#xD;
      professionals as a monitoring system in patients. The study proposes to evaluate the accuracy&#xD;
      and reliability of the RPM™ compared to monitors commonly used in the medical practice under&#xD;
      the standard conditions of medical practice; this study will therefore be a non-intervention&#xD;
      study. The study also proposes to evaluate notification and alarm systems, the communications&#xD;
      interface and non-interference with existing systems, devices, networks and procedures as&#xD;
      well as the incremental nursing workload associated with the integration of the RPM™ in a&#xD;
      clinical environment. The RPM™ and reference physiological monitoring devices will be&#xD;
      compared for physiological monitoring capabilities in 40 patients from the following four (4)&#xD;
      cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cohort 1 (Exercise): patients who are scheduled to undergo a minimum of 20 minutes of&#xD;
           exercise testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Cohort 2 (ICU): patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cohort 3 (Post-op): patients in Post-Operative care&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cohort 4 (ER): patients admitted to the Emergency Room (e.g., high risk medical&#xD;
           admissions) These cohorts are considered representative of a broad spectrum of the&#xD;
           general patient population. Patients participating in the study will be assigned to one&#xD;
           of these 4 cohorts, with a minimum of 10 patients assigned to Cohort 1 (Exercise) and a&#xD;
           minimum of 5 patients in each of the other cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study, the RPM™ and reference monitoring devices will be time-stamped such that zero&#xD;
      time will be readily evaluable and patients will be fitted with all necessary sensors for&#xD;
      collection of vital signs, namely heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), blood oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels (SpO2), non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP), body temperature (BT) and&#xD;
      respiration rate (RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Cohort 1 (Exercise) patients, comparative monitoring of vital signs will be done during&#xD;
      exercise testing for a minimum of 20 minutes with additional monitoring performed pre- and&#xD;
      post-exercise. There will be a minimum of 10 patients in this cohort. For patients in Cohorts&#xD;
      2, 3 and 4, comparative monitoring of vital signs will be performed during the period (24 -&#xD;
      72 hours) required to collect 12 Vital Sign Assessment Cycles (VSAC - defined in Section&#xD;
      5.2.2) per subject, with a minimum of 5 patients in each cohort and a total of 30 patients.&#xD;
      The four cohorts of patients have been chosen to allow comparison of vital signs from the&#xD;
      RPM™ and standard nursing measurement techniques over a broad range of physiologic data (e.g.&#xD;
      rest and exercise) and patient populations (e.g. stable and critically ill).The primary&#xD;
      objective for the study is to determine substantial equivalence of the RPM™ and the reference&#xD;
      devices or standard practice measurements by comparing the agreement (accuracy) between&#xD;
      paired output results for individual vital signs and the reliability of data collection over&#xD;
      a 24 hour monitoring period. Timepoint matched paired data for all available timepoints will&#xD;
      be collected from the RPM™ and the reference devices, excluding ambulatory data, for heart&#xD;
      rate, ECG, SpO2, blood pressure, body temperature and respiration rate. Accuracy will be&#xD;
      determined by assessing whether the paired values show significant agreement. Reliability&#xD;
      will be determined by a comparison of cumulative totals for lost data points and error rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines with all&#xD;
      patients required to sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF). This is a non-intervention study&#xD;
      and patients tested will be subjected to use of the RPM™ as the only experimental procedure&#xD;
      during the trial. Importantly, patients will not be exposed to any significant risks as a&#xD;
      result of participating in this study.&#xD;
