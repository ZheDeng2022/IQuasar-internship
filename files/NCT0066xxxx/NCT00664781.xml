      RATIONALE: rucaparib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of rucaparib and to&#xD;
      see how well it works in treating patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      or advanced ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of Anti tumour activity to PARP-1 inhibitor rucaparib in patients with&#xD;
           locally advanced or metastatic breast or advanced ovarian cancer shown to express the&#xD;
           BRCA 1 or 2 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the toxicity of treatment with Rucaparib in these population's.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the time to progression and overall survival in patients treated with this&#xD;
           drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patient populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) activity in peripheral blood&#xD;
           lymphocytes from BRCA 1 and 2 heterozygotic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine a tolerable and effective dosing regimen of the Rucaparib oral formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by an open label multicenter study. The&#xD;
      study was originally set up with an IV formulation. An oral formulation of the PARP-1&#xD;
      inhibitor rucaparib will be used from now on. Patients are stratified according to tumor type&#xD;
      (breast vs ovarian) and mutation status ( BRCA 1 vs BRCA 2). In addition, patient with&#xD;
      high-grade serous ovarian cancer can be enrolled into Stage 1 of the study. All patients&#xD;
      enrolled will receive PARP-1 inhibitor rucaparib oral formulation once daily for either 7,&#xD;
      14, or 21 days of each cycle, (two possible dosages for 21 days treatment). Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 21 days for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients who achieve stable or responding disease may receive additional courses of treatment&#xD;
      at the discretion of the chief investigator or Drug Development Office (DDO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      studies. Samples are analyzed for tumor marker (CA 125 and/or CA 15.3) measurements,&#xD;
      rucaparib plasma levels via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry, PARP&#xD;
      activity, and PARP protein expression via western blotting immunoassays. Paraffin embedded&#xD;
      sections from original diagnostic biopsy are also collected and analyzed for PARP protein&#xD;
      expression via immunohistochemical technique. Pleural and ascitic fluid may be collected and&#xD;
      analyzed for DNA DS break repair proficiency via immunohistochemical technique. Some patients&#xD;
      also undergo biopsy of tumors and samples are analyzed for BRCA 2 mutation as well as PARP&#xD;
      activity via validated PARP immunoblotting assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 28 days.&#xD;

             those female patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before&#xD;
             enrolment and agree to use two highly effective forms of contraception (oral, injected&#xD;
             or implanted hormonal contraception and condom, have an intrauterine device and&#xD;
             condom, diaphragm with spermicidal gel and condom, or are surgically sterilised) 4&#xD;

             uncontrolled infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Concurrent malignancies at other sites, with the exception of adequately treated&#xD;
             cone-biopsied in situ carcinoma of the cervix uteri and basal or squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma of the skin and concurrent breast and ovarian carcinoma. Cancer survivors,&#xD;

             scan or echocardiogram, and those patients with left ventricular ejection fraction&#xD;
             (LVEF) below the institutional limit of normal should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
