    <textblock>
      The adjuvant therapy of pancreas cancer has remained a challenge for oncology specialists&#xD;
      from all disciplines since the initial development of the pancreaticoduodenectomy by Whipple&#xD;
      in 1935 (Whipple, Ann Surg, 1935). A variety of phase II experiences utilizing radiation&#xD;
      therapy and 5FU-based chemotherapy following curative surgery for pancreas cancer have&#xD;
      consistently produced the disappointing survival results of 18-24 months median survival,&#xD;
      40%-50% 2-year survival and 10%-20% 5-year survival (Evans, in DeVita, et.al Cancer&#xD;
      Principles and Practices of Oncology, 1997). Indeed, whether any adjuvant therapy following&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreas cancer is of benefit to patients remains a debated&#xD;
      question. The landmark study performed by the GITSG in patients with pancreatic cancer&#xD;
      displayed a survival advantage for patients receiving postoperative radiation therapy and 5FU&#xD;
      compared to those receiving pancreaticoduodenectomy only (2-year survival 43% vs. 18%,&#xD;
      p=0.03). As a result, this study became to some the standard of care for patients with&#xD;
      resected pancreas cancer in the US (GITSG, Cancer 1987). However, this study rightfully has&#xD;
      been criticized from a variety of perspectives over the years; furthermore, recent&#xD;
      experiences by the EROTC and ESPAC have failed to reproduce the GITSG results (Klinkenbijl,&#xD;
      Ann Surg 1999,Neoptolemos, Proc ASCO 2000). However, the results of these two studies have&#xD;
      also received significant criticisms. The EORTC data are underpowered and the study failed to&#xD;
      use post-radiation chemotherapy to optimum advantage. The ESPAC data have been criticized as&#xD;
      being statistically invalid by trial desig10/14/02n and analysis. Thus, the optimization of&#xD;
      adjuvant therapy following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreas cancer remains a subject of&#xD;
      debate and poses essentially the same challenge to oncology specialists at the beginning of&#xD;
      the 21st century as it has for the past sixty years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confronted with these issues, investigators at the Virginia Mason Clinic began in 1995 a&#xD;
      phase II trial utilizing cisplatin and alpha-interferon in conjunction with 5FU and radiation&#xD;
      therapy following pancreaticoduodenectomy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The logic behind&#xD;
      this protocol was as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Recurrence following surgery and adjuvant chemoradiation in protocols for resected&#xD;
           pancreas cancer to that date had been associated with a high incidence of both local and&#xD;
           systemic recurrence; thus treatment must focus on improvement in relapse rates in both&#xD;
           areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. No chemotherapy regimens (as of 1995), either single agent or multi-agent, had shown&#xD;
           response rates markedly different from that seen with single agent 5FU (typically on the&#xD;
           order of 10%)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Therapeutic advance in the adjuvant therapy of pancreas cancer must therefore focus on&#xD;
           systemic agents that have the potential to synergize the tumoricidal activity of&#xD;
           radiation therapy and/or each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cisplatin and alpha-interferon, like 5FU, do have radiosensitizing activity in&#xD;
           experimental tumor systems and thus potentially could be added to 5FU to create a&#xD;
           &quot;combination&quot; radiosensitizing agent analogous to the way chemotherapy agents are&#xD;
           combined for systemic effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. These chemotherapeutic agents also have direct synergistic anticancer activity with&#xD;
           respect to each other in experimental tumor systems .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. These agents also have, to a large extent, non-overlapping toxicities and can be&#xD;
           delivered on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the above logic, a novel phase II protocol (with radiation therapy) for the adjuvant&#xD;
      therapy of pancreas cancer was developed. The protocol was constructed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  XRT 5000cGy/200cGy fractions given daily M-F wks 1-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CDDP 30 mg/m2 d 1 wks 1-5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IFN-A 3,000,000U sq qod wks 1-5 beginning d 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5FU 200mg/m2 wks 1-5 beginning d 1; repeated wks 10-15 and wks 18-23 (2 6 wk&#xD;
           chemotherapy courses post chemoradiation ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, in general, were treated within 8 weeks following pancreaticoduodenectomy (in&#xD;
      general, performed as a pylorus preserving procedure without extended lymph node dissection)&#xD;
      and included patients with adenocarcinomas of the head, body and tail of the pancreas. Other&#xD;
      periampullary cancers were not included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II trial from Virginia Mason has been published in a variety of forms, both&#xD;
      abstract (Picozzi, Proc ASCO 1999,2000) and manuscript (Nukui, Am J Surg 2000). To date, 38&#xD;
      patients have been treated at Virginia Mason using this method. Average patient age is 64.&#xD;
      Thirty three patients had cancers of the pancreas head, 5 patients had body and/or tail&#xD;
      cancers. Noteworthy in this series is a particularly high incidence of the adverse disease&#xD;
      prognostic factors for recurrence such as nodal involvement (79%) and non-surgical margin&#xD;
      positivity (32%). Using a prognostic model for disease recurrence developed at Johns Hopkins&#xD;
      incorporating the above factors plus tumor type (pancreatic head versus other periampullary&#xD;
      cancers), tumor size, tumor differentiation and estimated blood loss at surgery, 37/38&#xD;
      patients (97%) were judged to be at high risk for disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this trial updated as of February, 2001include the following important results:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients (38/38) treated to date have completed the chemoradiation phase of&#xD;
           treatment (wks 1-5); 35/38 patients completed the entire treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Approximately 90% of planned chemotherapy was delivered; virtually all planned radiation&#xD;
           therapy was delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity has been almost entirely GI-related (anorexia/dehydration, mucositis,&#xD;
           nausea/vomiting, diarrhea).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As a result of the above toxicity, the majority of patients required treatment delays&#xD;
           during chemoradiation and approximately 30% (13/38) required hospitalization. However,&#xD;
           there have been no treatment-related fatalities, and all patients have regained full&#xD;
           functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Median follow-up at present is greater than 2 years; 21/38 patients have been followed&#xD;
           for greater than 2 years. 28/38 (74%) patients remain alive, and 25/38 (67%) patients&#xD;
           remain alive and disease free.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At present, the median survivorship of this patient cohort is in excess of 45 months&#xD;
           (45.8 months, 95% confidence limits 36-55 months); the actuarial 2-year and 5-year&#xD;
           survivorships are 65 % and 60 %, respectively. 13/21 patients followed for more than two&#xD;
           years remain alive at this time (including 3 patients alive more than 5 years from&#xD;
           initial diagnosis). If just the 33 patients with adenocarcinomas of the pancreas head in&#xD;
           this phase II trial are considered, the median survivorship rises to 49 months (95%&#xD;
           confidence limits 39-59 months). Actuarial 2-year and 5-year survivorships are 73% and&#xD;
           68% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All recurrences have taken place between 5 and 22 months from the time of diagnosis&#xD;
           (none later).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The recurrence pattern seen to date is as follows; 2 patients local recurrence, 7&#xD;
           patients systemic and 4 patients both local and systemic recurrence. The local control&#xD;
           rate has thus been approximately 85% (32/38 patients) and the systemic control rate&#xD;
           approximately 70% (27/38 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      More detailed data on all 38 patients with adenocarcinomas of the pancreas treated using this&#xD;
      protocol at Virginia Mason to date are displayed in Figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data were presented to the Pancreas Cancer Committee of the ACOSOG in December,2000.&#xD;
      Meeting participants agreed to further development of this protocol given the treatment&#xD;
      results seen in comparison with the historical precedents previously cited. These outcomes&#xD;
      were seen as particularly favorable given the high-risk nature of the patient population&#xD;
      studied. However, the protocol also received the following criticisms from meeting&#xD;
      participants, including NCI reviewers. First, the protocol had only been studies to date at a&#xD;
      single institution. Second, the toxicity of the regimen was seen as quite significant,&#xD;
      especially during chemoradiation, when 30% of patients were hospitalized. Finally, the&#xD;
      post-chemoradiation phase of chemotherapy (infusional 5FU only) was seen as potentially&#xD;
      suboptimal, as several types of chemotherapy regimens, including both combination regimens&#xD;
      utilizing infusional 5FU(ref) and gemcitabine (ref) have produced superior response rates in&#xD;
      phase II trials to that seen with single agent 5FU. As a result of the above dialog, it was&#xD;
      decided by the ACOSOG Pancreas Cancer committee to develop a multi-institutional phase II&#xD;
      trial based upon the Virginia Mason protocol that would incorporate the above comments. It&#xD;
      was also felt that this effort should not conflict with a phase III protocol being planned by&#xD;
      the committee comparing a multi-agent 5FU-based regimen developed at UCLA with radiation&#xD;
      therapy with the single agent 5FU approach used by the GITSG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the protocol-related concerns mentioned above, the following modifications in the&#xD;
      original Virginia Mason protocol are suggested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The issue of toxicity during chemoradiation is addressed in three ways. First, radiation&#xD;
      therapy will be delivered to more confined fields, particularly given the predominance of&#xD;
      systemic recurrence in the therapeutic results to date. Second, the dose intensity of the&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents (cisplatin, 5FU, Alpha-interferon) given during radiation will be reduced&#xD;
      slightly. This is done remembering the majority of patients (approximately 70%) did require a&#xD;
      break in treatment during this phase of therapy. Finally, to assist other providers new to&#xD;
      this protocol, a supportive care pathway has been developed to assist in avoidance of&#xD;
      treatment related toxicity (e.g. nausea, gastritis, hyperglycemia) during treatment.&#xD;
