      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to evaluate the effect of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy&#xD;
      (MBCT) programme on psychological - and somatic symptoms, and illness perceptions in&#xD;
      individuals with self- reported multiple chemical sensitivities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited among respondents to a survey on the consequences of&#xD;
      self-reported symptoms related to inhalation of airborne chemicals conducted by the Danish&#xD;
      Research Centre for Chemical Sensitivities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot trial is designed as a randomized trial on the effect of MBCT versus treatment as&#xD;
      usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBCT programme includes 2½ hours of group training at the Psychiatric Centre,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet once a week for 8 weeks. Furthermore participants are encouraged to practice&#xD;
      at home for up to 45 min per day, 6 days a week during the entire course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of MBCT will be estimated from individual scores on psychometric scales&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple chemical sensitivities is a collective term used to describe illness from exposure&#xD;
      to common environ-mental agents. A recent Danish population-based cross sectional study&#xD;
      reported that 27% of the respondents reported various symptoms from exposure to common&#xD;
      environmental agents. In 19% of the respondents symptoms had led to behavioral changes and in&#xD;
      3.3% of the respondents to adjustments in either social life or occupational conditions, and&#xD;
      in 0.5% to adjustments in both social life and occupational conditions. Multiple chemical&#xD;
      sensitivities is not acknowledged as a clinical diagnose in Denmark and the Danish Healthcare&#xD;
      System has no clinical guidelines for management of people who report this type of illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) programme on&#xD;
      psychological - and somatic symptoms, and illness perceptions in individuals with self-&#xD;
      reported multiple chemical sensitivities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited among respondents to a survey on the consequences of&#xD;
      self-reported symptoms related to inhalation of airborne chemicals conducted by the Danish&#xD;
      Research Centre for Chemical Sensitives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot trial is designed as a randomized trial on the effect of MBCT versus treatment as&#xD;
      usual. Eligible participants (n= 42) stratified by occupational status (e.g. employed/not&#xD;
      employed) will be randomized to either intervention (MBCT) or treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MBCT programme includes 2½ hours of group training at the Psychiatric Centre,&#xD;
      Rigshospitalet once a week for 8 weeks. Furthermore participants are encouraged to practice&#xD;
      at home for up to 45 min per day, 6 days a week during the entire course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effect of MBCT will be estimated from individual scores on the following psychometric scales:&#xD;
      Symptom-Check List-92, The Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire, Perceived Stress Scale-10&#xD;
      and The Subjective Health Complaints-inventory. Estimations will be carried out at baseline,&#xD;
      four weeks after start of MBCT programme, eight weeks after start of MBCT programme, and&#xD;
      three months after ending the MBCT programme.&#xD;
