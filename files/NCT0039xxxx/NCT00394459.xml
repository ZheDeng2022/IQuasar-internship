      Primary Objective: The primary objective is to demonstrate that the safety of Perifix New is&#xD;
      non-inferior to using Perifix Standard when applied for thoracic epidural anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: Incidence of spontaneous paraesthesia during catheter insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: The secondary objectives are to determine the safety and performance of&#xD;
      the investigational product: frequency of inadvertent vascular cannulation, difficulties&#xD;
      involved in insertion and removal of the catheter, other safety features and data for the&#xD;
      evaluation of handling characteristics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidural anaesthesia is a central neuraxial block technique with many applications.&#xD;
      Improvements in equipment, drugs and technique have made it a popular and versatile&#xD;
      anaesthetic technique, with applications in surgery, obstetrics and pain control. Both single&#xD;
      injection and catheter techniques can be used. Its versatility means it can be used as an&#xD;
      anaesthetic, as an analgesic adjuvant to general anaesthesia, and for postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      in procedures involving the lower limbs, perineum, pelvis, abdomen and thorax.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although epidural anaesthesia is a safe technique, during the insertion of epidural catheters&#xD;
      several side effects may occur, including transient paraesthesia and inadvertent vascular&#xD;
      cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported incidences for paraesthesia vary widely between about 0.2% and 50% in different&#xD;
      articles, depending on the catheter (catheter material, soft-tipped or firm-tipped catheter),&#xD;
      the applied technique (lumbar or thoracic epidural anaesthesia, depth of catheter insertion),&#xD;
      the approach (midline or paramedian) and the included patients (obstetrical or&#xD;
      non-obstetrical). Paraesthesias are not supposed to lead to permanent neurological sequelae,&#xD;
      but are unpleasant and perturbing sensations for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides inadvertent intrathecal location of the catheter, further problems include technical&#xD;
      difficulties during threading or removal of the catheter. Here, the catheter shaft material&#xD;
      seems to be the crucial factor for the incidence of problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon years of experience, a wide range of epidural catheters were created, among them&#xD;
      the Perifix catheter of B. Braun. Common features are their high tensile strength and stretch&#xD;
      resistance, excellent shaft stability with easy visualisation of blood or spinal fluid due to&#xD;
      the crystal clear material, no risk of forming loops or knots, and softening of catheter&#xD;
      within a few hours due to water absorption of the polyamide material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, B. Braun Melsungen AG has developed a new generation of Perifix epidural catheters,&#xD;
      which are already CE-labeled. These new catheters are different in their composition compared&#xD;
      to the current Perifix Standard catheter with regard to the catheter material and tip&#xD;
      configuration. They have an outer poly-urethane liner and an inner polyamide body.&#xD;
      Experimental tests have shown that the positive features (e.g. pushability, kink resistance,&#xD;
      gliding, withdrawal) of the Perifix Standard catheter can be maintained. Due to the&#xD;
      polyurethane outer layer, the catheter gets softer when reaching body temperature immediately&#xD;
      upon insertion. Based on this, it is expected that paraesthesias during catheter injection&#xD;
      can be reduced by at least 20%.&#xD;
