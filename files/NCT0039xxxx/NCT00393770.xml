  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g. insulin resistance) is a hallmark and a major pathogenic&#xD;
      factor of type 2 diabetes. It is the key factor of the metabolic syndrome - a cluster of&#xD;
      arterial hypertension, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, coagulation&#xD;
      abnormalities,albuminuria and increased cardiovascular risk - that may precede or accompany&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin function and the abnormalities associated with insulin resistance, may have a major&#xD;
      role in preventing type 2 diabetes and, in the long-term, diabetes micro- and macrovascular&#xD;
      complications. Carnitine is involved in lipids and carbohydrates metabolism and&#xD;
      acetyl-L-carnitine(ALC), an intramitochondrial carrier of acylic group, may modulate cell&#xD;
      fuel substrate utilization. Studies found that carnitine may improve insulin sensitivity and&#xD;
      glucose disposal in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes. A recent study&#xD;
      also found that a primed constant infusion of acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) may increase glucose&#xD;
      utilization in type 2 diabetic patients, possibly restoring the glycogen synthase activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we designed the Acetylcarnitine in insulin resistance study, a pilot,&#xD;
      sequential,longitudinal study aimed to assess whether acetyl-carnitine may improve insulin&#xD;
      function and lipid profile in patients at increased risk of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Decreased insulin sensitivity (e.g. insulin resistance) is a hallmark and a major pathogenic&#xD;
      factor of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes often is related to a cluster of arterial hypertension,&#xD;
      obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, coagulation abnormalities, albuminuria and&#xD;
      increased cardiovascular risk which is called metabolic syndrome. A reduction of&#xD;
      insulin-resistance may improve metabolic syndrome, decreasing in the long term the onset of&#xD;
      clinical diabetes and the incidence of important cardiovascular and renal complications. In&#xD;
      the presence of insulin resistance it is altered the normal signal to the adipose tissue with&#xD;
      a consequent reduction of absorption and use of glucose. In subjects with increased fat mass,&#xD;
      mainly visceral, it has been shown the influence of several factors, as tumoral necrosis&#xD;
      factor alfa (TNF alfa) and fatty free acids (FFAs), on the peripheral activity of the&#xD;
      insulin. TNF alfa, a key modulator in fat metabolism, has a direct role on insulin-mediated&#xD;
      homeostasis of glucose and fatty acids, regulating the action of lipoprotein lipases and&#xD;
      fatty acid carriers influencing CoA synthesis and leptin production that, finally, inhibits&#xD;
      insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Increasing of circulating concentration of fatty&#xD;
      acids, due to the absence of suppression of lipolysis due to insulin inactivity, contributes&#xD;
      to peripheral and hepatic insulin resistance. It is also correlated with a condition of&#xD;
      active inflammation, which is linked to a higher incidence of atherosclerosis and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk, typical of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors, such as adiponectin and resistin, showed to have a role in glucose metabolism.&#xD;
      Adiponectin, a protein produced by adipocytes, has well-known anti-inflammatory and&#xD;
      anti-atherogenic actions, and it is postulated to improve insulin sensitivity through the&#xD;
      improvement of carbohydrates and lipids metabolism. In contrast, resistin seems to induce&#xD;
      insulin resistance and decreased glucose tolerance. Thus, the improvement of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome, by means of an increase of insulin sensitivity and correction of correlated lipids&#xD;
      and carbohydrates metabolism may play a primary role in the prevention of type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and, in the long term, may decrease micro- and macro-vascular complications. Large&#xD;
      prospective trials will help us to understand cellular mechanisms involved in metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome and may be useful to identify new therapeutic targets aimed to reduce insulin&#xD;
      resistance. Carnitine is involved in lipids and carbohydrates metabolism and&#xD;
      acetyl-L-carnitine (ALC) may increase glucose utilization in type 2 diabetic patients,&#xD;
      possibly restoring the glycogen synthase activity. ALC is a mitochondrial carrier of acylic&#xD;
      groups, which directly and indirectly participates to carbohydrates metabolism, acting on&#xD;
      fatty acids and on glucose oxidation on pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). PDH is formed by an&#xD;
      enzymatic complex (PDC) which catalyzes an irreversible reaction in carbohydrates oxidation,&#xD;
      and it is controlled by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, in which Pyruvate&#xD;
      Dehydrogenase Kinase uses ATP to phosphorylate PDH causing its inactivation, and Pyruvate&#xD;
      Dehydrogenase Phosphatase dephosphorylates PDH inactivating it. Kinase is activated by an&#xD;
      increased ratio intramitochondrial acetylCoA/CoA, as we can see in conditions of high fatty&#xD;
      acid levels. The consequent reduction of PDC activity, dramatically decreases glucose&#xD;
      oxidation. Carnitine participates to trans-esterification, forming acetylcarnitine. By means&#xD;
      of catching acylic groups, it decreases ratio acetylCoA/CoA, indirectly stimulating PDC&#xD;
      activity and favouring pyruvate oxidation and of glucose. Thus acetylcarnitine can be&#xD;
      considered a modulator of substrates utilization in cells, with consequences in the&#xD;
      metabolism of both lipids and carbohydrates. Several studies demonstrated that carnitine&#xD;
      contributes to the improvement of insulin sensitivity and glucose utilization in both healthy&#xD;
      subjects and type 2 diabetics. Thus it is interesting to confirm the hypothesis that&#xD;
      acetylcarnitine may improve insulin sensitivity in patients with a risk for type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      and verify if this improvement is associated with other components of metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aim To evaluate insulin sensitivity (e.g. Glucose disposal rate during an euglycemic&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemic clamp) in 40 patients with normal morning fasting glucose and increased risk&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate drug effects on sitting systolic/diastolic blood pressure, lipid profile,&#xD;
           morning fasting glucose and postprandial glucose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the correlation between insulin sensitivity and serum inflammatory markers&#xD;
           (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C-reactive protein) and insulin, leptin and adiponectin&#xD;
           levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess treatment tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study This will be a sequential and longitudinal study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible patients will have a baseline evaluation of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Systolic/diastolic blood pressure, Heart rate, Body weight (BW), B.M.I., Total body&#xD;
      water (TBW)*, Fat-free mass (FFM) **, Fat mass (FM) *** Metabolic Fasting morning blood&#xD;
      glucose; oral glucose tolerance test Insulin, leptin, adiponectin level Lipid profile Total,&#xD;
      VLDL and HDL cholesterol, total triglycerides, Apolipoprotein A and B Inflammatory markers&#xD;
      Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate, C-reactive protein and plasma TNF alfa Patients satisfying&#xD;
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria will have their insulin sensitivity evaluated by an&#xD;
      euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp and will enter a six month treatment period with&#xD;
      Acetylcarnitine 2 g/day. At the end of the treatment period and 2 months after treatment&#xD;
      withdrawal, all baseline parameters, including insulin sensitivity, will then be evaluated.&#xD;
      No changes in diet and in concomitant treatments (in particular with diuretics, ACE&#xD;
      inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, dihydro and non-dihydro calcium channel&#xD;
      blockers, statins) will be introduced throughout the whole study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Calculated by the Hume and Weyers formula: TBW in males = (0.2968 x weight in kg) + (0.1948&#xD;
      x height in cm) - 14.0129 TBW in females = (0.1838 x weight in kg) + (0.3446 x height in cm)&#xD;
      - 35.2701&#xD;
&#xD;
      ** FFM = TBW/0.73&#xD;
&#xD;
      *** FM = BW - FFM&#xD;
