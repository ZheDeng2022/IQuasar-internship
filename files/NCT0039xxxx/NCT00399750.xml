        The following information on clinical trials is provided for information purposes only to&#xD;
        allow patients and physicians to have an initial discussion about the trial. This&#xD;
        information is not intended to be complete information about the trial, to contain all&#xD;
        considerations that may be relevant to potential participation in the trial, or to replace&#xD;
        the advice of a personal physician or health professional.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Metastatic/recurrent disease not amenable to potentially curative treatment (e.g.,&#xD;
             inoperable metastatic disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior chemotherapy for metastatic/recurrent disease. Prior adjuvant treatment with&#xD;
             5-FU/LV and/or IFL is allowed if it is completed at least 6 months before study&#xD;

             conventional CT or MRI scans or &gt;/= 10 mm using spiral CT scans. If a single lesion is&#xD;
             identified as the target lesion, a histological or cytological confirmation of&#xD;
             adenocarcinoma is required.&#xD;
