      Peristomal skin complications are thought to be common but the exact frequency and cause of&#xD;
      these complications are unknown. We have sought to document the incidence of cutaneous&#xD;
      peristomal problems and to find risk factors that might contribute to peristomal&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

      Peristomal skin complications are thought to be common but the exact frequency and cause of&#xD;
      these complications are unknown. We have sought to document the incidence of cutaneous&#xD;
      peristomal problems and to find risk factors that might contribute to peristomal&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional study was conducted from September 2003 to January 2005. The study&#xD;
      population included all persons with an ostomy living in Roskilde County, Denmark. We have&#xD;
      attempted to include all persons with an ostomy by contacting the local municipalities&#xD;
      administering individual aid. Danish law (law of social service section 4 chapter 19 ยง 97)&#xD;
      states that every person with a chronic disease is entitled to reimbursement for any aid&#xD;
      needed. For ostomy patients this means that they are entitled to free stoma care products&#xD;
      from selected merchants and without restriction to type or manufacturer of ostomy product.&#xD;
      All ostomy patients are automatically enrolled in the database at the local municipality in&#xD;
      order to received reimbursement for product cost. It was therefore assumed that all ostomy&#xD;
      patients were registered, as the law provides benefits without restrictions, and self-payment&#xD;
      for alternative purchases would involve substantial additional and unnecessary private&#xD;
      expenditure for the individual ostomy patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A letter was sent to every ostomy patient by the municipalities, inviting them to&#xD;
      participate. The ostomy patients willing to participate would then return the stamped and&#xD;
      addressed envelope with their reply. For all patients who accepted the invitation, a physical&#xD;
      examination was scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the examination a detailed registration form was filled out to provide&#xD;
      standardised records of known risk factors and other data of possible pertinence to the&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A careful physical examination was performed by a dermatologist, a stoma care nurse&#xD;
      specialist and a resident. The majority of ostomy patients were seen at the dermatological&#xD;
      department Roskilde University Hospital, but a few were seen at their homes due to advanced&#xD;
      age or physical impairment. Personal details, medical histories, stoma appliances and daily&#xD;
      stoma care routines were recorded along with a thorough examination of the peristomal area in&#xD;
      regards to ostomy placemant, skin retraction, hernia, stoma height and width. A general skin&#xD;
      examination was also undertaken. Each variable was recorded and further documented by colour&#xD;
      photographs. To ensure that the participating patients correlated to the general population,&#xD;
      a national computer based register of all ostomy patients in Denmark were compared to our&#xD;
      patients in regards to ostomy type, sex, age and geographical location. Patients with a&#xD;
      peristomal skin problem and a control (person without a skin problem) were selected from the&#xD;
      cross-sectional study and invited for further examination. At this examination several non&#xD;
      invasive test were conducted. These non invasive test included: D-squame tapes, Capacitans&#xD;
      measurements , TEWL(transepidermal water loss) measurements , Tape stripping, Mecanical&#xD;
      measurements of the skin and pH measurements.&#xD;
