    <textblock>
      Malformations of the heart (congenital heart disease) are the most common congenital birth&#xD;
      defects, occurring in about 1% of children. Each year, between 150-200 children will undergo&#xD;
      open heart surgery at British Columbia Children's Hospital (BCCH) to repair the defect(s) in&#xD;
      their heart. The abnormal structure of the heart or the open heart surgery may cause damage&#xD;
      to the electrical system of the heart which can disturb the rhythm of the heart&#xD;
      (arrhythmias), prolong recovery or be life-threatening. For this reason, temporary pacing&#xD;
      wires are placed in the heart following surgery to ensure the heart rhythm is as normal as&#xD;
      possible during the post-operative period (pacing). In recent years, scientists have&#xD;
      recognized that pacing the heart from one area is not necessarily the same as pacing it from&#xD;
      a different area. In fact, in some individuals with arrhythmias and poor heart function,&#xD;
      pacing the heart from different areas can improve the pumping of the heart, resulting in&#xD;
      better heart function. This form of treatment is called Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy&#xD;
      (CRT) because it endeavours to optimize the pumping of the heart by changing the electrical&#xD;
      activation of the heart. CRT has been used to a very limited extent in children. A few&#xD;
      pediatric cardiologists have used CRT to help children who are in heart failure. We would&#xD;
      like to determine whether pacing the heart from different areas after open heart surgery&#xD;
      improves the child's heart function and aids his or her recovery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The heart's rhythmic beating or contraction is determined by the flow of an excitatory&#xD;
      electrical wave-front along a specialized cardiac conduction system. In the presence of&#xD;
      altered conduction, such as a bundle branch block or an intra-ventricular conduction delay,&#xD;
      abnormal cardiac contraction or dyssynchrony occurs. The delay can occur in the specialized&#xD;
      conduction system (electrical dyssynchrony) or myocardium (mechanical or structural&#xD;
      dyssynchrony).1 Techniques to improve both electrical and mechanical synchrony in patients&#xD;
      with bundle branch block were initially done on adults. Research in this field began to&#xD;
      appear in the last decade when dual chamber pacing was first used as adjunctive therapy for&#xD;
      adults with medically refractory heart failure.2 Acute studies showed that atrioventricular&#xD;
      (AV) synchronous pacing with a short AV delay improved cardiac output and exercise duration&#xD;
      in patients with heart failure and a prolonged PR interval.3 The beneficial effects of AV&#xD;
      resynchrony (optimizing AV conduction times with pacing) were shown to be due to increased&#xD;
      diastolic filling time, and reduction in mitral or tricuspid valve regurgitation. The results&#xD;
      of long-term studies, however, did not demonstrate consistent improvement in ejection&#xD;
      fraction or NYHA functional class with DDD pacing.4 Since then, Cardiac Resynchronization&#xD;
      Therapy (CRT) has established itself as a proven therapy for congestive heart failure in&#xD;
      adults, with patients showing improvement in exercise tolerance, quality of life, and&#xD;
      survival.1, 5, 6 More recently, the technique of utilizing CRT to stimulate the heart from&#xD;
      novel or multiple sites has been applied to pediatric patients.7-9 Children with chronic&#xD;
      heart failure have received CRT successfully as an adjunctive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major limitations of CRT is the objective assessment of whether cardiac output and&#xD;
      ventricular function are improved. As well, the precise location of where to pace the heart&#xD;
      in order to optimize hemodynamic function needs to be determined. The objective assessment of&#xD;
      successful CRT is a difficult clinical issue and should ideally be performed non-invasively.&#xD;
      Traditional two-dimensional echocardiographic and Doppler indices have been used to assess&#xD;
      the efficacy of CRT and include measuring cardiac output, looking at ventricular ejection&#xD;
      times, visually assessing wall motion, and measuring the length of diastole using the mitral&#xD;
      &quot;E&quot; and &quot;A&quot; waves. As most of the existing techniques are limited to assessing global&#xD;
      function, more detailed methods of assessment are necessary in order to fully assess and&#xD;
      optimize CRT.10, 11 Tissue Doppler Imaging (TDI) offers a more detailed analysis of regional&#xD;
      cardiac function and allows quantitative measures to be obtained. TDI operates at high frame&#xD;
      rates and can non-invasively map cardiac activation and add information related to the degree&#xD;
      and location of cardiac dyssychrony. TDI and its derivatives allow: (1) measurement of&#xD;
      myocardial velocities, which is based on the detection of the Doppler shift caused by the&#xD;
      motion of myocardial tissue during the cardiac cycle; (2) visualization of tissue tracking,&#xD;
      which color-codes tissue segments with similar displacements according to a color map; (3)&#xD;
      measurement of regional strain rates, which describes the rate of deformation, or how quickly&#xD;
      a segment of tissue shortens or lengthens; and (4) measurement of regional strain, which&#xD;
      describes the deformation of an object (in this case, tissue) relative to its original state.&#xD;
      12, 13&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac pacing in children is done most often following cardiac surgery for congenital heart&#xD;
      disease (CHD). This pacing is usually temporary. Following open heart surgery children&#xD;
      frequently exhibit cardiac dyssynchrony secondary to conduction abnormalities or regional&#xD;
      wall motion abnormalities. Often, damage to the conduction system is an unavoidable result of&#xD;
      the operation itself. Regardless of the extent of the conduction abnormality, most patients&#xD;
      operated on for congenital heart disease undergo a period of decreased cardiac function&#xD;
      related to several factors, including: pre-existing myocardial disease; cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass; and residual cardiac lesions.7, 14 The decrease in cardiac performance and,&#xD;
      therefore, the risk to the patient's life, can be aggravated by the presence of cardiac&#xD;
      dyssynchrony. The benefits of CRT are just beginning to receive attention in the setting of&#xD;
      pediatric post-operative cardiac care. 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to demonstrate that CRT is beneficial in the care of post-operative patients&#xD;
      undergoing open-heart surgery for repair of congenital heart defects. We will be using&#xD;
      state-of-the-art TDI for assessing cardiac dyssynchrony, and using it as a tool for&#xD;
      monitoring therapy. This study has tremendous potential for application to all patients&#xD;
      undergoing open-heart surgery for repair of congenital heart defects. If it can be&#xD;
      demonstrated that CRT can improve post-operative outcomes in this population, significant&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality can be avoided, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and hospital stays&#xD;
      shortened, and the associated health care costs reduced.&#xD;

      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The study was limited by a small sample.Our study patients underwent BiV pacing just prior to extubation, by which time myocardial dysfunction may have recovered, so they represented a potentially healthier subset in comparison to adults.</limitations_and_caveats>
