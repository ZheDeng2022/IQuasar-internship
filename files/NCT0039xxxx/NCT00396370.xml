    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety of a Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine against&#xD;
      tuberculosis (TB) and will evaluate if giving the vaccine by mouth, injection, or by both&#xD;
      methods produces greater results. BCG vaccine and/or placebo (substance containing no&#xD;
      medication) will be given by mouth and/or by injection into the skin. This study, conducted&#xD;
      at Saint Louis University, will enroll 60 (up to 80) healthy volunteers, 18-40 years old, who&#xD;
      are negative for a TB test (QuantiFERON®-Gold) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Study&#xD;
      procedures will include a physical exam; review of TB exposure history and medical history;&#xD;
      collection of multiple samples of blood, urine, stool, tears, and nose fluid; and skin and&#xD;
      blood tests for TB. Volunteers may participate for about 24 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaccination with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is used as part of tuberculosis (TB) control&#xD;
      strategies in most of the world outside of the United States and constitutes the most widely&#xD;
      implemented vaccination strategy worldwide. However, despite widespread use of BCG, TB&#xD;
      remains a leading infectious cause of death worldwide and it is estimated that one-third of&#xD;
      the world's population is chronically and asymptomatically (latently) infected with&#xD;
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB. This is a phase I,&#xD;
      single-center, randomized, vaccine trial including six double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      groups and one open-label group. Approximately 68 (up to 80) healthy male and female subjects&#xD;
      18-40 years old, inclusive, who are negative for QuantiFERON®-TB Gold and human&#xD;
      immunodeficiency virus will be enrolled. The expected total duration of the volunteer&#xD;
      enrollment, vaccination, and follow-up (volunteer participation) for this study is 30 months.&#xD;
      All volunteers are expected to be enrolled over a period of 9 months and on study for 24&#xD;
      months. Detailed immune studies with frozen samples will be expected to continue after&#xD;
      collection of all samples and after the protocol has been completed. Eligibility will be&#xD;
      determined by volunteer's health at prescreening and eligible subjects will give study&#xD;
      specific main study informed consent for enrollment in the study. Subjects randomized to&#xD;
      Groups A-F will receive, at Day 0 and 1 year later, BCG intradermally, orally, or by both&#xD;
      routes. PBS (PO) and Sauton medium (injectable) placebo will be used to blind the study.&#xD;
      Subjects randomized to Group G will receive BCG intradermally at Day 0 only. The primary&#xD;
      study objectives are the assessment of the safety of combined and individual intradermal (ID)&#xD;
      and oral (PO) vaccination with Statens Serum Institut (SSI) BCG in healthy, immunologically&#xD;
      naïve volunteers; comparisons of mycobacteria-specific interferon-gamma responses and mucosal&#xD;
      immunoglobulin-A induced by SSI BCG vaccination given intradermally, orally and by both&#xD;
      routes combined; and comparison of safety and immunogenicity of Danish and Connaught BCG&#xD;
      given intradermally. The secondary study objectives are the assessment of purified protein&#xD;
      derivative skin test responses as an indication of cutaneous T cell trafficking after&#xD;
      vaccination with SSI BCG; and quantitation of BCG replication in Sanofi Pasteur ID BCG&#xD;
      ulcerative lesions after ID BCG vaccination. The exploratory study objectives are comparisons&#xD;
      of intracellular killing activity induced by SSI BCG vaccination given intradermally, orally,&#xD;
      and by both routes combined; and characterization of mycobacteria-specific T cells induced&#xD;
      intradermally, orally, or both routes by vaccination with SSI BCG using dendritic cells as&#xD;
      antigen-presenting cells and stored peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a source for&#xD;
      matched T cells collected before and after vaccination. Parent protocol to sub-study 12-0110&#xD;
      and 10-0026.&#xD;

        partner, surgical sterilization, barrier method such as diaphragm or condom with&#xD;
        contraceptive foam or total abstinence) for 30 days prior to immunization and for the&#xD;
        2-year period of study follow-up. -Be in good health as judged by a physician on the basis&#xD;
        of reported medical history and physical examination including blood pressure (BP) and&#xD;
        respiratory evaluation. -Have a negative human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 enzyme-linked&#xD;
        immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. -Have negative serology tests for hepatitis B surface&#xD;

        secondary vaccination will result in the secondary vaccination being delayed until at least&#xD;
        72 hr after resolution of any of these symptoms that were not considered indicative of&#xD;
        active tuberculosis (TB). -Have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or other abnormalities&#xD;
        on physical examination. -Have oropharyngeal or skin ulceration, or history of&#xD;
        chronic/recurrent peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. -Note: Self-limited ulceration at&#xD;
        intradermal (ID) vaccination site healing within 3 months or other mild to moderate&#xD;
        complaints lasting less than 1-2 weeks, as documented in the memory aids (used for 2 weeks&#xD;
        after each vaccination) or other source documents used to capture results of clinical&#xD;
        assessments at any time point during the trial, will not be reasons to exclude a volunteer&#xD;
        from receiving the secondary vaccination. -History of any significant acute or chronic&#xD;

        -Lives with someone with HIV, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or active cancer.&#xD;
        -Have chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants or other&#xD;
        immune-modifying drugs within 6 months prior to the vaccine dose. (For corticosteroids,&#xD;
        this will mean prednisone, or equivalent, greater than or equal to 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled&#xD;
        and topical steroids are allowed.) -Have a history of smoking, alcoholism requiring medical&#xD;
        attention, substance abuse, and/or intravenous drug use within the past 1 year prior to&#xD;
        enrollment in the study. -Has a history or physical findings to suggest asthma or any&#xD;
        chronic pulmonary condition. -Has a history of epilepsy. -Has a pacemaker or implantable&#xD;
        cardiac devices. -Has a prosthetic valve. -Has a history of bleeding disorder. -Known&#xD;
        allergy to any vaccine components. -Is currently taking anticoagulant or anti-platelet&#xD;
        drugs and/or insulin. -Is currently under a physician's care for asthma or any chronic&#xD;
        pulmonary condition. -Received blood products or immunoglobulin within 6 months of the&#xD;
        first vaccination. -Vaccinated previously with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) at study&#xD;
        entry. -Received live attenuated vaccines within 4 weeks of vaccination. -Received&#xD;
        inactivated vaccines within 2 weeks of vaccination. (Medically indicated inactivated&#xD;
        vaccines should be given at least 2 weeks away from BCG immunization, or any sampling time&#xD;
        point after vaccination.) -Participated in another research study that includes receiving&#xD;
        an experimental agent or drug 30 days prior to vaccination. -Have a history of the use of a&#xD;
        systemic antibiotic within the 14 days prior to vaccination or planned use of a systemic&#xD;
        antibiotic during this study. -Have any medical, psychiatric, occupa tional, or behavioral&#xD;
        problems that make it unlikely the volunteer will comply with the protocol as determined by&#xD;
        the principal investigator (PI). -Be a health care provider at the highest risk of&#xD;
        acquiring Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection, such as pulmonologists performing&#xD;
        bronchoscopies on TB patients.&#xD;
