    <textblock>
      Cognitive and neurological dysfunction after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is common&#xD;
      and multi-factorial in origin. Several previous studies have shown that intraoperative&#xD;
      aprotinin administration may be neuroprotective.in the current prospective randomized study,&#xD;
      the effect of intraoperative aprotinin administration on the integrity of the optic nerve and&#xD;
      retinal nerve fiber layer will be examined. Optical coherance tomography will be used to&#xD;
      examin the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer.&#xD;

      Cognitive and neurological dysfunction after coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) is common&#xD;
      and multi-factorial in origin. Causative factors include cerebral Embolization (1), cerebral&#xD;
      ischemia reperfusion (2), cerebral hyperthermia after discontinuation of cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB) (3), and the systemic inflammatory response to CPB (4). Cognitive dysfunction is&#xD;
      reported in 53% of patients at discharge from the hospital, 36% at six weeks and 42% at five&#xD;
      years (5). Cognitive function at discharge from hospital is a predictor of long-term&#xD;
      cognitive outcome (5). Adverse neurological outcome has been classified as: type I (focal&#xD;
      neurological injury, stupor or coma) and type II (deterioration in intellectual function,&#xD;
      memory deficit or seizures). Patients with adverse cerebral outcomes have greater in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, longer hospitalization and a greater rate of discharge to facilities for&#xD;
      intermediate or long-term care (6). Adverse neurological outcome after otherwise successful&#xD;
      surgery is devastating for the patient, their family and society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive testing is the most established method to assess post cardiac surgery&#xD;
      cognitive outcome. Despite the extensive use of neurocognitive testing procedures in the&#xD;
      research literature, there is uncertainty regarding the precise interpretation of findings in&#xD;
      any given study. Thus, new tools to evaluate cognitive outcome are now being investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aprotinin is a naturally occurring serine protease inhibitor that is being used with&#xD;
      increasing frequency in cardiac surgery to reduce blood loss and the need for perioperative&#xD;
      blood transfusion. Through inhibition of serine proteases such as plasmin, aprotinin&#xD;
      significantly reduces fibrinolysis, thereby aiding hemostasis during surgical procedures.&#xD;
      These proven benefits are supplemented by the anti-inflammatory properties of aprotinin,&#xD;
      which may help curb some of the deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass. Two aprotinin&#xD;
      dosing regimens are used for prophylactic reduction of perioperative blood loss and the need&#xD;
      for blood transfusion in patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Serum&#xD;
      concentrations achieved with the full-dose regimen inhibit both kallikrein and plasmin&#xD;
      activity resulting in attenuation of the systemic inflammatory response to bypass, whereas&#xD;
      serum concentrations achieved with the half-dose regimen only inhibit plasmin activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-spite of the fact that aprotinin has been administered for more than a decade to cardiac&#xD;
      surgery patients, it's safety is still controversial. Several studies have reported an&#xD;
      increase risk for postoperative MI, CVA and renal failure after it's usage. Thus, its usage&#xD;
      is not a standard of care, and depends on the surgeon decision (13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence supporting the neuroprotective effects of aprotinin given during surgery was&#xD;
      obtained in several studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a post hoc analysis of 816 CABG patients from a multicenter study (7), aprotinin&#xD;
      administration was associated with a significantly (P = 0.04) decreased incidence of stroke&#xD;
      (3.1% vs. 0.0%). A meta-analysis (8) of placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind studies&#xD;
      of CABG patients receiving high-dose aprotinin or placebo has supported the hypothesis and&#xD;
      reported stroke incidence of 4.2% vs. 0%. A number of prospective studies have shown&#xD;
      reduction in post cardiac surgery cognitive deficits when aprotinin was administered during&#xD;
      CPB (9-10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, the mechanism by which aprotinin may confer neuroprotection is not known, an&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effect can be postulated. Another possible neuroprotective mechanism is&#xD;
      improved recovery of cerebral metabolism after ischemia (11). Its main site of action may be&#xD;
      the microcirculation, where it decreases ischemic injury by decreasing bradykinin generation&#xD;
      (12) and provides a better microcirculatory environment during early reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processes inflicting Cerebrovascular ischemia and inflammatory damage may also affect the&#xD;
      optic nerve. Thus, pathophysiological findings discovered by optic nerve imaging can reflect&#xD;
      cerebrovascular status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ischemic damage to the optic nerve or ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) is a known complication&#xD;
      of CABG. ION describes a defect of the optic nerve leading to irreversible loss of vision in&#xD;
      most cases. Influenced by a variety of factors, pathophysiological microvascular changes are&#xD;
      believed to provoke anterior ischemic neuropathy with sudden painless loss of vision. Since&#xD;
      therapeutic trials have failed, there is no reliable and effective treatment of anterior&#xD;
      ischemic optic neuropathy and prevention of possible causes is the only way to avoid this&#xD;
      rare but severe complication of cardiac surgery. The following risk factors were determined&#xD;
      for ION following CABG: History of glaucoma or other ophthalmological problems, prolonged&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass-time, myocardial ischemia, general edema during cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass, excessive hemodilution with low hemoglobin and hematocrit, hypo- or hypertension,&#xD;
      systemic hypothermia, need for vasoactive medication, diabetes and anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RNFL thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography OCT has been shown to correlate&#xD;
      very well with optic nerve atrophy and visual function in optic neuritis14, 15. Using OCT&#xD;
      measurements of optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness and visual field&#xD;
      testing as the primary outcome, we hypothesize that high-dose aprotinin administration would&#xD;
      decrease the incidence and severity of optic nerve and retinal injury following CABG with&#xD;
      CPB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Anesthesia, surgery and postoperative management Oral lorazepam 0.02 to 0.03 mg/kg will be&#xD;
      administered to patients two hours before surgery. General anesthesia will be induced with&#xD;
      fentanyl 15 to 20 µg/kg and ketamin. Muscle relaxation will be achieved using pancuronium 0.1&#xD;
      mg/kg. Before cannulation of the heart, heparin (at least 300 U/kg iv) will be administered&#xD;
      to each patient. Additional heparin will be administered to achieve and maintain a cephalin&#xD;
      kaolin time &gt; 480 sec. CPB will be instituted using a hollow fibre oxygenator (--) and a&#xD;
      40-µm screen arterial filter ( ) with crystalloid priming and a non-pulsatile flow at 32.0 to&#xD;
      34.0°C. Pump prime will be consisted of lactated Ringer's solution 2000 mL, sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate 8.4% 50 mL and mannitol 20% 3 mL/kg. The pump flow rate will be maintained at 2.4&#xD;
      L/min x m-2 during aortic cross clamping. During CPB, pump flows will be adjusted to maintain&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure at 65 to 80 mmHg and hematocrit will be maintained at 20 to 25%.&#xD;
      Intermittent use of cardiotomy suction () (0.5-1 L flows) from pericardiotomy to closure of&#xD;
      pericardium will be used. A cell saver device will not be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myocardial protection will be by intermittent antegrade and retrograde blood cardioplegia&#xD;
      administered via the aortic root and the coronary sinus respectively. A single aortic&#xD;
      cross-clamp will be used to complete distal and proximal anastamosis. Aortic venting will be&#xD;
      used in all patients. At the end of surgery, patients will be transferred to the intensive&#xD;
      care unit, where mechanical ventilation will be continued until local criteria for weaning&#xD;
      and tracheal extubation will be met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to a treatment group or placebo. In the treatment group,&#xD;
      aprotinin will be administered, consisting of 2 x 106 KIU as a loading dose after induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia, 2 x 106 KIU added to the CPB circuit prime, and a continuous infusion of 5 x&#xD;
      105 KIU•hr-1 during surgery. The infusion will be discontinued at the end of surgery.&#xD;
      Patients and the ophthalmologist will be unaware of the study group to which each patient&#xD;
      belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT and Visual Field measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      OCT measurements and visual fields examination will be performed in all patients prior to, 7&#xD;
      days and one month after surgery.&#xD;
