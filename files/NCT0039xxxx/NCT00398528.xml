  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Impaired short term memory, attention and concentration lapses, and slower processing of&#xD;
      information occur in up to 40-65% of patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The quality of&#xD;
      life of individuals with MS is impacted to the degree with which they experience these&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several medications approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) to treat MS symptoms and to modify (slow) disease course. Traditional approaches to&#xD;
      determining the effectiveness of medications used in treating MS rely on reports of the&#xD;
      number of relapses an individual experiences, as well as standard clinical tests, such as the&#xD;
      Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study will look at whether the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)&#xD;
      scan can be used as a tool for measuring changes in the brain associated with treatment in MS&#xD;
      patients. Unlike a typical MRI which provides structural information about the brain, the&#xD;
      fMRI provides information about brain activity during performance of cognitive or motor&#xD;
      tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of the immunomodulatory, disease-modifying therapies (DMT) represents a major&#xD;
      advance for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). To date, immunomodulatory agents&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of MS in the United States include two forms of recombinant&#xD;
      interferon-beta (IFN-beta-1a [Avonex, Rebif] and IFN-beta-1b [Betaseron]) and synthetic&#xD;
      glatiramer acetate [Copaxone].&#xD;
&#xD;
      These drugs have been shown to favorably alter the natural history of relapsing remitting MS&#xD;
      by slowing the progression of disability, reducing relapse rate, and decreasing brain&#xD;
      inflammation as measured by MRI. There is evidence that the treatment effects of both&#xD;
      IFN-beta and glatiramer acetate are related to their properties in regulating various&#xD;
      components of the immune system, in particular, the T cell functions (e.g. proliferation and&#xD;
      migratory behavior) and cytokine production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though demonstrating clear efficacy on a number of short-term clinical measures, these agents&#xD;
      are not cures and most patients with MS continue to experience disease activity in spite of&#xD;
      treatment. Over the last ten years, clinicians have become comfortable initiating therapy&#xD;
      with DMT. Now, attention is focused on monitoring the results of a chosen therapy and&#xD;
      deciding whether or not a patient is responding optimally to treatment. At present, however,&#xD;
      clinicians lack criteria for defining optimal response to DMT as well as evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations on how to improve treatment outcomes for individual patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a recently published model generated by an advisory board from the United States, as a&#xD;
      framework, The Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Working Group (CMSWG) developed practical,&#xD;
      evidence-based recommendations on how neurologists can assess the status of patients on DMT&#xD;
      and decide when it may be necessary to modify treatment in order to optimize outcomes. The&#xD;
      CMSWG's recommendations are based on monitoring relapses, neurological progression and MRI&#xD;
      activity. These recommendations have yet to be implemented in a prospective, randomized,&#xD;
      comparative Phase IV clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional measures do not provide critical information about the neural systems that&#xD;
      underlie change in behavioral performance. The goal of developing a surrogate biological&#xD;
      marker of drug efficacy is to be able to measure the extent to which a drug reaches its&#xD;
      intended targeted neural system, and to understand and predict the impact of treatment on&#xD;
      existing neuropathology. Ideally, relevant clinical outcome measures should be well&#xD;
      correlated with the biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI is a new tool for noninvasive imaging of human brain function. Without the use of&#xD;
      contrast agents, fMRI detects regional MR signal increases that have been hypothesized to&#xD;
      reflect decreases in deoxyhemoglobin due to local increases in blood flow/volume during task&#xD;
      activation. fMRI has higher spatial and temporal resolution than other existing functional&#xD;
      imaging techniques, making it ideal for the study of complex cognitive functions in patient&#xD;
      populations.&#xD;
