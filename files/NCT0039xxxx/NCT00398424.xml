  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, Open-Label study evaluating the PK of S-1 components and their metabolites&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of hepatic function defined by the&#xD;
      NCI classification for hepatic impairment. Patients will be stratified into 4 Cohorts-&#xD;
      Normal, Mild, Moderate or Severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six patients will be enrolled inot each cohort and receive S-1.&#xD;

    <description>PK Phase (Part 1), Beginning on Day 1 of the Pharmacokinetic Phase, 30 mg/m2 S-1 will be administered orally BID for 14 days (Days 1 through 14), followed by a 1-week recovery period.&#xD;
On Day -2 and Day 14 of the Pharmacokinetic Phase, all patients will receive a single dose of 30 mg/m2 S-1 administered orally.&#xD;
Extension Phase, Patients will receive S-1 at the dose that they tolerated in the PK Phase. S-1 will be administered orally BID for 2 weeks (Day 1 through Day 14) followed by a 1-week recovery period (Day 15 through Day 21). This cycle will be repeated every 3 weeks.</description>

                  treatment with drugs interacting with S-1. The following drugs are prohibited&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Sorivudine, uracil, dipyridamole, cimetidine and folinic acid (may enhance S-1&#xD;
                  activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Allopurinol (may diminish S-1 activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Phenytoin (S-1 may enhance phenytoin activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1 and&#xD;
                  flucytosine activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Pilocarpine (may inhibit CYP2A6 activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Has known sensitivity to 5-FU. 5. Is a pregnant or lactating female. 6. Is a patient&#xD;
