      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a novel prescription method (N-of-1&#xD;
      intervention)can be successfully integrated into primary care practices and to examine the&#xD;
      effects of this prescription method on selected patient health outcomes (e.g.., medication&#xD;
      compliance, medication costs, symptom management, satisfaction of physician/patient visit,&#xD;
      etc.) in patients with a uncontrolled or new diagnosis of Osteoarthritis or Chronic Heartburn&#xD;
      (GERD).&#xD;

      The current prescription writing behavior of physicians is largely an informed decision based&#xD;
      upon education and experience. The physician typically assesses the signs and symptoms of a&#xD;
      patient presentation, laboratory and other clinical tests, and other factors that may be&#xD;
      known to the physician (e.g. an inability to swallow capsules, or a requirement to be in&#xD;
      direct sunlight for an extended period), and chooses a drug to prescribe with no evidence of&#xD;
      patient response to the agent prescribed. The prescribing physician may or may not decide to&#xD;
      validate this decision by additional testing in the form of follow-up visits or other&#xD;
      procedures that are designed to assess the effectiveness of the prescription after some&#xD;
      arbitrary period of time, but not comparatively with other available agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other influences may impact the decision including aggressive promotions by pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies in support of their latest medication and direct to consumer retail advertising.&#xD;
      Studies conducted by the University of Washington Medical School have shown that when&#xD;
      patients merely enquire about a drug for which they've seen advertising, that drug is then&#xD;
      more frequently prescribed (Hollon 2005). At its best, prescription writing is an educated&#xD;
      guess with a scheduled follow-up to verify the results of the decision. At its worst, it may&#xD;
      result in all risk with no benefit to the patient if the patient is a non-responder, or if&#xD;
      the patient accepts an adverse outcome without informing the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Opt-e-scrip method for determining prescriptions is virtually the same method that is&#xD;
      used to assess new drugs for regulatory approval (i.e.,controlled experiments to reduce&#xD;
      systematic error, reduce random variation, increase precision of assessment). However,&#xD;
      instead of applying the techniques of scientific investigation to populations, these methods&#xD;
      are applied to the individual patient. Opt-e-scrip's proprietary methods are used to assess&#xD;
      alternative choices within a therapeutic class for effectiveness and safety before&#xD;
      prescribing a specific agent for an individual patient. In this case, however, because the&#xD;
      drugs are already marketed and cost information is available, when two or more agents are&#xD;
      equally safe and effective, a decision can be made reliably on cost as a relevant factor&#xD;
      (2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial studies indicate that the Opt-e-scrip methodology can distinguish between similar&#xD;
      medications based on efficacy and/or side effects at the individual patient level in patients&#xD;
      with osteoarthritis, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and allergic rhinitis (Reitberg,&#xD;
      Del Rio et al. 2002; Reitberg, Weiss et al. 2005). It remains to be seen how well this method&#xD;
      can be integrated into clinical care and how clinicians and patients respond to the method as&#xD;
      part of routine care. This project will assess the integration of Opt-e-scrip method into 20&#xD;
      primary care practices that will each use the method to assist with medication selection in&#xD;
      30 to 40 patients with a new diagnosis or uncontrolled osteoarthritis and GERD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims of Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1. Evaluate whether the (N-of-1) intervention prescription method can be successfully&#xD;
           integrated into primary care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2. Determine whether use of the intervention prescription method changes medication&#xD;
           selection for patients with osteoarthritis and gastroesophageal reflux disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3. Examine the effects of the intervention method on medication compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4. Examine the effects of the intervention prescription method on medication costs.&#xD;
