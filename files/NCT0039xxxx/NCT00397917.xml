  <brief_summary>

      The purpose of this study is to asses if taking 4 mg of folic acid per day at preconception&#xD;
      and during the first three months of pregnancy decreases the risk of having a child with&#xD;
      cleft lip and palate compared to 0.4 mg folic acid for women who have an oral cleft or have&#xD;
      had previously child with an oral cleft.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cleft lip and palate is a common and burdensome birth defect that has large health&#xD;
      ramifications and requires surgical, speech, behavioral, dental, and medical interventions.&#xD;
      There is some evidence suggesting that taking folic acid particularly at large doses during&#xD;
      preconception and first trimester of pregnancy may decrease the risk of oral cleft&#xD;
      recurrence, which is the risk of having a child with an oral cleft for women who have an oral&#xD;
      cleft or who have had a child with a cleft. However this evidence is based on study designs&#xD;
      that are incapable of contributing the preventive effects to folic acid with adequate&#xD;
      confidence, and the real effect of folic acid on cleft recurrence prevention remains to be&#xD;
      identified. Taking 4 mg of folic acid per day at preconception and first trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy has also been shown to prevent the recurrence of neural tube defects by up to 70%,&#xD;
      providing further support to evaluate this intervention for oral cleft recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates the effects of supplementation with 4 versus 0.4 mg of folic acid per&#xD;
      day at preconception and during the first three months of pregnancy on recurrence of cleft&#xD;
      lip and palate. Up to 6000 women will be randomly assigned to 4 versus 0.4 mg groups. The&#xD;
      primary aim is to compare the recurrence rates in the offspring of trial mothers in the two&#xD;
      groups. Secondary aims are to compare the two groups on several outcomes including&#xD;
      miscarriage, twinning, pre-eclampsia, serum and red cell folate levels, severity of oral&#xD;
      clefts and occurrence of other birth defects in the offspring of trial mothers, and birth&#xD;
      weight and gestational age of trial babies, and to compare the recurrence in the two groups&#xD;
      to that in historic controls.&#xD;
