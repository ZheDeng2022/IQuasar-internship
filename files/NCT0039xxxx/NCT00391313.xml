  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A severe outbreak of Chikungunya fever has been reported at La Réunion Island (France) in&#xD;
      2005-2006. Chikungunya is a viral disease. Chikungunya virus is an alphavirus transmitted to&#xD;
      humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes, usually of the genus Aedes (Aedes albopictus in La&#xD;
      Réunion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, more than 266,000 cases were estimated to have occurred in the island (760,000&#xD;
      inhabitants). Most of cases are expressed as a mild disease, with intense fever and&#xD;
      arthralgias, with rare but serious complications (encephalitis, liver, cardiac or renal&#xD;
      failures.) having required a hospitalization in an intensive care unit. 273 of such serious&#xD;
      cases (immediately life threatening condition) have been reported among the cases, in&#xD;
      patients aged over 10 days (59% were 65+ age old). Chikungunya was proven in 246 serious&#xD;
      cases; 101 patients had comorbidities, and 27% of confirmed cases eventually died. In&#xD;
      addition 44 cases of mother-to-child infections were reported and 40 were confirmed (one&#xD;
      died).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, in 248 death certificates, chikungunya was reported as the direct or indirect cause&#xD;
      of death, with a median age of 79, range 0-102, and a sex-ratio (M/F) of 0.95. InVS, in&#xD;
      collaboration with Inserm (French NIH) also reported (by June 6, 2006) a significant excess&#xD;
      of mortality (from all causes) during the major outbreak which occurred from December, 2005&#xD;
      (+10%) to April, 2006 (10.1%), with a peak of excess mortality reached in February (+34.4%),&#xD;
      concommitant to the peak of incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, there is no antiviral treatment against Chikungunya. We showed from ex-vivo studies&#xD;
      (in a sensitive model of cells culture to the viral infection) that chloroquine provides a&#xD;
      significant inhibition on the replication of the Chikungunya virus. This efficacy seemed also&#xD;
      to be reached at a plasmatic concentration of similar order of magnitude as recommended for&#xD;
      treating malaria with this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial aims to assess efficacy and safety of chloroquine as as therapeutic treatment of&#xD;
      chikungunya disease.&#xD;
