  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This disease is believed to be due to immune cells, cells which normally protect the body,&#xD;
      but are now destroying the bile ducts in the liver. When the ducts are damaged, bile builds&#xD;
      up in the liver and damages liver tissue. Over time, the disease can cause cirrhosis and may&#xD;
      make the liver stop working. This study is designed to examine whether treating patients with&#xD;
      high dose Cyclophosphamide and Fludarabine (drugs which reduce the function of your immune&#xD;
      system) and CAMPATH-1H (a protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be causing&#xD;
      PBC), followed by return of blood stem cells that have been previously collected from patient&#xD;
      brother or sister will stop or reverse the disease. The purpose of the Cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
      Fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H is to decrease immune system. The purpose of the stem cell&#xD;
      infusion is to restore blood production, which will be severely impaired by the&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide, Fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H, and to produce a normal immune system that will&#xD;
      no longer attack the body.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be no randomization in this study. All subjects who are determined to be eligible&#xD;
      for the study treatment will receive high dose cyclophosphamide, fludarabine and CAMPATH-1H&#xD;
      followed by infusion of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells. The procedures the subject&#xD;
      will undergo are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physician visit to determine potential eligibility for the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
           evaluated by a transplant physician. They will have a complete physical examination and&#xD;
           will provide a full medical history at these visits. In addition, subjects will be asked&#xD;
           to complete a quality of life Questionnaire . Finally, the study will be described in&#xD;
           detail by the transplant physician and nurse and the consent form will be provided to be&#xD;
           taken home to read.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HLA Testing. In order to proceed on this study, subjects will need to have a HLA&#xD;
           identical matched sibling donor. The subject and his or her siblings will need to&#xD;
           undergo HLA typing in order to determine whether there is a match or Cord blood stem&#xD;
           cells will be obtained from the New York Blood Center Cord Blood Registry which is an&#xD;
           internationally recognized registry or, if a match is not available, from Stemcyte, a&#xD;
           commercial registry that specializes in minority donors. One unit of HLA matched cord&#xD;
           blood unit will be infused on day zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Insurance verification. Subjects who remain interested in pursuing the study treatment&#xD;
           and who have severe scleroderma that is following a progressive course will proceed to&#xD;
           the insurance verification phase. Third party payment or self-pay must be verified&#xD;
           before subjects can proceed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Consent form. Prior to proceeding, the appropriate signatures will be obtained on the&#xD;
           consent form. Subjects will be given an opportunity to ask further questions of the&#xD;
           attending physician and transplant nurse prior to signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Pre-transplant testing. To determine final eligibility for the study, subjects will&#xD;
           undergo a series of tests/procedures. These include: CXR, electrocardiogram, endoscopy ,&#xD;
           ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder,transvenous liver biopsy, lymphopheresis,&#xD;
           pulmonary function test, urinalysis, and blood testing to include CBC; chemistries;&#xD;
           liver and kidney function tests; PT; PTT; AMA; viral studies and, for females, a&#xD;
           pregnancy test. Subjects will also be evaluated by a dentist at Northwestern Memorial&#xD;
           Hospital to rule out any potential sources of infection. All pre-transplant testing is&#xD;
           routine medical testing done to verify diagnosis and to insure adequate organ function&#xD;
           and absence of viral illnesses which would preclude a safe transplant course. Allogeneic&#xD;
           donors will also need to undergo testing in order to determine eligibility to proceed.&#xD;
           Testing for donors will include history and physical, electrocardiogram, CXR,&#xD;
           urinalysis, CBC, chemistries, PT, PTT, viral studies and, for females, a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell collection. Allogeneic donors will undergo a&#xD;
           routine procedure for the mobilization and collection of peripheral blood stem cells.&#xD;
           This includes the subcutaneous administration of G-CSF, to be self-administered as an&#xD;
           outpatient, beginning three days prior to the start of peripheral blood stem cell&#xD;
           harvesting. The peripheral blood stem cells will be collected as an outpatient in the&#xD;
           Blood Center on the fourth day of G-CSF administration. A central line may be placed for&#xD;
           this purpose on the first day of leukopheresis. Leukopheresis will be continued on a&#xD;
           daily basis (up to four consecutive days) until an adequate number of peripheral blood&#xD;
           stem cells have been collected. G-CSF will continue to be administered until&#xD;
           leukopheresis is completed. The pheresis catheter will be discontinued when stem cell&#xD;
           harvesting is completed. Processed cells will be frozen and stored until they are&#xD;
           reinfused after the conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Study treatment. Prior to the administration of the study treatment, subjects will have&#xD;
           a double lumen PICC line placed for the administration of chemotherapy, IV fluids, blood&#xD;
           products and the withdrawal of blood samples. The placement of a central catheter is a&#xD;
           routine medical procedure. Subjects will then undergo conditioning which will include 4&#xD;
           days of intravenous fludarabine and 4 days of cyclophosphamide and 2 days of CAMPATH-1H.&#xD;
           All drugs are FDA approved drugs. The previously collected allogeneic peripheral blood&#xD;
           stem cells will be reinfused following the completion of the conditioning regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Post-transplant follow-up. Subjects will have a history and physical by the transplant&#xD;
           physician at 6 months, 12 months, and yearly for 5 years. In addition, routine&#xD;
           urinalysis and blood testing will be performed at these same intervals to include CBC;&#xD;
           chemistries; kidney and liver function tests; AMA; ultrasound of the liver and&#xD;
           gallbladder, transvenous liver biopsy, lymphopheresis, and patients will also be asked&#xD;
           to complete a SF-36 Questionnaire, NDDK-QA Questionnaire.&#xD;
