      RATIONALE: Osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption uses certain drugs, such as mannitol, to&#xD;
      open the blood vessels around the brain and allow tumor-killing substances to be carried&#xD;
      directly to the brain. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as methotrexate and carboplatin, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor&#xD;
      growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others&#xD;
      find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Trastuzumab&#xD;
      may also help methotrexate and carboplatin work better by making tumor cells more sensitive&#xD;
      to the drugs. Giving osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption together with methotrexate,&#xD;
      carboplatin, and trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of carboplatin when&#xD;
      given together with methotrexate and trastuzumab after mannitol in treating women with breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to the brain.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and toxicity associated with blood-brain barrier disruption&#xD;
           comprising transfemoral mannitol followed by methotrexate and carboplatin with or&#xD;
           without trastuzumab (Herceptin®) in women with brain metastasis secondary to breast&#xD;
           cancer. (Phase I)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if overall survival exceeds 5 months in patients with Human Epidermal growth&#xD;
           factor Receptor 2(HER2)-positive or HER2-negative disease treated with this regimen.&#xD;
           (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the overall survival of these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the event-free and overall survival, steroid use, response rates, and time to&#xD;
           best response in patients with HER2-positive vs HER2-negative disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the neuropsychological effects of this treatment regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine cerebrospinal fluid levels of trastuzumab before and after blood-brain barrier&#xD;
           disruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I, pilot, dose-finding study of carboplatin followed by&#xD;
      a phase II, open-label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase I: Patients undergo osmotic blood-brain barrier disruption (BBBD) comprising&#xD;
           mannitol by transfemoral catheterization followed by methotrexate intra-arterially (IA)&#xD;
           over 10 minutes and carboplatin IA over 10 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also&#xD;
           receive sodium thiosulfate IV over 15 minutes at 4 and 8 hours after each dose of&#xD;
           carboplatin; leucovorin calcium IV or orally every 6 hours on days 3-9; and&#xD;
           pegfilgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on day 4 or filgrastim (G-CSF) SC beginning on day 4&#xD;
           and continuing until blood counts recover (7-10 days). Patients with HER-2 positive&#xD;
           disease receive trastuzumab (Herceptin®) IV over 90 minutes within 48 hours prior to&#xD;
           BBBD and then weekly for 3 weeks (between BBBD therapy sessions). Treatment repeats&#xD;
           every 4 weeks for up to 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive decreasing doses of carboplatin and/or methotrexate if the&#xD;
      proposed dose is not well tolerated. Dose-limiting toxicity is defined as grade IV&#xD;
      hematologic toxicity with delay in subsequent treatment courses for 4 weeks OR grade III/IV&#xD;
      nonhematologic toxicity without recovery in 14 days during the course of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II: Patients undergo BBBD as in phase I and receive carboplatin and methotrexate&#xD;
           at the doses determined in phase I. Patients also receive sodium thiosulfate, leucovorin&#xD;
           calcium, and pegfilgrastim or G-CSF as in phase I. Patients with HER2-positive disease&#xD;
           also receive trastuzumab as in phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological assessment is performed at baseline, every 6 months during treatment,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, every 3 months during treatment, at the completion of study treatment, every 6&#xD;
      months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 78 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
