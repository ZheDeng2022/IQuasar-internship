    <textblock>
      This is a study of the drug perifosine that consists of 2 parts. The first part of this study&#xD;
      was designed to determine the highest dose of perifosine that can be administered to people&#xD;
      every week without severe or prolonged nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This study started with&#xD;
      patients taking 900 mg/week and went up to 1800 mg/week. Part I of this study is completed.&#xD;
      The MTD had been determined and incorporated in Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals in Part II are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the gastrointestinal toxicity of 3 different dose-schedules and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain preliminary information on the response rate of perifosine in non-small cell lung&#xD;
           cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of Part I of this study was to determine the maximum dose of perifosine&#xD;
      that can be administered with tolerable gastrointestinal toxicity; and to obtain preliminary&#xD;
      information on the response rate of perifosine in non-small cell lung cancer. In addition,&#xD;
      the trial was and is designed to provide some insight into the nature of the anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect, the time to response, and dose-schedules that should be used in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 - In the second part of this study, patients will be randomized to one of 3&#xD;
      dose-schedules of perifosine and to test if the response rate of perifosine in non small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer is &gt; 10% in any of the 3 arms of the study. The study is not designed to compare&#xD;
      the response rates in the 3 arms of the trial, but toxicities will be compared. The regimens&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A weekly dose of 900 mg to be divided into three doses of 300 mg each. If patients&#xD;
           experience no grade 2 toxicities during their first month of therapy, the dose will be&#xD;
           escalated to 1,200 mg divided into four doses of 300 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A daily dose of 150 mg to be divided into three doses of 50 mg each. If patients&#xD;
           experience no grade 2 toxicities during their first month of therapy, the dose will be&#xD;
           escalated to 200 mg divided into four doses of 50 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A daily dose of 150 mg to be given in one dose at bedtime. If patients experience no&#xD;
           grade 2 toxicities during their first month of therapy, the dose will be escalated to&#xD;
           200 mg to be given in one dose at bedtime.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving weekly perifosine will receive prophylactic antiemetics. Patients&#xD;
      receiving daily perifosine will not routinely receive prophylactic antiemetics unless they&#xD;
      experience nausea. All patients may continue therapy unless disease progression is documented&#xD;
      on two occasions at least 4 weeks apart. Patients who experience toxicity may continue on&#xD;
      treatment with doses delayed or reduced.&#xD;

             extenuating circumstances for patients with more than two such regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease. Since the outcome for a patient is to be based&#xD;
             on response using RECIST criteria, the patient must have at least one measurable&#xD;
             lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension and fit one of the&#xD;
             following criteria: longest diameter 20 mm using conventional techniques or 10 mm with&#xD;
             spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria.&#xD;
             However, patients with ECOG performance status of 2 may be admitted with approval from&#xD;
             the study chairman or medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating are ineligible. All females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours of&#xD;
             treatment. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to employ adequate&#xD;
             contraception to prevent pregnancy while on therapy and for four weeks after the&#xD;
             completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with rapidly progressing disease, as defined by progression within 12 weeks&#xD;
             of initiation of the previous regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents or devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection and psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with perifosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment) or New York Heart Assoc. class&#xD;
             II-IV congestive heart failure.&#xD;
