      Background and Literature Review&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Spread and Early Demographic Impact of HIV in Zimbabwe&#xD;
&#xD;
      High levels of HIV prevalence and incidence have been recorded in Zimbabwe since sentinel&#xD;
      surveillance was introduced in 1990. Prevalence levels in excess of 40% have been recorded&#xD;
      among women attending antenatal clinics in a number of urban centres [1,2]. In a cohort study&#xD;
      of male factory workers conducted in Harare between 1993 and 1995, 19% of participants were&#xD;
      found to have the infection at enrolment and an incidence rate of 2.93% per annum was&#xD;
      recorded [3]. However, rural areas - where 70% of the country's population are based - are&#xD;
      experiencing some of the highest rates of incidence at the current time. In Mberengwa,&#xD;
      Midland Province, HIV prevalence among pregnant women increased from under 8% in 1992 to 25%&#xD;
      in 1994 [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a study in two rural areas of Manicaland Province, we also found high levels of HIV&#xD;
      infection at antenatal clinics in 1993-94 - 24% and 14%, at the growth points in the Honde&#xD;
      Valley and the Rusitu Valley, respectively. Further data from the Honde Valley in 1996&#xD;
      indicate that incidence remains high (2-4%). Significant increases in adult and infant&#xD;
      mortality and in orphanhood were recorded. The cause-specific and age-patterns of increase&#xD;
      indicate that these are due primarily to HIV infections. Sexual intercourse with casual&#xD;
      partners is common and condom use is low. In qualitative studies, high proportions of men,&#xD;
      but relatively few women, reported recent casual partnerships. Mathematical model simulations&#xD;
      indicate that this pattern of behaviour could explain the greater excess mortality that was&#xD;
      recorded among males, given a recent - last 4-5 years - escalation of the HIV epidemic in&#xD;
      rural areas. Other ulcerative and non-ulcerative sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are&#xD;
      common, but only 2% of respondents were aware that STDs can facilitate HIV transmission [5&#xD;
      8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mathematical model projections, based on our understanding of the predominant behaviour&#xD;
      pattern and fitted to observed trends in HIV prevalence, also indicate that further increases&#xD;
      in adult and early childhood mortality are to be expected. Results from these simulations and&#xD;
      empirical findings from Uganda suggest that these increases will result in adverse indirect&#xD;
      effects, including high proportions of children experiencing orphanhood and distortions in&#xD;
      the age- and sex-distribution of the population [9,10]. These effects may be compounded by&#xD;
      fertility change. Birth rates are declining in rural areas of Zimbabwe at present and the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic may re-enforce this decline through changes in behaviour or underlying fecundity&#xD;
      [11]. Women with HIV infection are reported as having lower fertility than other women in&#xD;
      Ugandan studies [12] and results from our research in Manicaland indicate that behaviour&#xD;
      changes which would tend to re-enforce the existing decline in birth rates may be beginning&#xD;
      to occur [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV Prevention Strategies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mathematical model simulations have demonstrated the potential for reducing the incidence of&#xD;
      new HIV infections through biomedical and behavioural interventions. The benefits of early&#xD;
      interventions and of targeting interventions at core groups have been emphasized [13,14].&#xD;
      Targeted interventions are liable to be less effective if introduced after high levels of HIV&#xD;
      prevalence have been reached. Their success will also depend on the level of heterogeneity in&#xD;
      sexual activity which exists within a population and the predominant pattern of mixing&#xD;
      between different risk groups [15]. Combinations of intervention approaches can act&#xD;
      additively and even synergistically [16].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one set of simulations, based on epidemiological data from rural Uganda, it was&#xD;
      demonstrated that a combined biomedical and behavioural intervention which (a) increased&#xD;
      condom use in contacts between men and casual sex partners to 50%, (b) reduced the frequency&#xD;
      of these contacts by 50%, and (c) reduced the average duration of STD episodes by 50%, could&#xD;
      reduce HIV incidence by 50% in the first year and 80% over ten years. Empirical studies have&#xD;
      shown that changes of this nature are possible and can lead to large reductions in HIV&#xD;
      incidence. In Nairobi, health education and condom promotion led to an increase in condom use&#xD;
      among commercial sex workers from 8% to 66%. Condom use was associated with a 3-fold&#xD;
      reduction in risk of sero-conversion [17]. In Zimbabwe, large-scale condom promotion&#xD;
      programmes were associated with 48% and 53% reductions in STD cases over three years, in&#xD;
      Bulawayo and Mutare, respectively. Most of these reductions were achieved within the first&#xD;
      year of the intervention [18]. In a study of 752 male factory workers in Mwanza, Tanzania,&#xD;
      counselling at an STD clinic contributed to significant reductions in reported high-risk&#xD;
      behaviour - eg: the proportion with more than one sexual partner in the preceding month fell&#xD;
      from 22% to 12% - and a large (63%) - but non-significant - reduction in HIV incidence&#xD;
      [19,20]. In a randomized control trial in rural areas around Mwanza, improved diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment of STDs was associated with a 42% reduction in the incidence of new HIV infections&#xD;
      over a two-year period [21,22].&#xD;
&#xD;
      While these examples demonstrate the effectiveness of individual interventions, there remain&#xD;
      shortages of scientific evaluations of combined approaches and of programmes which are&#xD;
      sustainable within rural communities, where the majority of sub-Saharan African populations&#xD;
      are based and where HIV is now spreading rapidly [23]. Studies of this kind are essential to&#xD;
      establish the effectiveness of different intervention strategies and to provide demonstration&#xD;
      models which can be used to promote the implementation of interventions which are appropriate&#xD;
      and cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care and Support Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
      As HIV epidemics begin to cause higher morbidity, mortality, orphanhood and socio-economic&#xD;
      hardship, affected communities require interventions which provide support in coping with&#xD;
      these problems, particularly so, as institution-based solutions become less viable. This need&#xD;
      is often upper-most in people's minds, so that prevention programmes which are linked to care&#xD;
      initiatives - especially where infected community members are supported and involved in&#xD;
      prevention - are considered likely to be most effective [24]. Few systematic evaluations have&#xD;
      been conducted to assess the effectiveness of existing care and support models. However, it&#xD;
      is clear that programmes which include a high level of external biomedical input are unlikely&#xD;
      to be financially sustainable [25]. On the other hand, early evaluations indicate that&#xD;
      initiatives which encourage local community ownership and participation, whilst more limited&#xD;
      in scope, can be extremely cost-effective [26].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-Based, HIV Prevention, Care and Support Intervention Strategy for Rural Zimbabwe&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of the above, it is proposed to initiate a community-based, combined HIV&#xD;
      prevention, care and support intervention in the Honde Valley and neighbouring areas of the&#xD;
      Mutasa District of rural Manicaland. The proposed intervention will ultimately cover an area&#xD;
      of approximately 2,750 square kilometres, comprising a population of around 170,000 people.&#xD;
      The project will be a collaborative programme promoted by Family AIDS Caring Trust (FACT) and&#xD;
      the Biomedical Research and Training Institute (BRTI) and involving local community and&#xD;
      church groups and local Ministry of Health personnel. FACT is a Zimbabwean NGO based in&#xD;
      Mutare, the provincial capital of Manicaland, and has a well-deserved reputation as an&#xD;
      organization which has pioneered innovative community-based HIV control activities in&#xD;
      Zimbabwe. Its' established projects include prevention and support programmes in both urban&#xD;
      and rural areas of the province. FACT will be responsible for behavioural (including condom&#xD;
      promotion and distribution activities and community-based promotion of STD services), support&#xD;
      and care aspects of the programme. BRTI is a relatively recently-formed organization based in&#xD;
      Harare with strong links with the University of Zimbabwe Medical School, the Blair Research&#xD;
      Institute and other parts of the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. BRTI has considerable&#xD;
      expertise in STD diagnostic methods and treatment regimes and would be responsible for this&#xD;
      aspect of the intervention and evaluation, in close co-operation with the Ministry of Health&#xD;
      in Manicaland. It serves a similar function in established HIV control programmes elsewhere&#xD;
      in Zimbabwe. BRTI would also act as employer for staff engaged to carry out the fieldwork for&#xD;
      the intervention evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLAN International have recently extended their area of operation in Zimbabwe to include the&#xD;
      Honde Valley and have agreed to provide funding for the HIV intervention programme for a&#xD;
      minimum period of four years. PLAN maintain routine records on a number of key impact&#xD;
      indicators so that the projects they sponsor can be assessed. It may be possible to develop&#xD;
      these systems so that they provide information on indicators of the impact of the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic and the effectiveness of AIDS control activities - eg: programme coverage and&#xD;
      success in targeting - which could be used in this study and for long-term monitoring&#xD;
      purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed intervention strategy appears to have good potential for sustainability and&#xD;
      replication. Factors which support this view include the emphasis on local community&#xD;
      involvement, the low cost of external inputs, the well-established local NGO partner,&#xD;
      Ministry of Health support, and the presence of a rural-based, community-orientated funding&#xD;
      organization with a substantial international funding base and a long-term commitment to&#xD;
      extending the scope of its activities in Zimbabwe. Descriptions of the principal intervention&#xD;
      elements are contained in separate documents attached to this proposal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To scientifically evaluate the impact and cost-effectiveness of a combined behavioural&#xD;
           and STD-control intervention strategy to slow the spread of HIV infections in rural&#xD;
           Zimbabwe; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To extend recent monitoring of the demographic impact of the HIV epidemic in a rural&#xD;
           area of Zimbabwe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsidiary aims include validation of innovative methods for data collection on HIV, other&#xD;
      STDs - ie: using saliva samples [35] - and sexual behaviour in rural settings (all subject to&#xD;
      final pre-test in the pilot study) and for estimating HIV incidence from cross-sectional&#xD;
      prevalence data [27]; evaluation of antenatal clinic data as a source of information on HIV&#xD;
      levels within the general population; and development of methods for routine evaluation of&#xD;
      community-owned support programmes for individuals and families affected by heightened&#xD;
      experience of chronic morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Design for the Intervention Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six pairs of sub-communities (clusters), matched for similar levels of key factors affecting&#xD;
      the spread of HIV, will be identified in the vicinity of the Honde Valley. Four of these&#xD;
      pairs are likely to be within commercial estates - tea, coffee, forestry and orchards - and&#xD;
      two in communal farming areas. Each sub-community will be chosen so that it includes a health&#xD;
      clinic where improved STD services can be made available. The behaviour and STD-control&#xD;
      intervention will be introduced in one cluster within each pair on a phased basis over a&#xD;
      period of twelve months - ie: one new cluster every two months. In each case, a baseline&#xD;
      survey for the evaluation will be conducted in the intervention and comparison clusters in&#xD;
      the two-month period immediately prior to the introduction of the programme. For the&#xD;
      evaluation, 1,000 respondents will be enrolled within a sector of each sub-community&#xD;
      following an initial household census - half of those enrolled will be men aged 17-49 years&#xD;
      and half will be women aged 15-39 years. Individuals who usually reside in the household will&#xD;
      be eligible for full participation in the study - i.e.: recruitment will be on a de jure&#xD;
      basis - in order to increase follow-up and reduce within-group heterogeneity. Within a&#xD;
      household, the random selection process used will avoid instances where a husband and wife or&#xD;
      more than one wife are enrolled and thereby reduce correlation of outcomes within individual&#xD;
      clusters. Respondents in each pair of clusters will be surveyed again two years months after&#xD;
      the baseline visit. Records will be kept on an anonymous basis but a mechanism will be put in&#xD;
      place to enable the data to be linked within and between survey rounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome indicators will include knowledge about HIV and AIDS, sexual behaviour indicators -&#xD;
      partner acquisition and partnership duration, mixing patterns and condom use - incidence of&#xD;
      HIV and selected STD infections, and health-seeking behaviour indicators. Sample sizes were&#xD;
      calculated to give an 80% power at the 95% significance level, comparing the matched&#xD;
      intervention and comparison clusters, for a range of different outcome variables. The&#xD;
      formulae used in these calculations take account of possible between-cluster and - in the&#xD;
      case of prevalence - within-cluster variability [22,28]. Given the level of spatial mobility&#xD;
      which exists within the Honde Valley area, some diffusion effect is likely to be present.&#xD;
      This has been reflected in the sample size computations through the use of conservative&#xD;
      anticipated excess reductions in the intervention clusters. We estimate that a sample size of&#xD;
      1,000 individuals per cluster will yield a minimum of 700 observations, after accounting for&#xD;
      loss to follow-up. In the case of the HIV incidence calculations, these observations will&#xD;
      provide 1,120 susceptible person-years of observation, after allowing for a baseline&#xD;
      prevalence in the general adult population of 20%. Under these conditions, an initial sample&#xD;
      size of 1,000 per cluster should be sufficient to permit detection of a 40% excess reduction&#xD;
      in HIV incidence, given a baseline annual incidence of 2% or higher. This sample size should&#xD;
      also enable us to detect, inter alia, a 40% lower incidence of new HSV2 and trichomoniasis&#xD;
      cases among individuals not infected at baseline and a 40% reduction in reported casual&#xD;
      relationships without the use of condoms, given a baseline prevalence of 10% or over.&#xD;
      Evidence from model simulations and empirical studies suggests that the excess reduction in&#xD;
      HIV incidence required is plausible given a combined intervention strategy [19,29].&#xD;
      Furthermore, the required excess reductions in STDs and high-risk behaviour should be&#xD;
      attainable. Reductions in these factors, of the order indicated, would, if demonstrated,&#xD;
      represent strong indirect evidence that the intervention strategy is slowing the spread of&#xD;
      HIV infections. Reduction in other STDs would be a significant benefit, in itself, given the&#xD;
      morbidity and adverse fertility consequences they frequently cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Quantitative and Qualitative Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative data will be collected on the intervention trial outcome measures summarized&#xD;
      above, principally through the two-round survey. A cohort of participants for this survey&#xD;
      will be recruited in a household census within each of the twelve study areas. The second&#xD;
      round of the study will be conducted two years after the first visit in each area and will&#xD;
      involve a repeat household census and further detailed interviews with the original&#xD;
      participants. The population-based survey will also provide data on process indicators,&#xD;
      including measures of contact with the intervention programme - eg: numbers of meetings&#xD;
      attended and visits received from programme personnel - and utilization of programme services&#xD;
      - eg: free condoms, revolving loans, care support, STD diagnosis and treatment - and other&#xD;
      potential determinants of key outcomes, including socio-economic and demographic factors, and&#xD;
      personal experience of HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Data will be collected on&#xD;
      demographic indicators - eg: age- and gender-specific mortality, recent fertility, orphanhood&#xD;
      and household composition - in the household and individual interviews, using standard&#xD;
      demographic methods [30,31]. Quantitative data will also be collected on HIV prevalence at&#xD;
      antenatal clinics, so that the representativeness of data from this source can be evaluated.&#xD;
      Qualitative data on sexual and health-seeking behaviour and obstacles to behaviour change&#xD;
      will be collected in focus-group discussions, pocket-chart voting sessions and key-informant&#xD;
      interviews [32,33] and employed to aid questionnaire design and validation and in&#xD;
      interpretation of statistical results. These methods were used successfully in our previous&#xD;
      study [7]. However, to strengthen this aspect of the current proposal, additional input on&#xD;
      the design and implementation of appropriate ethnographic methods will be received from a&#xD;
      collaborator from the LSE (Dr. Campbell).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Steps will be taken to develop the good working relationship already formed with the Honde&#xD;
      Valley community, to mobilize community support for the research and provide reassurance that&#xD;
      information given will be treated as strictly confidential. Thus, we hope to achieve high&#xD;
      participation and follow-up rates and more reliable information. Preliminary meetings will be&#xD;
      held with community leaders to explain the purpose of the study and the research procedures.&#xD;
      Similar information will be given to each prospective participant prior to their decision on&#xD;
      enrolment. Data collection methods such as self-completion questionnaires - 96% and 45% of&#xD;
      women aged under 50 years, living in the Honde Valley, have received primary and secondary&#xD;
      education, respectively, and literacy levels among men are higher than those for women [7] -&#xD;
      and secret balloting, which avoid the need for participants to reveal personal information to&#xD;
      enumerators directly and thus reduce under-reporting of sensitive information [34], have been&#xD;
      field-tested and will be pre-tested further in the pilot study and used where feasible.&#xD;
      Similarly, the possibility of using less invasive media such as saliva, urine or blood spot&#xD;
      samples for HIV and STD testing is being investigated with the Public Health Laboratory in&#xD;
      Harare [35]. The reliability and acceptability of these methods as applied in rural settings&#xD;
      will also be field-tested in the pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires will be translated into the local Manyika dialect of Shona, back-translated&#xD;
      and pre-tested in the pilot study. Data entry and validation will be undertaken using&#xD;
      SPSS-PC+. Appropriate data entry forms will be designed for each section of the survey&#xD;
      questionnaires and skip-rules, range checks etc will be employed to reduce data entry errors.&#xD;
      BRTI/Blair staff have considerable experience of using SPSS-PC+ for data entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis: Scope and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability and validity checks will be conducted to assess the quality of the quantitative&#xD;
      data [36]. Data analysis will be conducted using statistical software - eg: STATA and SAS -&#xD;
      and mathematical models of HIV incidence, which are based on underlying biomedical,&#xD;
      behavioural and demographic determinants of HIV infections [37,38]. Statistical analyses will&#xD;
      include tests for the significance of differences arising between paired intervention and&#xD;
      control clusters [39,40] and tests for impact of contacts with the intervention programme and&#xD;
      other possible determinants on changes in reported behaviour. The impact of the HIV epidemic&#xD;
      on mortality will be monitored using longitudinal survey data and official vital registration&#xD;
      records. Impact on fertility will be assessed by comparing birth rates among infected and&#xD;
      uninfected individuals, controlling for other key determinants including age, education,&#xD;
      religion and history of STDs. Crude birth rates, crude death rates and levels of natural&#xD;
      population increase will be estimated from the survey data and the trends evaluated [12].&#xD;
      Coverage and impact of care/support interventions will be investigated. HIV prevalence&#xD;
      estimated from the population-based survey will be compared with estimates from women&#xD;
      attending antenatal clinics to assess the representativeness of the latter. Adjustments will&#xD;
      be made in data analysis for the matched-pair design of the study. Data from the study will&#xD;
      be used to evaluate new methods for estimating incidence from cross-sectional HIV prevalence&#xD;
      surveys [27].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will be sought as a condition for enrolment in the study. This will be in&#xD;
      written form wherever literacy levels allow - which is expected to be in the great majority&#xD;
      of cases. A written statement in the local dialect of shona will be provided explaining the&#xD;
      purpose of the study and all aspects, benefits and risks of participation. The statement will&#xD;
      make it clear that participants have the right to withdraw from the study at any time. Time&#xD;
      will be allowed for prospective participants to read the statement, to ask questions and&#xD;
      consider their decision. The statement will be read aloud to prospective participants who are&#xD;
      unable to read themselves. Enumerators will be trained to do this in a balanced manner so as&#xD;
      to avoid possible coercion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given the opportunity to receive HIV-1 test results. Preliminary&#xD;
      counselling will be offered during study interviews. Where participants indicate that they&#xD;
      would like to be advised as to their own HIV-1 serostatus, appointments will be arranged for&#xD;
      them to visit a local clinic where a free counselling and testing service will be made&#xD;
      available. Standard Ministry of Health and Child Welfare and WHO procedures will be followed&#xD;
      throughout, with further serological tests being undertaken as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who test positive for other sexually transmitted diseases will be advised of&#xD;
      their results and a free treatment service will be offered wherever possible (eg: for&#xD;
      trichomoniasis). Less invasive media such as urine and saliva will be used for the collection&#xD;
      of samples for HIV-1 and STD testing. Where blood samples are sought, blood spots rather than&#xD;
      venipuncture will be used. Appropriately qualified and trained personnel will be employed to&#xD;
      collect the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rigorous procedures will be maintained throughout the study to ensure full confidentiality of&#xD;
      information obtained from participants. Data protection and anonymization procedures will be&#xD;
      implemented and computerized matching methods will be used to ensure that access to linked&#xD;
      data will be strictly limited to the principal investigators only, with the single exception&#xD;
      that appropriate medical staff will be given access to results of HIV-1 or STD tests where&#xD;
      participants wish to be informed of their results or to be offered treatment. The procedures&#xD;
      will be such that staff, study participants and other individuals are not able to deduce&#xD;
      individual HIV-1, STD and sexual behaviour details by applying exclusion and inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Confidential voting methods will be employed in the collection of sexual behaviour&#xD;
      information so as to avoid the need for participants to impart personal information to&#xD;
      enumerators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants will include participation in prevention, care and support&#xD;
      activities in the intervention areas (see separate description of intervention activities).&#xD;
      Subject to confirmation that these activities are effective, the researchers and programme&#xD;
      managers are committed to ensuring that similar programmes will be introduced within each&#xD;
      control area two years after the study is initiated in that area. In all areas, participants&#xD;
      will be offered free treatment of STDs identified in the survey. Free information sheets on&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection and AIDS which address gaps in information identified in the earlier study in&#xD;
      Honde Valley will be made available to study participants in all areas during the baseline&#xD;
      survey. Risks of participation in the research team or as a community member are believed to&#xD;
      be low. Rigorous procedures are to be followed to avoid needle-stick injuries and to ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality of information obtained, standard treatments will be offered for STDs&#xD;
      diagnosed and established tests and associated procedures, which have proved to be very&#xD;
      reliable in Zimbabwean settings, will be used for HIV-1 diagnosis, in particular, where&#xD;
      results are to be made available to participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of study results will be done through the Biomedical Research and Training&#xD;
      Institute (BRTI) and Blair Research Institute with approval from the Ministry of Health and&#xD;
      Child Welfare. An original copy of the data set from the study will remain in Zimbabwe at&#xD;
      BRTI and/or Blair. Approval for the study will also be obtained from the Central Oxford&#xD;
      Research Ethics Committee in the United Kingdom prior to implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel, Workplan and Location of Project Activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Gregson will manage and co-ordinate the proposed research project with expert&#xD;
      epidemiological and statistical support from the Blair Research Institute in Harare and the&#xD;
      Wellcome Trust Centre for the Epidemiology of Infectious Disease, at Oxford University (Dr.&#xD;
      Chandiwana, Professor Anderson, Dr. Garnett and Dr. Donnelly), social psychology and&#xD;
      ethnographic support from BRTI, the London School of Economics and the University of Natal&#xD;
      (Mr. Tom Zhuwau, Dr. Cathy Campbell, Professor Eleanor Preston-Whyte and Professor Linda&#xD;
      Richter), and biomedical support from BRTI (Professor Mason and Mr. Ocean Tobaiwa). Within&#xD;
      the team we have considerable management and administrative as well as research experience&#xD;
      and in a previous project we demonstrated the ability to develop and conduct a successful&#xD;
      fieldwork-based scientific research project, given the level of technical and logistical&#xD;
      support envisaged in this proposal. Zimbabwe has a good supply of well-qualified personnel in&#xD;
      most disciplines and staff with appropriate sociological, demographic and/or medical&#xD;
      expertise will be recruited. All staff will be given in-depth training in the specific&#xD;
      requirements of the study. A summary schedule of project activities over time is attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended Use of Results&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results will be disseminated through seminars, workshops and publications in local and&#xD;
      international journals. In these ways, we will seek to promote greater awareness of the level&#xD;
      of effectiveness of the intervention strategy evaluated in the given context.&#xD;

          <description>In addition to the standard-of-care services provided in the control arm, the intervention communities were to receive targeted and population-level activities to promote safer sexual behaviour and to improve treatment of STIs that facilitate HIV-1 transmission. The intervention strategies were to be implemented by two local nongovernmental organisations and the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare through an integrated programme of community- and clinic-based activities. The programme design comprised three key components: (1) peer education and condom distribution amongst commercial sex workers and male clients at workplaces and in the general community, supported by income-generating projects; (2) strengthened syndromic management of STI services at local health centres; and (3) open days with HIV/AIDS IEC activities at health centres to promote safer sexual behaviour and to increase the uptake of local STI treatment services.</description>

            <description>In addition to the standard-of-care services provided in the control arm, the intervention communities were to receive targeted and population-level activities to promote safer sexual behaviour and to improve treatment of STIs that facilitate HIV-1 transmission. The intervention strategies were to be implemented by two local nongovernmental organisations and the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Welfare through an integrated programme of community- and clinic-based activities. The programme design comprised three key components: (1) peer education and condom distribution amongst commercial sex workers and male clients at workplaces and in the general community, supported by income-generating projects; (2) strengthened syndromic management of STI services at local health centres; and (3) open days with HIV/AIDS IEC activities at health centres to promote safer sexual behaviour and to increase the uptake of local STI treatment services.</description>
