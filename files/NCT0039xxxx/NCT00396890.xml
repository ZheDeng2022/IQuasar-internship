      This study will determine whether stimulation of the right side of the brain with repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) followed by stimulation of the left side with theta&#xD;
      burst stimulation (TBS) can temporarily change brain activity and improve hand movements in&#xD;
      subjects more than has recently been achieved with rTMS alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For rTMS, a wire coil is held on the patient's scalp. A brief electrical current is passed&#xD;
      through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. The subject hears a&#xD;
      click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil. There may be a twitch in&#xD;
      the muscles of the face, arm or leg. The subject may be asked to tense certain muscles&#xD;
      slightly or perform other simple actions. The effect of TMS on the muscles is detected with&#xD;
      small metal disk electrodes taped to the skin of the arms or legs. This study uses two kinds&#xD;
      of rTMS. In one (Hz rTMS), magnetic pulses are given once per second for a period of 20&#xD;
      minutes; in the other (TBS), a series of pulses are given in bursts, each lasting 2 seconds,&#xD;
      for a period of 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures during three visits to the NIH Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive either real or sham rTMS applied on the right side of the brain followed&#xD;
      by real or sham TBS applied on the left side of the brain. In addition, subjects undergo the&#xD;
      following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Pinch force: Subjects press a wedged instrument between the thumb and index finger as hard&#xD;
      as they can during several trials every 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Speed tapping: Subjects press a key on a computer keyboard as quickly as possible for 10&#xD;
      seconds, repeated for several trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Simple reaction time: Subjects respond as quickly as possible to a &quot;go&quot; signal presented on&#xD;
      a computer monitor by performing a quick wrist movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot; Electromyography: Subjects' muscle activity is recorded using electrodes (small metal&#xD;
      disks) filled with conductive gel and taped to the skin over the muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 2 and 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 is scheduled for one day after visit 1, and visit 3 is one week after visit 1.&#xD;
      Participants do not have brain stimulation during these two visits, but they have TMS&#xD;
      measurements, behavioral measurements, and electromyography (EMG) to see if the brain&#xD;
      stimulation done during the first visit is still present after a period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all three visits, participants comp...&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)&#xD;
      applied to the primary motor cortex (MI) exerts a transient inhibitory effect on the&#xD;
      contralateral MI. Furthermore, down-regulation of excitability in MI of one hemisphere by 1Hz&#xD;
      rTMS results in increased excitability in the homologous MI accompanied by performance&#xD;
      improvements in simple motor tasks performed by the hand ipsilateral to rTMS. It has been&#xD;
      proposed that this phenomenon relies on interhemispheric disinhibition between both MI.&#xD;
      Furthermore, interhemispheric disinhibition is also a promising method for boosting&#xD;
      neurorehabilitation since interhemispheric disinhibition has been successfully applied in&#xD;
      stroke patients to enhance motor cortex excitability and hand function or reduce aphasia. The&#xD;
      purpose of this protocol is to test the hypothesis that interhemispheric disinhibition of the&#xD;
      left MI by down-regulating activity in the right MI can be further enhanced by additional&#xD;
      up-regulation targeting the left MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will study a total number of 72 healthy volunteers between the ages of 18-55.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis, subjects will be randomly allocated to one of 4 experimental sessions&#xD;
      (parallel design). Subjects will receive different types of combined brain stimulation (1 Hz&#xD;
      rTMS and Theta Burst Stimulation [TBS]) to the right and left MI. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      will be the amount of changes in cortical excitability, as reflected by recruitment curves&#xD;
      (RC) of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by single-pulse TMS over the left MI.&#xD;
      Additionally, we will test changes in short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) and&#xD;
      facilitation (ICF) as well as the modulation of interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) between&#xD;
      both MI. The secondary outcome measures will include simple motor tasks such as finger&#xD;
      tapping, pinch force/acceleration and reaction time of the right hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, we believe that this approach might identify additional effective strategies to&#xD;
      enhance functional recovery after stroke and might provide deeper insight into the neural&#xD;
      substrates involved in performance improvements after bilateral brain stimulation.&#xD;
