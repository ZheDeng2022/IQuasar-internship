  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this proposal will be to identify potentially modifiable risk factors&#xD;
      of long-term cognitive impairment (i.e. development of delirium and exposure to sedative and&#xD;
      analgesic medications) in ICU patients. The investigators will quantify the independent&#xD;
      contribution of these risk factors to the incidence of long-term cognitive impairment,&#xD;
      controlling for other established risk factors including age, pre-existing cognitive&#xD;
      impairment, and apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotype. Quantifying the contributions of these&#xD;
      modifiable risk factors will pave the way for the development of preventive and/or treatment&#xD;
      strategies to reduce the incidence, severity and/or duration of long-term cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and improve functional recovery for patients with critical illness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among Intensive Care Unit (ICU) survivors, subsequent cognitive and functional decline are&#xD;
      the greatest threats to meaningful recovery. Six small cohorts indicate that an alarming 30%&#xD;
      to 80% of the increasingly millions of ICU survivors develop an acquired long-term cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (LTCI) functionally equivalent to mild/moderate dementia that may last years.&#xD;
      Additionally, major deficits in health-related quality of life (HRQL), functional status, and&#xD;
      an &quot;ICU accelerated&quot; frailty are common, especially in the elderly. A leading and potentially&#xD;
      modifiable risk factor for these devastating outcomes may be ICU delirium, which is a&#xD;
      predictor of higher mortality, higher cost, and poor cognitive function at discharge.&#xD;
      Additionally, heavy and prolonged exposure to potent psychoactive medications routinely&#xD;
      administered in high doses to ventilated patients may have lasting yet preventable cognitive&#xD;
      and functional effects. In this proposal, Aims 1 and 3 will determine whether delirium is an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for the incidence, severity, and/or duration of LTCI (Aim 1) and&#xD;
      impaired HRQL (Aim 3) in ICU survivors. Likewise, Aims 2 and 4 will determine whether degree&#xD;
      of exposure to sedative and analgesic medications in ICU patients is an independent risk&#xD;
      factor for the incidence, severity, and/or duration of LTCI (Aim 2) and impaired HRQL (Aim&#xD;
      4). The study will be a prospective cohort study enrolling 800 mechanically ventilated&#xD;
      medical and surgical patients from 3 diverse medical centers over a 39 month period with&#xD;
      comprehensive follow-up testing at 3 and 12 months after hospital discharge. This study will&#xD;
      quantify whether delirium and sedative/analgesic exposure are indeed risk factors for LTCI&#xD;
      and HRQL, controlling for other covariates such as age, medical versus surgical ICU&#xD;
      admission, pre-existing cognitive impairment, sepsis, and apoE genotype. This will pave the&#xD;
      way for the development of preventive and/or treatment strategies to reduce long-term&#xD;
      cognitive impairment and improve the functional recovery of older and younger ICU patients&#xD;
      for decades to come. Major threats to recovery for ICU survivors are acquired cognitive and&#xD;
      functional decline that can last years, especially in older patients. To pave the way for&#xD;
      future preventive and interventional strategies, the cohort will determine to what degree&#xD;
      delirium and potent sedatives and analgesics are risk factors for long-term cognitive&#xD;
      impairment and functional decline following critical illness.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients will be included if they are adult, patients in a medical and/or surgical ICU&#xD;
             receiving treatment for any of the following: respiratory failure or cardiogenic or&#xD;
             septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be excluded if they meet any of the following&#xD;
        criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cumulative ICU time &gt;5 days in the past 30 days, not including the current ICU stay,&#xD;
             as this might create a state of flux regarding patients' cognitive baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe cognitive or neurodegenerative diseases that prevent a patient from living&#xD;
             independently at baseline, including mental illness requiring institutionalization,&#xD;
             acquired or congenital mental retardation, known brain lesions, traumatic brain&#xD;
             injury, cerebrovascular accidents with resultant moderate to severe cognitive deficits&#xD;
             or ADL dependency, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, severe Alzheimer's&#xD;
             disease or dementia of any etiology&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ICU admission post cardiopulmonary resuscitation with suspected anoxic injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An active substance abuse or psychotic disorder, or a recent (within the past 6&#xD;
             months) serious suicidal gesture necessitating hospitalization. This exclusion will&#xD;
             enrich follow-up rates by avoiding patients with whom it is particularly challenging&#xD;
             to maintain long-term contact&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blind, deaf, or unable to speak English, as these conditions would preclude our&#xD;
             ability to perform the follow-up evaluation interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Overly moribund and not expected to survive for an additional 24 hours and / or&#xD;
             withdrawing life support to focus on comfort measures only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prisoners.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who live further than 200 miles from Nashville and who do not regularly visit&#xD;
             the Nashville area.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are homeless and have no secondary contact person available. This&#xD;
             exclusion will enrich follow-up rates by avoiding patients with whom it is&#xD;
             particularly challenging to maintain long-term contact&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The onset of the current episode of respiratory failure, cardiogenic shock, or septic&#xD;
             shock was &gt; 72 hours ago.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had cardiac bypass surgery within the past 3 months (including the&#xD;
             current hospitalization)&#xD;
