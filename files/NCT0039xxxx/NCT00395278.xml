  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Burbelo and colleagues have developed a technique for rapidly and quantitatively&#xD;
      detecting antibody responses in sera to a variety of pathogens using recombinant proteins. We&#xD;
      would like to apply this technique to develop an assay for detecting antibodies to HHV-8&#xD;
      (KSHV, the etiologic agents of Kaposi's sarcoma, an AIDS-defining condition). We initially&#xD;
      plan to examine samples from patients with Kaposi's sarcoma, since all those patients are&#xD;
      almost certainly infected with HHV-8. We are thus using samples from patients with previously&#xD;
      diagnosed Kaposi's sarcoma. The samples in question are stored at the NCI FCRF repository&#xD;
      operated by SAIC Frederick or in Rockville, MD.&#xD;

      Our colleagues have developed a technique for rapidly and quantitatively detecting antibody&#xD;
      responses in sera to a variety of antigens using recombinant proteins. We would like to apply&#xD;
      this technique to develop an assay for detecting antibodies to HHV- 8 (KSHV, the etiologic&#xD;
      agent of Kaposi s sarcoma, an AIDS-defining condition). In addition we would like to&#xD;
      potentially measure antibody responses to HIV, other infectious agents, and human antigens,&#xD;
      to see if antibodies (or high antibody titers) to these antigens are associated with Kaposi s&#xD;
      sarcoma or HIV infection. We initially plan to examine samples from patients with Kaposi s&#xD;
      sarcoma, since all those patients are almost certainly infected with HHV-8. We would&#xD;
      subsequently plan to examine samples from HIV positive and HIV negative patients without&#xD;
      known Kaposi s sarcoma. We are thus requesting permission to use samples from patients with&#xD;
      and without previously diagnosed Kaposi's Sarcoma. In addition to antibody testing, we would&#xD;
      also like to examine these samples for evidence of infection with other infectious agents,&#xD;
      such as newly identified or unknown viruses, using techniques such as PCR or deep&#xD;
&#xD;
      sequencing.&#xD;
