  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study was to examine the OROSÂ® Hydromorphone HCL&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (the way a drug enters and leaves the blood and tissues over time) profile&#xD;
      for dose proportionality after administration of 8mg, 16mg, 32mg and 64 mg tablets.&#xD;

      This was a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),&#xD;
      open-label, four-way crossover study performed in normal, healthy adult patients. Each&#xD;
      patient received the following orally administered treatments of OROS® Hydromorphone HCL (a&#xD;
      different treatment during each dosing phase): Treatment A: 8mg; Treatment B: 16mg; Treatment&#xD;
      C: 32mg; Treatment D: 64mg; A naltrexone 50mg dose was administered 12 hours prior to, at the&#xD;
      time of, and 12 after study drug administration; Patients received a fourth dose of&#xD;
      naltrexone 50mg 24 hours after the 64mg study drug administration. There was a 7-day washout&#xD;
      period between study drug dosing phases.Venous blood sampling times were 0 (prior to dosing),&#xD;
      2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 hours after each study drug&#xD;
      administration. Three additional blood samples (at 56, 64, and 72 hours after dosing of study&#xD;
      drug) were drawn from those patients receiving the 64 mg tablets; LC/MS/MS (Liquid&#xD;
      Chromatography/Mass Spectroscopy/Mass Spectroscopy) techniques were employed for the analysis&#xD;
      of plasma hydromorphone concentrations.The primary endpoints of interest were: Area under the&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from zero to infinity; Area under the concentration-time curve from&#xD;
      zero to time t; Peak plasma concentration; the secondary endpoint parameters were: Time to&#xD;
      peak plasma concentration; Terminal half-life. OROS hydromorphone HCL tablets of 8mg, 16mg,&#xD;
      32mg, and 64mg were given orally, a different dosing treatment during each dosing phase. One&#xD;
      naltrexone HCL 50mg tablet was given orally 12 hours prior to, at the time of, and 12 hours&#xD;
      after hydromorphone administration during each dosing phase. Patient received a fourth dose&#xD;
      of naltrexone 50mg 24 hours following the 64mg study drug administration; It was a four week&#xD;
      treatment and there was a seven-day washout period between dosing phases.&#xD;
