&#xD;
          -  To be eligible, female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test (i.e. serum beta&#xD;
             hCG test) and be of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. non-childbearing potential (i.e. physiologically incapable of becoming pregnant).&#xD;
                  This includes any female who is post-menopausal. For the purposes of this study,&#xD;
                  post menopausal is defined as being amenorrhoeic for greater than 2 years with an&#xD;
                  appropriate clinical profile, e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor&#xD;
                  symptoms. Postmenopausal status will be confirmed by serum FSH and oestradiol&#xD;
                  concentrations at screening. Surgical sterility will be defined as females who&#xD;
                  have had a hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy or tubal ligation. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. childbearing potential and agrees to commit to one of the protocol-approved&#xD;
                  methods of contraception as detailed in Section 7.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight ≥ 50 kg (110lbs) for males and ≥ 45 kg (99lbs) for females.&#xD;

             at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have ALP &lt; 2 x ULN at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The subject must have normal serum folate levels at screening (folate supplements can&#xD;
             be administered if required but this must be stable for 4 weeks prior to&#xD;
             randomisation).&#xD;

             breath test at the screening visit.&#xD;

             calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50mL/min but &lt; 60mL/min may still be included in&#xD;
             consultation with the GSK medical monitor, but will not be eligible for the gadolinium&#xD;
             enhancement MRI scans).&#xD;
