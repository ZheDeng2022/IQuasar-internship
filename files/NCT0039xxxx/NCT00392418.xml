  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Millions of people worldwide are affected by iron deficiency anemia (IDA). IDA is a&#xD;
      widespread serious public health problem, especially for infants in developing countries&#xD;
      mainly because of inadequate intake of iron due to the poor bioavailability of dietary iron&#xD;
      in predominately cereal based diets. One of the ways to combat iron deficiency anemia is by&#xD;
      supplementation to targeted populations. Although iron drops have been used, they have been&#xD;
      largely unsuccessful in reducing the prevalence of anemia because of compliance, distribution&#xD;
      and supply issues. Sprinkles® are a new approach to iron delivery that is as efficacious as&#xD;
      iron drops and more acceptable. For Sprinkles® to be implemented into nation-wide programs as&#xD;
      a sustainable alternative to current iron supplementation approaches, an optimal model of use&#xD;
      and distribution for Sprinkles® needs to be established. By comparing daily versus flexible&#xD;
      use of Sprinkles® (60 sachets over 60, 90 and 120 days) among infants and young children aged&#xD;
      6-24 months, the primary objectives are to study the effect of the three administration&#xD;
      models of Sprinkles® on changes in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. hemoglobin concentration; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compliance or adherence to the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the acceptability of each of the&#xD;
      three intervention models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that adherence will be greater and hemoglobin concentration response will be&#xD;
      higher in those given 'flexible' instructions to use all of the Sprinkles® supplied over a&#xD;
      specific period of time compared to those given strict instructions for daily use.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will follow a community-based cluster randomized clinical trial design involving&#xD;
      three intervention groups. Total number of villages included in the study will be determined&#xD;
      by the availability of the eligible children. In each village, all eligible children will be&#xD;
      screened through house-to-house visits. After the screening, all the children will be&#xD;
      randomized by village using a table with randomly assorted table into one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daily use of 60 Sprinkles® sachets over 60 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexible use of 60 Sprinkles® sachets over 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexible use of 60 Sprinkles® sachets over 120 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all groups, assessments will be done at baseline, at the end of a group's intervention and&#xD;
      at 6 months after intervention in each group for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place in Kaligong sub-district in Bangladesh. All villages in Kaligonj&#xD;
      sub-district consist of plain agricultural land. Subsistence farming is the major source of&#xD;
      livelihood. Rice is the commonly eaten staple mixed with lentil and vegetable curry and&#xD;
      occasionally with pieces of fish and meat. Similar to the rest of the plain areas of the&#xD;
      country, malnutrition among women and children is widespread, but malaria is extremely&#xD;
      uncommon and the prevalence of hookworm is fairly low (less than 2%%).&#xD;
