      The study aims to evaluate the impact of a possible new treatment for hypertonia,&#xD;
      contributing to the motor disability in children with cerebral palsy (CP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study follows a 2005-2006 pilot study, that demonstrate a significant motor improvement&#xD;
      in 4 children exposed to low tones via stereophonic Headphones.(A possible mechanism is a&#xD;
      deep brain stimulation outspreading from the auditory pathways in certain tones) The goal of&#xD;
      this study is to perform a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT) on 30&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A three-arm study, with one group receiving the proposed treatment-music with low tones and&#xD;
      the other two groups receiving a placebo (music without tones or stories) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      clinical and a non invasive laboratory measurements (surface EMG) related to spasticity,&#xD;
      active and passive range of movement, isometric strength and upper and lower body function&#xD;
      would be measured both before and after the treatment .the assessments will include also a&#xD;
      Visual assessment , evaluation of gaze coordination and a quality of life and a caretaker&#xD;
      burden questionnaires.&#xD;

      A pilot study we had done this year demonstrate a significant improvement in spasticity as&#xD;
      measured clinically and by non invasive surface EMG, in four children with hypertonic CP,&#xD;
      exposed to music combined with low frequency tones, via stereophonic headphones. Two children&#xD;
      demonstrated a prompt motor improvement also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to perform a double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      to assess these preliminary results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants: 30 children with moderate to severe hypertonic CP (GMFCS 3-5), aged 3-9 years,&#xD;
      from the &quot;Meshy&quot; or &quot;Ilanot&quot; Early Childhood Development Centers - Jerusalem, Israel, will be&#xD;
      recruited with parents informed consent. Children who refuse to put on the headphones will&#xD;
      not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled three-arm study, with one group receiving the proposed&#xD;
      treatment-music with low tones and the other two groups receiving a placebo (music without&#xD;
      tones or stories) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children will listen to the music / stories via stereophonic headphones for 10 minutes -&#xD;
      3 times a week for 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the treatment the children will undergo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Neurological evaluation with their medical charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physiotherapic evaluation using the GMFM assessment and a surface EMG&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fine motor assessment using the QUEST and visual assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Parents will complete the PODCI and the Care and Comfort questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will repeat the EMG measurements immediately after the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 months after completing the treatment we will repeat the measurements we had done before&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
