      Patients suffering from Schizophrenia and their families often suffer from poor care because&#xD;
      of ignorance about the disorder especially in economically developing countries. Although&#xD;
      antipsychotic medication is effective in reducing relapse rate, 30-40 percent of patients&#xD;
      relapse within one year and 40-60 percent relapse within 2 years after discharge from 1st&#xD;
      hospitalization even if they are receiving maintenance medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of the treatment for schizophrenia,&#xD;
      patients with schizophrenia benefit more from combined use of antipsychotic drugs and&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment than pharmacotherapy alone in delaying or preventing relapse or&#xD;
      reducing hospital days. It is also less costly than standard treatment and suitable for&#xD;
      psychiatric rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there are now a number of studies from western countries and a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial from china which have led to increase enthusiasm about psychosocial treatment for&#xD;
      schizophrenia but question remains about comparative benefit of treatment methods and&#xD;
      additional methods of multiple treatment. In developing countries there is need for further&#xD;
      studies in which integrated treatment of pharmaco-therapy and psycho-education is instituted&#xD;
      and compared with treatment as usual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Realizing the need for maintaining the compliance and continuity of treatment, department of&#xD;
      psychiatry has started a program called Supervised Treatment of Outpatient Schizophrenia.&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Supervised Treatment versus the usual care&#xD;
      provided in the outpatient.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schizophrenic patients and their families often suffer from poor care because of ignorance&#xD;
      about the disorder1, especially in economically developing countries. Although many patients&#xD;
      of schizophrenia respond well to antipsychotic treatment, the risk of subsequent relapses is&#xD;
      generally high2, 40-60 percent relapse within 2 years after discharge from 1st&#xD;
      hospitalization is observed even if they are receiving maintenance medication1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also non-compliance is quite common in patients with schizophrenia like any other illness,&#xD;
      and it should be addressed3 because noncompliance and aggression risk profile symptoms are&#xD;
      positively correlated to hospitalization4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-compliance is also common in Pakistan like any other society. The commonest reasons for&#xD;
      non-compliance are unawareness of the benefits of treatment, non affordability of drugs,&#xD;
      physical side effects, no awareness given by the doctor and unfriendly attitude of doctors5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Educational therapy both for patient and family led to significant psychopathological&#xD;
      improvement at post-treatment and at follow-up.6 The recent trend of family intervention&#xD;
      produced many models. One long-term family based intervention reduced the risk of psychotic&#xD;
      relapse to about the half within the first two years. These methods also shorten hospital&#xD;
      stays, improve compliance with medication, patients' social functioning and relatives'&#xD;
      well-being, and they seem to be cost-effective.7 Definitive relationship exists between&#xD;
      compliance and the economic costs of schizophrenia as lower rates of compliance lead to&#xD;
      higher costs of treating schizophrenia8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family education on schizophrenia in China was effective in improving knowledge and promoting&#xD;
      improvement in patients' symptoms9. A largest randomized controlled trial from china10 have&#xD;
      led to increase enthusiasm about psychosocial treatment for schizophrenia but question&#xD;
      remains about comparative benefit of treatment methods and additional methods of multiple&#xD;
      treatment11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mostly research done on role of psychosocial-education in schizophrenia is from developed&#xD;
      countries but no work has been done yet in developing country like Pakistan even Subcontinent&#xD;
      having a different cultural background. Realizing the need for maintaining the compliance and&#xD;
      continuity of treatment, I have designed a study program called Supervised Treatment of&#xD;
      Outpatient Schizophrenia. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of Supervised&#xD;
      Treatment versus the usual care provided in the outpatient.&#xD;
