      This will be a randomized controlled trial closely following the original protocol in the&#xD;
      previous study published in JAMA 2004 by Merten et al. Patients will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of two treatment groups. Treatment group A will receive 1cc/kg/hour of 0.9% normal saline&#xD;
      at least 2 hours prior to study beginning and will be continued during and for 6 hours post&#xD;
      contrast. Treatment group B will receive 3cc/kg of sodium bicarbonate solution for one hour&#xD;
      prior to procedure then drip rate will be decreased to 1cc/kg/hour during and for 6 hours&#xD;
      post procedure. The sodium bicarbonate solution will be made by adding 3 amps of bicarbonate&#xD;
      to 1L of D5W. Patients in both treatment arms weighing &gt;110kg the initial fluid bolus and&#xD;
      drip will be limited to those patients weighing 110kg. In both treatment arms, diuretics will&#xD;
      be held before and after contrast administration on the day of the study. BMP will be checked&#xD;
      the day of, 24 and 48 hours post contrast administration. The greatest change in all readings&#xD;
      will be used for treatment comparisons. Contrast induced nephropathy will be defined as a&#xD;
      change in serum creatinine of more than 25% from baseline and/or 0.5mg/dL. Urinary pH will&#xD;
      also be measured on first spontaneous void following bolus. Vital signs including blood&#xD;
      pressure and oxygen saturation will be documented every 4 hours to monitor patients closely&#xD;
      for signs and symptoms of volume overload&#xD;

      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage III Chronic Kidney Disease (GFR 30-60ml/min per 1.73m2 calculated by using MDRD&#xD;
           equation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inpatients at Norton Community Hospital scheduled to undergo diagnostic CT Scan using&#xD;
           contrast between the hours of 7am and 6pm&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18+ years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current clinical diagnosis of exacerbated congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Creatinine &gt;8 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in serum Cre of at least 0.5mg/dL during previous 24hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-existing dialysis patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple myeloma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uncontrolled hypertension (definition: treated SBP &gt;160mmHg or DBP &gt;100mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure to contrast 48 hours prior to study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergy to contrast dye&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient has received pressor agents, fendolapam, mannitol, or mucomyst at time of study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Consecutive samples of all CPSC inpatients who meet the above inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Allocation Assignment: Patients who meet inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study will pick a concealed number out of an open envelope. That number (between 1- 656) will&#xD;
      correlate with a number on a sealed opaque envelope. Inside the opaque envelope will be a&#xD;
      chart sticker. The chart sticker will have the words either normal saline or sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate. The envelope will not be opened until all patient information (ie. Patient ID&#xD;
      sticker) is placed on the original chosen envelope. Then the chart sticker will be removed&#xD;
      and placed on the chart&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      This will be a randomized controlled trial closely following the original protocol in the&#xD;
      previous study. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Treatment&#xD;
      group A will receive 1cc/kg/hour of 0.9% normal saline at least 2 hours prior to study&#xD;
      beginning and will be continued during and for 6 hours post contrast. Treatment group B will&#xD;
      receive 3cc/kg of sodium bicarbonate solution for one hour prior to procedure then drip rate&#xD;
      will be decreased to 1cc/kg/hour during and for 6 hours post procedure. The sodium&#xD;
      bicarbonate solution will be made by adding 3 amps of bicarbonate to 1L of D5W. Patients in&#xD;
      both treatment arms weighing &gt;110kg the initial fluid bolus and drip will be limited to those&#xD;
      patients weighing 110kg. In both treatment arms, diuretics will be held before and after&#xD;
      contrast administration on the day of the study. BMP will be checked the day of, 24 and 48&#xD;
