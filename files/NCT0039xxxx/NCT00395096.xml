  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is one of the most common childhood diseases. It is chronic and often severely&#xD;
      disabling. The amount of nitric oxide that is exhaled while breathing increases with airway&#xD;
      inflammation, a symptom of asthma. This study will examine the results from a previous study,&#xD;
      the Cincinnati Asthma Prevention (CAP) study, to evaluate the effects of environmental and&#xD;
      genetic factors on exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) levels and to determine the relationship&#xD;
      between eNO and asthma severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring gas that plays a role in many body functions. Levels of&#xD;
      eNO increase with airway inflammation, a symptom of asthma. Researchers have proposed using&#xD;
      eNO as a noninvasive measure to guide physicians in the treatment and medical management of&#xD;
      asthma in children. However, more information about eNO is needed before this can happen.&#xD;
      This study will perform a secondary analysis of the results from its parent study, the CAP&#xD;
      study, which evaluated the effectiveness of preventing asthma in children who had been&#xD;
      exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not enroll any new participants. Previously collected data from the CAP study&#xD;
      will be reevaluated in this study to determine the longitudinal effects of environmental and&#xD;
      genetic factors on eNO levels. In addition, the data will be evaluated to determine the&#xD;
      relationship between eNO levels and asthma severity. No new data will be collected in this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
