  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel formulation of&#xD;
      oxcarbazepine that is released more slowly than the current formulation. The study medication&#xD;
      will be used as a treatment against partial epilepsy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomized, open-label, flexible-titration, controlled,&#xD;
      parallel-group study to investigate the safety and efficacy of a novel modified release&#xD;
      formulation of oxcarbazepine (OXC MR) compared to an immediate release oxcarbazepine (OXC IR)&#xD;
      product in patients with partial epilepsy. Adult patients of both gender, aged at least 18&#xD;
      years with refractory partial epilepsy, with or without secondary generalisation receiving a&#xD;
      stable background treatment with daily dosages of exactly 900 or 1200 or 1500 mg&#xD;
      Oxcarbazepine will be enrolled. Concomitant medication consisting of maximal 2 additional&#xD;
      AEDs (vagus nerve stimulator included) is allowed and must be kept stable throughout the&#xD;
      study. Patients, who agree to participate, will first sign and date the informed consent and&#xD;
      undergo an evaluation at screening visit to determine eligibility. Those patients who qualify&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study, assigned a patient ID, and will enter the 4-week baseline&#xD;
      period. Each patient will receive a seizure diary to record the number of seizures during the&#xD;
      baseline period. For Visit 1 the patient will return to the clinic and complete all baseline&#xD;
      procedures. Patients who have met the entry criteria will be randomised. The two treatment&#xD;
      groups consist of 50 patients each, one group to be treated with OXC MR b.i.d. and the other&#xD;
      to be treated with OXC IR b.i.d. in a 1:1 randomization. Following assignment to one of both&#xD;
      treatment groups the patient will enter the dose-titration phase. From Visit 1 (Study Day 1)&#xD;
      a total daily dose of 1200 mg /1500 mg /1800 mg oxcarbazepine will be given to the randomised&#xD;
      patients. From Day 6 the dosage will be titrated to a maximum total daily dose of 2700 mg in&#xD;
      steps of 300 mg every 6th day. Patients who experienced intolerable adverse events could&#xD;
      reduce their daily dose by 150 mg on the 2nd day of up-titration for the remainder of the&#xD;
      treatment period. In case the reduced dosage will also not be tolerated, in a second step the&#xD;
      dosage can be reduced by further 150 mg OXC. The maximal tolerated dose achieved on&#xD;
      up-titration will be maintained up to the final visit (Study Day 26).&#xD;
