      The primary objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm volume in&#xD;
      patients with ipsilateral lymphedema&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in arm&#xD;
           interstitial fluid pressure (IFP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the degree of improvement in arm edema as measured by changes in extracellular&#xD;
           fluid (ECF) volume based on bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) by lymphometer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of VEGF inhibition in this patient population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the clinical benefit in patients with ipsilateral lymphedema treated with&#xD;
           vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibition by evaluating patient responses to&#xD;
           a quality of life questionnaire (FACT-B+4 lymphedema questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the impact of VEGF inhibition on circulating VEGF levels in patients with&#xD;
           lymphedema&#xD;
