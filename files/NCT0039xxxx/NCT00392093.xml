      Background Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease of unknown cause. Risk&#xD;
      factors proposed as important in the pathogenesis of SLE include genetic, environmental, and&#xD;
      hormonal factors (1). Strong evidence implicates sex steroid hormones in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      SLE and other autoimmune diseases in human beings. Female gender is considered the strongest&#xD;
      risk factor for the development of SLE (2), which incidence is 8 times higher in females than&#xD;
      in males during the reproductive years. This difference in the susceptibility for developing&#xD;
      SLE strongly suggests the influence of sex hormones. We have shown a significantly increased&#xD;
      risk to develop SLE among postmenopausal women under estrogen replacement therapy compared&#xD;
      with postmenopausal women who did not take such hormones; this increased risk was directly&#xD;
      related with the length of use of such therapy (3). Lupus flares have been reported during&#xD;
      periods of major sex hormone changes such as puberty, menses, pregnancy and postpartum (4-7).&#xD;
      Abnormal metabolism of estrogens yields an excess production of 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone in&#xD;
      patients with SLE of both sexes (8), and low plasma androgens levels have been reported in&#xD;
      women with active and quiescent disease (9,10). An association between SLE and Klinefelter's&#xD;
      syndrome has been proposed (11). Estrogen receptors have been found on OKT8-positive&#xD;
      lymphocytes (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in animal models of SLE have also shown the relevance of sex hormones for the&#xD;
      development and course of SLE. Studies in the NZB/W F1 hybrid mouse support the role for&#xD;
      female hormones in the modulation of autoantibody production, development of renal disease,&#xD;
      and death (13). Female NZB/W F1 mice have higher autoantibodies titers and die several months&#xD;
      earlier than males. Treatment with androgens improves the survival and reduces immune-complex&#xD;
      deposits and development of renal disease in NZB/W F1 females (14). Prepubertal castration of&#xD;
      NZB/W F1 males plus administration of exogenous estrogen causes a female pattern of lupus&#xD;
      (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, these studies consistently suggest an interaction between sex hormones and the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our Institute more than 1900 SLE patients are followed-up regularly; 95 percent are&#xD;
      female, and around 20 percent of them are postmenopausal. These figures reflect the&#xD;
      increasing number of women with lupus who reach the postmenopausal stage due to their&#xD;
      susceptibility for developing either early or premature menopause, along with the&#xD;
      extraordinary improvement in their prognosis and survival rate. (16,2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopause entails the risk of developing vasomotor and other symptoms, as well as chronic&#xD;
      conditions, e.g. osteoporosis. Hormone therapy, with estrogens alone or in combination with&#xD;
      progestins, constitutes the most effective treatment for vasomotor and urogenital symptoms.&#xD;
      Current guidelines recommend hormone therapy, at the lowest effective dose and the shortest&#xD;
      time necessary (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of exogenous estrogens for developing systemic lupus erythematosus and disease&#xD;
      activity is controversial. Women users of oral contraceptives (18) or menopause hormonal&#xD;
      therapy are at an increased risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus than non-users&#xD;
      (3,19). While a high rate of flares in women taking combined oral contraceptives has been&#xD;
      reported (6), recently, we and the investigators of the Safety of Estrogens in Lupus&#xD;
      Erythematosus National Assessment (SELENA) group have demonstrated that estrogen containing&#xD;
      oral contraceptives did not increase the risk of activity exacerbation (20,21). Hormone&#xD;
      therapy was safe, well tolerated, and did not increase the risk of lupus flares in&#xD;
      observational studies (22-24); however, the SELENA group detected a slight increase in the&#xD;
      risk of developing mild/moderate, but not severe flares (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the increasing number of women with systemic lupus erythematosus who become&#xD;
      postmenopausal, the earlier age of menopause onset, and the co-morbidity appended; we aim to&#xD;
      evaluate the effects of hormone therapy on disease activity, menopausal symptoms, bone&#xD;
      mineral density, lipid profile, and mammographic breast density in peri/postmenopausal women&#xD;
      with systemic lupus erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We consider this study will help to identify the benefits and major adverse effects,&#xD;
      associated with the hormone replacement therapy in peri/postmenopausal women with SLE, and to&#xD;
      determine their efficacy in this unknown field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous similar studies Few studies have explored the influence of hormone replacement&#xD;
      therapy on the activity of SLE. Arden et al. (22), conducted a retrospective study among 60&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with SLE including 30 women users and 30 women non-users of HRT. The&#xD;
      mean follow-up was 12 months. There was no significant difference in any parameter measured&#xD;
      including lupus activity. They concluded that HRT appears to be well tolerated and safe.&#xD;
      Kreidstein et al., in a case-control study (23), compared the incidence of lupus flares&#xD;
      between 16 lupus patients receiving HRT and 32 controls. After 12 months of follow-up, the&#xD;
      authors concluded that the use of HRT in postmenopausal females with SLE does not appear to&#xD;
      increase the rate of lupus flares.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mok et al compared the frequency and severity of flares in 11 patients who received HRT with&#xD;
      23 patients who did not. No significant increase in the rate or magnitude of flares couldbe&#xD;
      demonstrated in patients who received HRT over a median follow-up period of 35 months (24).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although estrogens have been avoided in SLE patients, recently it has been considered that&#xD;
      the safety of estrogens in lupus is unsolved. The U.S. National Institutes of Health have&#xD;
      funded what is considered the first clinical trial on the safety of estrogens for women with&#xD;
      SLE -SELENA (Safety of Estrogen in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment). This clinical&#xD;
      trial will be conducted in 5 U.S. rheumatology centers. It is considered that &quot;the results of&#xD;
      the trial will provide scientific evidence to support physicians' decisions about the safety&#xD;
      of providing oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to women with SLE&quot;&#xD;
      (21,25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Hormone therapy does not increase the risk of lupus activity exacerbation, and it&#xD;
      is effective for the relief of menopausal symptoms and improves bone mineral density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methodology Design: Double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients: One hundred and six peri/postmenopausal women with a diagnosis of SLE according to&#xD;
      the American College of Rheumatology classification criteria (31), will be followed&#xD;
      regularly, baseline,1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18,21 and 24 months, to assess SLE activity as well as&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and acceptability of hormone replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on disease activity in&#xD;
           peri/postmenopausal women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy in the relief of menopausal&#xD;
           symptoms, and on bone mineral density in peri/postmenopausal women with systemic lupus&#xD;
           erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on lipid profile, mammographic&#xD;
           parenchymal density in peri/postmenopausal women with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the incidence rate of major side effects of hormone replacement therapy in&#xD;
           peri/postmenopausal women with systemic lupus erythematosus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lupus activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure lupus activity, we will use a validated disease activity index, the&#xD;
      Systemic Lupus Erythematosus disease activity index (SLEDAI) (26). The primary outcome will&#xD;
      be global disease activity throughout the follow-up period, estimated as the area under the&#xD;
      SLEDAI-curve (SLEDAI-AUC). Secondary outcomes will be the incidence of lupus flares, the time&#xD;
      to the first flare, changes in SLEDAI values from baseline at each follow-up visit, and&#xD;
      maximum disease activity. Lupus flares and severe flares are defined as an increase in the&#xD;
      SLEDAI of 3 or more or 12 or more points, respectively, from the previous visit (27). The&#xD;
      data will also be analyzed with the use of a new version of the SLEDAI (SLEDAI-2K) (28), and&#xD;
      a modified SLEDAI (SLEDAIm) that excludes microhematuria and pyuria because they may be&#xD;
      associated with the treatment. We will also record lupus treatment, hospitalizations,&#xD;
      thromboses, and deaths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopausal symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Menopausal symptoms and depression will be assessed through a face-to face interview,&#xD;
      utilizing the Greene Climacteric Scale questionnaire (29) and the Beck's Depression Inventory&#xD;
      (30). The Greene Climacteric Scale will be administered at baseline, and the Beck's&#xD;
      Depression Inventory at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone mineral density:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Densitometry of lumbar spine and hip will be performed at baseline, 12 and 24 months with&#xD;
      dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. In addition, blood and urine samples to measure biochemical&#xD;
      markers of bone turnover will be taken at baseline, 6, 12 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be collected for estradiol at baseline,1,2,3,6 and 15 months; lipid&#xD;
      profile at baseline, 9 and 21 months; coagulation tests at baseline,1 and 3 months; cervical&#xD;
      cytology examinations at baseline, 12 and 24 months; mammography at baseline and at the last&#xD;
      study visit in all the patients who would complete &gt; 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the selection of subjects Patients will be selected from the lupus clinic at the&#xD;
      Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Medicas y Nutricion Salvador Zubiran. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      be identified by a research assistant when they attend their clinical appointments as&#xD;
      outpatients, and will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;

&#xD;
       12. Undiagnosed uterine bleeding or cervical dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of hospital records:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospital records will be needed in order to complete patients' information related to dates&#xD;
      of entry to the hospital, first criteria, 4 criteria, chronic damage, sociodemographic&#xD;
      information, etc., not for lupus activity or secondary effects from the hormone therapy,&#xD;
      which will be collected prospectively. Medical records use has been authorized by the&#xD;
      appropriate hospital authorities. This authorization is implicit in the approval form the&#xD;
      ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject allocation Patients who fulfill the selection criteria will be randomly assign to&#xD;
      hormone therapy or placebo, using a computer-generated randomization list. Patients will be&#xD;
      allocated to the random numbers according to their entrance to the study, once they have been&#xD;
      informed about the study and sign the acceptance form. The allocation will be done by a&#xD;
      research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the medications to be studied&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/day plus 5 mg/day of medroxyprogesterone acetate&#xD;
           p.o. for the first 10 days per-month (Premarin and Cycrin, respectively, Laboratorios&#xD;
           Wyeth).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biologically inert placebo identical in appearance and packaging size to the active&#xD;
           regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All women will receive a daily supplement of 1200 mg of calcium carbonate and 800 IU of&#xD;
           vitamin D (Caltratate D, Laboratorios Whitehall-Robbins).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Admission procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure for patients recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SLE patients will be identified from the lupus clinic. If the patient would accept to&#xD;
      participate, she will be asked to sign the consent form and a study number will be assigned&#xD;
      by the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up procedure All patients will be evaluated in a standardized way at the same dates (±&#xD;
      7 days) by two independent specialists: a rheumatologist and a reproductive health&#xD;
      specialist. Both evaluations will be done at baseline,1,2,3,6,9,12,15,18,21, and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will be evaluated by a rheumatologist at entry and every follow-up visit. The&#xD;
      following variables will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - General information: (basal evaluation). A standardized entry form will be filled-out&#xD;
           to every patient who enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Lupus activity: (every visit) This will be evaluated using the SLEDAI (26), a widely&#xD;
           used and validated lupus activity index. A training session for the use of all indices&#xD;
           will be conducted between both participating rheumatologists in order to reach agreement&#xD;
           in their use and diminish inter-observer variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Medications: (every visit) Use of medications will be recorded, both as a continuous&#xD;
           (dose) and binary (yes/no) scale. The following medications will be recorded: steroids,&#xD;
           azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, cyclophosphamide, and chloroquine. Non-steroidal&#xD;
           antiinflamatory drugs will be recorded only as binary scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the rheumatic evaluation, each patient will be interviewed about the onset&#xD;
      of symptoms since the previous visit by an specialist in Biology of the Reproduction, who&#xD;
      will be unblinded to the treatment assigned. A standardized questionnaire for this purpose&#xD;
      will be used. In addition, the investigator will perform a gynecological physical&#xD;
      examination, and will evaluate the compliance to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pharmacy personnel will dispense the study medications according to the randomization&#xD;
      list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who do not attend their scheduled visits will be contacted by the social worker, and&#xD;
      visited at home when it was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for early termination of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A patient will be discontinued from the study whenever any of the following criteria would be&#xD;
      present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Development of severe lupus activity (SLEDAI &gt; 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Development of any putative complication to hormone therapy (thrombosis, cholestasis,&#xD;
           etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Development of any other severe complications due neither to SLE nor hormone therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Need prolonged immobilization. The decision will be taken after an special meeting held&#xD;
           by the study's physicians. It is required an agreement between at least one physician&#xD;
           from each of the participating departments (Rheumatology and Reproduction Biology).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management An entry form for each patient (original and copy) will be filled-out at both&#xD;
      reproductive health clinic and lupus clinic. On follow-up visits, standardized forms&#xD;
      (original and copy) will be filled for each patient at both clinics. The information of these&#xD;
      forms will be entered (double entry) on a master processing file which will be updated once a&#xD;
      week. All paper forms will be kept in special locked cabinets. Study investigators will be&#xD;
      the only persons having access to this information in order to maintain absolute&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Final analysis will be undertaken after 24 months follow-up is completed in all&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population for analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All those patients who enter the study will be included in the analysis. The analysis period&#xD;
      will be from the basal evaluation until the last patient's visit or the study ending.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lupus disease activity will be analyzed by between-group comparisons of lupus activity as&#xD;
      measured by the SLEDAI-AUC, maximum SLEDAI, and change in SLEDAI score from baseline at each&#xD;
      follow-up visit. nalysis of the incidence of flares will be based on incidence-density rates,&#xD;
      with patient-years of follow-up as the denominator and with relative risk and 95 percent&#xD;
      confidence intervals as the measure of association. For each patient, time will be calculated&#xD;
      from baseline until the first flare, withdrawal from the study, end of follow-up, or death,&#xD;
      whichever is first. The probability of flares throughout the study will be calculated with&#xD;
      use of life-table analyses and the log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Climacteric symptoms will be analyzed as the mean value of the Green's scale score at&#xD;
      baseline and at each follow-up visit, between-group and intra-group. Bone mineral density&#xD;
      will be analyzed as the mean value at baseline, 12 and 24 months, between-group and&#xD;
      intra-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and acceptability of hormone therapy will be analyzed as the proportion of&#xD;
      patients in each group who develop secondary effects, as well as the number who quit the&#xD;
      study during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be compared using Student's t-test, and categorical variables using&#xD;
      chi-square or Fisher's exact test. Within-group comparisons were made with use of the&#xD;
      Wilcoxon signed-rank test. P values will be two-sided. All analyses will be conducted by the&#xD;
      intention-to-treat method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee: An independent Safety Monitoring Committee consisting of 2&#xD;
      rheumatologists, 1 epidemiologist/ biostatistician, and 2 endocrinologists, not participating&#xD;
      as investigators will be established. The committee will meet every 12 months, or at any time&#xD;
      if an unusual problem occurs, to review all unacceptable events as defined by the&#xD;
      investigators during the planning phase, and determine whether they may be attributable to&#xD;
      the treatment studied. The study will be stopped by the Safety Monitoring Committee if the&#xD;
      number of unacceptable events reaches the stopping criterion. The committee will also review&#xD;
      the interim analysis, with authority to stop the study if a significant difference (P &lt; 0.01)&#xD;
      was detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Missing observations: We will try not to miss any data, however, because this study involves&#xD;
      several variables it is expected that some of them will be missing. We consider the&#xD;
      percentage of missing observations will be small and at random, due to the prospective nature&#xD;
      of the study. Anyway, we will seek advice from a statistician on the best way to handle the&#xD;
      problem&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary (Interim) analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since we consider we will not have enough patients to detect any significant treatment&#xD;
      difference earlier, a mid-term preliminary analysis will be done at 18 months. The objective&#xD;
      of this analysis is to evaluate if there is an important difference between the two groups&#xD;
      related to disease activity or adverse effects. If there was a satisfactory answer to the&#xD;
      main study hypothesis or an unexpectedly higher number of thrombotic events would be present&#xD;
      in the hormone therapy group, the study will be finished. As a stopping rule, a two-tailed&#xD;
      significance level for SLE activity P &lt; 0.01 has been established, or the presence of &gt;3&#xD;
      thrombotic events in the hormone therapy group. If a P value between 0.01 - 0.05 was detected&#xD;
      in the interim analysis, a second analysis will be undertaken 9 months later with an&#xD;
      identical stopping rule for both SLE activity and thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary analysis will be done by personnel from the Clinic Epidemiology Unit at our&#xD;
      Institute, whom will be blinded to groups' coding. Results will be reviewed by members of the&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring Committee. The result will not be informed to the research group, unless an&#xD;
      indication for termination of the study would be present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final analysis will be undertaken after 12 months follow-up is completed on all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects and statistical power&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the assumption of a mean (+SD) baseline SLEDAI value of 5.43±5.04 (27), we estimate that&#xD;
      the planned sample size would provide an 80 percent chance of detecting a difference in&#xD;
      SLEDAI of 3 points or more (on a scale of 0 to 105, with higher scores indicating greater&#xD;
      severity), at a significance level 0.05. With allowance for a 20 percent loss to follow-up,&#xD;
      the planned sample size was 54 patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring study progress:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A monthly meeting will be held among all study participants in order to evaluate the study's&#xD;
      flow, solving problems, evaluate intermediate outcomes, and reach agreements. Decisions not&#xD;
      foreseen at the beginning of the study will be taken in those meetings. Minutes will be&#xD;
      written in each of those meetings which will be filed in the research book.&#xD;

      3.4 Project management&#xD;
&#xD;
      General coordination, supervision and analysis of the study will be under the principal&#xD;
      investigators responsibility. Funds administration will be at the Institute administrative&#xD;
      office for research projects. All publications derived from the present investigation will be&#xD;
      done according to established regulations, giving recognition to the support received.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Main problems anticipated&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Meet study's subjects number. This is the main problem we face. Although we follow&#xD;
           regularly around 1900 SLE patients, finding 106 peri/postmenopausal women who would&#xD;
           accept to participate in the study after reviewing inclusion/exclusion criteria remains&#xD;
           a hard number to reach. However, every year about 200 new SLE patients come to our&#xD;
           Institute. We expect to meet the necessary number to conduct the study. If we noticed we&#xD;
           had a low number, we will invite lupus patients from other institutions to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We do not consider we may have problems neither with the evaluation from rheumatology&#xD;
           nor reproductive health clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results expected from this study will provide light about several unanswered questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - We will be able to determine whether postmenopausal hormone therapy affects SLE&#xD;
           activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - We will be able to determine the effect of hormone replacement therapy on climacteric&#xD;
           symptoms and bone mineral density in peri/postmenopausal women with SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - We will be able to determine the incidence rate of secondary effect and the&#xD;
           risk/benefit profile of hormone replacement therapy in peri/postmenopausal women with&#xD;
           SLE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We expect to publish our results in first line journals.&#xD;
