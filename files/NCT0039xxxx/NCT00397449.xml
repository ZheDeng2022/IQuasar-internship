      This is a randomized, open, dose-selection Phase 1 study. The study aims to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of 3 doses (10,30 &amp; 100 micrograms) of the GMZ2 hybrid (GLURP and&#xD;
      MSP3) blood stage vaccine in healthy non-immune European adults. The vaccines will be&#xD;
      administered with aluminum hydroxide as adjuvant. The safety and the tolerability of the&#xD;
      vaccine will be assessed on the rate of solicited and unsolicited events/reactions related to&#xD;
      the vaccine. The safety profile will include local and systemic reactions/events as well as&#xD;
      the biological safety, based on a clinically significant change of the baseline value of the&#xD;
      main biological criteria. The immunogenicity of the different formulation of the vaccine will&#xD;
      be assessed on the level and the quality of circulating antibodies as well as the stimulation&#xD;
      of the T-cell immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial is a randomised, open, dose-selection, single centre trial. One adjuvant will be&#xD;
      assessed, aluminum hydroxide (alum). Three different dosages - 10µg, 30µg, and 100µg - of&#xD;
      GMZ2 will be evaluated with the aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. A total of 30 volunteers will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomized into three groups of 10. As this is a dose escalation study,&#xD;
      volunteers in Group 1 will receive the initial dose of 10µg on the first vaccination day.&#xD;
      After a satisfactory safety profile at this dose (see sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3), we will&#xD;
      proceed to vaccinate volunteers in Group 2 with the higher dose of 30µg after a 2-week&#xD;
      interval. The same procedure will also be followed for volunteers in Group 3, who will be&#xD;
      administered their initial dose of 100µg GMZ2 if the review of the safety profile of Group 2&#xD;
      is satisfactory. The aim will be to recruit all volunteers before the intended start of the&#xD;
      study. The randomization procedure will be performed in the following way: when participants&#xD;
      are found to be eligible and have signed their informed consent they will be numbered&#xD;
      sequentially (in order of enrollment). The numbers will be randomly assigned to 3 groups of&#xD;
      10 numbers through a specific randomization computer program. These groups will be the&#xD;
      treatment groups.&#xD;
