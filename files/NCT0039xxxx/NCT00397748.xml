  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore the brain in men with and without attention deficit hyperactivity&#xD;
      disorder (ADHD). It will use positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) to study brain function and nerve cell communication involving phospholipids&#xD;
      (fatty molecules that make up the covering of nerve cell fibers in the brain and are involved&#xD;
      in communication between the cells). It will also look at how nerve cell communication is&#xD;
      related to blood flow. In particular, the study will explore communication through the&#xD;
      dopamine system, which is one of the main neurotransmitter systems in the brain involved in&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy men and men with ADHD between 18 and 55 years of age may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;Medical history and psychiatric and medical evaluation, including blood and urine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;MRI scan. This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of&#xD;
      the brain. The subject lies still on a table that slides into the scanner (a metal cylinder)&#xD;
      during the scanning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;PET scanning. The subject lies on the scanner bed with his head held still using a&#xD;
      special facemask. A catheter (plastic tube or needle) is placed in an artery to collect blood&#xD;
      samples and in a vein to inject radioactive isotopes for measuring blood flow and&#xD;
      phospholipid metabolism. Scans are done after an injection of a saline solution and again&#xD;
      after injection of apomorphine, a medication that turns on dopamine receptors in the brain.&#xD;
      The injections are given under the skin of the abdomen, about one and a half hours apart....&#xD;

      A. Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a heritable neurodevelopmental disorder&#xD;
      with a reported male predominance that persists into adulthood and leads to significant&#xD;
      morbidity in affected individuals. ADHD is currently hypothesized to reflect central&#xD;
      dopaminergic dysfunction. Evaluation of human dopaminergic dysfunction using in vivo&#xD;
      neuroimaging has been limited to studies of receptor localization and quantification, and&#xD;
      dopamine synthesis, rather than direct measurement of the functional status of receptor&#xD;
      signaling. There exists a need to thoroughly elucidate mechanisms underlying aberrant&#xD;
      dopaminergic neurotransmission downstream of receptor activation in signaling processes. We&#xD;
      have developed an in vivo method to measure neuroreceptor-initiated signal transduction&#xD;
      involving activation of phospholipase A(2) to release the second messenger, arachidonic acid&#xD;
      (AA). We propose to use positron emission tomography (PET) to quantitatively image&#xD;
      dopamine-initiated signal transduction via AA in ADHD patients and healthy volunteers, in&#xD;
      subjects administered the dopaminergic agonist, apomorphine, and to measure regional cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (rCBF) as well. We hypothesize that signaling and flow responses to apomorphine&#xD;
      will be elevated, demonstrating hypersensitivity of the dopamine signaling mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 healthy male volunteers between the ages of 18 and 55, will be recruited for this study&#xD;
      (see justification for recruitment of males only in Study Design and Methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will have up to four study-related visits to the Clinical Center in Bethesda&#xD;
      over a one-year period, including an overnight stay. Participants will also be asked to&#xD;
      complete an initial comprehensive telephone questionnaire to elicit whether they meet&#xD;
      criteria for study participation, followed by on-site visits to NIH to complete a modified&#xD;
      battery of neuropsychiatric screening tests related to symptom presence and severity.&#xD;
      Questions relating to medical, family, psychiatric and developmental histories and lifestyle&#xD;
      will be asked. In addition, visits will include a physical exam as well as blood and urine&#xD;
      collection, and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head. Subject&#xD;
      participation will culminate with sequential subcutaneous administration of a single dose of&#xD;
      control vehicle solution (control) followed by the dopamine agonist apomorphine (after&#xD;
      appropriate pre-medication with the anti-emetic, trimethobenzamide) or two sequential&#xD;
      injections of vehicle for PET scans with attendant radiolabeled compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Outcome Parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has four specific aims. First, regional cerebral blood flow will be quantified in&#xD;
      response to an acute challenge with apomorphine s.c. and compared between study groups&#xD;
      (ADHD/non-ADHD). Second, dopamine D(2)-like receptor signal transduction will be evaluated by&#xD;
      PET in response to an acute challenge with apomorphine s.c. and compared between study groups&#xD;
      (ADHD/non-ADHD). Third, baseline esterified and unesterified serum fatty acids will be&#xD;
      compared between patients and control subjects. Lastly, we will examine the acute effect of&#xD;
      apomorphine in the stimulation of serum growth hormone in all subjects, as confirmatory&#xD;
      evidence for stimulation of central dopaminergic receptors.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All subjects must have normal values on screening measures to be in the study. They must be&#xD;
        male and between 18 and 55 years of age. Primary efforts will also be to recruit&#xD;
        non-smokers, given nicotine s ability to release dopamine presynaptically, a confound for&#xD;
        this study. Previous smokers who have been abstinent for greater than 1 year may be&#xD;
        considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to psychiatric criteria described above: past or current medical condition that&#xD;
        would interfere with brain function - history of alcoholism, tobacco use (must have minimum&#xD;
        of one year of full remission/complete abstinence from nicotine), neurological illness,&#xD;
        head trauma with loss of consciousness, history of exposure to central nervous system&#xD;
        toxin; history of central nervous system infection; metabolic, endocrine, connective tissue&#xD;
        disease; hypertension or other cardiovascular disorder; gastrointestinal disorders;&#xD;
        abnormal renal, liver or pulmonary function; blood dyscrasias; malignancy; nonstimulant or&#xD;
        stimulant pharmacotherapy within 1 month of the study, or any history of antipsychotic&#xD;
        medication; neurodegenerative or neurodevelopmental disorder; stroke; epilepsy; sensitivity&#xD;
        to flashing lights; subjects requiring regular medication; subjects demonstrated by drug&#xD;
        screening to have taken a controlled substance; subjects with a history of hypersensitivity&#xD;
        to lidocaine; subjects with IQ less than 80. Females, adolescents and children will be&#xD;
        excluded.&#xD;
