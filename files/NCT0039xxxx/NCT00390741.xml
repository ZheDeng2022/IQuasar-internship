      The major goals of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct an intervention development study to evaluate the feasibility of implementing&#xD;
           an exercise intervention for reduction losses in bone mineral density, muscle mass, and&#xD;
           strength, and clinically relevant aspects of functioning following a hip fracture, and&#xD;
           to obtain preliminary tests of the effective ness of these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the effect of home-based exercise intervention on bone metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the effects of hip fracture on bone metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the effects of exercise and hip fracture on hormonal regulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the association between markers of bone metabolism hormone regulators, and&#xD;
           BMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To separate out the effects of hip fracture on bone turnover from those of aging in&#xD;
           persons with low bone mineral density.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a major public health problem, with striking consequences for the older&#xD;
      patient, her family and the health care system. More than 350,000 persons over age 65 will&#xD;
      fracture a hip in the United States during the coming year at an estimated annual cost of&#xD;
      over $12 billion; by 2040, over 650,000 hip fractures will occur annually in this group.&#xD;
      Between 18-33% of older hip fracture patients die within one year of their fracture,&#xD;
      depending upon the specific population studied. Most surviving hip fracture patients&#xD;
      experience reduced mobility and lose their ability to function independently. As many as 45%&#xD;
      of those who are community dwelling at the time of their fracture are discharged to&#xD;
      institutions post-hospitalization, and 15-25% remain institutionalized for a year&#xD;
      post-fracture. Further, significant strain is observed in over a third of family caregivers&#xD;
      as long as a year post-fracture. Depending upon the population studied and function being&#xD;
      assessed, an estimated 25-75% of those who are independent before their fracture can neither&#xD;
      walk independently nor achieve their previous level of independent living within a year&#xD;
      following their fracture and 10- 20% of those who sustained a hip fracture can expect to have&#xD;
      another osteoporotic fracture within two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol consists of two components related to the recovery after hip fracture&#xD;
      (described below):&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXERCISE INTERVENTION TRIAL. With few exceptions, which are restricted primarily to studies&#xD;
      of comprehensive in-patient rehabilitation, little systematic attention has been given to&#xD;
      evaluating strategies for improving functioning, bone, and muscle post-hip fracture.&#xD;
      Strategies that have been shown to improve bone, muscle, and function in older persons who&#xD;
      have not fractured a hip may be useful if applied to persons following hip fracture. Exercise&#xD;
      is one of the strategies that have received considerable attention. Exercise training in&#xD;
      older adults also has beneficial effects on bone density, muscle strength, and physical&#xD;
      functioning, as well as cardiovascular fitness, and risk reduction for falls and fractures.&#xD;
      An exercise program that combines weight-bearing and resistance exercises can increase bone&#xD;
      mineral content in postmenopausal women. Little information is available on whether a&#xD;
      home-based exercise program can be used to achieve similar benefits compared to a more&#xD;
      structured, on-site exercise program. This issue is particularly relevant in older, frail&#xD;
      women who have sustained a hip fracture because many are unable and unwilling to travel to&#xD;
      exercise facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the studies of exercise are instructive of potential benefits for older persons&#xD;
      following hip fracture. Most of the work to date has been restricted to relatively healthy,&#xD;
      select samples of older persons who have been recruited into rigorously controlled randomized&#xD;
      experiments. Hence, while they are efficacious in benefiting a select group of older persons,&#xD;
      it is not known whether these interventions will be accepted by a frail older population&#xD;
      which has become suddenly disabled by a hip fracture, nor is it known whether these&#xD;
      interventions will be beneficial to this group which is losing bone, muscle and function at&#xD;
      an accelerated rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because losses in BMD following hip fracture place these women at greater rise of subsequent&#xD;
      fracture and may delay or prevent full recovery of ambulatory ability, it is important to&#xD;
      optimize fracture healing and prevent loss of bone. One therapeutic option for these patients&#xD;
      that may be effective is to increase physical activity through exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these profound losses in function, bone, and muscle, we remain uncertain about the&#xD;
      extent to which these losses can be attributed to the fracture, and only limited attention&#xD;
      has been given to preventing such losses. In addition, we seek to understand the role of&#xD;
      exercise in relation to bone metabolism and levels of hormones thought to regulate bone&#xD;
      metabolism following a hip fracture. Elucidating these mechanisms will be valuable for&#xD;
      understanding the effects of exercise on bone health. The purpose of this study is to take an&#xD;
      intervention known to be beneficial in select populations, into the real world setting and&#xD;
      apply to frail older persons who have become suddenly disabled by a hip fracture. It is&#xD;
      essential to test the effectiveness of the intervention following a hip fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With a waiver for authorization obtained at each hospital, the study nurse will do a chart&#xD;
      review of hip fracture patients to determine study eligibility and then explain the study to&#xD;
      the potential participant, obtain consent, and get baseline study measures within fifteen&#xD;
      days of fracture. The project coordinator will notify the exercise trainers of which&#xD;
      participants have been randomized to the treatment group, and the trainer will set up the&#xD;
      first home visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the baseline interview the participant will be assigned to one of two study&#xD;
      groups. One group is the treatment group and one involves no treatment and are followed as&#xD;
      usual care. Those assigned to the treatment group will be visited by an exercise trainer who&#xD;
      will visit the participant three times a week for the first two months of the study, two&#xD;
      times per week during months three and four, one time per week during months five and six,&#xD;
      two times a month during months seven and eight, and one time a month during months nine&#xD;
      through twelve. During months seven through twelve of the study the trainer will contact the&#xD;
      participant by telephone once each week during the weeks that he or she does not go the&#xD;
      participants' home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up interviews, performance assessment, DEXA scans, ultrasound measurements (only for&#xD;
      34 participants) and blood draws will be done at two, six and twelve months following hip&#xD;
      fracture. The baseline and follow-up interviews will last approximately two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NON-HIP FRACTURE COMPARISON. Bone loss that occurs in older women is believed to result from&#xD;
      uncoupling of bone remodeling. Despite the loss of BMD with aging, the cellular mechanisms&#xD;
      for fracture healing appear to remain intact. Fracture healing can be divided into three&#xD;
      phases: inflammatory, reparative, and remodeling. The first two phases are dependent&#xD;
      primarily on the local trauma effects of the fracture and are completed within approximately&#xD;
      five weeks; hence, exercise intervention would be expected to have little or no effect on&#xD;
      these processes. The remainder of the approximately six-month duration of femoral neck&#xD;
      fracture healing involves modeling and remodeling of the callus. Because skeletal loading may&#xD;
      modulate remodeling, exercise should have an effect during this period. Even after completion&#xD;
      of healing, mechanical factors are expected to continue to affect remodeling of the femur.&#xD;
      Bone resorption, mediated by osteoclastic activity, is the first phase of a remodeling cycle.&#xD;
      In the post-fracture context, in which both fracture debris removal and callus remodeling are&#xD;
      ongoing, high levels of markers of resorption would be anticipated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will attempt to separate out the effects of hip fracture on bone turnover from those of&#xD;
      aging in persons with low bone mineral density. Bone turnover of hip fracture patients&#xD;
      receiving usual care will be compared to bone turnover in a similar group of women who have&#xD;
      not fractured their hips (i.e., matched on age, ability to ambulate independently, and with&#xD;
      low BMD).&#xD;
