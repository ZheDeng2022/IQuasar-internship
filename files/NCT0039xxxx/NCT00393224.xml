  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In an effort to identify genetic factors linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer&#xD;
      (NPC), the researchers identified and sampled 2,394 individuals from Taiwanese families in&#xD;
      which two or more relatives had been diagnosed with NPC. Serum from these individuals was&#xD;
      tested for three anti-Epstein-Barr virus (EPV) antibodies associated with elevated risk of&#xD;
      NPC. Results indicate that apparently healthy individuals from high-risk families have a&#xD;
      nearly threefold elevation in their EBV antibody prevalence compared with the general&#xD;
      population. However, the clinical implications of this finding are not yet understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify the implications, the 2,394 unaffected individuals from the multiplex family study&#xD;
      will be invited to participate in the current study. Approximately 1,600 individuals are&#xD;
      expected to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an ear, nose, and throat examination to determine if they have occult&#xD;
      or symptomatic NPC. Their levels of EBV antibody at the time of initial recruitment will be&#xD;
      correlated with NPC detection in the period between initial recruitment and the present&#xD;
      study. Participants will also be asked to complete a brief risk factor questionnaire and to&#xD;
      donate blood, saliva, a nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal tissue, and urine for future&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, no accepted clinical management protocol exists for screening unaffected members&#xD;
      from families at high risk of NPC development. Results from this study have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly impact the clinical management and follow-up of individuals with a family&#xD;
      history of NPC.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this proposed study is to evaluate the clinical utility of serum EBV antibody&#xD;
      testing for the identification of individuals at increased risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
      (NPC) within high-risk, NPC multiplex families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2,394 unaffected individuals from Taiwanese families, in which two or more relatives have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with NPC, have been identified and sampled as part of an ongoing collaboration&#xD;
      to identify genetic factors linked to NPC development. Serum from these individuals has been&#xD;
      tested for three anti-EBV antibodies (VCA IgA, EBNA1 IgA, and anti-DNase) known to be&#xD;
      associated with elevated risk of prevalent and incident NPC in general population studies.&#xD;
      Results from testing of our study population indicate that apparently healthy individuals&#xD;
      from high-risk multiplex families have a near 3-fold elevation in their EBV antibody&#xD;
      prevalence when compared to the EBV antibody prevalence observed in the general community for&#xD;
      these same EBV markers. However, the clinical implications of this apparent elevation in EBV&#xD;
      antibody reactivity are not yet understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we propose to evaluate whether individuals within our previously conducted&#xD;
      high-risk family study with elevations in EBV antibody levels are at increased risk of&#xD;
      incident NPC. Individual markers (VCA IgA, EBNIA1 IgA and anti-DNase antibodies) and&#xD;
      combinations of markers will be evaluated to determine their performance as screening tests&#xD;
      for NPC risk in high-risk multiplex families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this goal, we propose to invite the 2,394 unaffected individuals from our&#xD;
      multiplex family study, defined as those families with greater than or equal to 2 NPC. As a&#xD;
      result of our recruitment efforts, we expect approximately 1,600 subjects to participate in&#xD;
      an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) examination by an expert otolaryngologist to determine whether&#xD;
      any of these individuals has occult or symptomatic NPC. We will correlate the three EBV&#xD;
      antibody screening tests performed at the time of initial recruitment into our family study&#xD;
      with NPC detection in the period between initial recruitment into the family study and the&#xD;
      present study (median time between original EBV antibody testing and clinical evaluation =&#xD;
      5.5 years; range = less than 1 year - 10 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to histopathological specimens collected for NPC diagnosis, participants in this&#xD;
      study will be asked to agree to a brief risk factor questionnaire and to donate blood,&#xD;
      saliva, a nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal tissue, and urine for future studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No accepted clinical management protocol exists for screening unaffected members from&#xD;
      families at high-risk of NPC development. Results from this study have the potential to&#xD;
      significantly impact the clinical management and follow-up of individuals with a family&#xD;
      history of NPC.&#xD;
