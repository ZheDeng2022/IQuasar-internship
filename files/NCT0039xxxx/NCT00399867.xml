  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In vitro statins, inhibitors of the HMG-CoA-reductase, have been shown to overcome cell&#xD;
      adhesion mediated drug resistance at very low concentrations. The purpose of the study is to&#xD;
      investigate the in vivo efficacy of simvastatin as inhibitor of cell adhesion mediated drug&#xD;
      resistance. Patients refractory to ongoing chemotherapy will receive concomitantly&#xD;
      simvastatin and response will be monitored by paraprotein levels&#xD;

      Multiple Myeloma (MM) is an incurable haematological neoplasm that is characterized by&#xD;
      homing, survival, and proliferation of malignant, antibody producing plasma cells in the bone&#xD;
      marrow. All clinically relevant symptoms (cytopenia, hyperproteinemia and proteinuria with&#xD;
      renal insufficiency, hypercalcemia, osteolysis) are due to the aggressive infiltration of the&#xD;
      whole bone marrow by MM cells, while all other solid and lymphoid organs including the&#xD;
      peripheral blood are normally spared. From these clinical observations and from many&#xD;
      preclinical studies it is evident that adhesion of MM cells to the bone marrow cells&#xD;
      characterizes the biology of this disease. Adhesion of MM cells leads to the secretion of&#xD;
      stimulatory cytokines,upregulation of adhesion molecules, proliferation of MM cells, and drug&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statins, like simvastatin, inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)&#xD;
      reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Interestingly, in MM&#xD;
      models statins induce apoptosis, inhibit proliferation, overcome primary and secondary drug&#xD;
      resistance, and synergize with cytotoxic drugs. Oligonucleotide microarray analyses&#xD;
      demonstrated that de novo and acquired drug resistance are associated with an increase of&#xD;
      HMG-CoA reductase gene expression. We have shown before that adhesion of MM cells to bone&#xD;
      marrow stromal cells mediates strong multidrug resistance and that this can be overcome by&#xD;
      co-treatment with simvastatin in non-toxic concentrations. Interestingly, statin induced&#xD;
      apoptosis in MM cells is not hampered by adhesion to bone marrow stromal cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based upon these comprehensive preclinical findings clinical trials to investigate the&#xD;
      in-vivo antimyeloma activity of statins are urgently needed. Our in vitro studies&#xD;
      demonstrated that inhibition of cell adhesion mediated drug resistance by simvastatin is&#xD;
      possible at low concentrations of about 1ÂµM. We therefore suggested that cell adhesion&#xD;
      mediated drug resistance can be treated with approved doses of simvastatin (80mg daily).&#xD;
      Consequently we initiate a pilot phase II trial to investigate feasibility and clinical&#xD;
      effects of simvastatin concomitantly with chemotherapy as preparation for a randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the primary goal is to prove the hypothesis that simvastatin can overcome drug resistance&#xD;
      in vivo only patients not responding to chemotherapy will be included. Chemotherapy is&#xD;
      defined as bortezomib and bendamustin, as both are effective and approved drugs in the&#xD;
      therapy of relapsed myeloma. Further inclusion criteria are age over 18 years, proven MM&#xD;
      (serum protein below 11g/dl, life expectancy &gt; 3 months) and treatment indication with&#xD;
      measurable paraprotein. In the case of no change (paraprotein increase less than 25% and&#xD;
      paraprotein decline less than 50%) after two cycles of bortezomib (one cycle: 1.3 mg/m2&#xD;
      d1,4,8,11) or bendamustin (one cycle: 100 mg/m2 d1+2) the patients will receive two further&#xD;
      cycles with concomitant simvastatin treatment (80 mg daily starting two days before&#xD;
      chemotherapy and stopping two days after chemotherapy). Exclusion criteria are severe organ&#xD;
      failure and risk factors for rhabdomyolysis (untreated hypothyroidism, active liver disease,&#xD;
      terminal renal insufficiency, acute infectious disease, myopathy, heriditary myopathy in the&#xD;
      family history, alcohol abuse, comedication with itraconazole, ketoconazole, erythromycin,&#xD;
      clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors, nefazodone, cyclosporine, fibrates, niacin,&#xD;
      amiodarone, verapamil).&#xD;
