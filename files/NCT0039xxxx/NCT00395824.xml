  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis causes contact activation of the coagulation pathway (1). For this reason,&#xD;
      unfractionated or low molecular weight heparins are administered in daily practice to prevent&#xD;
      thrombosis of the dialyzer and blood circuit, but the dose commonly used causes systemic&#xD;
      anticoagulation. This can cause serious complications in patients with high risk of bleeding.&#xD;
      Regional and low-dose heparinization, use of prostacycline, regional citrate anticoagulation&#xD;
      (RCA), and high-flow-rate hemodialysis without anticoagulation have been shown to reduce&#xD;
      bleeding complications. Each of these methods, however, is characterized by its own technical&#xD;
      difficulties, limitations, or complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of heparin-coated&#xD;
      polyacrylonitrile membranes (AN69ST) and regional citrate anticoagulation in hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients at risk of bleeding&#xD;

      1. Open label single centre prospective randomized trial including 33 patients aged over 18&#xD;
           years with chronic kidney disease stage 5 requiring intermittent hemodialysis at the&#xD;
           University Hospital Leuven and at risk of bleeding. Exclusion criteria were: any&#xD;
           haemostatic disorder favouring either bleeding or clotting, anti-vitamin K or heparin&#xD;
           treatment, heparin induced thrombocytopenia and haemodynamic instability. Written&#xD;
           informed consent before enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Random allocation (by sealed enveloppe) to RCA with a calcium free dialysate (RCA-Ca0),&#xD;
           RCA with a calcium containing dialysate (RCA-Ca1,5) or to anticoagulant-free hemodiaysis&#xD;
           with a heparin-coated polyacrylonitrile membrane (Nephral 300STÂ®).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. At the end of each dialysis session, arterial and venous drip chambers and the filter&#xD;
           will be inspected for visible signs of coagulation. Corresponding to the standard care&#xD;
           at our dialysis unit, a semi-quantitative score with a range from 0 (no signs of&#xD;
           clotting) to 4 (complete occlusion) will be used for evaluation of the dialyzer. By&#xD;
           definition, the drip chamber will be considered clotted when a thrombus was visible&#xD;
           after the rinse back procedure. A fibrin ring against the wall of the drip chamber will&#xD;
           be considered normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood samples for assessment of prothrombin fragment F1+2 and d-dimers will be collected&#xD;
           from the inlet blood catheter prior to hemodialysis initiation and during hemodialysis&#xD;
           at T15, T120 and T238.&#xD;
