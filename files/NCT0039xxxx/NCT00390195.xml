  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mTOR has been examined in hepatocellular carcinomas as well. This pathway is up-regulated&#xD;
      in a proportion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and that rapamycin inhibits cell&#xD;
      proliferation and blocks S6K phosphorylation. Inhibition of mTOR had been shown to suppress&#xD;
      substantially the liver tumor growth. Nevertheless, inhibition of mTOR was demonstrated to&#xD;
      have a clinical response in some cancer types. These reports imply that inhibition of mTOR&#xD;
      could be a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of HCC. Therefore, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that RAD001, a rapamycin analog, can inhibit the mTOR, and subsequently suppress the liver&#xD;
      tumor in the treatment of HCC patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is aimed to investigate the safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacogenetics&#xD;
      and feasibility of RAD001 in advanced HCC patients. This study will be a randomized phase I&#xD;
      study with dose escalation and subsequently a phase II study of intent to treat, as well as&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic and surrogate marker study of RAD001.&#xD;

                  3. Pharmacogenetic study&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Surrogate marker study on the PTEN, total and Phosphorylated forms of Akt of&#xD;
                     tumor tissues&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This study will be a randomized phase I study with dose escalation and&#xD;
      subsequently a phase II study of intent to treat, as well as pharmacokinetic, pharmacogenetic&#xD;
      and surrogate marker study of RAD001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Upto 134 patients (Phase I: in cohort of 3-6 to test each dose level and a upto&#xD;
      48 patients to reach the expected MTD, 24 patients in each schedule of treatment arm; Phase&#xD;
      II: 18 patients of each schedule at the first stage and 25 patients of each schedule at the&#xD;
      second stage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication: The RAD001 dose level of daily schedule will be escalated from 2.5, 5.0,&#xD;
      7.5 to 10 mg/day without splitting, with or without food. The RAD001 dose level of weekly&#xD;
      schedule will be escalated from 20, 30, 50 to 70 mg/week without splitting. The dose and&#xD;
      schedule of RAD001 in the phase II study will be dependent on the result of phase I study.&#xD;
      RAD001 will be supplied by Novartis Co.,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Conduct: Patients will be enrolled onto a sequence of receiving an oral dose of RAD001.&#xD;
      The schedule of RAD001 will be either once daily or once weekly. Throughout the whole phase I&#xD;
      and II study, an eligible patient will be randomized into either arm of daily or weekly&#xD;
      schedule. In the phase I part, each cohort of dose level will have 3 patients. The dose of&#xD;
      oral RAD001 will be initially fixed at 2.5 gm/day in daily schedule arm and at 20 mg/week in&#xD;
      weekly schedule arm. One treatment course is defined as 4 weeks of RAD001 therapy. When no&#xD;
      patient experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at certain level, subsequent patients would&#xD;
      be randomized to the next dose level. When 1 out of 3 patients developed DLT, 3 additional&#xD;
      patients would be treated with the same dose level. Three patients will be further recruited&#xD;
      to the next dose level when none of that 3 additional patients experience DLT. No&#xD;
      intra-individual dose-escalation will be performed. In the phase II part, Simon's optimal&#xD;
      two-stage approach will be used in both daily and weekly schedules. If one responder is&#xD;
      observed at the first stage of eighteen patients in either treatment schedule, further&#xD;
      twenty-five patients will be accrued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic Assessment：&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Radiological response: To evaluate the disease control rate (complete response +&#xD;
                partial response + stable disease) by computed tomography after every 8 weeks of&#xD;
                therapy and according to RECIST guideline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Biological response&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. To evaluate the change of serum a-fetoprotein level.&#xD;

                common toxicity criteria (CTC) version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Abnormal liver functional tests are common in patients with HCC, only abnormal&#xD;
                elevation of ALT will be considered as indicator of hepatotoxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacogenetic &amp; Surrogate Marker Assessments&#xD;

&#xD;
                  3. Cmin: trough concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Cave: average concentration&#xD;
&#xD;
                  5. AUCt: area under curve within a given time&#xD;
&#xD;
                  6. t1/2: elimination half life&#xD;

                  2. Total and Phosphorylated forms of Akt&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening will be done within 2 weeks before starting treatment, and will include all&#xD;
           parameters listed below, (except for pharmacokinetics, AEs/concomitant medications, and&#xD;
           toxicity assessments) as well as informed consent, patient eligibility, medical history,&#xD;
           a pregnancy test (if indicated), EKG, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. During treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Physical examination (including vital sign measurements), height, weight, AEs, and&#xD;
                toxicity evaluation at the first day of each week during the initial 4 weeks,&#xD;
                biweekly at the subsequently 8 weeks and 4-weekly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Performance status will be assessed on the first day of each treatment course.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigators/research nurses should monitor patients in each treatment course and&#xD;
                should instruct patients regarding the signs and symptoms of RAD001 toxicity as&#xD;
                described in the &quot;Information for Patients&quot; section of the RAD001 product labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The laboratory tests, hemogram, clinical chemistry will be conducted weekly at the&#xD;
                first 4 weeks, biweekly at the subsequent 8 weeks and 4- weekly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Imaging studies for tumor response will be performed every 2 courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient clinical and biological responses will be noted at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: No formal inferential statistical analyses will be performed. Data will&#xD;
      be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of patients, mean, median, standard&#xD;
      deviation, minimum, and maximum) for continuous variables and using frequency and percentage&#xD;
      for discrete variables. For the safety analyses, data will be presented for all patients. An&#xD;
      accounting of the study patients by disposition will be tabulated. Demographic data (e.g.,&#xD;
      age, gender), medical history, cancer history, and other baseline characteristics will be&#xD;
      summarized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety Evaluation: The general safety and tolerability of RAD001 will be assessed using&#xD;
           the following safety endpoints: AEs, routine clinical laboratory evaluations (hemogram,&#xD;
           serum chemistry, and urinalysis), physical examination, concomitant medications, and&#xD;
           Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. The grade of AEs at the&#xD;
           time of rescue as determined from the NCI-CTC version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pharmacokinetic Analysis: Pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined from plasma drug&#xD;
           and metabolite concentration curves using non- compartmental approaches. Mean (SD)&#xD;
           plasma drug concentration values will be summarized and plotted for each dose group. All&#xD;
           parameters described will be summarized with means and standard deviations. The&#xD;
           concentration in plasma determined at each sampling time point will be furnished on the&#xD;
           original scale for each subject participating in the study. The pharmacokinetic&#xD;
           parameters Cmax, Cmin, Cave, and AUC will be analyzed on the logarithmic scale of&#xD;
           measurement. The parameters of elimination half- life and tmax will be analyzed on the&#xD;
           original scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Efficacy Analysis: The efficacious parameters will be determined by mean of disease&#xD;
           control rate and median of time to tumor progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS)&#xD;
           using Kaplan-Meier method. The efficacious parameters will be added with 95% confidence&#xD;
           interval. All calculations will be based on the intent-to-treat principle.&#xD;
