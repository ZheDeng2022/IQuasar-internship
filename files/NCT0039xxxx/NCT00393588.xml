      This study will test the ability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to detect damage in&#xD;
      different parts of the brain in patients with multiple sclerosis and to see if cognitive&#xD;
      problems in patients can be correlated with the presence of lesions or reduction in the size&#xD;
      of certain part of the brain. Healthy subjects will also be studied to compare findings in&#xD;
      patients with those of normal volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy subjects and patients with multiple sclerosis who are between 18 and 60 years of age&#xD;
      may be eligible for this study. Patients must not have severe clinical disability and must&#xD;
      have been receiving and responding to Interferon beta for at least 6 months prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, MRI and&#xD;
      possibly evoked potential testing, which measures the nervous system response to visual,&#xD;
      auditory and somatosensory stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants have two MRI scans within 1 week (inclusive of the one performed for screening).&#xD;
      MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to obtain images of body tissues and organs. The&#xD;
      scanner is a metal cylinder surrounded by a strong magnetic field. During the MRI, the&#xD;
      subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. Participants will be&#xD;
      tested with magnet strengths of 1.5 and 3 Tesla; the higher the Tesla, the greater the&#xD;
      ability to see brain changes. Each scan may last up to 90 minutes. In addition to the MRI&#xD;
      scans, participants undergo cognitive testing that measures memory and thought processes and&#xD;
      complete forms that test and quantify fatigue level, stress, anxiety and depression&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: The study will evaluate cognitive impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      (MS) and correlate the degree of cognitive dysfunction as identified by scores obtained in&#xD;
      multiple cognitive tests with measurements of cortical thickness, cortical lesions and white&#xD;
      matter disease on magnetic resonance imaging of brains of MS individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION: Study population will consist of 49 patients with relapsing remitting or&#xD;
      secondary progressive MS with superimposed relapses who have been treated with Interferon&#xD;
      beta at fully tolerated dosages for at least six months, and 49 healthy volunteers matched&#xD;
      for gender, age and educational level. We expect to screen 65 individuals per arm in order to&#xD;
      be able to enroll 49 individuals per arm, thus meeting the requirements of the sample size&#xD;
      calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: After screening clinical (rating disability by the means of the Expanded Disability&#xD;
      Status Scale [EDSS] score), neurophysiological (e.g. evoked potential tests) and imaging&#xD;
      examinations, MS patients and healthy subjects will undergo a neuropsychological evaluation&#xD;
      using the Minimal Assessment of Cognitive Function in Multiple Sclerosis (MACFIMS) and the&#xD;
      Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics (ANAM), and also a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). After 25% and after 50% of projected patients have been enrolled, distribution&#xD;
      in MACFIMS will be evaluated to ensure that a broad spectrum of cognitive ability is&#xD;
      represented. Cortical thickness, cortical lesions and white matter damage metrics (e.g.&#xD;
      lesion load, diffusion tensor and magnetization transfer MRI measures) will be computed. In&#xD;
      order to exclude the hypothesis that the presence of fatigue, anxiety and depression,&#xD;
      normally occurring in MS patients, might interfere with their cognitive performance, thus&#xD;
      acting as confounding factors, scales measuring fatigue and mental status will be&#xD;
      administered in all subjects. Scores obtained on these scales will be used as covariates in&#xD;
      each of the statistical analyses performed in the present study to account for their possible&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The first outcome measure will be the MACFIMS and cortical thickness&#xD;
      values. Correlation between these two metrics will be initially performed. Secondly, cortical&#xD;
      lesions as well as white matter lesions on T1 and T2 weighted images, magnetization transfer&#xD;
      ratios and diffusion tensor imaging metrics of lesional and normal appearing brain tissues&#xD;
      will be computed and their impact in determining cognitive impairment will be determined.&#xD;
      Thirdly, deep gray matter, white matter and total brain volume measures will be computed and&#xD;
      correlated with cognitive function measured by the MACFIMS. Similarly, correlations between&#xD;
      clinical disability, as measured by the EDSS score and cognitive impairment, as well as&#xD;
      between EDSS score and each of the RMI variables explored in the study will be performed.&#xD;
      Finally, the level of correlation between MACFIMS and ANAM tests will be investigated.&#xD;
