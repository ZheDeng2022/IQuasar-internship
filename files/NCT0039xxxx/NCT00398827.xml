  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dexmedetomidine as&#xD;
      compared to placebo when used for the sedation of subjects requiring monitored anesthesia&#xD;
      care (MAC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) is a specific anesthesia service that involves an&#xD;
      anesthesiologist administering sedatives and analgesics to a patient while monitoring his/her&#xD;
      vital signs. MAC is often used to supplement local and regional anesthesia for non-intubated&#xD;
      patients undergoing non-invasive procedures and minor surgery. The goal of MAC is to relieve&#xD;
      anxiety by inducing a minimally depressed level of consciousness while the patient is able to&#xD;
      continuously and independently maintain a patent airway and to respond appropriately to&#xD;
      verbal commands.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Respiratory depression is the major concern with most of the medications (midazolam,&#xD;
      fentanyl, propofol) currently used for MAC. There is clearly an unmet need for a sedative&#xD;
      agent that can safely be used during MAC in both healthy and high risk populations with&#xD;
      limited adverse side effects. A medication that can attenuate anxiety and the stress response&#xD;
      associated with surgery and procedures without causing respiratory depression is highly&#xD;
      desirable. A medication that reduces the total amount of opioids administered during a&#xD;
      procedure could substantially reduce complications. Such a medication could be used either&#xD;
      alone or in combination with other agents, thereby reducing the dose and side effects of the&#xD;
      other agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX) has sympatholytic, sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects that&#xD;
      attenuate the catecholamine response to perioperative stress. DEX has not been associated&#xD;
      with respiratory depression when used alone, despite sometimes deep levels of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An estimated 325 patients (260 DEX, 65 PBO) requiring MAC sedation for an elective&#xD;
      surgery/procedure will be randomized at approximately 25 investigative sites.&#xD;
