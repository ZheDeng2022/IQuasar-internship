  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the injection of HER2/neu DNA is safe and&#xD;
      stimulates an immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immune system consists of different kinds of cells and substances which help fight&#xD;
      against infections and inflammation in the body. These antibodies and T-cells are part of the&#xD;
      immune system that may also help to fight against tumor cells. One way to make antibodies and&#xD;
      stimulate T-cells is to inject the patient with a preparation which contains material that&#xD;
      may stimulate the immune system. This process is called an immunization. We are trying to&#xD;
      immunize the patient against HER2/neu. In order to participate in this trial, the tumor must&#xD;
      have a large amount of HER2/neu on its surface. The injection that the patient will receive&#xD;
      in this trial is a piece of DNA made in bacteria which contains the gene for rat HER2. DNA is&#xD;
      material which contains the information needed to produce many substances in the body. The&#xD;
      HER2 gene encodes for a protein known as HER2.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Breast cancer patients with AJCC Stage III or metastatic (AJCC Stage IV) disease that&#xD;
        over-express HER2 will potentially be eligible for this trial. Patients may have measurable&#xD;
        disease, evaluable disease or be without evidence of disease. They may be receiving&#xD;
        hormonal therapy and they may have already received trastuzumab (Herceptin) or be receiving&#xD;
        trastuzumab during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have ALL of the features listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AJCC Stage IV breast cancer (histologically confirmed) with no evidence of disease or&#xD;
             stable disease. Patients may be either off therapy or on hormone therapy and/or&#xD;
             trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OR AJCC Stage III breast cancer &lt; or = to 36 months post completion of adjuvant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathology slides must be reviewed by the Department of Pathology at MSKCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2 over-expression by FISH or by staining 3+ on immunohistochemistry in either the&#xD;
             primary or metastatic tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; or = to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from the toxicity of any prior therapy, and not received&#xD;
             major surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy for at least 4 weeks prior to entry&#xD;
             into the trial. (Ongoing hormonal therapy and/or trastuzumab administration is&#xD;
             permitted.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt; 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (Women of child bearing potential must not be pregnant and have a normal&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks of starting treatment.) Woman who may yet bear children&#xD;
             and sexually active men must be using appropriate contraception during the course of&#xD;
             this study. Patients must be counseled not to become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
             Patients must also be counseled that injection of HER2 may have unknown affects on the&#xD;
             viability of a future fetus.&#xD;
