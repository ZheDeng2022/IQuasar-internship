  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that episodic amiodarone treatment (i.e. amiodarone treatment 1 month prior&#xD;
      until 1 month after cardioversion) is associated with a lower morbidity and a higher quality&#xD;
      of life compared to continuous prophylactic amiodarone treatment while atrial fibrillation is&#xD;
      still effectively suppressed. The latter means that at the end of the study permanent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is prevented in comparable percentage of patients (70%) in both treatment&#xD;
      strategies. However, this will be accomplished at the cost of a higher number of electrical&#xD;
      cardioversions (2-3) in the episodic treatment group compared to the continuous treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine differences in adverse event rates between patients with persistent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation who are randomized to episodic amiodarone treatment (EAT) strategy and patients&#xD;
      who are randomized to continuous amiodarone treatment (CAT) strategy, while atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is still effectively suppressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events can be related to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. amiodarone use&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. atrial fibrillation itself or underlying heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine differences in quality of life between patients with persistent atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation who are randomized to the EAT strategy and patients who are randomized to the&#xD;
      CAT strategy.&#xD;

        Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Symptomatic persistent atrial fibrillation for at least 48 hours- 1 year (present&#xD;
             episode).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Older than 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ventricular rate during AF &gt; 75 beats per minute, documented on rest-ECG without rate&#xD;
             control.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least two weeks of oral anticoagulation therapy before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Contra indications for amiodarone (severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or QTc&#xD;
             &gt; 440ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of relapse of AF during adequate amiodarone treatment (i.e. adequate&#xD;
             amiodarone and desethylamiodarone plasma levels).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Concomitant treatment with class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs. Amiodarone should not&#xD;
             have been used during the last 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Other (non) cardiac QT prolonging drugs (if not possible to discontinue).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. First episode of persistent atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. More than three relapses of persistent atrial fibrillation necessitating electrical&#xD;
             cardioversion during the last three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Known sick sinus syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of second or third degree AV conduction disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Intraventricular conduction disturbances (QRS&gt; 140ms).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pacemaker treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Hemodynamically significant valvular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with heart failure with symptoms according to NYHA class III or IV.&#xD;

&#xD;
         14. Recent myocardial infarction (&lt; 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. PTCA, CABG, other cardiac surgery or major non-cardiac surgery within the last three&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. History of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Serious pulmonary, hepatic, haematological, metabolic, renal, gastrointestinal, CNS or&#xD;
             psychiatric disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Pregnant and non-pregnant women who are pre-menopausal and are not practising an&#xD;
             acceptable method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Treatment with any other investigational agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Presence of any disease that is likely to shorten life expectancy to &lt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;

             of efficacy or safety or be associated with poor adherence to the protocol.&#xD;
