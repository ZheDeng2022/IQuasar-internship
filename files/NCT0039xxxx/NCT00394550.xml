  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study of the effect of treating laryngomalacia (floppiness of tissue on&#xD;
      top of the voice box that can possibly block breathing) found in association with obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnea (blockage of breathing while sleeping).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine which is the best treatment for children with&#xD;
      obstructive sleep apnea and laryngomalacia: adenotonsillectomy alone or adenotonsillectomy&#xD;
      with laser supraglottoplasty (removal of tissue on top of the voice box to open the airway).&#xD;

      If you agree to have your child be in the study, you will do the following things:&#xD;
&#xD;
      you are consenting to your child having the adenoid (tissue similar to lymph nodes, found in&#xD;
      the back of the throat) and tonsils removed (if not previously performed), direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy (looking in the throat) and bronchoscopy (inspection of the lungs with a long&#xD;
      tube-like device down the throat), and randomization (½ will be treated further, ½ will be&#xD;
      observed) into treatment and no-treatment arms if your child is diagnosed with&#xD;
      laryngomalacia. After starting general anesthesia (putting patient to sleep for procedure),&#xD;
      the surgeon will perform direct laryngoscopy (look at the throat and voice box) and&#xD;
      bronchoscopy (look at the entrance to the lungs [trachea or windpipe]). If your child is&#xD;
      diagnosed with laryngomalacia (flopping of the tissue around the voice box, potentially&#xD;
      causing obstruction or blockage), 50% will undergo a further treatment (laser&#xD;
      supraglottoplasty, or removal of tissue at the entrance of the voice box) and 50% will be&#xD;
      observed. The decision to treat or not treat will be random, as is customary for prospective&#xD;
      research trials. All children (both treatment arms will receive a 3 week treatment of a&#xD;
      medicine (a proton pump inhibitor) to reduce the level of stomach acid and prevent potential&#xD;
      exposure of the larynx (voice-box) to stomach acid. If your child does not have&#xD;
      laryngomalacia, no further treatment on the larynx (voice-box) will be performed. Next,&#xD;
      adenotonsillectomy will be performed as is common for the Otolaryngologist performing the&#xD;
      procedure. Postoperatively, a sleep study will be performed (identical to the preoperative&#xD;
      study) ideally 3-6 months after surgery, (but up to one year after) to monitor your child's&#xD;
      progress. Additional laboratory tests or drawing of blood is not routine in this procedure,&#xD;
      but may be performed as dictated by your child's medical conditions.&#xD;
