  <brief_summary>

      The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and tolerability of the fixed combination&#xD;
      beclomethasone/formoterol pMDI with that of fluticasone/salmeterol pMDI in patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe asthma&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic disease that is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the&#xD;
      U.S. and Europe (i.e. approximately 10% of the total population). Pharmacological therapy is&#xD;
      used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyper-reactivity. Medications&#xD;
      include preventive treatments in forms of antinflammatory/antiallergic agents (i.e.&#xD;
      glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, cromolyn sodium) and reliever treatments, in&#xD;
      form of bronchodilators (i.e. β-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics). In patients treated&#xD;
      with inhaled glucocorticosteroids whose asthma is not fully controlled, national and&#xD;
      international guidelines recommend a stepwise approach. Recent evidence-based clinical trials&#xD;
      show that the addition of a LABA to inhaled glucocorticosteroids is more beneficial in terms&#xD;
      of asthma control than increasing the dose of corticosteroids alone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe persistent asthma for at least 6 months,&#xD;
             according to GINA revised version 2002 guidelines (11):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Forced expiratory volume (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) ³ 50% and £&#xD;
                  80% of the predicted normal;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Asthma not adequately controlled with the current therapies, defined as presence&#xD;
                  of daily asthma symptoms &gt; once a week and night-time asthma symptoms &gt; twice a&#xD;
                  month, and daily use of short-acting β2-agonists. These findings are to be based&#xD;
                  on recent medical history and are to be confirmed in the 2-week run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with inhaled corticosteroids at a daily dose ≤ 1000 μg of BDP or equivalent.&#xD;
             The daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids taken at visit 1 will be assessed taking&#xD;
             into account the following ratios between the doses of the different steroids:&#xD;
             fluticasone propionate : BDP CFC = 1 : 2; budesonide : BDP CFC = 4 : 5; flunisolide :&#xD;
             BDP CFC = 1 : 1. The ratios between inhaled steroids are irrespective of the&#xD;
             formulations (i.e. spray aerosol or powder) used. When BDP is given in the new&#xD;
             extra-fine HFA-134a formulation (as QVAR®, 3M Healthcare), the ratio with BDP CFC is&#xD;
             set as 2 : 5. Therefore, the maximum allowed daily dose of inhaled corticosteroids at&#xD;
             study entry will be: budesonide 800 μg, fluticasone propionate 500 μg, flunisolide&#xD;
             1000 μg, BDP 1000 mg, BDP HFA extra-fine 400 μg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive response to the reversibility test in the screening visit, defined as an&#xD;
             increase of at least 12% (or, alternatively, of 200mL) from baseline value in the&#xD;
             measurement of FEV1 30 minutes following 2 puffs (2 ´ 100 µg) of inhaled salbutamol&#xD;
             administered via pMDI. The reversibility test can be avoided in patients having a&#xD;
             documented positive response in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A co-operative attitude and ability to be trained to correctly use the metered dose&#xD;

             a week, as well as of daily use of relief salbutamol is to be confirmed by reviewing&#xD;
