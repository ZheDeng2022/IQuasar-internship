      Hypothesis In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, malnutrition, inflammation and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease commonly coexist. The triad has been coined the &quot;MIA&#xD;
      syndrome&quot;. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), plays&#xD;
      a central role in the pathogenesis of the MIA syndrome. Thalidomide selectively inhibits the&#xD;
      production of TNF-alpha and represents a valuable anti-cytokine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim To study the effect of thalidomide in attenuating or reversing malnutrition and&#xD;
      systemic inflammation in PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Double-blinded randomised prospective placebo control trial. Setting: Renal unit of a&#xD;
      university teaching hospital. Subjects: Sixty prevalent PD patients with evidence of&#xD;
      malnutrition. Interventions: Patients will be randomised to receive either oral thalidomide&#xD;
      100 mg nocte or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: Patients will be followed for 1 year. Nutritional parameters including&#xD;
      serum albumin, subjective global assessment, malnutrition-inflammation score, normalised&#xD;
      protein nitrogen appearance, fat-free edema-free body mass and anthropometry measurements&#xD;
      will be monitored. Systemic inflammatory markers such as serum C-reactive protein and IL-6&#xD;
      will be assayed. Hospitalisation, cardiovascular events, and overall patient survival will&#xD;
      also be compared during study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutritional parameters and markers of systemic inflammation are expected to improve with&#xD;
      thalidomide therapy. The magnitude of improvement in nutrition, as well as patient morbidity,&#xD;
      will be compared with placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Hong Kong, 80% of end-stage renal failure patients are treated with PD. Malnutrition,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and systemic inflammatory response are all common in our clinical&#xD;
      practice. They are major causes of patient morbidity and mortality. As a readily available&#xD;
      anti-cytokine therapy, thalidomide may represent a valuable treatment of the MIA syndrome.&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide important insight on the clinical benefit of thalidomide&#xD;
      treatment in malnourished PD patients, which accounts for about one-third of our dialysis&#xD;
      population.&#xD;

      Overall study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center randomized placebo control study on 60 prevalent PD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment phase will take up to 12 months, and the study phase will be 1 year. Study code&#xD;
      will only be revealed at the end of the study period or if patients develop serious adverse&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized prospective study will be performed in 60 stable PD patients. Recruitment&#xD;
      criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. clinically stable adult patients (18 to 80 years old) on PD; and&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. evidence of malnutrition:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. overall subjective global assessment score &lt; 5; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. malnutrition inflammation score &gt; 9; or&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. serum albumin &lt; 35 g/L C. written patient informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria are:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients who are planned to have elective living donor transplant within 6 months&#xD;
           Patients who are planned to transfer to other renal center within 6 months High&#xD;
           likelihood of early withdrawal from the study (e.g. myocardial infarction, severe or&#xD;
           unstable coronary disease, stroke, severe liver disease within 3 months) Active&#xD;
           infection or systemic inflammatory disease. Current malignant disease Pregnancy or&#xD;
           breast-feeding Women of childbearing potential with unreliable birth control methods&#xD;
           Known hypersensitivity to thalidomide&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline data including age, sex, underlying renal disease, presence of diabetes,&#xD;
           hepatitis B status, requirement of helper for dialysis procedure, PD regimen and&#xD;
           duration on dialysis are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           After initial evaluation in a screening visit at -4 week, patients will be randomly&#xD;
           assigned to receive either oral thalidomide 100 mg nocte or placebo. Thalidomide will be&#xD;
           obtained from Penn Pharmaceuticals Ltd (Gwent, UK) as 100 mg tablets, and prescribed in&#xD;
           accordance with the published guidelines for the clinical use and dispensing of&#xD;
           thalidomide [34]. There will be 30 patients on each arm of randomization. Dialysis&#xD;
           prescription will be changed only if there is clinical evidence of underdialysis. Both&#xD;
           patients and investigators will be blinded from the therapy during follow up assessment.&#xD;
           Side effects will be recorded and the drug will be discontinued when clinically&#xD;
           necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be followed at at -4 (screening), 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44 and 52&#xD;
           weeks. The following clinical data will be documented during each visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Body height and body weight Blood pressure Compliance to thalidomide by pill count&#xD;
           Compliance to dialysis exchange by direct questioning Skin itchiness score from 0 to 3+,&#xD;
           as described previously [31]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Body-mass index and body surface area will be computed. The majority of patients will be&#xD;
           on three or four 2-liter exchanges per day. Blood pressure or edema are controlled with&#xD;
           standard anti-hypertensive agents and/or hypertonic dialysate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
           A full panel of biochemical parameters will be monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hemoglobin, plasma sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphate,&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, and alanine transaminase at -4, 0, 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 44&#xD;
           and 52 weeks Fasting serum glucose, lipid and iron profile at 0, 24 and 52 weeks Serum&#xD;
           parathyroid hormone at 0 and 52 weeks Serum inflammatory markers at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52&#xD;
           weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inflammatory markers include serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6),&#xD;
           leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and fibrinogen levels, as&#xD;
           suggested by other groups [35-38].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nutritional assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
           Nutritional status will assessed by subjective global assessment (SGA), comprehensive&#xD;
           malnutrition-inflammation score (MIS), normalized protein nitrogen appearance (NPNA),&#xD;
           serum albumin level, anthropometric lean body mass (LBM), and fat-free edema-free body&#xD;
           mass (FEBM).&#xD;
&#xD;
           SGA will be performed at -4, 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks by a single observer. The 4-item&#xD;
           7-point scoring system proposed by Enia et al [39] will be used. MIS will be performed&#xD;
           at -4, 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks. The calculation of MIS has been described previously&#xD;
           [40]. Briefly, MIS consists of 4 main parts and 10 components, all scored from 0&#xD;
           (normal) to 3 (very severe). The total score ranges from 0 to 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
           FEBM and PNA will be measured by creatinine kinetics at 0, 24 and 52 weeks. A 24-hour&#xD;
           dialysate and urine collections will be performed. Total and peritoneal Kt/V are&#xD;
           determined by standard methods. Residual GFR is calculated as average of 24-hour urinary&#xD;
           urea and creatinine clearance. FEBM is calculated according to the formula of Forbes and&#xD;
           Brunining [41]. PNA is derived from the Randerson's formula [42]. It is further&#xD;
           normalized to standard body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Anthropometric measurements will be performed at 0, 12, 24, 36 and 52 weeks by a single&#xD;
           observer. This include bicep, tricep, subscapular and supra-iliac skin fold thickness,&#xD;
           and midarm muscle circumference. Derived variables by anthropometric measurements,&#xD;
           including lean body mass (LBM) and percentage of body fat, will be computed by standard&#xD;
           formula [43].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pulse wave velocity&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pulse wave velocity (PWV), an index of aortic stiffness, is measured using an automatic&#xD;
           computerized recorder at 0, 24 and 52 weeks. The results will be analyzed by the&#xD;
           Complior SP program (Artech Medical, France). Briefly, pressure-sensitive transducers&#xD;
           are placed over the neck (carotid artery), wrist (radial artery) and groin (femoral&#xD;
           artery) with the patient in the supine position on day of haemodialysis treatment before&#xD;
           putting patient to the dialysis machine. PWV of the carotid-femoral and carotid-radial&#xD;
           territory is calculated by dividing the distance between the sensors by the time&#xD;
           corresponding to the period separating the start of the rising phase of the carotid&#xD;
           pulse wave and that of the femoral and also the radial pulse waves. The procedure takes&#xD;
           10 to15 seconds to complete. The test will be performed by the same observer to&#xD;
           eliminate effect of intra-observer variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Health-related quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patient acceptance and satisfaction will be assessed by the Chinese translation of&#xD;
           &quot;Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form (KDQOL-SFTM), version 1.3&quot;, at 0 and 52&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
           The major outcome measure is nutritional status, as detailed above. The schedule of&#xD;
           various tests is summarized in Appendix 2. Secondary outcomes include the followings:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Change in arterial pulse wave velocity Total number of days of hospital admission during&#xD;
           study period Composite cardiovascular end point: cardiovascular death, non-fatal&#xD;
           myocardial infarction or stroke, hospital admission for unstable angina, coronary&#xD;
           intervention, transient ischemic attack, or lower limb ischemia Number of episode of&#xD;
           peritonitis during study period All cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
           Transplantation, conversion to hemodialysis, recovery of renal function, and transfer&#xD;
           out of the unit will also be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Potential Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Hong Kong, 80% of end-stage renal failure patients are treated with peritoneal dialysis&#xD;
      (PD). In 2004, there were over 3000 PD patients in Hong Kong. Malnutrition, cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and systemic inflammatory state are all common in our clinical practice. They are&#xD;
      major causes of patient morbidity and mortality. The financial implication is considerable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a readily available anti-cytokine therapy, thalidomide may represent a valuable treatment&#xD;
      of the MIA syndrome. The proposed study will provide important insight on the clinical&#xD;
      benefit of thalidomide treatment in malnourished PD patients, which accounts for about&#xD;
      one-third of our dialysis population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed by SPSS for Windows software version 11.5 (SPSS Inc.,&#xD;
      Chicago, IL). All data will be expressed in mean +/- standard deviation unless otherwise&#xD;
      specified. Serial changes of nutritional parameters, dialysis adequacy, and inflammatory&#xD;
      markers will be compared to the baseline values by analysis of variance for multiple measures&#xD;
      (MANOVA). Serial change in residual GFR is examined by Wilcoxon's rank sum test with&#xD;
      Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparison because of skewed data. Nutritional status&#xD;
      and systemic inflammatory markers after one year will be compared between the 2 groups by&#xD;
      Student's t-test for parametric data. Hospitalization and peritonitis rate between the groups&#xD;
      are compared by Kruskal-Wallis test because the data will be highly skewed. Actuarial patient&#xD;
      survival will be compared by logrank test with Kaplan-Meier survival curves and treatment&#xD;
      group as stratifying variable.&#xD;
