      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. A bone marrow or&#xD;
      peripheral stem cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to replace&#xD;
      blood-forming cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. This may allow more chemotherapy to&#xD;
      be given so that more tumor cells are killed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase III trial is studying how well giving combination chemotherapy with or&#xD;
      without etoposide followed by an autologous stem cell transplant works in treating young&#xD;
      patients with previously untreated malignant brain tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 2-year event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of pediatric&#xD;
           patients with previously untreated nondisseminated medulloblastoma (&lt; 4 years of age),&#xD;
           disseminated medulloblastoma (&lt; 10 years of age), or noncerebellar primitive&#xD;
           neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) (disseminated or non-disseminated) treated with induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy followed by consolidation with myeloablative chemotherapy and autologous&#xD;
           hematopoietic stem cell rescue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the mortality of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the complete and partial response rates after completion of induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy in these patients stratified according to pathology (medulloblastoma vs&#xD;
           noncerebellar PNET vs high-grade gliomas vs atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors vs choroid&#xD;
           plexus carcinomas and atypical papillomas vs ependymomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the EFS and OS of these patients stratified according to additional diagnoses&#xD;
           (atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors vs choroid plexus carcinomas and atypical choroid&#xD;
           plexus papillomas vs ependymomas vs high-grade gliomas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the time to progression and patterns of relapse in these patients stratified by&#xD;
           diagnosis and radiotherapy received (&lt; 6 years of age with evidence of no residual tumor&#xD;
           pre-transplant and no post-transplant consolidation radiotherapy vs &lt; 6 years of age&#xD;
           with residual tumor present pre-transplant treated with post-transplant consolidation&#xD;
           radiotherapy vs &gt; 6 years of age treated with post-transplant consolidation&#xD;
           radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the neuropsychometric function, endocrinologic function, and physical growth&#xD;
           in these patients stratified according to radiotherapy received (none vs reduced-volume&#xD;
           craniospinal radiotherapy vs focused local-field radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to type of tumor (nonglial&#xD;
      vs glial and diffuse pontine).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Regimen C (patients with glial tumors):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stem cell harvesting (bone marrow and/or peripheral blood): Patients undergo&#xD;
                leukapheresis or bone marrow aspiration to collect bone marrow or peripheral blood&#xD;
                stem cells prior to beginning induction chemotherapy or after the first course of&#xD;
                induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Induction chemotherapy: Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of&#xD;
                courses 1-3, oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5, and carboplatin IV over 4&#xD;
                hours on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 6 and&#xD;
                continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4&#xD;
                courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unresectable bulky disease and corticosteroid dependence are removed from&#xD;
      study. All other patients proceed to consolidation chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation chemotherapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to&#xD;
           -6 and thiotepa IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo&#xD;
           reinfusion of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Patients also receive&#xD;
           G-CSF SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy: Beginning within 6 weeks after stem cell transplantation, patients &gt; 6&#xD;
           years of age at diagnosis undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 4-6 weeks in&#xD;
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients ≤ 6 years of age&#xD;
           undergo radiotherapy if there is evidence of tumor remaining after completion of&#xD;
           induction chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Regimen D2 (patients with nonglial tumors):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stem cell harvesting (bone marrow and/or peripheral blood): Patients undergo&#xD;
           leukapheresis or bone marrow aspiration to collect bone marrow or peripheral blood stem&#xD;
           cells prior to beginning induction chemotherapy or after the first course of induction&#xD;
           chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Induction chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Courses 1, 3, and 5 (28 days per course): Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6&#xD;
                hours on day 1, cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 2 hours on&#xD;
                days 2 and 3, high-dose methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 4, and filgrastim&#xD;
                (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts&#xD;
                recover. Patients also receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of courses 1 and&#xD;
                3.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Courses 2 and 4 (28 days per course): Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily&#xD;
                on days 1-5, oral etoposide once daily on days 1-10, cyclophosphamide IV over 1&#xD;
                hour on days 11 and 12, and G-CSF SC beginning on day 13 and continuing until blood&#xD;
                counts recover. Patients also receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 of course&#xD;
                2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with unresectable bulky disease and corticosteroid dependence are removed from&#xD;
      study. All other patients proceed to consolidation chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consolidation chemotherapy: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 4 hours on days -8 to&#xD;
           -6 and thiotepa IV over 3 hours and etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -5 to -3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation: Patients undergo&#xD;
           re-infusion of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Patients also&#xD;
           receive G-CSF SC beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy:Patients undergo radiotherapy as in regimen C. Patients in both regimens&#xD;
           undergo neuropsychological testing after induction chemotherapy but before consolidation&#xD;
           chemotherapy and then at 18, 36, and 54 months after completion of study treatment.&#xD;
           Neuropsychometric and neuroendocrine testing is performed before and after radiotherapy.&#xD;
           Quality of life is also assessed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
