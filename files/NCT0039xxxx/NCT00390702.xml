    <textblock>
      The Ventricular septal defect (VSD) is the most common of all congenital cardiac&#xD;
      malformations. By modifying the Nit-Occlud® PDA Device the Nit-Occlud® Lê VSD Spiral System&#xD;
      was designed. as a percutaneous, transcatheter device for occlusion of (peri)membranous and&#xD;
      muscular ventricular septum defects (VSD) with a spiral coil. In this clinical investigation&#xD;
      feasibility, safety and performance of the new cardiac occluder will be evaluated in&#xD;
      accordance with European and US regulations. The study data will be compared to performance&#xD;
      criteria for VSD, which are deduced analogue to the published specific Objective Performance&#xD;
      Criteria (OPCs) for PDAs. The first part of the study has been performed in three clinical&#xD;
      centres in Germany. For the second part in April 2009 four additional clinical centres in&#xD;
      Germany, Israel, Italy and Spain were included.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  VSD must be diagnosed by acknowledged methods, like echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signs of left ventricular volume overload are present (left ventricle or left atrium&#xD;
             diameters 2 standard deviations greater than normal) and/or measured by&#xD;
             catheterisation : Qp/Qs &gt; 1.5&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary vascular resistance is less than 4 Wood units&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is older than 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The VSD has a perimembranous or muscular location.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A distance between the rim of the VSD and the aortic annulus of at least 3.0 mm (as&#xD;
             measured on the 2-D echocardiography - apical 5-chamber view)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The minimal diameter (size) of the VSD is less than 8.0 mm (as measured on the 2-D&#xD;
             echocardiography - apical 5-chamber view)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must agree to fully participate in the clinical trial and give informed&#xD;
             consent in writing. If the patient is without legal ability additionally the person of&#xD;
             legal responsibility must agree and s/he must give the informed consent in writing&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pathological or physical condition precluding the implantation of a Nit-Occlud® Lê VSD&#xD;
        coil, such as :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  perimembranous VSD with no evidence of circular aneurysm formation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Associated cardiac anomalies requiring surgery (greater than mild aortic&#xD;
             insufficiency; such as aortic valve prolapse)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active endocarditis or other type of sepsis or other active infection at time of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Thrombus at or near the intended site of implantation&#xD;
&#xD;
