      This study will evaluate which parts of the brain are affected by treatment with behavioral&#xD;
      therapy versus medication therapy in people with post-traumatic stress disorder.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure&#xD;
      to a traumatic event. PTSD symptoms may include emotional numbness, loss of interest in&#xD;
      activities that were once enjoyable, irritability, and sleep problems. Medication therapy,&#xD;
      behavioral therapy, and a combination of both therapies are among the available treatment&#xD;
      options for people with PTSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talking therapy&#xD;
      that has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD, teaches patients how to alter their&#xD;
      thinking to, in turn, improve how they feel. A selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)&#xD;
      is a type of medication that has also been effective in treating PTSD. Information about the&#xD;
      comparative physiological effects of each of these treatments on people with PTSD is needed.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate which parts of the brain are affected by CBT treatment versus SSRI&#xD;
      treatment in people with PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with and without PTSD will be enrolled in this 12-week, open label study.&#xD;
      Following a screening visit to determine eligibility, participants with PTSD will be offered&#xD;
      a choice of either CBT or SSRI treatment. Those participants who choose CBT will attend 16&#xD;
      therapy sessions. The first phase of therapy will focus on the development of emotional and&#xD;
      interpersonal regulation skills. The second phase will use a modified form of prolonged&#xD;
      exposure therapy, which has been effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD. Participants who&#xD;
      elect to receive medication will take sertraline, an SSRI that has been safe and effective in&#xD;
      treating PTSD. These participants will attend 12 treatment sessions. Pre- and post-treatment&#xD;
      fear response will be assessed in all participants using fMRI scans to measure brain&#xD;
      responses and using saliva samples to test cortisol levels. All participants will also&#xD;
      self-administer saliva samples at various points during the 3 days prior to fMRI scanning.&#xD;
      Other outcomes will be assessed throughout the study using questionnaires.&#xD;
