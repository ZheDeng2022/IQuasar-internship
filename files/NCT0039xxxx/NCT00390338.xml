      RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's dendritic cells mixed with tumor peptides and&#xD;
      proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Infusing&#xD;
      the vaccine directly into the lymphatic system may cause a stronger immune response and kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of two&#xD;
      dendritic cell vaccines in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the safety of intralymphatic autologous type-1-polarized dendritic cell vaccine&#xD;
           vs autologous mature dendritic cell vaccine loaded with antigenic peptides and proteins&#xD;
           in patients with stage III or IV melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine peripheral blood CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell responses to HLA-presented melanoma&#xD;
           epitopes and autologous tumor cells using interferon gamma and interleukin-5 ELISPOT&#xD;
           assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to these regimens and DTH to&#xD;
           autologous tumor lysates in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the DTH response to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and pan-DR epitope (PADRE) in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate treatment-associated changes in immune response with clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients are randomized to&#xD;
      1 of 2 formulations of dendritic cell (DC) vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive intralymphatic autologous type-1-polarized (by&#xD;
           interleukin-1-beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF] alfa, interferon alfa, poly-I:C, and&#xD;
           interferon gamma) DC vaccine that has been loaded with tumor-related peptide antigens&#xD;
           (gp100:209-217[210M] peptide, tyrosinase peptide, MART-1:27-35 peptide, MAGE-3/6, and&#xD;
           EphA2) and proteins (keyhole limpet hemocyanin [KLH; first course] or pan-DR epitope&#xD;
           [PADRE] [second course]) every 6 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 1 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive intralymphatic autologous mature (by interleukin-1-beta, TNF&#xD;
           alfa, interleukin-6, and prostaglandin E_2) DC vaccine that has been loaded with&#xD;
           tumor-related peptide antigens and proteins as in arm I every 6 hours on days 1-4 of&#xD;
           weeks 1 and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients achieving complete response receive 2 more courses of treatment (3 months apart).&#xD;
      Patients achieving partial response receive up to 10 more courses of treatment (1 month&#xD;
      apart) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each arm, cohorts of 4-7 patients receive escalating doses of DC vaccine until the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of&#xD;
      7 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are obtained at baseline and periodically during and after treatment. Samples&#xD;
      are examined by immunoenzyme techniques for immunologic measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 10½ years and then&#xD;
      annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;

    <description>i. Peripheral blood CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses against HLA-presented melanoma epitopes, and (in patients with available tumor tissue) against autologous tumor cells, and using IFNγ-, and IL-5- ELISPOT assays. CD8+ T cell responses (IFNγ ELISPOT) will be used as a secondary readout: the sum of the specific ELISPOT counts obtained (at week 8) with each of the individual HLA-A2-restricted peptides (less the respective counts obtained before the treatment), will be considered as a primary indication of the vaccine effectiveness.&#xD;
ii. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) response to the mix of the melanoma-related peptides, injected intradermally in vivo, and DTH to autologous tumor lysates, in all cases when autologous tumor tissue is available.&#xD;
iii. Delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses to KLH and PADRE injected intradermally in vivo.</description>
