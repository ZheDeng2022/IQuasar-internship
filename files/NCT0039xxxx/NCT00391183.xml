  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether palliative biliary stenting improves the&#xD;
      quality of life, of gallblader cancer patients, who present with hilar block and obstructive&#xD;
      jaundice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For most patients with gallbladder cancer, cure is not possible and treatment should be&#xD;
      therefore aimed at palliation of symptoms and maintaining quality of life (QOL) in the few&#xD;
      months between diagnosis and death. Most of these patients suffer from intractable pruritis,&#xD;
      pain, anorexia and general debility. Biliary stenting leads to a reduction in pruritis and&#xD;
      jaundice, and is commonly offered to many unresectable patients. However stenting related&#xD;
      complications like cholangitis, rescue percutaneous treatment and need for prolonged&#xD;
      hospitalization often impair the remaining short survival of these patients. In these&#xD;
      patients improving the QOL should be the primary focus, and survival a secondary end point in&#xD;
      disease management. No study has addressed the issue of QOL of patients with gallbladder&#xD;
      cancer, post stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three clinical studies have evaluated the change in the QOL of patients with malignant&#xD;
      biliary obstruction after of endoscopic stenting. Ballinger et al evaluated 19 patients with&#xD;
      unresectable pancreatic carcinoma before stenting and upto 12 weeks or death after stenting.&#xD;
      The Rotterdam Symptom Checklist and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were used.&#xD;
      Significant improvements were seen in the parameters of mood, indigestion, appetite and level&#xD;
      of activity. Luman et al studied 47 inoperable patients with malignant biliary strictures.&#xD;
      The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QOL questionnaire (EORTC&#xD;
      QLQ-C30) was used at baseline and 1 month after stenting. For patients successfully&#xD;
      completing the follow up, significant improvement in emotional, cognitive , and global health&#xD;
      scores was found after stenting. In addition to the expected improvement in pruritis and&#xD;
      jaundice , anorexia, diarrhea and sleep pattern were also improved. Abraham et al studied 50&#xD;
      patients with malignant biliary obstruction without liver metastasis considered non surgical&#xD;
      candidates, and undergoing palliative biliary stenting. The SF-36 Health Survey Questionnaire&#xD;
      was used to quantify QOL at baseline and 1 month after stent insertion. Follow up data was&#xD;
      available for only 26 patients. Among these patients a significant reduction in the bilirubin&#xD;
      level was associated with improvement in the social function and mental health. A high&#xD;
      baseline bilirubin (&gt; 14mg/dL) was associated with a lack of improvement at 1 month follow&#xD;
      up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence existing data regarding improvement in the QOL of patients undergoing palliative&#xD;
      biliary stenting is sparce and incomplete. Gallbladder cancer presenting a hilar block is the&#xD;
      most common biliary malignancy in India. Hilar tumors are associated with more technical&#xD;
      failure of stenting, higher cholangitis rates, earlier stent blockage, and shorter survival&#xD;
      as compared to distal biliary tumors. Only 6 patients with Klatskin tumors were included in&#xD;
      one of the study.8 Patients with hilar block were either not included6, or were not&#xD;
      specified7 in the other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life (QOL) refers to the impact of a medical condition or its&#xD;
      treatment on a person's expected physical, psychological and social well being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calman states that QOL evaluations measure the difference between the &quot;hopes and&#xD;
      expectations&quot; of an individual and that individual's present experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The multidimensionality that is commonly assessed in QOL measures includes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physical symptoms of the disease or its treatment or concurrent illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional capacity (ability and energy) for daily routine, social interactions,&#xD;
           intellectual activity, emotional reactions and adjustments, economic independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-perception of wellness or its absence. There are two basic types of instruments for&#xD;
           measuring the QOL: generic and disease specific. Generic instruments focus on the main&#xD;
           components that constitute QOL, and are intended to be applied in a wide range of&#xD;
           populations and health states across all diseases. There are many excellent validated&#xD;
           self-completion questionnaires for cancer patients eg. EORTC QOL questionnaire,&#xD;
           Functional assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), Rotterdam Symptom Checklist (RSCL),&#xD;
           Functional Living Index Cancer (FLIC). All these questionnaires are multidimensional,&#xD;
           and it is rarely required to develop a new instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EORTC QLQ-C30 has been developed in a multi-cultural setting, and translations are&#xD;
      available in 43 languages. The instrument has been shown to be valid, reliable, and&#xD;
      responsive to change. Disease specific modules are available to supplement the core&#xD;
      questionnaire. Reference data is available for calculating sample size. The questionnaire is&#xD;
      easily understood by most patients and is quick to complete (mean time 11 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a 30- item questionnaire composed of multi-item scales and single items&#xD;
      that reflects the multidimensionality of the quality of life construct. It incorporates five&#xD;
      functional scales (physical, role, cognitive, emotional, and social), three symptom scales&#xD;
      (fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting), and a global health and quality of life scale. The&#xD;
      remaining single items assess additional symptoms commonly reported by cancer patients&#xD;
      (dyspnea, appetite loss, sleep disturbance, constipation and diarrhea), as well as the&#xD;
      perceived financial impact of the disease and its treatment. The functional scales have 16&#xD;
      questions, symptom scales have 6 questions, global quality of life has two questions, and&#xD;
      there are six single item questions. For ease of interpretation, all scale and item scores&#xD;
      are linearly transformed to a 0 to 100 scale. For the 5 functional scales and the global&#xD;
      quality of life scale, a higher score represents a better level of functioning. For the&#xD;
      symptom oriented scales and items, a higher score corresponds to a higher level of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence we plan to prospectively study unresectable gallbladder cancer patients with hilar&#xD;
      block to evaluate whether palliative stenting improves their quality of life, and whether the&#xD;
      benefit afforded outweighs the early and late complications of stenting.&#xD;
