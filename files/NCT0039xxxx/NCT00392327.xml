    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies different chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimens&#xD;
      to compare how well they work in treating young patients with newly diagnosed, previously&#xD;
      untreated, high-risk medulloblastoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine&#xD;
      sulfate, cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Giving more than one drug (combination chemotherapy) may kill&#xD;
      more tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Carboplatin&#xD;
      may make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. It is not yet known which&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy regimen is more effective in treating brain tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether carboplatin radiosensitization increases long term event-free&#xD;
      survival for high risk medulloblastoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether isotretinoin increases long term event-free survival for high risk&#xD;
      medulloblastoma/PNET patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare residual disease response to radiation alone versus radiation plus carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify molecular prognostic indicators suitable for patient stratification in future&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) during phases of active treatment&#xD;
      specific to treatment modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To describe the neuropsychological functioning of the study population and to evaluate&#xD;
      the relationship between neuropsychological status and health related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to Arm A or Arm B (Arms C and D closed to accrual as of&#xD;
      Amendment 3 1/27/15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A (standard chemoradiotherapy and standard maintenance therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) five days a week for 6&#xD;
      weeks. Patients also receive vincristine sulfate intravenously (IV) over 1 minute once weekly&#xD;
      for 6 weeks. Six weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients proceed to maintenance&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1, vincristine sulfate&#xD;
      IV over 1 minute on days 1 and 8, and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 2 and 3.&#xD;
      Patients also receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) or IV beginning on day 4 and continuing&#xD;
      until blood counts recover (at least 10 days). Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of&#xD;
      6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B (standard chemoradiotherapy plus carboplatin and standard maintenance therapy):&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients receive vincristine sulfate and undergo radiation therapy as in&#xD;
      Arm I. Patients also receive carboplatin IV over 15 minutes on each day of radiation therapy.&#xD;
      Six weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients proceed to maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive maintenance therapy as in Arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM C (standard chemoradiotherapy, standard maintenance therapy plus isotretinoin, and&#xD;
      continuation therapy with isotretinoin - CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 1/27/15):&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo chemoradiotherapy as in Arm I. Six weeks after completion&#xD;
      of chemoradiotherapy, patients proceed to maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive isotretinoin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on day 1 and&#xD;
      days 16-28 and cisplatin, vincristine sulfate, cyclophosphamide, and filgrastim as in Arm I&#xD;
      maintenance therapy. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then proceed to continuation&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTINUATION THERAPY: Patients receive isotretinoin PO BID on days 15-28 every 28 days for up&#xD;
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM D (standard chemoradiotherapy plus carboplatin, standard maintenance therapy plus&#xD;
      isotretinoin, and continuation therapy with isotretinoin - CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 1/27/15):&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHEMORADIOTHERAPY: Patients undergo chemoradiotherapy as in Arm II. Six weeks after&#xD;
      completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients proceed to maintenance therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive maintenance therapy as in Arm III. Patients then&#xD;
      proceed to continuation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTINUATION THERAPY: Patients receive continuation therapy as in Arm III.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 1 year.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed, previously untreated: (1) M0 medulloblastoma with &gt; 1.5 cm^2&#xD;
             residual; (2) M+ medulloblastoma; patients with diffusely anaplastic medulloblastoma&#xD;
             are eligible regardless of M-stage or residual tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  As of amendment # 2, enrollment of patients with supratentorial PNET has been&#xD;
                  discontinued&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  All patients with M4 disease are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain with and without&#xD;
             contrast is required; NOTE: computed tomography (CT) scans are NOT sufficient for&#xD;
             study eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-operative head MRI scan with and without contrast (preferably within 72&#xD;
                  hours post-surgery); for patients who undergo stereotactic biopsy only, either a&#xD;
                  pre or post-operative MRI is sufficient; for patients with M2 and M3 disease, a&#xD;
                  post-op MRI is strongly encouraged, but not mandatory&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spinal MRI imaging with and without gadolinium is required within 10 days of&#xD;
                  surgery if done pre-operatively or within 28 days of surgery if done&#xD;
                  post-operatively; for posterior fossa tumors, pre-operative MRI scans are&#xD;
                  preferred&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology examination must be obtained pre-operatively&#xD;
             or within 31 days following surgery; the optimal time for obtaining CSF is prior to&#xD;
             surgery or 1-3 weeks following surgery; ventricular CSF (either pre- or post-op) may&#xD;
             be used only if a post-operative spinal tap is contraindicated; if a spinal tap is&#xD;
             contraindicated and there is no ventricular CSF available, then CSF cytology can be&#xD;
             waived for patients with supratentorial tumors or if there is documentation of spinal&#xD;
             subarachnoid metastases (M3); patients who are categorized as M1 must have either an&#xD;
             intra-operative positive CSF (via lumbar puncture at the end of the procedure) or a&#xD;
             positive lumbar CSF obtained &gt; 7 days post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a Karnofsky performance level of &gt;= 30 for patients &gt; 16 years of&#xD;
             age or a Lansky performance scale of &gt;= 30 for patients =&lt; 16 years of age and life&#xD;
             expectancy &gt; 8 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No previous chemotherapy or radiation therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroids should not be used during chemotherapy administration as an antiemetic&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Selected strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4&#xD;
             (cytochrome P450 3A4) include azole antifungals, such as fluconazole, voriconazole,&#xD;
             itraconazole, ketoconazole, and strong inducers include drugs such as rifampin,&#xD;
             phenytoin, phenobarbitol, carbamazepine, and St. John's wort; the use of these drugs&#xD;
             should be avoided with vincristine (vincristine sulfate)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CYP450 3A4 stimulators or inhibitors should be avoided or used with great caution when&#xD;
             taking cyclophosphamide; aprepitant should also be used with caution with etoposide or&#xD;
             vincristine chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cisplatin should be used with caution with nephrotoxic drug; aminoglycoside should be&#xD;
             avoided or used with caution during or shortly after cisplatin administration and&#xD;
             concomitant use with amphotericin B should probably also be avoided; patients&#xD;
             receiving cisplatin and other potentially ototoxic drugs such as aminoglycoside or&#xD;
             loop diuretics concomitantly should be closely monitored for signs of ototoxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Plasma levels of anticonvulsant agents should be monitored and doses adjusted&#xD;
                  during therapy with cisplatin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other experimental therapy is permitted while on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine clearance or radioisotope glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &gt;= 70&#xD;
             mL/min/1.73 m^2 OR a serum creatinine based on age/gender as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  0.8 mg/dL (2 to &lt; 6 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1.0 mg/dL (6 to &lt; 10 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1.2 mg/dL (10 to &lt; 13 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1.5 mg/dL (male) or 1.4 mg/dL (female) (13 to &lt; 16 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1.7 mg/dL (male) or 1.4 mg/dL (female) (&gt;= 16 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) (aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) or&#xD;
             serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) (alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) &lt; 2.5 x&#xD;
             upper limit of normal (ULN) for age; for patients on anti-seizure medications, SGOT&#xD;
             (AST) or SGPT (ALT) must be &lt; 5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt;= 100,000/uL (untransfused)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemoglobin &gt;= 8 g/dl (may be transfused)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are post-menarchal must have a negative pregnancy test; lactating&#xD;
             female patients must agree not to breast-feed while on this trial; males or females of&#xD;
             reproductive potential may not participate unless they have agreed to use an effective&#xD;
             contraceptive method&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All institutional, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Cancer Institute&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Patients (Pts) 3-21 yrs were recruited at COG institutions.The first pt was enrolled 5/23/2007, and the last pt was enrolled 4/9/2018.The study was initially open to medulloblastoma and supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumor (SPNET) pts, but closed for SPNET pts as of amendment #2.All pts were off treatment at the time of results reporting.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants received standard therapy consisting of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A subset of patients was randomly assigned to receive carboplatin. A second randomization was used to randomly assign patients to receive isotretinoin. Of note, the isotretinoin randomization was stopped early due to futility.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>The Estimated Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) at 9+/-3 Months Post Diagnosis for Medulloblastoma Patients</title>
        <description>Post-treatment neurocognitive function was assessed. Full-scale IQ (FSIQ) is a representative measurement for neurocognitive function. FSIQ was measured by IQ tests. Assessments within the time window, from eligible and evaluable patients are reported. The time window is 9+/-3 months post diagnosis, only the assessments before progression date were reported. The Range of FSIQ is 50-150. A higher FSIQ is better. Mean and standard deviation of FSIQ were calculated and reported.</description>

If the patient had disease progression, only the assessments before progression date were reported. The MI is a standard T- score, and it ranges from 0 to 100. The higher score reported suggests a higher level of dysfunction. Mean and standard deviation of MI were calculated and reported.</description>
