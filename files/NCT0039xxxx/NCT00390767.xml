    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and activity of increasing doses of&#xD;
      MultiGeneAngio, a cell therapy product produced from the patient's own cells, as potential&#xD;
      treatment for patients with peripheral arterial disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 16 million patients worldwide (1 in 20 people over the age of 50) suffer from&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease(PAD). PAD is characterized by narrowing or occlusion of vessels&#xD;
      supplying blood to the lower limbs, most often due to atherosclerosis. Symptoms of PAD&#xD;
      include claudication that may progress to critical limb ischemia manifested by rest pain,&#xD;
      tissue loss and gangrene, which eventually may necessitate amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MultiGeneAngio is a cell therapy-based product developed for treatment of patients with PAD&#xD;
      secondary to narrow or blocked arteries in the legs. MultiGeneAngio is composed of&#xD;
      endothelial and smooth muscle cells that are isolated from a short vein segment stripped from&#xD;
      the patient's arm. After isolation the cells are expanded, characterized, and gene modified&#xD;
      by transfer of angiogenic genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MultiGeneAngio is a clear cell suspension injected intra-arterially at the site of blockage&#xD;
      using a standard diagnostic catheter, in order to create and expand new collateral arteries,&#xD;
      and thereby improve blood flow to an ischemic limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comprehensive pre-clinical studies, as well as clinical experience with PAD patients&#xD;
      suffering from claudication showed that production and administration of MultiGeneAngio was&#xD;
      feasible and safe, as no apparent drug-related adverse events have been observed. Moreover,&#xD;
      follow-up data of peak walking times imply a beneficial trend of this efficacy end-point.&#xD;
      Additional follow-up data will continue to be collected to help evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of MultiGeneAngio.&#xD;
