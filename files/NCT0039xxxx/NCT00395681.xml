      Rationale: The extreme increase of obesity in the last years had led to this study. There is&#xD;
      no consensus about how to anaesthetise morbidly obese patients. The amounts of narcotics&#xD;
      given vary widely and rather depend on the anaesthetist than on the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      dynamics in the morbidly obese patient. Reason for this is that it is not clear in what&#xD;
      extend the pharmacokinetics and dynamics are affected in the morbidly obese patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The study is performed in order to develop a population pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic model of Propofol when used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in&#xD;
      the morbidly obese patient (BMI &gt; 40). A covariate analysis will be performed in order to&#xD;
      account for variability in pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic parameters. This model will&#xD;
      take into account patient and procedure bound covariates. The results will be used to develop&#xD;
      individualised dosing schemes of Propofol when used for induction and maintenance of&#xD;
      anaesthesia in morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A randomised, therapeutic and non-invasive study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Morbidly obese patients with a Body Mass Index &gt; 40 undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      banding or gastric bypass surgery, 18-60 year old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): Patients will be randomised into two groups, one group will be&#xD;
      given 200 milligrams of Propofol and the other group will be given 350 milligrams of&#xD;
      Propofol. During the induction of anaesthesia with Propofol over 60 seconds, the patient is&#xD;
      asked to count in order to measure time to induction of anaesthesia. During and following&#xD;
      anaesthesia a maximum of 50 ml of blood will be taken from an indwelling arterial line. Depth&#xD;
      of sedation will be measured using non-invasive Bispectral Index (target 40-60) and other&#xD;
      standard measures (heart frequency and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoints: pharmacokinetic parameters; clearance,&#xD;
      intercompartmental clearance, volume of central compartment and volume of peripheral&#xD;
      compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints: pharmacodynamic parameters; time to induction of anaesthesia (stop&#xD;
      counting, eyelash reflex, quality of anaesthesia, corresponding dose required for induction&#xD;
      of anaesthesia for both induction doses), EC50 using BIS, required doses of Propofol during&#xD;
      maintenance of anaesthesia, wake-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: A maximum amount of 50 milliliters of blood will be sampled from an indwelling&#xD;
      arterial line. The patient will be asked to count slowly during induction of anaesthesia.&#xD;
      Both induction doses of 200 and 350 milligrams are currently used standard induction doses&#xD;
      for morbidly obese patients.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE The extreme increase of obesity in the last years had led to&#xD;
           this study. There is no consensus about how to anaesthetise morbidly obese patients. The&#xD;
           amounts of narcotics given during induction and maintenance of anaesthesia vary widely&#xD;
           and rather depend on the anaesthetist than on the pharmacokinetics and dynamics in the&#xD;
           morbidly obese patient (see figure 1 and 2). Despite the large range in induction doses&#xD;
           (200-800 milligrams of Propofol, figure 1), the quality of induction of anaesthesia&#xD;
           proved to be adequate in all cases. This can be explained by the central volume of&#xD;
           distribution, which probably is the same in morbidly obese patients as in normal weight&#xD;
           patients. This means that the induction dose of Propofol does not have to be adjusted in&#xD;
           morbidly obese patients and that induction doses for non-obese patients can be applied,&#xD;
           being 200 milligrams ( +/- 2.5 mg/kg). For maintenance of anaesthesia, however,&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic parameters such as clearance and peripheral volume of distribution play&#xD;
           an important role and are probably altered in morbidly obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because it is not clear how the pharmacokinetics and dynamics are affected in the&#xD;
           morbidly obese patient, this study is performed in order to develop a population&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic model of Propofol when used for induction and&#xD;
           maintenance of anaesthesia in the morbidly obese patient (BMI &gt; 40).&#xD;
&#xD;
           In our clinic several studies have been performed on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           relations of Propofol in non-obese patients. There have been two studies on induction of&#xD;
           anaesthesia12. One study described sedation following cardiac surgery3. There also are&#xD;
           four studies that described sedation in the critically ill patient45 and in children67.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study is performed in order to develop a population pharmacokinetic and&#xD;
           pharmacodynamic model of Propofol in morbidly obese patients. A covariate analysis will&#xD;
           be performed in order to account for variability in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic&#xD;
           parameters. The results will be used to develop individualised dosing schemes for&#xD;
           Propofol in morbidly obese patients. This model will take into account patient and&#xD;
           procedure bound covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary Objective: The main objective is to develop a pharmacokinetic model of Propofol&#xD;
           when used for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia in the morbidly obese patient.&#xD;
           Pharmacokinetic parameters are clearance, intercompartmental clearance, volume of&#xD;
           central compartment and volume of peripheral compartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary Objective(s): The secondary objective is to develop a pharmacodynamic model of&#xD;
           Propofol in morbidly obese patients, using the Bispectral Index and haemodynamics (heart&#xD;
           rate and blood pressure) as a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Pharmacodynamic parameters; time&#xD;
           to induction of anaesthesia (stop counting, eyelash reflex, quality of anaesthesia,&#xD;
           corresponding dose required for induction of anaesthesia for both induction doses), EC50&#xD;
           using BIS, required doses of Propofol during maintenance of anaesthesia, wake-up time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A covariate analysis will be performed in order to account for variability in&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters. Covariates: body weight, body mass&#xD;
           index, lean body mass, length, age, PEEP and open or laparoscopic procedure, renal and&#xD;
           hepatic function tests, haemodynamic parameters, use of co-medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. STUDY DESIGN This is a randomised, therapeutic and noninvasive study, which means the&#xD;
           whole procedure will be standard except for additional blood sampling from an indwelling&#xD;
           arterial line during and following anaesthesia. The induction doses (200 mg or 350 mg)&#xD;
           are both considered standard doses, as in our own survey these induction doses were&#xD;
           found to vary between 200 and 800 milligrams (unpublished data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morbidly obese patients, 18-60 year old, with a Body Mass Index &gt; 40 undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      banding or gastric bypass surgery are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before induction the investigators install an antecubital infusion line, an indwelling&#xD;
      arterial blood pressure line, a Bisprectal Index (BIS) and a 3-lead ECG. The investigators&#xD;
      give 2 millilitres of Lidocaine prior to infusion of Propofol 2 % to avoid pain during&#xD;
      injection. Anaesthesia will be induced with a bolus of 200 milligrams or 350 milligrams of&#xD;
      Propofol 2 % over 60 seconds delivered by a Graseby Medical 3400 pump. Patients are not given&#xD;
      any premedication. During the bolus injection patients are asked to count. At the moment the&#xD;
      patient stops counting a blinded observer notes the time and BIS and evaluates presence of&#xD;
      the eyelash reflex. When the total amount of Propofol 2 % is given a blinded observer notes&#xD;
      the BIS and presence of eyelash reflex and 250 micrograms of Fentanyl and 50 milligrams of&#xD;
      Atracurium is given. The BIS is noted again and the patient will be intubated and&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated. The ventilation modes are noted, as well as the amount of PEEP and&#xD;
      when a pneumoperitoneum is used the investigators note the intra-abdominal pressure. The BIS&#xD;
      monitors depth of anaesthesia continuously and data will be recorded at intervals of 30&#xD;
      seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia is maintained by aiming at a Bispectral Index between 40 and 60. The&#xD;
      investigators start with Propofol 2 % at an infusion rate of 25 % of total body weight (5&#xD;
      mg/kg/hr), with the ability to change when the aimed BIS is not reached. Remifentanyl (2 mg&#xD;
      Remifentanyl in 40 ml of NaCl 0.9 %) and Atracurium (150 mg of Atracurium in 50 ml of NaCl&#xD;
      0.9 %) are standardised at infusion rates of 25 % of ideal body weight and 10 % of total body&#xD;
      weight respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are taken from the indwelling arterial line, the exact time being recorded for&#xD;
      each sample. At the point of sampling the investigators note the BIS. If the infusion of&#xD;
      Propofol 2 % is changed, the time and the BIS will be noted. Extra blood samples are taken at&#xD;
      the moment of changing the infusion rate and 5 or 15 minutes after the change in infusion&#xD;
      rate. All samples are collected in glass oxalate tubes and analysed within three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the operation Propofol 2 %, Remifentanyl and Atracurium are stopped and 10&#xD;
      milligrams of Morphine will be given intravenously. Atracurium is antagonised with&#xD;
      Neostigmine 1.5 milligrams and Atropine 0.5 milligrams. Postoperative pain relief is&#xD;
      standardised with intravenous Diclofenac 3 times 75 milligrams, intravenous Paracetamol 4&#xD;
      times 1000 milligrams and subcutaneous Morfine 4 times 10 milligrams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.1 Population (base) Morbidly obese patients with a Body Mass Index &gt; 40 undergoing&#xD;
      laparoscopic banding or gastric bypass surgery, 18-60 year old&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2 Inclusion criteria Patients with a Body Mass Index &gt; 40 undergoing laparoscopic banding&#xD;
      or gastric bypass surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3 Exclusion criteria Epilepsy, pregnancy, breastfeeding and known allergy for Propofol, egg&#xD;
      lecithin or soy bean oil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Sample size calculation In this study, 20 morbidly obese patients are included. For the&#xD;
      determination of pharmacokinetic parameters, normally 8-10 patients are required under&#xD;
      optimal circumstances. Because the clinical situation in the operation room is less optimal&#xD;
      compared to phase I studies in human volunteers resulting in additional variability, it is&#xD;
      generally accepted to include 20 patients which has resulted in reliable models in previous&#xD;
      studies from our group&#xD;
