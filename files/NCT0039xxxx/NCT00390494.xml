    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the change in symptoms and health-related quality&#xD;
      of life in patients undergoing treatment for fibroids. Results from the questionnaire will be&#xD;
      compared with results obtained from patients who do not have fibroids in order to determine a&#xD;
      score range that differentiates these two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are the most common benign uterine tumor affecting approximately 70% of all&#xD;
      women in the United States. Sixty percent of the 600,000 hysterectomies performed in the&#xD;
      United States annually are done because of uterine fibroids. Hysterectomy has been the&#xD;
      definitive treatment for fibroids and has been demonstrated to be effective in controlling&#xD;
      symptoms. However, there have been few studies comparing the outcome of hysterectomy to other&#xD;
      surgical and non-surgical therapies or to the outcomes experienced by a &quot;normal&quot; population,&#xD;
      i.e. those not diagnosed with fibroids. Similarly, the relative effectiveness of myomectomy&#xD;
      and uterine fibroid embolization has not been evaluated in the context of other fibroid&#xD;
      therapies and minimally invasive variations. Fibroid symptoms experienced by patients are&#xD;
      subjective and have not been shown to correlate with fibroid number, size, location, or any&#xD;
      other clinical measure of fibroids. As symptoms and their impact are the primary outcomes&#xD;
      experienced by patients, a validated questionnaire to measure this impact is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality of Life Questionnaire (UFS-QoL) was developed from&#xD;
      focus groups of women with leiomyomata. The original items captured key symptoms and areas of&#xD;
      life impact voiced by the focus group participants. Content validity was established through&#xD;
      cognitive debriefings of women with leiomyomata and review by expert clinicians. The UFS-QoL&#xD;
      was then validated in a patient population of women with leiomyomata as well as &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the UFS-Qol as the primary measure, this study will provide the basis of comparison for&#xD;
      women with uterine fibroids both before and after therapy. &quot;Normal&quot; scores will be&#xD;
      established from patients without fibroids. These data will provide the basis for comparing&#xD;
      these outcomes to those resulting from a variety of investigational therapies. It will also&#xD;
      provide insight into the progression of fibroid-related symptoms in patients established as&#xD;
      normal at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. To determine the change in symptoms and health-related quality of life in patients&#xD;
      undergoing hysterectomy, myomectomy, and uterine fibroid embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. To compare the outcomes of each intervention with a normal control group as well as with&#xD;
      the other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. To validate the UFS-QoL questionnaire in a normal population to determine a normal score&#xD;
      range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. To validate the UFS-QoL questionnaire in hysterectomy patients to determine a &quot;normal&quot;&#xD;
      score for patients without a uterus.&#xD;
