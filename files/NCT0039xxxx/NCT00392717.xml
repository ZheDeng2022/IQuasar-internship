  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visceral obesity is strongly associated with dyslipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia, low&#xD;
      HDL-cholesterol and mildly elevated LDL-cholesterol) and insulin resistance, key&#xD;
      characteristics of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Recent evidence has clearly established that&#xD;
      the risk of CVD is increased in subjects with the MetS. The precise reason for this remains&#xD;
      unclear, but appears to be closely related with dyslipidaemia. Effective management of&#xD;
      dyslipidaemia is important to reduce the risk of CVD in these subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Inhibition of hepatic cholesterol synthesis by statins and triglyceride synthesis&#xD;
      by fish oils improve lipoprotein metabolism in visceral obese men.&#xD;

      The study employed a factorial study design, stable isotopy and mathematical modelling to&#xD;
      examine the independent and combined effects of decreasing cholesterol substrate availability&#xD;
      with atorvastatin and decreasing triglyceride substrate availability with fish oils on&#xD;
      lipoprotien kinetics (apoB, apoA, apoC-III and chylomicron remnants) in insulin-resistant men&#xD;
      with visceral obesity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Obesity was defined as a waist circumference &gt;100 cm, waist:hip ratio &gt;0.97 and BMI&#xD;
             &gt;29 kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects were selected for having insulin-resistance, defined as a homostasis model&#xD;
             assessment (HOMA) score (21) &gt;5.1 (i.e. one SD above the mean for a reference&#xD;
             population of 22 lean, normolipidemic healthy males of similar age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects had plasma triglyceride &gt;1.2 mmol/L and cholesterol &gt;5.2 mmol/L at&#xD;
             screening while consuming ad libitum, weight-maintaining diets&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diabetes mellitus, apolipoprotein E2/E2 genotype, macroproteinuria, creatinemia,&#xD;
             hypothyrodism, or abnormal liver enzymes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects did not consume fish oil supplements or drank more than 30g alcohol/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  None reported a history of CVD, or was taking medication or other agents known to&#xD;
             affect lipid metabolism.&#xD;
