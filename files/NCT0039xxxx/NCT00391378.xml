      Between 1 and 5 percent of patients who have coronary artery bypass surgery suffer a stroke&#xD;
      following surgery, and 30 percent have new brain lesions that do not produce symptoms and are&#xD;
      seen only on MRI. In addition, up to 40 percent of patients develop long-term cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. This study will identify risk factors that predict whether a person undergoing&#xD;
      heart surgery will develop cerebral infarcts after surgery. It will also identify operative&#xD;
      and inflammatory factors that may alter the risk, and will evaluate whether the small lesions&#xD;
      are associated with cognitive decline at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age or older who will undergo coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), heart&#xD;
      valve replacement, or combined CABG and valve replacement procedure are eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates must have no neurological or cognitive impairment before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo standard medical and surgical treatment as determined by their&#xD;
      physicians. In addition, they have the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical and neurological evaluation before surgery and 24 and 48 hours after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain MRI before surgery, and 48 hours, 30 days and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws before surgery, immediately after surgery, and 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours after&#xD;
           surgery to quantify the response of their inflammatory system to surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychological examinations 30 days and 6 months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition, patients who agree to enroll in a substudy that will explore whether&#xD;
           differences in the genes coding for inflammatory molecules lead to a change in the risk&#xD;
           of iscjhemia after heart surgery, will have extra blood drawn for genetic analysis.&#xD;

      Objective. Cardiac surgery is the leading cause of iatrogenic stroke in the United States; 1%&#xD;
      to 5% of patients undergoing CABG have a stroke, and 30% have clinically silent new lesions&#xD;
      that are detectable only on MRI. Cognitive dysfunction is also common after heart surgery,&#xD;
      and up to 40% have long-term cognitive impairment. The primary objective of this study is to&#xD;
      define the pre-operative risk profile that best predicts postoperative ischemic or cognitive&#xD;
      changes in patients undergoing heart surgery and to 1) establish a registry of patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac surgery to evaluate the relationship of new lesions on MRI, blood&#xD;
      biomarkers, neurological and neurocognitive outcome 2) identify the most significant risk&#xD;
      factors for post operative cerebral ischemic lesions 3) determine whether new ischemic&#xD;
      lesions on DWI are associated with subsequent neurological or cognitive impairment. The&#xD;
      objective of the genetics sub-study is to estimate the relative risk of specific&#xD;
      polymorphisms of genes of molecules involved in the inflammatory response and occurrence of&#xD;
      new ischemic lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population. 363 patients (188 consecutive patients undergoing CABG and 175 patients&#xD;
      undergoing aortic or mitral valve replacement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. Patients will have a pre-operative medical and neurological evaluation before surgery&#xD;
      and 24 and 48 hours after surgery. A brain MRI will be obtained preoperatively and 48 hours,&#xD;
      30 days, and 6 months after surgery. Blood drawn to quantify biomarkers will be obtained&#xD;
      before and immediately after surgery and 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours post-operatively. Patients&#xD;
      enrolled in the genetics sub-study will have additional blood drawn for sequencing of&#xD;
      inflammatory genes. Neuropsychological examinations will occur at 30 days and 6 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures. The primary outcome measure is the evidence of new ischemic lesions on the&#xD;
      48-hour DWI relative to pre-operative DWI. In addition, the following outcome measures will&#xD;
      be considered in exploratory analyses: 1) Any new ischemic lesion on 30 day DWI or FLAIR&#xD;
      relative to pre-op DWI or FLAIR; 2) Evidence of clinically definite ischemic stroke (focal&#xD;
      neurological deficits persisting for more than 24 hours) confirmed by non-investigational CT&#xD;
      or MRI (if protocol-required scans are not obtained) occurring within the first 30 days (plus&#xD;
      or minus 3 days) after surgery; 3) All cause mortality; 4) Encephalopathy; 5) Cognitive&#xD;
      decline at 30 days; 6) Cognitive decline at 6 months; 7) Evidence of reperfusion injury on&#xD;
      48-hour post-gadolinium FLAIR; 8) New ischemic lesions on 6-month DWI or FLAIR; 9) Changes in&#xD;
      values of blood markers; 10) Number, volume, and location of new DWI or FLAIR lesions.&#xD;
