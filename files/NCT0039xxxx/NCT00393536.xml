      The purpose of this study is to find out whether educational visits by Pharmacists, who are&#xD;
      already employed as advisers in health organisations, improve the prescribing habits of&#xD;
      primary care doctors.&#xD;

      Background There is increasing evidence that clinical guidelines can lead to improvements in&#xD;
      both the process and outcome of care[1]. They figure prominently within the UK, particularly&#xD;
      since the inception of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the&#xD;
      National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). However, clinical guidelines&#xD;
      are not self-implementing and there is a growing body of research that demonstrates the&#xD;
      effectiveness of various implementation strategies[1]. This has suggested that while the&#xD;
      commonly used strategy of the postal distribution of educational materials alone may change&#xD;
      clinician's behaviour it is unlikely to lead to large changes in practice. Educational&#xD;
      outreach visits, using a trained person to meet face-to-face with a health care professional&#xD;
      to provide information, may improve practice, especially prescribing behaviour[1,2]. Previous&#xD;
      studies of the effectiveness of outreach visiting in the UK NHS have used local pharmacists&#xD;
      as the visitors[3,4]. All Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England employ Pharmaceutical&#xD;
      Advisers who are pharmacists whose role is to provide, from a wide clinical and health&#xD;
      service management perspective, advice on prescribing and related areas to general&#xD;
      practitioners (GPs). Pharmaceutical Advisers routinely visit general practices and are seen&#xD;
      as change agents; however, the formal delivery of educational outreach by them has not been&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1996, the then Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority established a Clinical&#xD;
      Effectiveness Unit. The remit of the Unit was to provide support to local health care teams&#xD;
      in primary and secondary care, with the aim of promoting clinical effectiveness and&#xD;
      encouraging the use of best evidence in daily practice through systematic, evidence-based&#xD;
      approaches to guideline implementation. The strategy adopted by the Clinical Effectiveness&#xD;
      Unit was to concentrate on five clinical areas. These were selected by a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      steering group using explicit criteria (evidence of inappropriate variation in practice; a&#xD;
      good evidence base for what should be done; the clinical area should be a source of&#xD;
      significant morbidity or mortality; large cost implications in the management of the topic).&#xD;
      Depression was one of the clinical areas chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was, for the choice of antidepressants for the management of&#xD;
      depression, to evaluate, within a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of outreach visiting by existing Pharmaceutical Advisers in addition to the&#xD;
      postal distribution of educational materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Within a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, involving all general practices in&#xD;
      two PCTs, routine methods were used to distribute guidelines for the choice of&#xD;
      antidepressants for the management of depression. Intervention practices were offered two&#xD;
      visits (most accepted only one) by their PCT Pharmaceutical Adviser who had been trained in&#xD;
      the techniques of outreach visiting. The intervention was evaluated using level three&#xD;
      Prescribing Analysis and Cost (PACT) data for antidepressant drugs for the six months during&#xD;
      which the intervention was delivered and the subsequent 12 months&#xD;
