  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to develop and to evaluate a psychophysiological intervention for distressing&#xD;
      chronic tinnitus. Therefore 100 people suffering from chronic tinnitus are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either an intervention-group, receiving 12 sessions of a psychophysiological oriented&#xD;
      intervention, or to a waiting-list-group, who are waiting for a comparable time period.&#xD;
      Afterwards, patients of the waiting-list-group also receive intervention. The effects of the&#xD;
      intervention on severity, distress and perceived loudness of the tinnitus as well as on other&#xD;
      psychological variables like depression or self-efficacy are evaluated through comparing the&#xD;
      results of the intervention group with those of the waiting-list-group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally the psychophysiological reactivity under different stress-conditions is measured&#xD;
      before and after intervention or waiting. Therefore the activity of the muscles of head and&#xD;
      shoulders (EMG) as well as the skin temperature and skin conductance are measured. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that patients with stronger psychophysiological reactivity benefit more from an&#xD;
      psychophysiological intervention.&#xD;

      The study aims to develop and to evaluate a psychophysiological intervention for distressing&#xD;
      chronic tinnitus. Therefore 100 people suffering from chronic tinnitus are randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either an intervention-group, receiving 12 sessions of a psychophysiological oriented&#xD;
      intervention, or to a waiting-list-group, who are waiting for a comparable time period.&#xD;
      Afterwards, patients of the waiting-list-group also receive intervention. The effects of the&#xD;

      hypothesized that patients with stronger psychophysiological reactivity benefit more from an&#xD;
      psychophysiological intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further aims of the study are 1) to compare the muscle activity of the tinnitus-patients with&#xD;
      those from healthy controls, because till now no study investigated if tinnitus-patients&#xD;
      effectively present higher muscle activity in head and shoulders than healthy people and 2)&#xD;
      to evaluate the influence of the subjective illness perceptions on the intervention-outcome,&#xD;
      because it is hypothesized that patients with more somatic illness perceptions benefit more&#xD;
      from a psychophysiological intervention than patients with rather psychological illness&#xD;
      perceptions.&#xD;
