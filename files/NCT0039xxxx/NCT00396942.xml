      This study will compare brain changes in people with Parkinson's disease with those of normal&#xD;
      control subjects while they learn motor skills. People with Parkinson's disease sometimes&#xD;
      have trouble learning new skills, but it is not known why. This study will use repetitive&#xD;
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), nerve conduction studies, and&#xD;
      electroencephaolography (EEG) to look for differences in the way the brain changes with&#xD;
      learning in people with Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers and people with Parkinson's disease who are between 21 and 80 years&#xD;
      of age may be eligible for this study. Participants undergo the following procedures in five&#xD;
      visits to the NIH Clinical Center:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical and neurological examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor training. Participants perform a pinching movement once every other second, timed to a&#xD;
      metronome, during rTMS. For TMS, a wire coil is held on the subject's scalp. A brief&#xD;
      electrical current is passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the&#xD;
      brain. The subject hears a click and may feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the coil.&#xD;
      There may be a twitch in the muscles of the face, arm or leg. rTMS involves repeated magnetic&#xD;
      pulses delivered in short bursts of impulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 3 and 4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain physiology studies using rTMS, nerve conduction studies (electrical nerve stimulation)&#xD;
      and EEG. A nerve at the subject's wrist is stimulated with electrical impulses to measure the&#xD;
      speed with which nerves conduct electrical impulses and the strength of the connection&#xD;
      between the nerve and the muscle. rTMS is performed for 20 minutes. The EEG measures the&#xD;
      electrical activity of the brain (brain waves). For this test, electrodes (metal discs) are&#xD;
      placed on the scalp with a conductive gel and the brain waves are recorded while the subject&#xD;
      moves his or her thumb briskly for 20 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects undergo rTMS for 20 minutes and have an EEG.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the present study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clarify that the altered plasticity of the primary motor cortex (M1) in patients with&#xD;
           Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with impaired motor learning by using the paired&#xD;
           associative stimulation (PAS) technique, which can enhance or inhibit the M1&#xD;
           excitability with paired stimulation to the contralateral peripheral nerve and cerebral&#xD;
           cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elucidate that the altered plasticity of the M1 in patients with PD goes together with&#xD;
           impaired sensorimotor integration via the basal ganglia-thalamocortical loop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 right-handed patients with PD&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 right-handed age-matched healthy volunteers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and age-matched healthy volunteers will complete five different sessions: Visit 1:&#xD;
      clinical screening; Visit 2: motor learning session; Visit 3 and 4: the paired associative&#xD;
      stimulation (PAS) sessions; Visit 5: the control session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the motor learning session, subjects will be asked to perform metronome-paced pinch of&#xD;
      their index finger and thumb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the PAS sessions, they will receive 20 minutes of paired stimulation to the&#xD;
      contralateral peripheral nerve stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at the&#xD;
      appropriate timing for producing changes of the M1 excitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the control session, they will receive 20 minutes of repetitive TMS without the&#xD;
      peripheral nerve stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the motor learning session:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peak acceleration (MPA) of thumb movement&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  maximal peak force (MPF) between the index finger and thumb&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the PAS and control sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peak-to-peak motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  resting motor threshold&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  afferent inhibition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  event related desynchronization (ERD) and event related synchronization (ERS)&#xD;
