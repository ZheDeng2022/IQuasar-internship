  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic (the way a drug enters and&#xD;
      leaves the blood and tissues over time) profile of Dilaudid OROS 16mg (Dilaudid Slow Release;&#xD;
      hydromorphone HCL) administered under fasting conditions, following a high-fat breakfast&#xD;
      meal. The study also examined the effect of naltrexone blockade on the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profile of Dilaudid SR.&#xD;

      This was a randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on chance),&#xD;
      open-label, three-way crossover study, performed in normal, healthy adults. Each patient&#xD;
      received orally administered treatments (a different treatment during each dosing phase):&#xD;
      Treatment A: single dose of Dilaudid SR 16 mg administered under fasting conditions without&#xD;
      the naltrexone block;Treatment B: single dose of Dilaudid SR 16 mg administered under fed&#xD;
      conditions without the naltrexone block, Treatment C: single dose of Dilaudid SR 16 mg&#xD;
      administered under fasting conditions with naltrexone HCL 50mg block (3 oral doses of 50mg&#xD;
      each administered 12 hours prior to , at the time of, and 12 hours after Dilaudid SR 16mg&#xD;
      administration). There was a 7-day washout period between dosing phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood sampling times were 0 (prior to dosing),2,4,6,8,10,12,16,20,24,30,36,42,and 48&#xD;
      hours after each Dilaudid SR administration. LC/MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography/Mass&#xD;
      Spectroscopy/Mass Spectroscopy)techniques were employed for the analysis of plasma for&#xD;
      hydromorphone concentration. Each patient randomly received orally-administered treatments of&#xD;
      single dose of Dilaudid SR 16mg; under fasting conditions without the naltrexone block; under&#xD;
      fed conditions without naltrexone block; under fasting conditions with naltrexone 50mg block&#xD;
      (3 oral doses of 50mg naltrexone HCL each administered 12 hours prior to, at the time of, and&#xD;
      12 hours after hydromorphone administration); 7-day washout period between dosing phases.&#xD;
