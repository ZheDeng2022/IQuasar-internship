      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of vorinostat and azacitidine&#xD;
      and to see how well they work in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes or acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. Vorinostat may stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving vorinostat&#xD;
      together with azacitidine may kill more cancer or abnormal cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of vorinostat in combination with azacitidine in&#xD;
      patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and some select patients with acute myeloid&#xD;
      leukemia (AML) (step 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify doses of both vorinostat and azacitidine for safe combination of the 2 agents&#xD;
      that can be administered in repetitive cycles over time for use in phase II studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the response rate of patients treated with the combination of&#xD;
      suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (vorinostat) and azacitidine at the doses established&#xD;
      as safe and effective in Step 1 in an expanded cohort of patients with MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To obtain preliminary data on the effects of treatment with the combination of vorinostat&#xD;
      and Aza C (azacitidine) in patients with MDS on a series of biologic surrogate markers&#xD;
      including: deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation of specific genes (e.g. p15); histone&#xD;
      acetylation; hematopoietic progenitor growth and differentiation; the fate of the MDS clone&#xD;
      and changes in gene expression by array profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine effect of treatment with the combination on time to response, time to leukemic&#xD;
      transformation and frequency of transformation to leukemia in patients with MDS during the&#xD;
      phase II segment of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) once daily (QD) on days 1-7 and vorinostat&#xD;
      orally (PO) 2-3 times daily on days 3-5, 3-9, or 3-16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at&#xD;
      least 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then&#xD;
      every 2 months thereafter.&#xD;
