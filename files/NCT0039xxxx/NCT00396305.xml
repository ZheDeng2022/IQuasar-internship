      This research study is being done because influenza (flu) affects many people each year&#xD;
      throughout the world. The elderly and those with chronic health problems are at greater risk&#xD;
      for complications from the flu. The purpose of this research study is to evaluate vaccination&#xD;
      strategies in the elderly and others receiving the influenza vaccination in order to increase&#xD;
      protection. All subjects will receive the flu vaccine as an injection in the muscle of the&#xD;
      upper arm. Participants may receive a booster [an extra dose of vaccine or placebo (inactive&#xD;
      substance)] shot. Study participants will include healthy adult volunteers, ages 21-40,&#xD;
      60-89, or 90 years and older. Subjects will be involved in study related procedures for 6&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Influenza and pneumonia are the fourth leading cause of death among people aged over 65&#xD;
      years. Influenza also leads as a cause of catastrophic disability, greatly affecting the&#xD;
      quality of life of elderly persons. In the United States alone, an estimated 10 billion&#xD;
      dollars is spent annually due to the impact of influenza, and this will rise as the&#xD;
      population of seniors rapidly expands. Thus, influenza vaccination is recommended for elderly&#xD;
      adults. Although it is cost-effective, influenza vaccination only prevents infection in 30&#xD;
      percent-40 percent of those aged over 65, compared to 70 percent-90 percent of those under&#xD;
      65. Reduced influenza vaccine efficacy and greater morbidity and mortality are thought to be&#xD;
      largely due to immune senescence, but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. A&#xD;
      better understanding of immune senescence can ultimately translate into improved&#xD;
      effectiveness for a variety of vaccines, including vaccines against bioterrorist attack (such&#xD;
      as small pox vaccine), and thereby bring huge advances in disease prevention and billions in&#xD;
      cost savings. The commercially available influenza vaccine used in the United States contains&#xD;
      inactivated split viral particles of influenza B and two subtypes of influenza A. These&#xD;
      vaccines are cost-effective, but far from perfect; up to 61 percent of vaccinated elderly&#xD;
      people acquire influenza infection nonetheless. The safety and cost effectiveness of the&#xD;
      licensed split influenza virus vaccine is established, reducing researchers' incentive to&#xD;
      further improve the vaccine or define the difficult and expensive-to-measure T cell-mediated&#xD;
      immunity to it. The ultimate goal of this proposed non-randomized, open-label study is to&#xD;
      improve vaccine efficacy in order to reduce morbidity and mortality from influenza and other&#xD;
      infectious diseases in elderly people. The primary objective is to examine the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of vaccine strategies to enhance the Type 1 Helper Cells (Th1) response by&#xD;
      booster at the peak of Influenza specific (IS)-Th1 expansion following first vaccination. The&#xD;
      frequency of IS-Th1 and the antibody level on days 7 and 28 will be used as the two main&#xD;
      indicators of immunogenicity, although CD8+ T cell response will also be analyzed. The safety&#xD;
      profile to be assessed includes immediate adverse events, solicited local and systemic&#xD;
      events, and unsolicited adverse events. Seventy-four healthy individuals who are living&#xD;
      independently in the communities surrounding the study site will be invited to participate in&#xD;
      the trial. Participants between the ages of 21 and 40 years (young cohort) and those 60 years&#xD;
      and older (elderly cohort) will be recruited. Participants will be considered active in the&#xD;
      trial for 3 months post vaccination. A telephone follow-up visit will be scheduled at 6&#xD;
      months post-vaccination. Four groups of subjects will be recruited: 1 control group (Group 1)&#xD;
      and 3 experimental groups (Group 2, Group 3, and Group 4). This study is linked to DMID&#xD;
      protocol 05-0125. Protocol 05-0125 contains Part II of this study.&#xD;

    <description>The trivalent influenza vaccine is a sterile suspension prepared from the allantoic fluids of chicken embryos infected with a specific type of influenza virus. Each 0.5 mL dose of the vaccine contains 15 mcg hemagglutinin (HA) of 3 strains of virus (H1N1, H3N2, and B). The vaccine is a liquid preparation; as such, no diluent is required. It is essentially clear and slightly opalescent in color.</description>
