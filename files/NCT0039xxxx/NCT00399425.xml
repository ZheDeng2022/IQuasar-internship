  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of bemiparin (low molecular weight heparin) for 3 months in the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic foot ulcers in diabetic patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The involvement of microcirculation in diabetes microangiopathy may be the cause of&#xD;
      ulceration and severe incapacitation. Torpid ulcers of the lower limbs affect up to 15% of&#xD;
      diabetic patients at some moment of their lifetime; about one-third of patients developing&#xD;
      ulcers will never achieve their definitive cure, and half of them will die within three years&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heparins, besides their well known antithrombotic effects, have been shown to stimulate both&#xD;
      the synthesis of heparan sulphate -a potent endogenous anticoagulant- in endothelial cell&#xD;
      cultures and the proliferation of fibroblasts taken from diabetic ulcers .&#xD;
&#xD;
      After noticing the highly positive evolution of chronic ulcers in six diabetic patients who&#xD;
      had received LMWHs in their homes for the prophylaxis of deep vein thrombosis , and&#xD;
      considering the excellent safety record of these drugs, we decided to explore the effects of&#xD;
      LMWHs on the evolution of diabetic foot ulcers and the quality of life of diabetic patients&#xD;
      seen in our primary care practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison: bemiparin vs placebo&#xD;
