        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients (pts) must have histologically or cytologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
             the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pts must have evidence of progressive metastatic disease (e.g., new lesions on bone&#xD;
             scan or new/enlarging lesions on computerized tomography [CT] scan) or known&#xD;
             metastatic disease and rising PSA, during or after treatment with a taxane-based&#xD;
             regimen (as well as any other subsequent non-cytotoxic therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pts with bone metastases only (i.e., lacking soft-tissue disease) must have a PSA&#xD;
                  level of 10 ng/mL or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pts with soft tissue metastases and/or visceral disease must have either&#xD;
                  measurable disease (per RECIST criteria) or a PSA level of 10 ng/mL or higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For pts with stable metastatic disease and rising PSA: two consecutive rises in&#xD;
                  PSA measurement are necessary, each separated from the previous by a minimum of&#xD;
                  two weeks. The most recent PSA value must be obtained within 1 week prior to&#xD;
                  registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  At least 3 PSA values within 6 months of registration (each separated by at least&#xD;
                  2 weeks) using the same clinical laboratory needs to be available for calculation&#xD;
                  of the PSA pre-treatment slope. Only those values obtained after the last&#xD;
                  treatment date (see inclusion criteria #5 below) will be acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Pts must have had prior treatment with bilateral orchiectomy or other primary hormonal&#xD;
             therapy with evidence of treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pts who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue their luteinizing&#xD;
                  hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy (e.g., leuprolide or goserelin)&#xD;
                  or LHRH antagonist (e.g. abarelix) while receiving protocol therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A serum testosterone level of 50 ng/dL or lower is required to confirm castration&#xD;
                  status within 4 weeks prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. For pts previously treated with flutamide (Eulixin), Nilutamide (Nilandron), or&#xD;
             bicalutamide (Casodex): pts must have discontinued flutamide 4 weeks or more prior to&#xD;
             registration with continued evidence of progressive disease. For bicalutamide or&#xD;
             nilutamide, pts must have discontinued the drug 6 weeks or more prior to registration&#xD;
             with evidence of progressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Disease progression following anti-androgen withdrawal needs to be confirmed by a&#xD;
             rising PSA after the required 4-6 week washout period (e.g. PSA level higher than the&#xD;
             last PSA obtained while on anti-androgen therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pts must have received only one prior taxane-based regimen for metastatic disease,&#xD;
             with evidence of disease progression (inclusion criteria #2) during treatment or&#xD;
             within 6 months of treatment discontinuation. Up to one other prior experimental&#xD;
             therapy (non-cytotoxic) is permitted. At least 4 weeks or more from previous treatment&#xD;
             must have elapsed prior to registration, with evidence for disease progression as&#xD;
             outlined in inclusion criteria #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status of 2 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pts must have near normal organ and marrow function within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             registration as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Granulocytes &gt; 1500/mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm³&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (ALT) &lt; 2 times the institutional upper&#xD;
                  limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL or a calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pts with a history of prior malignancy are eligible provided they were treated with&#xD;
             curative intent and have been free of disease for 5 years or more (excluding&#xD;
             non-melanomatous skin cancers treated with curative intent).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. All sites of disease must be evaluated within 4 weeks prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written informed&#xD;
             consent and authorization for release of protected health information, abide by the&#xD;
             study restrictions, and agree to return for the required assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The use of bisphosphonates (i.e. pamidronate sodium or zoledronic acid) will be&#xD;
             allowed provided that the patient has been receiving that medication for 4 weeks or&#xD;
             more with evidence of progressive disease as outlined above.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • Pts will not be allowed to start bisphosphonate while receiving protocol treatment&#xD;
             unless clinically indicated (will need approval of the study principal investigator).&#xD;
             Those patients already on a bisphosphonate will need to continue to receive the&#xD;
             bisphosphonate as previously scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pts must not have had prior radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to registration. Patient&#xD;
             cannot have had prior Strontium 89, Samarium 153, or other radioisotope.&#xD;
&#xD;
             • If a pt requires palliative radiotherapy, two consecutive rises (baseline value must&#xD;
             be obtained after completion of radiation treatment) in PSA measurement are necessary,&#xD;
             each separated from the previous by a minimum of two weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No concurrent use of estrogen, or estrogen-like agents (i.e. PC-SPES, Saw Palmetto, or&#xD;
             other herbal products which may contain phytoestrogens), or any other hormonal therapy&#xD;
             (including megastrol acetate, finasteride, ketoconazole, and systemic corticosteroids)&#xD;
             is allowed at any time during the study. Prior use of these agents will need to be&#xD;
             discontinued 4 weeks or more prior to enrollment. Disease progression needs to be&#xD;
             confirmed as outlined in inclusion criteria #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pts with type I insulin-dependent diabetes or poorly-controlled type II&#xD;
             insulin-dependent diabetes or a fasting blood glucose of more than 10 mmol/L (200&#xD;
             mg/dL) will be excluded due to difficulty evaluating the tumor metabolic activity&#xD;
             using FDG-PET.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must not have active angina pectoris, or known heart disease of New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Class III-IV. Patients must not have a history of myocardial&#xD;
             infarction within 6 months prior to registration. No history or evidence of&#xD;
             ventricular dysrhythmias or other unstable arrythmia is allowed (rate controlled&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation is allowed if the patient is asymptomatic from a cardiac&#xD;
             standpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must not have any known history of carcinomatous meningitis or brain&#xD;
             metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No serious concurrent medical illness or active infection should be present which&#xD;
             would jeopardize the ability of the patient to receive the therapy outlined in this&#xD;
             protocol with reasonable safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No major surgery within 21 days of starting treatment with Panzem NCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Pts must not receive any investigational agents other than Panzem NCD for the duration&#xD;
             of their participation in this trial.&#xD;
