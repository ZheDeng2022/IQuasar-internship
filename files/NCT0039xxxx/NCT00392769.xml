      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if cetuximab can help to control the&#xD;
      disease in patients who have recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To determine the overall disease control rate of cetuximab in patients with progressive or&#xD;
      recurrent endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the duration of disease control, time to disease progression, and survival&#xD;
           of this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of cetuximab in this cohort of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate biologic markers with response to therapy if tissue is available.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a large protein that plays an important role&#xD;
      in tumor growth. When EGFR is stimulated or &quot;overexpressed,&quot; a series of chemical reactions&#xD;
      happen that result in a tumor being &quot;told&quot; to grow. Researchers know that EGFR is&#xD;
      overexpressed in many types of endometrial cancer. Cetuximab is designed to block this&#xD;
      receptor, which may help to stop or slow the growth of tumors in those patients whose&#xD;
      endometrial cancer has come back.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests.&quot; These tests&#xD;
      will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in the study. If you have had&#xD;
      some of the tests done recently, they may not need to be repeated. Your complete medical&#xD;
      history will be recorded. You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and&#xD;
      measurement of vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests, tests of your kidney and liver&#xD;
      function, and a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. The pregnancy test&#xD;
      must be negative for you to be allowed to take part in this study. You will have a chest&#xD;
      x-ray and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the abdomen&#xD;
      and pelvis (stomach and hip area) to measure the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive cetuximab once a&#xD;
      week through a needle in a vein. Each treatment cycle is 4 weeks long. In the first week of&#xD;
      your first treatment cycle only, you will receive cetuximab over 120 minutes (2 hours). For&#xD;
      all additional treatments, you will receive cetuximab over 60 minutes. During the infusion&#xD;
      and for 60 minutes after the infusion ends, you will be closely watched for signs of an&#xD;
      allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive diphenhydramine (or a similar antihistamine) by vein, about 30-60 minutes&#xD;
      before receiving each cetuximab infusion. This is in order to lower the risk of side effects&#xD;
      that the study drug may cause. Your doctor may decide to lower the dose of diphenhydramine in&#xD;
      later doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each cycle of therapy and 1 month after treatment ends, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. CT scans or MRI will be repeated&#xD;
      every 2-3 cycles and at the end of treatment. If you have any tumors in your chest, a chest&#xD;
      x-ray will be repeated every 2-3 cycles and at the end of treatment. If you have a partial or&#xD;
      complete response (the tumor shrinks or disappears completely) or the disease is stable&#xD;
      (where the tumor has neither grown nor shrunk), the CT or MRI will be repeated 4 weeks later&#xD;
      to check the response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be able to keep receiving additional treatment cycles as long as you are&#xD;
      benefitting. If the disease gets worse or you experience any intolerable side effects, you&#xD;
      will be taken off the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed treatment on the study, the status of your health and the disease&#xD;
      will be checked. Your doctor will decide how often these check-ups will occur. You may return&#xD;
      to M. D. Anderson for these follow-up exams, or if you choose not to come in to the clinic,&#xD;
      you will be contacted by phone to see how you are doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Cetuximab is commercially available and FDA approved for&#xD;
      the treatment of colorectal cancer. Its use in the treatment of endometrial cancer in this&#xD;
      study is experimental. Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. Up to 30 patients will&#xD;
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must have signed an approved informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Histologically confirmed progressive or recurrent endometrial cancer (endometrioid,&#xD;
             serous, clear cell, mixed malignant Mullerian tumors, or mixed histology; any grade).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients must have failed at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for recurrent&#xD;
             disease (does not include chemosensitizing radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as lesions&#xD;
             that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest dimension to be&#xD;
             recorded). Each lesion must be &gt; 20 mm when measured by conventional techniques,&#xD;
             including palpation, plain x-ray, CT, and MRI, or &gt; 10 mm when measured by spiral CT.&#xD;
             Ascites and pleural effusions are not considered measurable disease. If the measurable&#xD;
             disease is restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed&#xD;
             by cytology/histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have a Zubrod performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must either be not of child bearing potential or have a negative pregnancy&#xD;
             test within 7 days of treatment. Patients are considered not of child bearing&#xD;
             potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy,&#xD;
             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for&#xD;
             greater than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients must have a pretreatment granulocyte count (i.e., segmented neutrophils +&#xD;
             bands) of &gt;1,000/Fl, a hemoglobin level of &gt;/= 9.0 gm/dL and a platelet count of&#xD;
             &gt;75,000/Fl.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients must have an adequate renal function as documented by serum creatinine &lt;/=&#xD;
             2.0 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients must have adequate hepatic function as documented by a serum bilirubin &lt;/=&#xD;
             2.5 mg/dL, regardless of whether patients have liver involvement secondary to tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Aspartate transaminase (SGOT) must be &lt;/= 3x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
             unless the liver is involved with tumor, in that case, the aspartate transaminase must&#xD;
             be &lt;/=5 x institutional upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Prior to beginning therapy, at least 4 weeks must have elapsed since prior&#xD;
             chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy or investigational therapy. Patients&#xD;
             receiving palliative radiation therapy are exempt from the 4 week waiting period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who have uterine sarcomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have isolated recurrences (vaginal, pelvic, or paraaortic) that are&#xD;
             amenable to potentially curative treatment with radiation therapy or surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with any other severe concurrent disease, which would make the patient&#xD;
             inappropriate for entry into this study, including significant hepatic, renal, or&#xD;
             gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with a history of prior malignancy except for adequately treated basal cell&#xD;
             or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, or other cancer for which the&#xD;
             patient has been disease-free for at least five years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with active or uncontrolled systemic infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients with history of uncontrolled cardiac disease; i.e., uncontrolled&#xD;
             hypertension, unstable angina, recent myocardial infarction (within prior 6 months),&#xD;
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure, and cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction&#xD;
             under 40%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who received prior therapy that specifically and directly targets the EGFR&#xD;
             pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients who experienced prior severe infusion reaction to a monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding.&#xD;
