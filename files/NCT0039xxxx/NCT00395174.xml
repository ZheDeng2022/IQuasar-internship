  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study were to obtain additional evidence in support of the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a recombinant hemagglutinin (rHA) vaccine in an elderly population, and to&#xD;
      establish non-inferiority of the immunogenicity of the rHA vaccine when compared with a&#xD;
      licensed trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV). Another purpose was to provide a preliminary&#xD;
      estimate of the relative efficacy of the two vaccines against culture-positive influenza-like&#xD;
      illness during the subsequent epidemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Annual influenza epidemics are associated with serious excess morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      particularly among the elderly. Licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (TIVs) have&#xD;
      been shown to reduce hospitalization and death following influenza in this vulnerable&#xD;
      population, but their efficacy is lower than that observed in younger, healthy populations.&#xD;
      In addition, recent studies have questioned the level of effectiveness of TIV in the elderly,&#xD;
      suggesting that cohort studies have overestimated the benefits of immunization with current&#xD;
      TIV formulations in this age group. In view of these considerations, it is widely accepted&#xD;
      that improved and alternative vaccines are needed for control of seasonal and pandemic&#xD;
      influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently available TIVs are prepared from viruses that are grown in embryonated hens' eggs.&#xD;
      Alternative substrates for vaccine production are desirable in order to reduce the&#xD;
      vulnerability of and to expand influenza vaccine supply. Recombinant DNA techniques allow for&#xD;
      expression of the influenza hemagglutinin (rHA) by baculovirus vectors in insect cell&#xD;
      cultures. Advantages of this technique include speed of production, absence of egg protein,&#xD;
      and a highly purified product. Previous studies among healthy younger and older adults have&#xD;
      confirmed that rHA vaccines are safe, well tolerated and immunogenic at dosages up to nine&#xD;
      times higher than those contained in TIV. Dose-related increases in serum antibody levels&#xD;
      after immunization also were observed.&#xD;
