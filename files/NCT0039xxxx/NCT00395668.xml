  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate if electromagnetic radiation from TETRA handset&#xD;
      can influence cognitive function and the well-being of healthy adults. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      purpose is to provide any special information about the subjects which can cause the possible&#xD;
      reactions.&#xD;

      TETRA is the term used to describe the technology known as Terrestrial Trunked Radio. It is&#xD;
      the European standard digital mobile radio communication system. TETRA has primarily been&#xD;
      developed to enable the deployment of secure, digital PMR (Professional Mobile Radio)&#xD;
      services required by the public safety and emergency services (police, fire and paramedics).&#xD;
      The TETRA system is specified to work within the VHF and UHF bands (150 MHz to 900 MHz)&#xD;
      [Chadwick, 2003], and operates most often at frequencies around 400 MHz. The lower frequency&#xD;
      means that TETRA is less vulnerable to interference, which is a vital aspect of&#xD;
      communications for the emergency services. The system makes it possible to offer complete&#xD;
      coverage for the emergency services. One of the TETRA features is that the signal is&#xD;
      transmitted in bursts that repeat. The result is a power modulation of some of the RF signal&#xD;
      at a frequency of 17,6 Hz (times pr. second) [NRPB, 2001]. This pulsing has led to concerns&#xD;
      about its effect on health. Since this pulsing only occurs for transmission from TETRA&#xD;
      handset and not from the base stations, most concerns is related to the health effect on the&#xD;
      users of TETRA handset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to asses whether exposure to TETRA handset can affect cognitive functions and high&#xD;
      level brain functions such as learning and problem solving the volunteers will be tested by&#xD;
      comparing performance with and without exposure. Sham exposure (no radiation from the&#xD;
      handset) vs. TETRA signal (at the lowest carrier frequency, standard TDMA pulsing at 17,6 Hz&#xD;
      and a selection of lengths of exposures at the realistic SAR value).&#xD;
&#xD;
      56 healthy males aged 25-50 year working within public safety and emergency services (police,&#xD;
      fire and paramedics), is planned to be used in this study. Subjects must be identified as&#xD;
      potential users of the TETRA system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A climatic chamber at the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine, Aarhus&#xD;
      University, is modified with absorbing lining to dampen reflections from the walls. The&#xD;
      climatic chamber is modified to make it a screened room to prevent external RF fields, and to&#xD;
      some extent low frequency fields, to enter the chamber. Except for cables to the keyboard and&#xD;
      screen there are no other electromagnetic radiators in the chamber. The study will be double&#xD;
      blinded as any noise (acoustic and electric) related to exposure will be the same and the&#xD;
      person responsible for exposure and exposure assessment will not be able to see each other.&#xD;
      The only investigator knowledgeable about the exposure will have no contact with subjects and&#xD;
      staff doing measurement. This double blinding will continue until the basic statistical&#xD;
      analyses have been conducted.&#xD;
