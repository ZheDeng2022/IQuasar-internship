  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, open-label study evaluating the PK of S-1 components and their metabolites&#xD;
      in patients with advanced solid tumors and varying degrees of renal function. Patients will&#xD;
      be stratified by baseline 24-hour creatinine clearance(CrCL) into 4 cohorts using the normal&#xD;
      clearance formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: Control Group B:Mild renal dysfunction Group C:Moderate renal function and Group D:&#xD;
      Severe renal dysfunction. Six patients will be enrolled into each cohort.&#xD;

    <description>S-1 administration will be determined by degree of renal impairment as follows:&#xD;
Group A (Control): 30 mg/m2 BID Group B (Mild renal dysfunction): 30 mg/m2 BID Group C (Moderate renal dysfunction): 20 mg/m2 BID Group D (Severe renal dysfunction): 20 mg/m2 QD&#xD;
Pharmacokinetic Phase (Part 1):&#xD;
On Days -2 and 14 of the Pharmacokinetic Phase, patients will receive a single dose of S-1 administered orally in the morning.&#xD;
Treatment will be followed by 1 week of recovery (Days 15 through 21).&#xD;
Extension Phase (Part 2):&#xD;
S-1 will be administered orally for 2 weeks (Day 1 through Day 14) followed by a 1-week recovery period (Day 15 through Day 21). This cycle will be repeated every 3 weeks.</description>

               1. Sorivudine, uracil, dipyridamole, cimetidine and folinic acid (may enhance S-1&#xD;
                  activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Allopurinol (may diminish S-1 activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Phenytoin (S-1 may enhance phenytoin activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Flucytosine, a fluorinated pyrimidine antifungal agent (may enhance S-1 and&#xD;
                  flucytosine activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Pilocarpine (may inhibit CYP2A6 activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has known sensitivity to 5-FU.&#xD;
&#xD;
