      This study is intended to help develop new MRI imaging techniques for studying mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders. Researchers believe that depression and anxiety disorders may cause&#xD;
      structural and functional changes in the brain. This study will optimize the way MRI scans&#xD;
      are collected to look at brain structure and examine how the brain behaves while subjects&#xD;
      perform particular tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal subjects between 18 and 50 years of age who have never had a major psychiatric&#xD;
      disorder and who have no first-degree relatives with mood disorders may be eligible for this&#xD;
      study. Candidates are screened by phone with questions about their psychiatric and medical&#xD;
      history, current emotional state and sleep pattern, and family history of psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders. Candidates who pass the preliminary screening then undergo additional screening&#xD;
      interviews and laboratory tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing, as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;MRI scans: Subjects are asked to participate in an MRI study on one of several scanners&#xD;
      to measure blood flow in the brain, concentrations of certain chemicals in the brain, or&#xD;
      magnetic properties of the brain. MRI uses a strong magnet and radio waves to obtain pictures&#xD;
      of the brain. The subject lies still on a narrow bed with a metal coil close to the head. For&#xD;
      this study, subjects may be asked to wear a special coil on the neck to help measure blood&#xD;
      flow. They may be asked to watch a screen presenting images or to do a task in which they&#xD;
      respond to pictures or sounds and may be asked to return for additional scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;&lt;TAB&gt;Neuropsychological testing: Subjects may undergo tests of cognitive performance. Often,&#xD;
      people with mood disorders have subtle changes in performance on these tests that allow&#xD;
      researchers to pinpoint where brain abnormalities occur. Before the tests can be used in&#xD;
      patients, they must be validated by using healthy subjects. These tests are presented either&#xD;
      orally, in written form, or on a computer.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major component of understanding the pathogenesis of mood and anxiety disorders is expected&#xD;
      to involve elucidation of abnormalities in brain structure and function associated with these&#xD;
      conditions. Historically post-mortem histopathological and neurochemical assessments&#xD;
      constituted the primary methods for investigating abnormalities of brain structure and&#xD;
      function in psychiatric disorders. However, the significance of the results from such studies&#xD;
      has been limited by the relatively poor availability of specimens from subjects with mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders who had been unmedicated and clinically well-characterized antemortem. By&#xD;
      allowing for in vivo human studies, medical imaging technologies provide efficient, accurate,&#xD;
      and non-invasive alternatives for characterizing brain structure and function. The recent&#xD;
      rapid development of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technology, in particular, has provided&#xD;
      powerful tools for assessing a wide range of cerebral physiological and morphological&#xD;
      characteristics. To optimally exploit the potential of these rapidly evolving MRI scanning&#xD;
      and hardware capabilities in investigations of mood and anxiety disorders, new techniques and&#xD;
      applications must be developed and tested. The technical development protocol proposed herein&#xD;
      will assess new imaging techniques and hardware, and will develop novel cognitive tasks for&#xD;
      application in the study of mood and anxiety disorders. The primary objective of this&#xD;
      protocol is the development of MRI experiments for characterizing the physiological&#xD;
      correlates of mood and anxiety disorders. In addition, the pilot projects encompassed within&#xD;
      this protocol involve the optimization of existing MRI pulse sequences, the application of&#xD;
      new pulse sequences for structural and functional MR imaging, and the development of new&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI) tasks that can elucidate neural function within the&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral domains affected in mood and anxiety disorders. This protocol will also&#xD;
      allow testing of existing imaging hardware that can increase the spatial resolution,&#xD;
      contrast, and sensitivity of MR images. Such hardware includes the use of multi-channel radio&#xD;
      frequency (RF) coils and patient monitoring equipment. Development of these techniques and&#xD;
      applications will directly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of MRI studies of mood and&#xD;
      anxiety disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve 250 healthy volunteers and 90 patients with major depressive&#xD;
      disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This technical development protocol will assess new imaging techniques and hardware, and will&#xD;
      develop novel cognitive tasks for application in the study of mood and anxiety disorders.&#xD;
      Subjects may have the option to participate in one or several procedures conducted under this&#xD;
      protocol, including fMRI, Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS), Magnetoencephalography&#xD;
      (MEG), behavioral tasks, and rating scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures on neuropsychological tests will include parameters such as accuracy&#xD;
      and reaction time. Secondary outcome measures will include differences in reaction time or&#xD;
      accuracy between different testing conditions. Outcome measures from MRI scanning sessions&#xD;
      will include signal-to-noise ratio, contrast-to-noise ratio, structural volumes, metabolite&#xD;
      concentrations (in the case of MRS), relaxation times (in the case of relaxometry), and BOLD&#xD;
      time series (in the case of fMRI).&#xD;
