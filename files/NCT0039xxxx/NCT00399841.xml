  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and patient preference for&#xD;
      spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using the Precision device with the electrode array placed at&#xD;
      T7 versus placement at T8. Eligible patients will have chronic intractable pain in the back&#xD;
      or lower extremities and will have independently elected SCS as the next line of therapy.&#xD;
      There is some anecdotal evidence that the coverage of the paresthesia resulting from T7&#xD;
      placement is preferable to that obtained by the more commonly used T8 placement but there has&#xD;
      been no study to support this observation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The conventional implantation of the spinal cord stimulator calls for dual percutaneous leads&#xD;
      placed at T8-T9 vertebral levels. Recently published studies as outlined in a letter to the&#xD;
      editor of Neuromodulation suggest that a &quot;well placed single lead will generally perform&#xD;
      better than a dual lead.&quot; Furthermore, anecdotal reports suggest that lead placement at T7&#xD;
      will capture axial back pain with greater success compared to lead placement at alternative&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to achieve better pain treatment and paresthesia coverage by placing a single&#xD;
      lead at T7.&#xD;
