    <textblock>
      Mother-to-child transmission of HIV is an important but preventable mode of infection.&#xD;
      Prevention depends on identifying pregnant women infected with HIV and offering medications&#xD;
      during pregnancy which can dramatically decrease the chances of transmission. Currently&#xD;
      universal screening of all pregnant women for HIV is recommended in the province of Ontario.&#xD;
      Unfortunately the rates of screening are still low: estimates place the average rate at 50%&#xD;
      -60%. We believe that rates in our clinic at the Women's Health Care Centre are significantly&#xD;
      higher in part because all our patients have a first obstetrical visit. This is an unhurried&#xD;
      visit with a trained obstetrical nurse who offers pre-test counselling and explores reasons&#xD;
      why patients refuse testing. We hypothesize that with this system, acceptance rates for HIV&#xD;
      screening are significantly higher than the provincial average.&#xD;

      We hypothesize that by having a dedicated and unhurried intake visit with a trained&#xD;
      obstetrical nurse, pregnant women will be more likely to accept antenatal HIV testing. We&#xD;
      further hypothesize that in our obstetrical clinic at the Women's Health Care Centre, the&#xD;
      application of a universal opt-out screening policy will result in a testing rate that is&#xD;
      higher than the provincial average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a two part study. The first part will be a retrospective chart review while the&#xD;
      second part will be a prospective cohort study. All antenatal patients with first visits at&#xD;
      our clinic will be included. For the retrospective portion, 537 charts will be reviewed. For&#xD;
      the prospective portion, 537 patients will be enrolled prospectively using a data sheet which&#xD;
      will be included in all charts starting when the study begins. For both portions, the&#xD;
      following information will be obtained:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  presence of HIV test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  result of test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if test not performed, the reason documented, in any&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if testing refused, the reason for refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information that will be obtained includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of HIV positive pregnant women cared for in our clinic during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  percentage of positive cases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  difference in testing (acceptance) rates between the retrospective and prospective (when&#xD;
           data sheet in use) portions of the study.&#xD;
