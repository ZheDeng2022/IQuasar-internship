      The purpose of the study was to characterize the safety, effectiveness, and impact on quality&#xD;
      of life (QOL) measures of OROSÂ® hydromorphone HCL in patients with chronic low back pain.&#xD;

      This study was a short-term, non-randomized (each patient was assigned the same treatment&#xD;
      from phase I through phase III by the researchers), non-comparative, open-label, repeated&#xD;
      dose study of OROS® hydromorphone HCL consisting of 3 phases: Phase 1 - prior opioid&#xD;
      stabilization phase (2-7 days); Phase 2 - OROS® hydromorphone HCL conversion, titration, and&#xD;
      stabilization phase (3 - 14 days); Phase 3 - OROS® hydromorphone HCL maintenance therapy&#xD;
      phase (28 days) Before Phase 1, patients must have had no change in their prescribed opioid&#xD;
      regimen over the prior 30 days. During Phase 1, patients were to have demonstrated 2&#xD;
      consecutive days of stable baseline oral or transdermal opioid medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 2, patients requiring =96 mg OROS® hydromorphone HCL every 24 hours converted to&#xD;
      a once-daily dosing OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose at approximately a 5:1 morphine to&#xD;
      hydromorphone equivalent ratio. OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose titration (25-100% baseline&#xD;
      dose) was allowed every 2 days to achieve stabilization. OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose&#xD;
      reduction was allowed during Phases 2 and 3 for opioid-related adverse events (AEs). Rescue&#xD;
      medication, Dilaudid IR (immediate release) was allowed during all 3 phases. During Phase 3,&#xD;
      patients attended 4 weekly study visits to provide diary information about study medication&#xD;
      and rescue medication usage, daily pain relief scores and adverse events, and to receive&#xD;
      weekly supplies of study medications. OROS® hydromorphone HCL tablets of 8,16, 32, or 64 mg&#xD;
      depending on Phase I stable baseline oral or transdermal opioid medication, 2-7 days; study&#xD;
      drug dose titration was allowed every 2 days to achieve stabilization in Phase II, 3-14 days;&#xD;
      Phase III , maintenance therapy phase 28 days; study drug dose reduction was allowed during&#xD;
      Phase 2 and 3 for opioid-related adverse events. Rescue medication of Dilaudid IR (immediate&#xD;
      release) 2, 4, 8mg tablets were allowed during all phase.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with chronic low back pain who were currently receiving strong oral or&#xD;
             transdermal opioid analgesics on a daily basis, or patients suitable for advancement&#xD;
             of therapy to step 3 of the World Health Organization (WHO) analgesic ladder were&#xD;
             considered for enrollment in the study. Patients requiring &gt;8 and =96 mg of OROS®&#xD;
             hydromorphone HCL every 24 hours were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
