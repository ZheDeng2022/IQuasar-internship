  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the drug perifosine in combination with Gemcitabine. Perifosine is an oral&#xD;
      anti-cancer agent that has been used in more than 140 people, but has not been combined with&#xD;
      other drugs before this study. The study is designed to determine the highest dose of&#xD;
      perifosine that can be administered to people every day while they are on a Gemcitabine&#xD;
      regimen, without severe or prolonged nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. This study starts with&#xD;
      patients taking 50 mg/day and goes up to 150 mg/day. After the highest tolerable dose is&#xD;
      found, we will add 10 more patients at that dose.&#xD;

      This is a phase 1, open-label trial of perifosine and gemcitabine in patients with&#xD;
      malignancies for whom single agent gemcitabine is a reasonable treatment option. All patients&#xD;
      will receive gemcitabine at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle. Patients&#xD;
      will receive perifosine orally at a dose of 50, 100 or 150 mg per day for the first 14 days&#xD;
      of the 21-day cycle. Cohorts of 3 patients will be treated with doses of 50 mg administered&#xD;
      either once, twice or three times a day. In this study a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be&#xD;
      defined as a dose that can be given without grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity in more than&#xD;
      1/3 patients. If 2/3 patients in any cohort encounter a grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity,&#xD;
      an additional 3 patients will be added. If the dose is intolerable for &gt;3/6 patients then the&#xD;
      previous level will be declared the MTD. Once an MTD has been determined an additional 10&#xD;
      patients will be added at the MTD to better define the expected toxicities.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer for&#xD;
             which treatment with single agent gemcitabine would be an appropriate treatment option&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received no more than two prior chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0 to 2 according to the ECOG criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from any acute toxicity related to prior therapy,&#xD;
             including surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to ingest oral medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating are ineligible. All females of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours of&#xD;
             treatment. Men and women of childbearing potential must agree to employ adequate&#xD;
             contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;
             informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents or devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection and psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with perifosine.&#xD;
             HIV-positive patients not receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy must be&#xD;
             approved by the study chair prior to entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment) or New York Heart Assoc. class&#xD;
             II-IV congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radiation therapy to &gt; 50% of marrow producing sites.&#xD;
