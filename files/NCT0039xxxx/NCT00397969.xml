      RATIONALE: Receiving a reminder letter from their doctor may increase the frequency of&#xD;
      colonoscopy in patients who have had a colorectal polyp removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well a reminder letter from their&#xD;
      doctor improves the frequency of colonoscopy in patients who have had a colorectal polyp&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether rates of surveillance colonoscopy can be substantially increased by&#xD;
           linking computerized data on endoscopic screening procedures to computerized pathology&#xD;
           data to identify patients with prior adenomatous polyps who are due for repeat&#xD;
           colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate whether the impact of the intervention varies by patient characteristics,&#xD;
           including age, sex, or site of primary care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled, crossover study. Patients are stratified according&#xD;
      to age (â‰¤ 65 years of age vs &gt; 65 years of age), gender, time elapsed since last colonoscopy,&#xD;
      and primary care physician's (PCP) membership in Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates (yes vs&#xD;
      no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: PCPs are mailed response forms (regarding the disposition of their eligible&#xD;
           patients [e.g. patient letter mailed, patient called, scheduled for colonoscopy,&#xD;
           colonoscopy completed elsewhere, patient refused procedure, clinical contraindication,&#xD;
           patient deceased]) and letters reminding them that their patients are due for a&#xD;
           follow-up colonoscopy. PCPs who do not return response forms within 4 weeks are sent a&#xD;
           second set of reminders and patient letters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Six months after the beginning of the study, PCPs are mailed response forms and&#xD;
           patient letters once. A second set of reminders and patient letters are not sent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 800 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
