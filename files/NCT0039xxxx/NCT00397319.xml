  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate specific markers of cardiovascular risk before and after growth hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy in a population of growth hormone deficient adults, as compared to an&#xD;
      age, gender, and BMI-matched healthy population.&#xD;

      Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. The effects of such a deficiency include decreased exercise capacity and&#xD;
      tolerance, impaired cardiac function, a central fat redistribution, increased peripheral&#xD;
      arterial resistance, and an unfavorable lipid profile. These effects have been found to be&#xD;
      reversed with appropriate replacement therapy with recombinant human growth hormone. We plan&#xD;
      to utilize several experimental systems to further investigate the role of growth hormone&#xD;
      (GH) in maintaining cardiovascular health. In particular, we would like to further understand&#xD;
      the interaction of GH with Plasminogen-activator-inhibitor-1 (a major activator of the&#xD;
      fibrinolytic system) as well as the role of GH in the maintenance of vascular function.&#xD;

    Inadequate retention of GHD adults to maintain power to study the effect of GH on fibrinolysis.&#xD;
