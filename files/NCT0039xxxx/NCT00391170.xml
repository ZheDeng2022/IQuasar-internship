      This study will determine if a dexamethasone mouth rinse can reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      oral chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) in patients who have undergone a bone marrow&#xD;
      (stem cell) transplant procedure. cGVHD is a common complication of stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation, resulting from the donor cells attacking the transplant recipient's tissues.&#xD;
      In oral cGVHD, the tissues in the mouth are damaged, causing painful mouth sores.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat inflammation. It is the only&#xD;
      corticosteroid available that can be used as a mouth rinse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 12 years of age or older who have received a stem cell transplant may be eligible to&#xD;
      participate if they are enrolled within 70 to 90 days of their transplant. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history and oral exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to receive either the dexamethasone rinse or a placebo (a&#xD;
      solution that looks and tastes like the dexamethasone rinse but has no active medication).&#xD;
      They undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with the study solution. Patients rinse their mouth with the dexamethasone solution&#xD;
      or placebo three times a day for 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinic visits before starting treatment and at 1, 2 and 3 months after starting the study&#xD;
      drug for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral exam (before starting treatment and at each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photographs of the mouth (before starting treatment and at 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy from inside the cheek (before starting treatment). The inside of the cheek is&#xD;
           numbed and a small piece of tissue is removed for examination by a pathologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva sample collection (before starting treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draw (before starting treatment and at each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality-of-life questionnaires (before starting treatment and at 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaire to assess level of dry mouth and mouth pain (before starting treatment and&#xD;
           at each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of medications (at each visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACTH stimulation test to evaluate adrenal gland function (at 3 months). Patients are&#xD;
           given an injection of a drug called &quot;ACTH&quot; or &quot;cosynthropin,&quot; which is a version of a&#xD;
           hormone normally produced by the pituitary gland. Blood samples are drawn before the&#xD;
           injection and at 30 and 60 minutes after the injection to measure levels of the hormone&#xD;
           cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment ends, participants are contacted by telephone every month for 6 months to&#xD;
      report any symptoms of cGVHD, and they return to the clinic at 6 months for a final&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;

      Prevention of oral chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) by topical agents is an&#xD;
      attractive strategy because it would potentially avoid the adverse effects associated with&#xD;
      systemic immunosuppression. Topically administered dexamethasone solution is a commonly used&#xD;
      agent for the prophylaxis of oral inflammatory conditions including GVHD. However, the&#xD;
      efficacy and systemic effects of topically administered dexamethasone solution are unknown.&#xD;
      We therefore propose this trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of topical&#xD;
      dexamethasone solution for prevention of oral chronic GVHD in stem cell transplant&#xD;
      recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot phase II study will follow a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled,&#xD;
      parallel group design. Consenting subjects who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation at the NIH Clinical Center and the surrounding transplant clinics will be&#xD;
      randomized 50/50 to receive dexamethasone 0.01% solution or placebo as an oral rinse for 3&#xD;
      months starting 90-100 days post-transplant. Subjects will be evaluated monthly after the&#xD;
      start of intervention. Diagnostic and research evaluations will include a complete oral&#xD;
      examination, oral mucosal biopsy prior to the beginning of the intervention (day -7) and at&#xD;
      the time of development of oral chronic GVHD or at the completion of intervention in the&#xD;
      absence of clinical GVHD. We will measure serum dexamethasone levels and perform short&#xD;
      cosyntropin (ACTH stimulation) test at the end of the 3 months of intervention or onset of&#xD;
      clinically significant GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topical&#xD;
      dexamethasone 0.01% solution used as an oral rinse for prevention of oral chronic GVHD. Our&#xD;
      primary endpoint will be the proportion of subjects that develop clinically significant&#xD;
      (severity score 3 or higher) oral chronic GVHD after three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will include the impact of oral chronic GVHD on the quality of life,&#xD;
      characterization of the changes in tissue and salivary biomarkers associated with development&#xD;
      of oral graft versus host disease, and measures of the effects of topical dexamethasone on&#xD;
      hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis. Secondary outcomes will include oral cavity specific&#xD;
      quality of life as measured by OHIP-14 questionnaire, oral discomfort levels, improvement in&#xD;
      general quality of life scores, and severity of oral chronic GVHD as measured by the&#xD;
      site-specific GVHD scoring system.&#xD;
