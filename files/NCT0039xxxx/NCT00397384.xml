  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of erlotinib hydrochloride when&#xD;
      given together with cetuximab and to see how well they work in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced gastrointestinal cancer, head and neck cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, or&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as cetuximab, can&#xD;
      block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them.&#xD;
      Erlotinib hydrochloride and cetuximab may also stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      blood flow to the tumor. Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together with cetuximab may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). II. To identify the recommended dose (RD)&#xD;
      for phase II of erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in combination with cetuximab in patients&#xD;
      (pts) with incurable gastrointestinal, head and neck, or non-small cell lung cancers that are&#xD;
      Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). II. To perform skin and tumor biopsies to&#xD;
      analyze molecular inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling&#xD;
      pathway, defined as a &gt;= 75% inhibition of phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      (EGF) receptor or of its downstream effectors tumor protein (p)44/42 mitogen-activated&#xD;
      protein kinase (MAPK) or protein kinase B (Akt) or as a &gt;= 25% decrease of marker of&#xD;
      proliferation Ki-67 (Ki67) from baseline in either skin or tumor tissue in the majority of&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To identify the optimal biological dose (OBD). IV. To describe any antitumor effect&#xD;
      observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of erlotinib hydrochloride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive cetuximab intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1, 8, and 15 and&#xD;
      erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 8-21. Treatment repeats every 21&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 4 weeks.&#xD;

             examination using a vital dye (e.g., fluorescein, Bengal-Rose), and/or an abnormal&#xD;
