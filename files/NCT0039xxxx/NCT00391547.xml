  <brief_summary>

      The primary purpose is to demonstrate the efficacy of a prescription mouthrinse in human&#xD;
      subjects for treatment of Gingivitis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gingivitis is an endemic disease that is a precursor to periodontal disease. Two mouthrinse&#xD;
      agents, Peridex and Listerine, have received the Seal of Acceptance from the Council on&#xD;
      Dental Therapeutics of the American Dental Association for the control of supragingival&#xD;
      plaque and gingivitis. Peridex (0.12% chlorhexidine, bisbiguanide cationic detergent) is a&#xD;
      prescription mouthrinse that demonstrates potent anti-plaque and anti-gingivitis action.&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine rinses are also prescribed to prevent post surgical infections. Chlorhexidine&#xD;
      has broad spectrum antibacterial activity and substantivity. With prolonged use,&#xD;
      chlorhexidine maintains its effectiveness but causes staining of natural teeth and composite&#xD;
      materials used in restorative dentistry. Other side effects associated with chlorhexidine are&#xD;
      calculus formation and possible alterations in taste. Although chlorhexidine rinses and&#xD;
      supragingival irrigations have demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing plaque and&#xD;
      gingivitis, chlorhexidine has had a minimal impact in treating periodontal disease.&#xD;
      Listerine, comprised of essential oils, is an over-the-counter mouthrinse that is less&#xD;
      effective than chlorhexidine in controlling plaque and gingivitis, but has minimal side&#xD;
      effects. Other agents such as quaternary ammonium compounds and metal salts are rarely used&#xD;
      alone but can be used in combination with other antimicrobial rinses to enhance their&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;

             determined by Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have 16 natural, gradable teeth and good dental health, as determined by Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have &gt; 25% sites with GI scores &gt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have average PI score &gt; 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of effective method of contraception for the duration of the study or permanently&#xD;
             sterilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to comply with study requirements including following instructions on&#xD;
             study treatment (drug) and returning for follow-up visits as required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have full understanding of all elements of, and signature and dating of the written&#xD;
        informed consent prior to the initiation of protocol specified procedures. Females with&#xD;
        childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test before and during the study&#xD;
        period. Sexually active females must be using an effective form of birth control. These&#xD;
        methods include oral contraceptives (&quot;the pill&quot;), an intrauterine device (IUD),&#xD;
        levonogestrol implants (Norplant®), medroxyprogesterone acetate injections (Depo-provera®)&#xD;
        or contraceptive foam with a condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

        Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not eligible for participation&#xD;

          -  History, or current evidence, of any significant acute or chronic medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would render&#xD;
             examination difficult or invalid or prevent the subject from active study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treatment with antibiotic within the one (1) month period prior to the screening&#xD;
