    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to study the patterns of metabolite changes in subjects with asthma&#xD;
      to determine if there is a predictable pattern prior to, and post, clinical exacerbation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: 1. Metabolite profiles will change prior to detection of a clinical exacerbation&#xD;
      in subjects with asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. There will be a measurable temporal delay before metabolite profiles return to baseline&#xD;
      following anti-inflammatory therapy of an exacerbation of asthma.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study 20, non-smoking, asthmatic adults. Subjects will be recruited from&#xD;
      outpatient asthma clinics in Edmonton. All subjects will meet GINA criteria for mild&#xD;
      persistent to moderate persistent asthma. Following informed consent we will obtain blood,&#xD;
      induced sputum and urine samples after an overnight fast and free of any caffeine for at&#xD;
      least 24 hours. We will also obtain routine demographic information including age, sex, and&#xD;
      usual asthma medication usage. We will obtain health related quality of life status using&#xD;
      generic (15D) and disease specific (Asthma Quality of Life) questionnaires. Subjects will be&#xD;
      instructed regarding use of peak flow meters and the typical symptoms associated with loss of&#xD;
      asthma control. They will be instructed regarding accessing a dedicated asthma website that&#xD;
      incorporates the above questions (Visit 1). There is also a place for subjects to enter twice&#xD;
      daily peak flow measurements. The website is password protected and each subject can access&#xD;
      only their own individualized data entry pages. A research coordinator is able to access any&#xD;
      subject data again using a unique password. We will use this internet-based program to&#xD;
      monitor daily PEF and daily asthma symptoms. Patients will be instructed to access the&#xD;
      website daily and will reassessed at 2 weeks. Subjects will then be instructed to continue&#xD;
      with their usual asthma management and to log on to the asthma website daily to record&#xD;
      symptoms and twice daily peak flows. Only subjects meeting criteria for well controlled&#xD;
      asthma (GOAL criteria) along with objective compliance with study protocols over 2 weeks will&#xD;
      then be enrolled in the next phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1. After two weeks, subjects will return (Visit 2). At this time a blood (10 ml) and&#xD;
      urine sample will be obtained and stored for subsequent metabolomic analysis. An exhaled gas&#xD;
      sample will be collected and analyzed for nitric oxide concentration using a sensitive&#xD;
      chemiluminescence technique. An induced sputum sample will also be obtained using&#xD;
      standardized protocols and cell count and differential will be determined. The remainder of&#xD;
      the sputum sample will also be stored for subsequent analysis. All tests will be performed in&#xD;
      the morning after an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2. During the second phase of the study, subjects will be instructed to reduce their&#xD;
      controller medication (inhaled corticosteroid alone or combined inhaled corticosteroid with&#xD;
      long acting beta 2 agonist) by 50% e.g. from 4 puffs daily to 2 puffs daily. Subjects will&#xD;
      log on to their website daily for 4 weeks or until they experience a mild exacerbation (see&#xD;
      definition below). If they experience a clinical exacerbation, they will be instructed to&#xD;
      return to the hospital site where repeat blood, urine, exhaled air and sputum testing will be&#xD;
      obtained (Visit 3a). They will be instructed to increase their controller medication and to&#xD;
      continue with the increased steroid phase of the study. Those not experiencing a clinical&#xD;
      exacerbation will return to the hospital site at the end of the four weeks (Visit 3b). They&#xD;
      will have repeat blood, urine and sputum samples and will then be instructed to eliminate&#xD;
      controller medication for four weeks or until they experience a clinical exacerbation. Those&#xD;
      experiencing a clinical exacerbation will be treated as outlined above. Those continuing to&#xD;
      experience clinical good control will be brought back at four weeks for repeat blood, urine,&#xD;
      exhaled air and sputum analysis (Visit 3c). Throughout the 4-8 week period of inhaled steroid&#xD;
      withdrawal, patients will be asked to save a urine sample three times weekly. These samples&#xD;
      will be stored in pre-labeled containers in their freezer until picked up by the study&#xD;
      coordinator at weekly intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3. After a patient experiences a mild exacerbation or at the end of 8 weeks of steroid&#xD;
      reduction and elimination, patients will enter the final phase of the study. At that time all&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to increase their controller medication back to their baseline&#xD;
      values. They will be followed for four weeks and repeat blood, urine, exhaled air and sputum&#xD;
      samples will be obtained (Visit 4). Finally, subjects will be instructed to double their&#xD;
      usual controller medication for four weeks after which repeat blood, urine and sputum samples&#xD;
      will be obtained. Again, subjects will collect and store urine samples at a frequency of 3&#xD;
      times per week. The subjects will then be instructed to resume their usual asthma controller&#xD;
      medication dosing and the study will be complete (Visit 5). All tests will be performed in&#xD;
      the morning after an overnight fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mild exacerbation will be defined by any one of the following events:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A decrease in peak flow to less than 80% of best effort for two consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. An increase in reliever medication (fast acting beta 2 agonist) by 50% over baseline&#xD;
           needs for two consecutive days&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Waking at night due to asthma on two consecutive nights A severe exacerbation will be&#xD;
           defined as any need for additional medical contact for treatment of asthma (e.g.&#xD;
           Emergency Room, Walk-in Clinic) or any hospital admission for asthma. The need for oral&#xD;
           corticosteroids will also constitute a severe exacerbation. If at any point the subjects&#xD;
           undergo a severe exacerbation, they will be examined by either their own treating&#xD;
           physician or by one of the physicians associated with this study and appropriate&#xD;
           escalation of treatment will be commenced. The REB will be informed of all severe&#xD;
           exacerbations. The study coordinator and one of the study physicians will be available&#xD;
           by pager around the clock during the course of the study.&#xD;
