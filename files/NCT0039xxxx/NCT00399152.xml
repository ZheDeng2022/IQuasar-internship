      This study is a Phase I trial in two parts. In part 1, a MTD to the combination of perifosine&#xD;
      and sunitinib malate will be determined. In part 2, with the MTD as a starting point, a group&#xD;
      of patients will be accrued with the goal of ensuring that they will be able to tolerate at&#xD;
      least two courses of therapy, which would make them evaluable for response in a Phase II&#xD;
      study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I trial in two parts. In part 1, an MTD to the combination of&#xD;
      perifosine and sunitinib malate will be determined. In some previous trials with perifosine&#xD;
      and other biologic agents, doses determined in Phase I studies are not as well tolerated in&#xD;
      larger groups of patients when response is an endpoint. Thus in part 2, with the MTD as a&#xD;
      starting point, a group of patients will be accrued with the goal of ensuring that they will&#xD;
      be able to tolerate at least two courses of therapy, which would make them evaluable for&#xD;
      response in a Phase II study. As a secondary endpoint, the effects of the combination of&#xD;
      perifosine and sunitinib malate will be evaluated for response rate and time to progression.&#xD;
      The pharmacokinetics of the combination of the study drugs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purposes of this study, one cycle of therapy will be defined as 6 weeks. Patients&#xD;
      will take one 50 mg tablet of perifosine one to three times a day and sunitinib malate once a&#xD;
      day for 4 out of 6 weeks. Patients may need anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheals. Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated for progression or response at 12-week intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience toxicity may continue on treatment with doses delayed or reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients should continue therapy unless disease progression is documented on two&#xD;
      occasions at least four weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 of this Phase I study will accrue from six to 24 patients depending on the number of&#xD;
      dose levels evaluated. Up to six patients will be treated at each dose level. A dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) will be defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 3 or greater non-hematologic toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Grade 4 hematologic toxicity&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of renal tumor or&#xD;
             GIST are eligible for this protocol. Patients with other solid tumor types must have&#xD;
             their cases reviewed by the OCOG medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The physician must believe that the patient's course and the growth rate of the tumor&#xD;
             are such that the patient would feel comfortable continuing treatment for 12 weeks&#xD;
             even if there is a transient period of modest tumor growth during the first weeks&#xD;
             following the initiation of perifosine and sunitinib malate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a life expectancy of more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have received prior sorafenib or sunitinib malate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have measurable or evaluable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should have a performance status of 0 to 1 according to the ECOG criteria.&#xD;
             However, patients with ECOG performance status of 2 may be admitted with approval from&#xD;
             the study chairman or medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function, unless in the opinion of the&#xD;
             treating investigator, the abnormality is related to tumor and the study chairman or&#xD;
             medical monitor agree the abnormality is unlikely to affect the safety of perifosine&#xD;
             and/or sunitinib use.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from acute toxicity related to prior therapy including&#xD;
             surgery or radiotherapy, excluding alopecia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to ingest oral medications or to obtain them through a&#xD;
             gastrostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written&#xD;

             the previous regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had more than three prior systemic therapies, including biologics,&#xD;
             are excluded unless prior approval is obtained from the medical monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents or devices&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients initiating a treatment for their cancer within the last two months who will&#xD;
             be continued concomitantly with perifosine&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to perifosine (miltefosine or edelfosine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection and psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;

             phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             sunitinib. Patients who are no longer taking strong CYP3A4 inhibitors and/or inducers&#xD;
             are ineligible unless they have discontinued use 4 weeks prior to beginning therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from&#xD;
             the study because of possible pharmacokinetic interactions with perifosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of unstable or newly diagnosed angina pectoris, recent&#xD;
             myocardial infarction (within 6 months of enrollment), or New York Heart Association&#xD;
