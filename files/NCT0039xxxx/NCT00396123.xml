  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Humans have cells in their blood stream called endothelial progenitor cells or EPCs. These&#xD;
      are thought to be important in keeping blood vessels healthy. People with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD) have low numbers of these cells. People with cardiovascular (heart and blood&#xD;
      vessel) disease also have low numbers. Patients with CKD have more cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      then any other group.Erythropoietin is a hormone made by the kidneys. It is essential for&#xD;
      making red blood cells and also activates EPCs. It is low in people with kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of your regular medical care for correcting your low red blood cell count, you will&#xD;
      be receiving a medication that acts like erythropoietin. It is called darbepoetin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if darbepoetin treatment affects EPC numbers and&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The majority of patients with kidney disease, an estimated 20 million adults in the U.S.,&#xD;
      will die of cardiovascular disease. Further, the risk for cardiovascular events is 2-3 fold&#xD;
      higher than in the general population and increases with the severity of renal impairment&#xD;
      [1]. Reasons for this accelerated atherosclerotic process are unclear. Recent evidence&#xD;
      suggests that endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) are critical to maintaining vascular&#xD;
      integrity [2]. Patient populations with low circulating EPCs, including patients with kidney&#xD;
      disease, have excess vascular disease burden. The hematopoietic cytokine, erythropoietin, is&#xD;
      a key regulator of EPCs and is reduced in patients with kidney disease [3]. Therefore, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that supplementation with the erythropoietin analog, darbepoetin, enhances EPC&#xD;
      function leading to improvement in vascular repair mechanisms in patients with chronic (CKD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To begin to explore this hypothesis, we will pursue the following specific aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the effects of darbepoetin on EPC number in patients with anemia related to&#xD;
           CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the effects of darbepoetin on EPC function in patients with anemia related to&#xD;
           CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the effects of darbepoetin on proangiogenic factors in patients with anemia&#xD;
           related to CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies will expand our understanding and potentially guide therapy aimed at reducing&#xD;
      the excess cardiovascular disease burden in high risk populations.&#xD;
