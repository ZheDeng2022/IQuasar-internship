  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2004 there were more than 40 million people infected Worldwide with HIV, with&#xD;
      an estimated 16,000 new infections every day (UNAIDS, 2004). The HIV epidemic threatens whole&#xD;
      societies particularly in Africa and Asia and rates of infections in the Western Countries&#xD;
      have also increased over the last few years. However, despite more than 15 years of research,&#xD;
      an effective vaccine against HIV and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has still not&#xD;
      been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is considerable evidence that cellular immune responses can effectively control HIV-1&#xD;
      replication during acute and chronic infections thereby possibly protecting individuals from&#xD;
      infection and preventing the spread of HIV. To be truly effective in the general population,&#xD;
      a vaccine must induce responses specific to immunologically conserved regions. The&#xD;
      epitope-based vaccine MVA-mBN32 represent a very logical approach to this problem because its&#xD;
      potential to elicit a polyfunctional immune response and to focus these responses to&#xD;
      conserved epitopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a recombinant MVA-BN® expressing&#xD;
      CTL and HTL epitopes of HIV-1 (MVA-mBN32) vs. the vector control MVA-BN® in 30 HIV-infected&#xD;
      subjects will be examined. This will include a full analysis of CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+&#xD;
      CTL responses to these epitopes, to establish the potential of such a homologous prime-boost&#xD;
      vaccine approach to induce a broad cell-mediated response to different HIV antigens.&#xD;
