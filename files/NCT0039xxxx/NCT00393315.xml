      The aim of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of the Paclitaxel-eluting&#xD;
      PTCA-balloon in the treatment of in-stent restenoses in native coronary arteries with&#xD;
      reference diameters between 2.5 mm and 3.5 mm and ≤ 22 mm in length for procedural success&#xD;
      and preservation of vessel patency in comparison to the Paclitaxel-eluting Taxus™ stent.&#xD;

      Background information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent deployment for the treatment of coronary artery stenoses has evolved as the standard&#xD;
      treatment in nearly all types of coronary lesions over the past two decades.The initial&#xD;
      recurrence rate of bare stents in the range of 20 30 % in low risk stenoses has been further&#xD;
      reduced by devices with passive coatings such as silicon carbide, heparin, phosphorylcholine,&#xD;
      and carbon. The significant decline of in-stent restenoses (= ISR) to the order of 12 % was&#xD;
      achieved by active coatings like the cell-cycle inhibitor sirolimus and to about 13.7 % by&#xD;
      the cytotoxic paclitaxel. Taken into account the more than one million annual stent&#xD;
      procedures performed worldwide even low recurrence rates will leave some hundred thousand&#xD;
      repeat procedures annually. In the treatment of in-stent restenoses, however, approaches such&#xD;
      as stand alone angioplasty with conventional balloons, the repeat use of bare stents, cutting&#xD;
      balloon angioplasty, rotablation, and atherectomy have revealed unsatisfactory and often&#xD;
      conflicting results. For brachytherapy the late loss was reported in the range from 0.22 +/-&#xD;
      0.84 mm to 0.73 +/- 0.79mm. Due to its disadvantages such as delayed endothelialization with&#xD;
      ensuing late thrombosis cumulating in a 12-months cardiac event rate of up to 30% rising to&#xD;
      50% after five years, its decrease of benefit over time, and the cumbersome logistics at the&#xD;
      sites and in the labs, brachytherapy is not considered as a valid approach of the future.&#xD;
      Recently, the deployment of drug eluting stents into a restenotic device was associated with&#xD;
      restenosis rates in the range from 4% to 30% suggesting some advantage over the&#xD;
      aforementioned approaches. The wide range of the results and some late cardiac events still&#xD;
      leave room for alternative methods such as the Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Rationale The principle of the Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter is based on the&#xD;
      antiproliferative mode of action of the compound, the latter being homogenously distributed&#xD;
      along the entire length of the balloon and, hence, the vessel segment to be treated. This&#xD;
      advantage is in particular relevant in comparison to drug eluting stents as are the lack of&#xD;
      chronic mechanical alterations of the artery, the ease of access to the lesion, the obviation&#xD;
      of adding another layer of metal to the lesion, and the presumably lower cost of the&#xD;
      procedure. Data on the use of the Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter on the treatment&#xD;
      of in-stent restenoses, however, are scant. In the animal model and according to unpublished&#xD;
      results in humans, the proliferation induced by a Paclitaxel-eluting balloon catheter was&#xD;
      significantly less compared to an uncoated balloon and to the Sirolimus-eluting Cypher™&#xD;
      stent.Therefore, it is prudent to compare the direct arterial application of Paclitaxel by&#xD;
      means of the Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter versus the Paclitaxel-eluting&#xD;
      Taxus™-stent as percutaneous transluminal treatment options of in-stent restenosis in human&#xD;
      coronary arteries in a prospective randomized pilot study.&#xD;
