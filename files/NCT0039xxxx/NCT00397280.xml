    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the response of immune cells (neutrophils, monocytes) to various&#xD;
      signals in the test tube to determine how they sense the signals in the body and what&#xD;
      substances they produce in response to them. It will determine how the cells may, under&#xD;
      certain circumstances, contribute to inflammation, and will measure substances in the blood&#xD;
      plasma (the liquid, non-cellular part of the blood) that might stimulate white blood cells,&#xD;
      in order to understand how the blood responds to possible disease-related conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older who weigh at least 110 pounds may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Participants give about 320 milliliters (mL) of blood (about 1 1/3&#xD;
      cups) or less at each donation. They donate no more than once every 8 weeks and no more than&#xD;
      six times a year. On some occasions, less than 320 mL of blood may be drawn. The collected&#xD;
      blood is separated into its components and specific cells are exposed to substances to&#xD;
      examine their response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is several-fold. We wish to determine the response of white blood&#xD;
      cells (neutrophils, monocytes, eosinophils, lymphocytes) to various signals in the test tube,&#xD;
      to test how they sense the signals in the body, and what substances they produce. We wish to&#xD;
      determine how these cells may, under certain circumstances, contribute to inflammation. We&#xD;
      wish to measure the substances in the blood plasma that might contribute to stimulation of&#xD;
      white blood cells to understand the response of the whole blood to potential&#xD;
      disease-associated conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to define the signaling pathways activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and&#xD;
      other selected innate immunity stimuli, and the downstream inflammatory functional&#xD;
      consequences, in human leukocytes in vitro. Adult (18-65 yrs. old), nonpregnant, healthy&#xD;
      volunteers will have 320 ml of whole blood collected by venipuncture in a monitored setting&#xD;
      no more frequently than once every 8 weeks. No further interventions will be exercised upon&#xD;
      the subjects. The whole blood will be fractionated into neutrophil, red blood cell,&#xD;
      mononuclear cell, and plasma fractions using plasma-Percoll discontinuous centrifugation.&#xD;
      Leukocytes will be subjected in vitro to inflammatory stimuli (e.g., LPS), and selected&#xD;
      signaling outcomes (e.g., mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, Rho GTPase activation,&#xD;
      protein-protein interactions) and functional measures (e.g., chemotaxis, superoxide anion and&#xD;
      cytokine production) quantified in the absence and presence of relevant chemical inhibitors&#xD;
      (e.g., SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor). In each such experiment, cells from the daily donor&#xD;
      will be used as paired controls to the in vitro experimental intervention (e.g., SB203580&#xD;
      inhibitor vs. DMSO vehicle). Three or more repetitions (on different donors) of each specific&#xD;
      experimental outcome, as necessary, will be performed to establish statistical significance&#xD;
      of findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific focus of the studies planned will be to define the role of lipid raft membrane&#xD;
      microdomains in transduction of the LPS signal in human leukocytes. Lipid rafts are&#xD;
      cholesterol-rich microdomains in the plasma membrane, within which the LPS receptor,&#xD;
      Toll-like Receptor 4 (TLR4), has been described to reside. LPS signaling has been reported to&#xD;
      be sensitive to raft cholesterol content, presumably because the specific repertoire of&#xD;
      proteins in rafts is sensitive to raft cholesterol content. Rafts are thought to act as&#xD;
      dynamic signaling platforms for co-segregation of proximal adaptor proteins, kinases, and&#xD;
      other signaling proteins. Of interest, while LPS has been described to modulate the activity&#xD;
      of proteins that determine raft cholesterol content (egg, Liver X Receptor, ABCA1), virtually&#xD;
      no work has been done to clarify: 1) the mechanisms underlying LPS-induced intracellular&#xD;
      cholesterol redistribution, and, more importantly, 2) whether such intracellular&#xD;
      redistribution of cholesterol is causal to the signaling events triggered by LPS, or 3)&#xD;
      whether innate immunity signaling is dependent upon inter-subject variations in raft&#xD;
      cholesterol content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, we will investigate the role of the tumor suppressor gene p53 in the regulation&#xD;
      of inflammation. It is now widely accepted that inflammation and cancer development are&#xD;
      interconnected. Dr. Menendez is one of the international leaders in the study of the tumor&#xD;
      suppressor gene p53. His group has discovered that activation of p53 through exposure to&#xD;
      carcinogenic stimuli leads to differential expression of genes that have a direct effect on&#xD;
      the inflammatory response, such as several toll-like-receptor genes. Dr. Menendez will use&#xD;
      human leukocytes that will be isolated from whole blood. He will expose these cells to&#xD;
      stimuli that activate p53, such as doxorubicin (a chemotherapy agent) or radiation, and&#xD;
      examine the expression of toll-like-receptor genes as well as the response to LPS and other&#xD;
      inflammatory agents in vitro.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we will investigate the role of zinc-finger proteins in gene expression in&#xD;
      inflammatory cells. ZFP36 is an RNA binding zinc finger protein that is involved in the&#xD;
      turnover of mRNAs encoding several clinical important cytokines, including TNFa. Several&#xD;
      missense, promoter and 3'-untranslated variants have been identified in humans; in some&#xD;
      cases, these variants and their haplotypes have been associated with human inflammatory&#xD;
      disease. We will isolate peripheral blood macrophages and stimulate them with LPS and other&#xD;
      cytokines, then evaluate the behavior of cytokine mRNA and gene expression.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal, healthy adult donors as judged by screening questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonpregnant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Weighing at least 110 lbs&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18-65 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV negative (proof required every 6 months we will conduct test)*&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis C serology negative (checked every 6 months&#xD;
             we will conduct test)*&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The rationale for HIV and hepatitis viral testing is that chronic viral infection&#xD;
                  may alter and possibly invalidate our experimental results. HIV and hepatitis&#xD;
                  results will be confidentially obtained. Testing will be contracted to an&#xD;
                  external certified laboratory and will be paid for by the study group. Results&#xD;
                  will be available only to the study doctor/PI (Fessler), the study coordinator,&#xD;
                  the CRU Director (Garantziotis, LAI), and the donor, with the few caveats that&#xD;
                  follow&#xD;
&#xD;
        All positive HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C results will be promptly communicated to the&#xD;
        donor by the study doctor/PI or the CRU Director. The participant will be referred to their&#xD;
        physician and/or to the N.C. Department of Health for confirmatory testing and counseling.&#xD;
        As explained in detail in the attached Supplement describing N.C. State Department of&#xD;
        Health code will be followed. The state code mandates reporting of positive results along&#xD;
        with the participant s name and identifying information to the N.C. Department of Public&#xD;
        Health. Upon contracting with the testing laboratory, clarification will be obtained and&#xD;
        documented as to whether the contracted laboratory or the study MD will be responsible for&#xD;
        reporting positive results to the state to avoid duplication of reporting. Upon receipt of&#xD;
        the test results, the N.C. Department of Health will contact the participant to inform them&#xD;
        of the positive result, how to find care, how to avoid infecting others, how the newly&#xD;
        diagnosed HIV and/or hepatitis infection is reported, and the importance of informing their&#xD;
        partners at possible risk because of their HIV and/or hepatitis infection. If the HIV,&#xD;
        hepatitis B, and hepatitis C results are negative, the participant will be not be notified.&#xD;
        However, the participant may contact the research study nurse for their results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        HIV and hepatitis B/C test results, non-reactive and reactive, will be documented&#xD;
        confidentially by the PI or study coordinator in the subject s file, and kept in a locked&#xD;
        file cabinet in the CRU Medical Records Room.In order to document the reporting procedure&#xD;
        and the time associated with the reporting process, a document has been created and placed&#xD;
        in the study specific manual (Hepatitis B/C and HIV Notification Process for Reactive&#xD;
        Results Form)&#xD;
&#xD;
