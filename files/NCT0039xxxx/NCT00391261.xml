  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and tolerability of metformin&#xD;
      treatment in children and adolescents suffering from weight gain secondary to use of atypical&#xD;
      antipsychotic medications. In this 12 week, open-label study we will investigate metformin's&#xD;
      effects on weight control and/or weight loss. We hypothesize that metformin would prevent&#xD;
      further weight gain or lead to weight loss, resulting in amelioration of one of the most&#xD;
      significant side effects of atypical antipsychotic use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients taking olanzapine, risperidone, or quetiapine with increased BMI of at least 10%&#xD;
      over the previous 2 months of atypical therapy will be eligible for the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      need to have been on a stable dose of their antipsychotic medications at the time of&#xD;
      enrollment (stable x2 weeks) and will remain on the same atypical dose, if possible,&#xD;
      throughout the study. The dosing of metformin will start at 500mg per day and increase up to&#xD;
      a maximum dose of 1500mg daily. Determination of weight gain during the course of the study&#xD;
      will be based on the subject's weight at enrollment and subsequent visits. The patients will&#xD;
      be asked not to vary their dietary or physical activity habits during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interpretation of Data: The study's primary outcome measure will be change in weight and body&#xD;
      mass index at 12 weeks of metformin treatment. Additionally, skin-fold test and abdominal&#xD;
      girth will be measured at baseline and endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks: Generally, metformin is well-tolerated. However, there may be unknown risks associated&#xD;
      with exposure to a new medication in a clinical population where this specific compound has&#xD;
      not been studied extensively. The general and rare side effects are listed below. These risks&#xD;
      will be minimized by careful monitoring and higher than standard of care safety evaluations.&#xD;
      In addition, an individual's symptoms could potentially remain unchanged or worsen by&#xD;
      initiating this medication, or from delaying initiation of a potentially more effective&#xD;
      alternative treatment. For these reasons, participation in the study is entirely voluntary&#xD;
      and consent may be withdrawn at any time without any repercussions and will result in the&#xD;
      patient being immediately discontinued from the study. If at any time the clinician believes&#xD;
      that the patient is not benefiting from the study, the study will be discontinued and&#xD;
      endpoint measures will be obtained if possible. A risk-benefit analysis, weighing clinical&#xD;
      improvement against side effects will be done at each visit and will determine further&#xD;
      inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects and their guardians will be asked repeatedly to inform study staff of any side&#xD;
      effects. Subjects are informed of the potential side effects and the importance of alerting&#xD;
      study staff to the side effects in the consent and assent forms. Side effect data will be&#xD;
      collected at baseline and every other week, but subjects are encouraged to give relevant&#xD;
      information at every clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative treatments include no treatment with an attendant risk of increased weight gain,&#xD;
      potentially leading to health hazard. Other medications that are available are not&#xD;
      extensively used and widely accepted. These other medication options will be discussed as&#xD;
      alternatives during the consent process. Also, life-style modifications including healthy&#xD;
      diet habits and increased physical activity will be discussed during the consent process as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;

          3. Ability to give assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. At least 10% increase in body mass index (BMI) within the past 2 months of quetiapine,&#xD;
             olanzapine, or risperidone treatment, per parent or physician report.&#xD;

          2. IQ below the mild mental retardation range (&lt;60), based on verified records of&#xD;
             cognitive testing performed within 2 years of enrollment. In event that suitable&#xD;

&#xD;
