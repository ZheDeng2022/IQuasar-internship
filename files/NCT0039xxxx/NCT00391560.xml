      This is a Phase II trial designed to determine the efficacy and safety of perifosine in&#xD;
      patients with leukemia who develop progressive disease or recurrence while receiving therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of perifosine in patients with refractory and relapsed leukemia.&#xD;
      After a one time loading dose of 600 mg (150 mg x 4 at least 4 hours apart) during the first&#xD;
      cycle, perifosine will be given orally at 100 mg once a day continuously. Cycles are 28 days&#xD;
      in length. Intra-patient dose escalation for the maintenance dose to 150 mg daily will be&#xD;
      done in the second cycle if no non-hematological toxicities beyond grade 0-1 occurred during&#xD;
      the first cycle are observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assessed for efficacy at the end of each 28 day cycle of therapy, +/- 7&#xD;
      days. Complete remissions, partial remissions and hematological improvements of any kind will&#xD;
      be counted towards an objective response for all diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum total of 74 patients will be enrolled on the study, all of them assigned to the&#xD;
      same experimental treatment scheme (arm) described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum total of 37 evaluable patients will be entered in each of two diagnostic groups,&#xD;
      which are being distinguished due to different anticipated rates of accrual. Group 1: AML,&#xD;
      MDS, CML-BP non-lymphoid, CMML, Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia (AMM); Group 2: CLL, ALL, CML-BP&#xD;
      lymphoid.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have relapsed/refractory leukemias for which no standard therapies are&#xD;
             anticipated to result in a durable remission. Patients with poor-risk myelodysplasia&#xD;
             (MDS) [i.e. refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB-1 or RAEB-2) by WHO&#xD;
             classification] and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) are also candidates for&#xD;
             this protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute non-lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
             (AML) by WHO classification, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic&#xD;
             leukemia (CLL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Patients with&#xD;

             use acceptable contraceptive methods (physician will discuss acceptable methods)&#xD;
             during the time on study and for 4 weeks following the completion of treatment. Women&#xD;
             of child-bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
             beginning treatment on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents, or&#xD;
             at least five half-lives for noncytotoxic agents. Persistent chronic toxicities from&#xD;
             prior chemotherapy must not be greater than grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have the following clinical laboratory values:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serum creatinine: &lt;= 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin: &lt;=1.5x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST): &lt;= 3x the&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal unless considered due to organ leukemic involvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be able and willing to give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age equal to or greater than 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months,&#xD;
             symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or&#xD;
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of severe hyper-reactive airway system (e.g. active asthma,&#xD;
             COPD)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant and nursing patients are excluded because the effects of perifosine on a&#xD;
             fetus or nursing child are unknown.&#xD;
