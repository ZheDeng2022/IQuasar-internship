      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of MVA85A in healthy volunteers in the UK who&#xD;
      are infected with HIV. In phase I studies, a single vaccination with MVA85A, when&#xD;
      administered at a dose of 5 x 10^7pfu intradermally, has been shown to be safe in both&#xD;
      mycobacterially na√Øve individuals, those previously vaccinated with BCG and latently infected&#xD;
      individuals. Additionally, 5 x 10^7 pfu MVA containing HIV antigens administered twice, 4&#xD;
      weeks apart, in HIV positive individuals, is safe. We will use 5 x 107 pfu MVA85A&#xD;
      intradermally in this study. Subjects will be identified from HIV clinics in the Oxford&#xD;
      Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust and also from Swindon and Marlborough NHS Trust and St. Mary's&#xD;
      Hospital NHS Trust if our recruitment targets are not met.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The need for new vaccine against tuberculosis Tuberculosis (TB) kills about three million&#xD;
      people annually. It is estimated that one third of the world's population are latently&#xD;
      infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) (Dye, 1999). These latently infected&#xD;
      individuals are at risk of reactivation of infection, should they become immunosuppressed.&#xD;
      Worldwide, coinfection with HIV is the commonest cause of immunosuppression and increases the&#xD;
      chances of reactivation from a 10% lifetime risk to a 10% annual risk (Corbett, 1996). The&#xD;
      currently available vaccine, M. bovis BCG, is largely ineffective at protecting against adult&#xD;
      pulmonary disease in endemic areas and it is widely agreed that a new more effective&#xD;
      tuberculosis vaccine is a major global public health priority (Colditz, 1994). However, it&#xD;
      may be unethical and impractical to test and deploy a vaccine strategy that does not include&#xD;
      BCG, as BCG does confer worthwhile protection against TB meningitis and leprosy. An&#xD;
      immunisation strategy that includes BCG is also attractive because the populations in which&#xD;
      this vaccine candidate will need to be tested will already have been immunised with BCG.&#xD;
      Given the high prevalence of infection with M.tb, a vaccine that could be administered to&#xD;
      latently infected individuals and eradicate latent infection would have an enormous impact on&#xD;
      the mortality and morbidity from TB. M.tb is an intracellular organism. CD4+ Th1-type&#xD;
      cellular responses are essential for protection and there is increasing evidence from animal&#xD;
      and human studies that CD8+ T cells also play a protective role (Flynn, 2001). However, it&#xD;
      has generally been difficult to induce strong cellular immune responses in humans using&#xD;
      subunit vaccines. DNA vaccines, recombinant viral vectors and protein/adjuvant combinations&#xD;
      all induce both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, however none of these antigen delivery systems induce&#xD;
      high levels of antigen specific T cells, when used alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategies involve giving two different vaccines, each&#xD;
      encoding the same antigen, several weeks apart. Using a DNA prime-recombinant modified&#xD;
      vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) boost induces higher levels of antigen specific CD4+ and CD8+ T&#xD;
      cells than using homologous boosting with the same vector in a number of different disease&#xD;
      models (Schneider, 1998; McShane, 2001). Given the protective efficacy of BCG in childhood,&#xD;
      ideally BCG would be the priming immunisation in such a prime-boost strategy. In order to do&#xD;
      this, we have focused on antigen 85A as a candidate antigen. Antigen 85A is highly conserved&#xD;
      amongst all mycobacterial species and is present in all strains of BCG. Antigen 85A is a&#xD;
      major secreted antigen from M. tuberculosis which forms part of the antigen 85 complex (A, B&#xD;
      and C). This complex constitutes a major portion of the secreted proteins of both M.tb and&#xD;
      BCG. It is involved in fibronectin binding within the cell wall and has mycolyltransferase&#xD;
      activity. Antigen 85A is immunodominant in murine and human studies and is protective in&#xD;
      small animals (Huygen, 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA). Many viruses have been investigated as&#xD;
      potential recombinant vaccines. The successful worldwide eradication of smallpox via&#xD;
      vaccination with live vaccinia virus highlighted vaccinia as a candidate for recombinant use.&#xD;
      The recognition in recent years that non- replicating strains of poxvirus such as MVA and&#xD;
      avipox vectors can be more immunogenic than traditional replicating vaccinia strains has&#xD;
      enhanced the attractiveness of this approach. MVA (modified vaccinia virus Ankara) is a&#xD;
      strain of vaccinia virus which has been passaged more than 570 times though avian cells, is&#xD;
      replication incompetent in human cell lines and has a good safety record. It has been&#xD;
      administered to more than 120,000 vaccinees as part of the smallpox eradication programme,&#xD;
      with no adverse effects, despite the deliberate vaccination of high risk groups (Stickl,&#xD;
      1974; Mahnel, 1994). This safety in man is consistent with the avirulence of MVA in animal&#xD;
      models. MVA has six major genomic deletions compared to the parental genome severely&#xD;
      compromising its ability to replicate in mammalian cells (Meher, 1991). No replication has&#xD;
      been documented in non- transformed mammalian cells. Viral replication is blocked late during&#xD;
      infection of cells but importantly viral and recombinant protein synthesis is unimpaired even&#xD;
      during this abortive infection. The viral genome has been proven to be stable through a large&#xD;
      series of passages in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Replication-deficient recombinant MVA has&#xD;
      been seen as an exceptionally safe viral vector. When tested in animal model studies&#xD;
      recombinant MVAs have been shown to be avirulent, yet protectively immunogenic as vaccines&#xD;
      against viral diseases and cancer. Recent studies in severely immuno-suppressed macaques have&#xD;
      supported the view that MVA should be safe in immuno-compromised humans (Akira, 2001;&#xD;
      Stittelaar, 2001). There is now safety data from a number of recombinant MVAs that are&#xD;
      currently in Phase I/II trials in both the UK and Africa. Useful data on the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of various doses of a recombinant MVA vaccine comes from clinical trial data with a&#xD;
      recombinant MVA expressing a number of CTL epitopes from Plasmodium falciparum&#xD;
      pre-erythrocytic antigens fused to a complete pre-erythrocytic stage antigen, Thrombospondin&#xD;
      Related Adhesion Protein (TRAP). To date MVA ME-TRAP has been administered to over 600&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (adults and children) in Oxford and Africa (The Gambia and Kenya) without&#xD;
      any serious adverse events (Adrian Hill, unpublished, personal communication). Volunteers&#xD;
      have received one to three doses of from 3 to 15 x 107 pfu per dose of intra-dermal vaccine&#xD;
      at three-week intervals. All subjects have temporary local redness with typically a 5mm&#xD;
      central red area with a paler pink surrounding area that ranges in size from about 1 -7cm in&#xD;
      diameter and peaks at 48 hours post vaccination. At seven days post vaccination generally&#xD;
      only the central red area remains. This fades over the next few weeks and is usually not&#xD;
      apparent at 2 months after vaccination. The emerging safety profile of recombinant MVA&#xD;
      vaccine is excellent and supported by data from clinical studies of three other MVA&#xD;
      recombinants made in Oxford and currently in clinical studies using MVAs for HIV, HBV and&#xD;
      melanoma. To date these vaccines have been administered to over 600 people with no serious&#xD;
      adverse events (Hill; personal communication) 40 HIV positive individuals treated with highly&#xD;
      active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) have been vaccinated with at least 5 x 107 PFU MVA&#xD;
      containing HIV antigens with no serious adverse events (Dorrell, unpublished data; Cosma et&#xD;
      al 2003; Harrer et al, 2005). 7 HIV positive individuals have been vaccinated with MVA&#xD;
      containing malaria antigens with no serious adverse events and no significant or sustained&#xD;
      rise in viral load (Bejon at al, CID 2006, in press).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant MVA encoding antigen 85A MVA85A induces both a CD4+ and a CD8+ epitope when used&#xD;
      to immunise mice. When mice are primed with BCG and then given MVA85A as a boost, the levels&#xD;
      of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced are higher than with either BCG or MVA85A alone, and this&#xD;
      regime is more protective than either vaccine alone (Goonetilleke et al, 2003). In the more&#xD;
      sensitive guinea pig model, guinea pigs vaccinated with BCG, and then MVA85A, and then a&#xD;
      second viral vector, fowlpox expressing antigen 85A, 6/6 guinea pigs are alive at the end of&#xD;
      the experiment, compared with 2/6 guinea pigs vaccinated with BCG alone, and 0/6 control&#xD;
      animals (Williams et al, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In rhesus macaques, this BCG prime-MVA85A and Fowlpox85A boost is more immunogenic than any&#xD;
      of the vaccines alone, and is more protective than BCG alone (verrek et al, unpublished&#xD;
      data).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical studies using MVA85A MVA85A (at a dose of 5 x 107pfu) has been administered to 48&#xD;
      healthy volunteers in the UK, 21 healthy volunteers in The Gambia and 18 in South Africa,&#xD;
      with no serious adverse events. We have designed our Phase I studies to allow for a&#xD;
      vaccination of volunteer groups sequentially with a step-wise increase in mycobacterial&#xD;
      exposure, in order to minimize the possibility of a Koch reaction. A Koch reaction describes&#xD;
      the development of immunopathology in a person or animal with tuberculosis, when an&#xD;
      exaggerated immune response to M.tb is stimulated. It was described in patients with TB&#xD;
      disease when Koch performed his original studies employing mycobacteria as a type of&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccination. It has now been demonstrated in the mouse model of therapeutic&#xD;
      vaccination (Taylor, 2003). Available animal data suggest that these reactions do not occur&#xD;
      in mice latently infected with M.tb, suggesting that such reactions may correlate with high&#xD;
      bacterial load and that the Koch phenomenon may not pose a problem for vaccination of healthy&#xD;
      albeit latently infected humans. We started these studies in healthy volunteers who were as&#xD;
      mycobacterially na√Øve as possible. They were skin test negative and Elispot negative for PPD,&#xD;
      ESAT 6 and CFP10, and had not had previously been vaccinated with BCG. We have now completed&#xD;
      studies in the UK vaccinating volunteers previously vaccinated with BCG (McShane, Nature Med,&#xD;
      2004) and in The Gambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two ongoing studies in Oxford. The first is a phase I trial of the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of MVA85A in individuals who are latently infected with M.tb. We have now&#xD;
      vaccinated all 12 volunteers with no serious adverse events. The second is a dose selection&#xD;
      study evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of 2 different doses of MVA85A (1x10^8 and&#xD;
      1x10^7 pfu), in healthy adult volunteers who have previously been vaccinated with BCG. Here&#xD;
      we have vaccinated 11 individuals with the higher dose (1x10^8) with no serious adverse&#xD;
      events, the main side effect being a fever at 24-48 hours post-vaccination, which completely&#xD;
      resolves over 24 hours. Results from the low dose arm will be collected over the next few&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
