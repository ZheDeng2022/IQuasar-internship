      Escitalopram, the therapeutic active S-enantiomer of citalopram, is a selective serotonine&#xD;
      reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) used for treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. The&#xD;
      antidepressant effect is probably due to a stimulation of the serotonergic neurotransmission&#xD;
      caused by the inhibition of the presynaptic serotonin reuptake. This inhibition may also be&#xD;
      responsible for the increased pupil diameter seen in volunteers treated with racemic&#xD;
      citalopram. Based on escitaloprams pharmacodynamic properties it is expected to have the same&#xD;
      affect on pupil diameter. A dose/response relationship has not yet been established but&#xD;
      theoretically the pupillary changes might serve as a biomarker for the serotonergic effect of&#xD;
      escitalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Escitalopram is demethylated in part by the polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C19&#xD;
      (CYP2C19); but the impact of CYP2C19 polymorphism on the total metabolism of escitalopram is&#xD;
      still to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      in CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers (EMs) and poor metabolizers (PMs) and to investigate&#xD;
      whether change in pupil size reaction to a light stimulus can act as a biomarker for the&#xD;
      serotonergic effect of escitalopram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized, double blinded; placebo controlled two phases&#xD;
      cross-over trial with single and repeated doses of 20 mg escitalopram and equivalent placebo.&#xD;
      Sixteen healthy volunteers (8 EMs and 8 PMs) will participate in the trial. Prior to the&#xD;
      trial, approximately 400 volunteers will be phenotyped by omeprazole metabolic ratio in order&#xD;
      to identify the CYP2C19 EMs and PMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the two phases blood samples will be drawn and pupil sizes will be measured at fixed&#xD;
      time points after drug administration.&#xD;
