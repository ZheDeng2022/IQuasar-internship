      The purpose of this study is to determine whether new blood test (procalcitonin) can help to&#xD;
      reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics in patients with unexplained fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although fever is most commonly caused by bacterial infection there are multiple other&#xD;
      conditions that can cause fever. It can be caused by viral infection. It can also be caused&#xD;
      by other non infectious disease. Patients with malignancy, inflammation (such as gout or&#xD;
      arthritis), or clots in veins can present with fever. Occasionally medications themselves can&#xD;
      cause fever. If fever is not caused by infection antibiotics will not help. Instead they may&#xD;
      cause side effects such as diarrhea and allergic reactions. We want to determine whether&#xD;
      simple blood test (procalcitonin) can help us to make a difference between fever caused by&#xD;
      infection and fever caused by others (above mentioned) non-infectious problems. We also want&#xD;
      to determine whether such test would help us to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and help us&#xD;
      to find faster the real cause of the fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients with the unexplained fever will be participating in this study. This&#xD;
      study will involve single, additional blood test, performed only if patient continue to have&#xD;
      fever despite a few days of investigations and therapy with antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be assigned by drawing to one of two groups. In the first group blood test&#xD;
      (procalcitonin) will help a doctor to decide whether to stop or continue antibiotics. If&#xD;
      procalcitonin level is high antibiotics will be continued and the doctor will most probably&#xD;
      order additional tests to determine the source of infection. If procalcitonin level is low&#xD;
      serious bacterial infection is unlikely. The antibiotics will be stopped and a doctor will&#xD;
      try to look for other cause of fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second group blood for the tests will be collected but not reported to a doctor. You&#xD;
      will be treated in traditional manner by a doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By following this procedure we will be able to determine whether therapy guided by&#xD;
      procalcitonin level is as safe and possibly more effective than traditional approach. This&#xD;
      study does not involve any other tests or study medications. We will attempt to contact all&#xD;
      patients one month later by phone to determine whether you remain well after discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance has increasingly become a threat to patient safety in health care&#xD;
      settings.1 Several studies have identified the inappropriate use of antimicrobials as&#xD;
      important risk factor for antimicrobial resistance and the important area of opportunity for&#xD;
      increasing patient safety and improving patient outcomes.2 High rates of antimicrobial use&#xD;
      have been linked to high rates of antimicrobial resistance,3 and increased exposure to&#xD;
      antimicrobials has been associated with an increased probability of colonization with&#xD;
      resistant pathogens. It has also been shown that antimicrobial control results in significant&#xD;
      cost savings4 and it may reduce antimicrobial resistance Surveys reveal that 25 - 33% of&#xD;
      hospitalized patients receive antibiotics6 and that 22 - 65% of antibiotic use in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients is inappropriate.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reasons for inappropriate antimicrobial therapy include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. treating anybody with fever (even when it is not caused by infection) with broad&#xD;
           spectrum antibiotics&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. treating colonization or contamination (rather than real infection)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. continuing antibiotics even when infection was cured or is unlikely8&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is quite clear that clinicians need reliable marker for bacterial infections that would&#xD;
      allow an early diagnosis, inform about the course and prognosis of the disease and facilitate&#xD;
      therapeutic decisions.9 Procalcitonin covers these features better as compared to other, more&#xD;
      commonly used biomarkers (such as CRP).10 It has been shown recently that procalcitonin&#xD;
      guidance substantially reduces antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia without&#xD;
      compromising patients' safety. 11, 12 However, the efficacy and safety of PGAD in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with undefined fever has not been previously investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We think that PGAD should be equally safe and effective intervention in hospitalized patients&#xD;
      with fever of unknown etiology. It should help to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and in&#xD;
      effect, help to control antimicrobial resistance.&#xD;
