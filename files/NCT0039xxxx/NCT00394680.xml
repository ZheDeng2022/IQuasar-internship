  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Options for coronary revascularization include stent implantation and coronary bypass&#xD;
      surgery. Both modalities have their unique advantages and disadvantages in terms of clinical&#xD;
      outcomes as well as financial impact on the medical system. We wish to investigate the late&#xD;
      results of patients undergoing coronary revascularization, the need for re-hospitalization,&#xD;
      re-intervention, patient satisfaction as well as the financial burden on the medical system.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted by historical prospective review of hospital records in&#xD;
      conjunction with records of the medical insurance companies (&quot;HMO's&quot;).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardio-vascular disease is the second leading cause of death in the western world. Two modes&#xD;
      of treatment are currently used:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Percutaneous Interventions (PCIs) i.e: balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty and stents[ bare metal (BMS) and drug eluting (DES)].&#xD;
&#xD;
      CABG is a major operation but is considered to be safe and with good quality of life in the&#xD;
      years to follow. The initial cost of CABG is high but usually stays low thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCI is less invasive but its downfall is a high rate of restenosis hence leading to the&#xD;
      return of angina. The initial cost is low but due to the return of symptoms the cost&#xD;
      increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of DES is to lower the rate of restenosis thus reducing the need for repeat&#xD;
      hospitalizations and procedures. The initial cost of this stent is higher than that of the&#xD;
      BMS but still lower than that of CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to assess and compare the average annual cost of treatment for&#xD;
      patients with multi-vessel disease who underwent one of the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CABG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. DES&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information for the study is derived from the data bases of the cardiology and&#xD;
      cardio-thoracic surgery departments at Shaarey-Zedek hospital and from those of Clalit Health&#xD;
      Services and Kupat Holim Meuhedet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is historical prospective. The participants are insured by the above&#xD;
      mentioned HMOs and were treated during 2000-2004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final sample's size will be decided on according to a pilot study with 15 patients from&#xD;
      each of the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge no studies comparing CABG and DES have yet been published. We believe that&#xD;
      our study could become a mile stone in the process of choosing the most suitable treatment&#xD;
      for the patient and for the health system.&#xD;
