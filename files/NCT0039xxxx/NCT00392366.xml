  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the, MR guided, laser interstitial thermal&#xD;
      therapy (LITT) treatment technique can be safety and efficiently used for the human liver&#xD;
      metastasis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This new &quot;minimally invasive&quot; technique has been tested so far, with success, on animal brain&#xD;
      and prostate tumors. LITT has also tested with success by other teams for the treatment of&#xD;
      liver metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to determine if the Visualase, MR guided, laser&#xD;
      interstitial thermal therapy device can be safely and efficiently used for the treatment of&#xD;
      human liver metastasis originating from the colon and rectal primary tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As secondary objectives for this clinical study is to explore the tolerance of the treatment&#xD;
      and its contra indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will include a statistical sample of 25 patients and will run over a&#xD;
      period of 24 months. The inclusion period will be of 12 months and the patients will be&#xD;
      followed up during a period of 7 days after the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will be performed at the Cochin University Hospital of Paris and the&#xD;
      patients will be coming from the oncology / surgery departments of the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients recruited for this study are those who developed several liver metastasis and&#xD;
      are planned for the a surgical resection for part of the liver (where metastasis are&#xD;
      located). Prior to the surgical resection, a LITT procedure will be performed on one of the&#xD;
      metastasis. After the surgical resection histological analysis will be elaborated to compare&#xD;
      the real necrosis volume created by the LITT procedure to the expected predicted volume.&#xD;
