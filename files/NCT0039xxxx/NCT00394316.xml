    <textblock>
      X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease (CGD) is an inherited disorder caused by an abnormal&#xD;
      gene that fails to make the protein known as gp91 phox. This protein is part of a group of&#xD;
      proteins that work to create hydrogen peroxide in neutrophils. Neutrophils are a type of&#xD;
      white blood cell that helps fight infections. As a result, patients who do not make this gp91&#xD;
      phox frequently develop life-threatening infections. In addition, these neutrophils often act&#xD;
      abnormally, resulting in the creation of a granuloma, which is an abnormal collection of&#xD;
      cells. These granulomas can then become large enough to block organs, such as the bladder&#xD;
      and/or intestines, causing significant problems. Patients are usually treated with&#xD;
      antibiotics (often needed for extended periods of time) for the infections caused by CGD, and&#xD;
      with corticosteroids for the granulomas. However, these drugs do not cure CGD itself, and can&#xD;
      have significant side effects. Thus patients with CGD do not have a normal life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only available cure to date for CGD is Bone Marrow Transplantation (BMT), where the&#xD;
      blood-making cells from a specially matched brother or sister donor (allogeneic) or a&#xD;
      similarly matched unrelated donor are given to the patient after the patient has undergone&#xD;
      some kind of chemotherapy or radiation in preparation for receiving the cells. If the cells&#xD;
      from the donor engraft (or survive in the marrow), the patient can be cured; however, there&#xD;
      is a risk that the cells may not engraft or that they may later get rejected from the body.&#xD;
      Also, the cells from the donor can react against the patient, causing a serious disorder&#xD;
      called &quot;Graft Versus Host Disease&quot; (GVHD). Although there are a number of methods used to try&#xD;
      to reduce and/or prevent graft rejection and/or GVHD, these complications can still occur&#xD;
      even with the newer methods now being developed. The risks of such complications are lower&#xD;
      when a brother or sister is used as the donor; however, not all patients (even those with&#xD;
      siblings) will have an ideally matched donor. Hence, transplantation, especially when using&#xD;
      an unrelated donor, is not always a perfect cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because the gene responsible for making the gp91 phox is known, it is possible to use gene&#xD;
      therapy to try to cure this disease. In gene therapy, some of the blood-making cells are&#xD;
      taken from the patient using a technique called apheresis. The normal gene is placed into the&#xD;
      cells using special viruses called retroviruses. The cells are then able to produce the&#xD;
      normal protein. In this trial, the patient will receive a small dose of chemotherapy called&#xD;
      busulfan, lower than what is traditionally used in allogeneic BMT, and the newly corrected&#xD;
      cells will then be put back into the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even with the best standard of care, a number of patients with CGD will still die from&#xD;
      infection. For those patients who have an unresponsive or progressive infection and do not&#xD;
      have a possible sibling donor, their only hope is either a Matched Unrelated Donor (MUD)&#xD;
      transplant, which has a high risk of causing death itself, or gene therapy. Hence, we would&#xD;
      propose using gene therapy in these patients as this has less risk of causing death, but can&#xD;
      still possibly offer a cure. Even if the corrected cells do not remain life long to rid the&#xD;
      patients entirely of their disease, as long as they persist for even a few months, they would&#xD;
      be able to at least clear the current infection for which the patients are being considered&#xD;
      for enrollment in this protocol. Further, they would still be eligible to undergo a matched&#xD;
      unrelated donor transplant in the event that gene therapy does not confer any benefit.&#xD;
