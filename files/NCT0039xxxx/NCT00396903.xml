  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the insertion of epidural catheters several complications can occur, including&#xD;
      transient paraesthesia and inadvertent venous cannulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reported incidences for paraesthesia vary widely between about 0.2% and 50% in different&#xD;
      articles, depending on the catheter (catheter material, soft-tipped or firm-tipped catheter),&#xD;
      the applied technique (lumbar or thoracic epidural anesthesia, depth of catheter insertion),&#xD;
      the approach (midline or paramedian) and the included patients (obstetrical or&#xD;
      non-obstetrical). Furthermore, the inconsistent definition of &quot;paraesthesia&quot; makes it&#xD;
      difficult to compare the results of different studies. Paraesthesia are not supposed to lead&#xD;
      to permanent neurological sequelea, but are unpleasant and perturbing sensations for the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For inadvertent venous cannulation during epidural catheter placement, incidences between 1%&#xD;
      and 14% have been reported. As for the paraesthesia rate, catheter material, technique,&#xD;
      approach and included patients are determinants for the incidence of vessel puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective of this study is to determine the incidence of paraesthesia with this&#xD;
      catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to record&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the frequency of inadvertent venous cannulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  difficulties involved in insertion and removal of the catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data on additional complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data for the evaluation of handling characteristics&#xD;

      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, uncontrolled, open, non-randomised study (&quot;Observational Study&quot;)&#xD;
      with a CE-certified medical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information and consent Information of the procedure and oral consent of epidural anaesthesia&#xD;
      for the surgery is obtained as usual. Oral consent for data collection has to be obtained. No&#xD;
      randomisation or blinding is performed and no non-standard procedures are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria 100 patients scheduled for Epidural Anaesthesia will be included in this&#xD;
      study. Eligible patients are ASA class I-III, between 18 and 75 years of age and are&#xD;
      scheduled for EA, with or without general anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Anamnestic exclusion criteria are all contraindications for epidural&#xD;
      anaesthesia (e.g. neurological deficit, skin infection of the puncture site, diseases leading&#xD;
      to neurological impairment such as diabetes, coagulation impairment). Non-competent and&#xD;
      non-cooperative patients as well as pregnant and breast-feeding women are also to be&#xD;
      excluded. Same applies for patients with medicament- and drug abuse or problems in&#xD;
      communication or those participating in parallel in another clinical study with experimental&#xD;
      drugs or devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation and Blinding No randomization is required. An independent observer who is not&#xD;
      performing the epidural will record occurrence, incidence and intensity of paraesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the main and the secondary criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Frequency of paraesthesia during catheter insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of inadvertent venous cannulation (aspiration of blood)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intensity of paraesthesia (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  description: - pain&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  others&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency and kind of difficulties during insertion of the catheter (rating of &quot;easiness&#xD;
           of insertion&quot;: 0 = no resistance, 1 = minor difficulties, 2 = serious difficulties, 3 =&#xD;
           impossible)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Facultative: Documentation of paraesthesia/difficulties during catheter removal at 48&#xD;
           hours after surgery (or earlier, if appropriate)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient data (age, height, weight, sex, diagnosis, kind of intervention, ASA class,&#xD;
           relevant co-diagnosis, relevant co-medication)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Epidural anaesthesia and -analgesia related data&#xD;
&#xD;
           â€¢ Data that relate to the description of the puncture process and method chosen in case&#xD;
           of difficulties during puncture, catheter insertion and removal&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Level of sensory blockade&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Indwelling time of epidural catheter by recording the time of insertion&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dose/kind of anaesthetic used for epidural anaesthesia, type of general anaesthesia&#xD;
                if relevant&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Kind of analgesia done by epidural catheter&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Adequacy of epidural anaesthesia (yes / no)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Further complications/side effects related to epidural anaesthesia/analgesia (i.e.&#xD;
                dural puncture, haematoma, etc)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Judgement of the anaesthesiologist concerning handling features (0 = no resistance, 1 =&#xD;
           minor difficulties, 2 = serious difficulties)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Catheter damages&#xD;
