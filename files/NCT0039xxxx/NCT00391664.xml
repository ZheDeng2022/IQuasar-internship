      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the quality of life of long-term gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      survivors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the early 1970s, death rates for the major gynecological tumors have significantly&#xD;
      declined, with a reduction of 42% for endometrial, 49% for cervix, 27% for vagina and vulva,&#xD;
      and 11% for ovarian cancer. Thus, of the approximately 82,000 new gynecologic cases each&#xD;
      year, more women will be living and, necessarily be forced to cope with psychological or&#xD;
      behavioral morbidity. Psychosocial data on cancer patients portray significant fear and&#xD;
      anxiety with diagnosis and treatments and the potential for high levels of psychological and&#xD;
      sexual morbidity. While many studies have been done investigating sexual outcomes, little&#xD;
      data is available on basic domains of quality of life, i.e. emotional or social adjustment,&#xD;
      occupational outcomes, or aspects of physical health that might influence quality of life for&#xD;
      gynecologic cancer survivors. There is a need for basic descriptive research in these areas,&#xD;
      particularly in investigations that include representative samples from differing&#xD;
      socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate quality of life in long-term gynecologic cancer&#xD;
      survivors. The specific aims are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Describe quality of life (both mental health and physical functioning components),&#xD;
           stress, and sexual functioning among survivors of gynecologic malignancies and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Describe differences between disease site groups (i.e. cervical, endometrial, ovarian,&#xD;
           and vulva).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown with other cancer groups that improvements in mood and coping can be&#xD;
      achieved with brief, cost effective interventions (e.g. ten therapy hours with delivery in a&#xD;
      group format). These are multi-modal interventions with stress reduction, disease/treatment&#xD;
      information, cognitive behavioral coping strategies, and social support. There is suggestive&#xD;
      evidence that disease specific interventions, such as including sexual therapies for&#xD;
      gynecologic patients, can result in improvements as well. Research focus on these issues is&#xD;
      aided by the availability of reliable and valid strategies to assess both quality of life&#xD;
      (SF-36; FACT) and sexuality. Before clinical trials are undertaken, research must provide a&#xD;
      comprehensive assessment of quality of life for gynecologic cancer survivors.&#xD;
