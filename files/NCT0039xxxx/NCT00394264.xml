  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal injuries including low back pain (LBP) are a major problem in military&#xD;
      personnel. These injuries can result from training exercises, job duties, or recreational&#xD;
      activities. However incurred, many of these injuries can result in limited duty in work or&#xD;
      training, and can decrease military readiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Osteopathic Research Center (ORC) will examine the effectiveness of a specific&#xD;
      set of Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment interventions referred to as Manual/Manipulative&#xD;
      Therapy (M/MT) to reduce pain and improve functioning in young active duty military&#xD;
      personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad overall goal of this proposed research project is to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a larger clinical trial of Manual/Manipulative Therapy (M/MT) in restoring full&#xD;
      performance in military personnel in the operational environment. A second goal is to&#xD;
      estimate the treatment effect size of M/MT in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following two hypotheses will guide the data study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: Subjects receiving manual/manipulative therapy for low back pain will&#xD;
           report less pain at two and four weeks than subjects in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2: Subjects receiving manual/manipulative therapy for low back pain will&#xD;
           achieve greater functioning at two and four weeks than subjects in the control group.&#xD;

      Musculoskeletal injuries are among the most common injuries in the military, and cause more&#xD;
      soldiers to miss time from active duty than any other health condition.These injuries account&#xD;
      for up to 20% of all clinic visits at Fort Sam Houston.Of these visits, up to 36% are&#xD;
      back-related, resulting in lost duty time, lost training time, and a negative impact on&#xD;
      military preparedness. It is of interest to the military to refine interventions that would&#xD;
      effectively and efficiently treat back related injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) has been studied as a treatment for low back pain in&#xD;
      both chronic and subacute presentations in a variety of situations. OMT has been found&#xD;
      effective in decreasing medication use for back pain and improving pain and functioning.In a&#xD;
      study on low back pain in the Navy, use of OMT significantly reduced time on light duty and&#xD;
      sick-in-quarters time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Osteopathic Research Center (ORC) proposes to examine the efficacy of a specific&#xD;
      set of OMT interventions referred to in this proposal as Manual/Manipulative Therapy (M/MT)&#xD;
      to reduce pain and improve functioning in young active duty military personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The site for this study is the Madiagan Amry Medical Center at Fort Lewis, WA. We will sample&#xD;
      the active duty personnel who present at the outpatient clinics at the Hospital with a&#xD;
      complaint of low back pain. Osteopathic physicians will provide the M/MT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enough subjects will be enrolled and randomized in the study for a total of 100 to complete&#xD;
      the trial in two groups: a treatment group receiving M/MT plus standard care (SC), and a&#xD;
      control group receiving SC only. Standard care may include medications, back care education&#xD;
      and exercise instructions, and/or limited duty. M/MT sessions will last approximately 15-20&#xD;
      minutes, and will be provided up to twice a week for up to four weeks. Standard care will be&#xD;
      provided as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes to be measured are pain and functionality. Pain measures include a Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) and medication use. Function will be measured by the Back Pain Functional Scale&#xD;
      (BPFS), Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ), and time on modified duty. The VAS and duty status&#xD;
      will be recorded at each visit. All other outcomes will be assessed at two and four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initial visit, we will also collect demographic data, medical history, information on&#xD;
      quality of life using the SF-36, and subject treatment expectation. A subject satisfaction&#xD;
      survey and a measure of overall improvement will be completed at two and four weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The broad overall goal of this proposed research project is to determine the feasibility of&#xD;
      conducting a larger clinical trial of Manual/Manipulative Therapy (M/MT) in restoring full&#xD;
      performance in military personnel in the operational environment. A second goal is to&#xD;
      estimate the treatment effect size of M/MT in this population.&#xD;
