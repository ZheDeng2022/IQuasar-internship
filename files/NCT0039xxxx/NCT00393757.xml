  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see why malaria epidemics occur in highland areas in Kenya. A&#xD;
      better understanding of factors contributing to malaria may be necessary for malaria vaccine&#xD;
      planning. These factors include interactions between age, where malaria is passed from&#xD;
      mosquitoes to people, immune system (how the body fights infection) responses and other&#xD;
      factors that contribute to malaria in epidemic-prone areas. About 6400 people from the&#xD;
      villages of Kapsisiywa and Kipsamoite will participate. Study procedures will include in home&#xD;
      surveys, which will involve a census and an interview by researchers. Blood samples and&#xD;
      smears will be collected from some volunteers in both communities to understand how the body&#xD;
      protects itself from malaria and to check for malaria parasites. Twice each month, random&#xD;
      houses will be selected from 3 places in the village to measure the number of mosquitoes in&#xD;
      the home. Participants may be involved in the study for up to 4 years.&#xD;
