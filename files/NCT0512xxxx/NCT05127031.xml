  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Each participant would complete four test days and each test day is separated by 7-10 days.&#xD;
      At each test day the participants would complete a graded maximal exercise test&#xD;
      (VO2max-test), a chair rise (Linear encoder) as well as measuring of basic demographic&#xD;
      outcomes (weight, fat%,blood pressure etc.). The first test day would further include a motor&#xD;
      (MDS-UPDRS III) and cognitive examination (MoCA), a questionnaire about quality of life&#xD;
      (PDQ-39) and one about depression (BDI-II). Furthermore, the first test day would include two&#xD;
      test of walking performance (6 minutes walk test and Time Up and Go). Two of the test days&#xD;
      would be completed while the participants are off their Parkinson disease medication for at&#xD;
      least 12 hours, while the other two test days would be completed while on their Parkinson&#xD;
      medication. The order of the tests would be randomized. It is hypothesized that the VO2max&#xD;
      test would be reliable and valid when participants are on medication, while off-medication&#xD;
      would affect the reliability and validity.&#xD;
