      The beneficial of perioperative usage of thoracic epidural anesthesia and analgesia in&#xD;
      various thoracic and upper abdominal surgery are well studied. However, intraoperative data&#xD;
      are lacking whether combined thoracic epidural and general anesthesia have effect on the&#xD;
      median (50%) effective effect-concentration (EC50) of propofol for inducing loss of&#xD;
      consciousness (LOC). We performed this study among patients undergoing open gastrectomy in&#xD;
      gastric cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty-eight patients undergoing open gastrectomy were randomly assigned to two groups with&#xD;
      thoracic combined general anesthesia (TEA+GA) or general anesthesia (GA) alone.&#xD;
      Target-controlled infusion (TCI) of propofol was used for anesthesia induction. The initial&#xD;
      propofol concentration of target effect-site (Ceprop) was 3.5 ug/ml and was increased&#xD;
      stepwise by 0.5ug/ml at each 4 min intervals by an un-down sequential method to reach LOC.&#xD;
      The predicted Ceprop at the time of LOC, intravenous anesthetics, vasopressor requirement,&#xD;
      emergency time from anesthesia and postoperative numeric rating scale (NRS) were recorded and&#xD;
      analyzed between two groups.&#xD;

      After received the approvement of ethics committee of the Cancer Hospital of the University&#xD;
      of Chinese Academy of Sciences (approval number IRB- 2021-214). 48 adult gastric cancer&#xD;
      patients between 18-75 yrs, ASA physical state I and II, undergoing open gastrectomy, were&#xD;
      enrolled in this study. The exclusion criteria included: patients with contraindications to&#xD;
      epidural puncture or catheter placement; chronic or acute (within 48 h) intake of&#xD;
      psychotropic drugs, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, or opioids; alcoholism; hepatic, renal,&#xD;
      neurological or other organ dysfunction; younger than 18 years or older than 75 years; with&#xD;
      allergic to local anesthetic solutions or opioids; received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy; as&#xD;
      well as patients who refuse to receive epidural puncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to either TEA+GA group of GA group. The requirement for the&#xD;
      modified up-down method was used to confirm sample size (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative arrangements 3-lead electrocardiogram, pulse oximetry and continuously invasive&#xD;
      artery blood pressure via left radial artery() were measured for basic monitoring. A central&#xD;
      venous catheter was placed in the right internal jugular vein for fluid input and central&#xD;
      venous pressure measurement and its position was confirmed by ultrasound. Bispectral Index&#xD;
      (BIS) monitor (VT94306, Aspect VISTA, Covidien IIc, MA, USA) was measured for monitoring the&#xD;
      depth of anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thoracic Epidural Anesthesia Epidural puncture was performed in the left lateral position&#xD;
      through the interspace between the eighth to ninth thoracic vertebra (T8-T9). Epidural&#xD;
      catheter was inserted by median approach using &quot;loss-of-resistance&quot;technique and was placed&#xD;
      advanced 4 cm cephalad. A test dose of 3ml, 1%, lidocaine was injected through the catheter&#xD;
      after the aspiration test for blood and cerebrospinal fluid shows negative results. Non&#xD;
      sensory and motor anesthesia after 4 min of test dose injection indicate the absence of&#xD;
      accidental subarachnoid placement of the catheter. In group TEA+GA, 5-8ml of 0.375%&#xD;
      ropivacaine depend on the height and weight of the patient was administrated through the&#xD;
      epidural catheter at least 20 min before induction, by the second anesthesiologist, to obtain&#xD;
      a bilateral segmentary sensory block to pinprick between T4 and T12 dermatomes. Continuous&#xD;
      infusion of 4-6 ml 0.375% ropivacaine was applied using micro-infusion pump after&#xD;
      induction(2). In group GA, same dose of normal saline was administered before induction and&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Anesthesia General anesthesia was induced by propofol plasma target-controlled&#xD;
      infusion (TCI) (). To explore the EC50 of propofol for inducing LOC in two groups. We started&#xD;
      induction using a series of predicted effect-site concentrations of propofol (Ceprop) with an&#xD;
      equal step wise of 0.5 ug/ml, according to the up-down method of Dixon(1). The initial Ceprop&#xD;
      for the first patient of each group was 3.5 ug/ml based on previous studies (3) . Positive&#xD;
      response to propofol was defined as LOC happened within 4 min after start of TCI under&#xD;
      initial concentration. Otherwise the response was taken as negative and propofol&#xD;
      concentration was increased 0.5 ug/ml more each 4 min until patient reach LOC (LOC was&#xD;
      defined as loss of response to verbal commands). The initial TCI Ceprop was increased by 0.5&#xD;
      ug/ml for the next patients if the previous patient shows negative in the same group. The&#xD;
      initial TCI Ceprop was decreased by 0.5 ug/ml for the next patient if the previous patient&#xD;
      shows positive in the same group. All the patients were increased by 0.5 ug/ml stepwise at 4&#xD;
      min intervals until they showed LOC. An interval of 4 min was based on the pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) character of propofol in order to obtain the steady-state&#xD;
      effect-site concentrations (4; 5). An intravenous of 0.25 mg/Kg oxycodone and 0.6 mg/Kg&#xD;
      rocuronium were given after LOC to facilitate tracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance of anesthesia Anesthesia was maintained with propofol, remifentanil and&#xD;
      rocuronium during surgery. Ceprop was adjusted in stepwise of 0.5 ug/ml to keep the BIS&#xD;
      between 45 to 55 in two groups. The lowest Ceprop was 2.0 ug/ml to avoid intraoperative&#xD;
      awareness. Concentration for remifentanil was between 0.05 ug/Kg/min and 0.25 ug/Kg/ min&#xD;
      during surgery depend on the blood pressure. The maintenance doses of rocuronium was&#xD;
      0.15mg/Kg as required to maintain surgical paralysis (6). Patients with hypertension were&#xD;
      treated with 10 mg urapidil or 5 mg diltiazem i.v and hypotension was treated initially by&#xD;
      speeding Ringger's solution, infusion voluven, then decrease concentration of remifentanil by&#xD;
      0.05 ug/Kg/min until reach the lower limit of 0.05 ug/Kg/min and finally given 5mg ephedrine&#xD;
      i.v. 80 ug phenylephrine or 1mg metaraminol were then given if hypotension was remaining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative management Anesthetics were stopped when the final surgical suture was done and&#xD;
      then 2-4mg/Kg of sugammadex was applied according to the train-of-four (TOF) ratio. The&#xD;
      duration between the time of discontinuation of anesthetics and the time of spontaneous&#xD;
      opening of eyes was defined as anesthesia emergency time. All patients received postoperative&#xD;
      patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA) 0f 0.175% ropivacaine with 0.7ug/ml sufentanil.&#xD;
      The PCEA continuous infusion dose was 3-4 ml with patient-controlled bolus dose of 4-5ml&#xD;
      depend on the height and weight of patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were transferred to PACU after extubation and stay at least 60 min there. In PACU,&#xD;
      pain intensity using numerical analogue score of 0-10, postoperative nausea, vomiting and&#xD;
      times of hypotension were evaluated and recorded at 30min, 60min and the time leave PACU.&#xD;
