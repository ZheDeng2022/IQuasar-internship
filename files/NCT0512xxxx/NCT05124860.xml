  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metabolic alterations associated with critical illness have significant implications for&#xD;
      the nutritional management of ICU patients. Despite this, little is known about these changes&#xD;
      in patients requiring prolonged organ support and nutritional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to describe changes in metabolism over time in a large&#xD;
      prospective cohort of patients requiring &gt;10 days of ICU care. Our hypothesis is that there&#xD;
      is a significant change in mean energy expenditure and respiratory quotient (RQ) between the&#xD;
      early (day 1-3), intermediate (day 4-10) and late (&gt;10 days) phase in ICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical illness has profound effects on human metabolism. The most prominent feature in the&#xD;
      early phase is an upregulation of catabolic pathways, which promotes the production of&#xD;
      endogenous energy substrates and net protein breakdown [1].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is very little published data describing trends of energy expenditure and substrate&#xD;
      utilization in patients with a prolonged ICU stay. While this group only constitutes a small&#xD;
      fraction of ICU patients, it accounts for a large part of ICU resource allocation, morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality [2]. Several studies have been conducted in recent years to better characterize&#xD;
      patients with persistent critical illness, focusing on markers of catabolism and inflammation&#xD;
      [3, 4]. It is not known if these changes are associated with alterations in energy metabolism&#xD;
      and substrate utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bridging these knowledge gaps will improve our understanding of the nutritional needs and&#xD;
      metabolism of patients beyond the early phase in ICU. We therefore plan to conduct a&#xD;
      prospective observational multi-center study to address these questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this project is to describe longitudinal changes in energy expenditure and&#xD;
      associated clinical characteristics in a large cohort of patients with a prolonged ICU stay.&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that there is a significant change in mean energy expenditure and&#xD;
      respiratory quotient (RQ) between the early (day 1-3), intermediate (day 4-10) and late (&gt;10&#xD;
      days) phase in ICU. Correlations between metabolic rate and other clinical characteristics&#xD;
      will also be analysed for hypothesis-generating purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adult ICU patients with at least one measurement of energy expenditure by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry at participating study sites will be included in the study. Study sites are&#xD;
      encouraged to routinely perform indirect calorimetry every 3-4 days. Study subjects will be&#xD;
      followed until ICU discharge or death, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Survival status (ALIVE/DEAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to include ≥200 patients with an ICU length of stay of &gt;10 days.&#xD;
      Based on data from the Swedish Intensive Care Registry between 2015-2019, these patients&#xD;
      accounted for 5% of all ICU admissions [5]. This proportion is comparable to results from a&#xD;
      registry study conducted in Australia and New Zealand of over one million ICU admissions [2].&#xD;
      Based on these figures we intend to screen 6000 unique patients for study participation,&#xD;
      accounting for the possibility that multiple measurements of indirect calorimetry are not&#xD;
      consistently performed. In total we expect to include around 1250 unique subjects with at&#xD;
      least one measurement with indirect calorimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive data will be presented as mean +/- standard deviation or median (interquartile&#xD;
      range) as appropriate. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be analysed using a&#xD;
      generalized linear mixed-effects model. Exploratory outcomes and their association to other&#xD;
      clinical variables will be analysed using generalized linear regression models. If values are&#xD;
      found to be not missing at random, conditional logistic regression censoring will be used to&#xD;
      calculate inverse probability weights for accounting for difference in drop-out&#xD;
      probabilities.&#xD;
