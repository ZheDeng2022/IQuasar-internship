      For locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (cT3/4aN+M0 ),&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy can downstage T and N stage, improve R0 resection rate, reduce recurrence&#xD;
      and metastasis rates, and finally improve the long-term survival. A combination of&#xD;
      Fruquintinib and SOX for locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      could be a novel therapy. This study intends to evaluate the efficacy of Fruquintinib plus&#xD;
      SOX as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide and a&#xD;
      substantial global health burden. Surgery is the only possible way to cure gastric cancer,&#xD;
      however, more than 80% of Chinese patients are diagnosed at advanced stages. Surgery and&#xD;
      comprehensive treatment have made significant progress in gastric/gastroesophageal junction&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma, but recurrence and metastasis are still common. Improving the R0 resection&#xD;
      rate and reducing recurrence and metastasis rates are becoming more urgent. For locally&#xD;
      advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (cT3/4aN+M0 ), neoadjuvant therapy&#xD;
      can downstage T and N stage, improve R0 resection rate, reduce recurrence and metastasis&#xD;
      rates, and finally improve the long-term survival. A combination of Fruquintinib and SOX for&#xD;
      locally advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma could be a novel therapy.&#xD;
      This single-arm, multicenter, open-label phase II study is designed to evaluate the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Fruquintinib plus SOX as neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced gastric or&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have not received prior antitumor therapy.&#xD;
