    <textblock>
      According to the objective, the trial is constituted by two study groups: one is food effect&#xD;
      assessment group, and another is multiple dose pharmacokinetic assessment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to (1) assess the effect of a meal (light-fat) on the single-dose PK&#xD;
      of SHR3824 and metformin administered in the HR20033 FDC tablet in healthy Chinese subjects;&#xD;
      (2) to characterize the single-dose and steady-state PK of SHR3824 and metformin following&#xD;
      administration of the HR20033 FDC tablet to healthy subjects in the fed state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess in healthy Chinese subjects, the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the SHR3824 and Metformin after single doses (administered in the fed and fasted states)&#xD;
      and multiple doses (administered in the fed state) of the HR20033 FDC tablet.&#xD;
