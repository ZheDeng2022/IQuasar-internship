      This study will be performed in the in the FAYOUM University hospital after the local&#xD;
      Institutional Ethics Committee and local institutional review board approval. The study&#xD;
      design will be double blinded prospective controlled comparative study. A detailed informed&#xD;
      consent will be signed by the eligible patients before recruitment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I, II patients who will be&#xD;
           scheduled for elective lumbar surgery for one or two levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age range from 18 and 70 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patient refusal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  significant renal, hepatic and cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History of allergy to one of the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any contraindication to regional anesthesia such as local infection or bleeding&#xD;
           disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic opioid use, history of chronic pain and cognitive disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lumbar spine lesion revision. Randomization will be done via computer-generated random&#xD;
           numbers that will be placed in separate closed envelopes and will be opened by study&#xD;
           investigators just after induction of general anesthesia. Neither the patients, the&#xD;
           study investigators, the attending clinicians nor the data collectors will be aware of&#xD;
           the allocation of groups till the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be allocated in 1:1 ratio to one of the two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      group erector spinae plane block (n=41), and group intrathecal morphine (n=41).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive 150 mg ranitidine oral tablet at the night and on the morning of&#xD;
      the operation as a premedication. Upon arrival to the operating room, standard monitors&#xD;
      (Electrocardiogram, Pulse oximeter, Noninvasive blood pressure monitoring) will be applied&#xD;
      and continued all over the operation. An intravenous (IV) access will be established. General&#xD;
      anesthesia will be performed as follows: induction will be made using IV propofol (2mg/kg),&#xD;
      atracurium (0.5mg/kg), and fentanyl&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1microgram/kg). A cuffed endotracheal tube (7-8.5) size will be placed to secure the airway&#xD;
      .The patients will be placed in the prone position. Maintenance of anesthesia will be made&#xD;
      using inhalational anesthesia (isoflurane) and IV atracurium according to the patients'&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same anesthesiologist who is experienced in US guided regional anesthesia will perform&#xD;
      the block. In the group ESP, a high frequency linear US probe (HFL_50, 15_6MHz) will be&#xD;
      placed vertically and nearly 3 cm lateral to the vertebra in the middle of the incision line.&#xD;
      The transverse process and the overlaying erector spinae muscles (ESM) will be identified&#xD;
      under parasagittal scanning A22 G,50 mm block needle (SONOTAP,Pajunk, Geisingen,Germany) will&#xD;
      be inserted at a 30-40° angle in the cranial to caudal direction via an in-plane approach and&#xD;
      advanced into the plane between the fascia of ESM and transverse process under sterile&#xD;
      conditions. The correct needle position will be confirmed after a hydro dissection with 3 ml&#xD;
      of isotonic saline, and then 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected in the interfascial&#xD;
      plane between the rhomboideus major muscle and ESM. The local anesthetic spread will be&#xD;
      visualized in a fascial longitudinal pattern deep to the ESM. The same procedure will be&#xD;
      performed on the contralateral side. In the group of intrathecal morphine , a lumbar puncture&#xD;
      will be done in the lateral position via a midline approach into the level of the vertebra&#xD;
      which exists in the middle of the incision with complete aseptic condition using 25 gauge&#xD;
      Quincke spinal needle to give 0.3 mg of morphine (preservative free form) suspended in 0.4 ml&#xD;
      of normal saline . Anesthesia will be discontinued at the end of the surgery and the patients&#xD;
      will be extubated after return of spontaneous respiration .All patients will be followed for&#xD;
      1 hour in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) then discharged to the ward. In the&#xD;
      postoperative period we will give the patients multimodal analgesic regimen as following : a)&#xD;
      paracetamol 1000 mg IV 3 times/day, b) dexketoprofen 50 mg IV once/day, c) IV pethidine&#xD;
      0.5mg/kg as a rescue analgesic on demand. Postoperative pain will be evaluated using a visual&#xD;
      analogue scale (VAS 0: no pain, 10: worst pain ever) at 0 hours postoperative in PACU, then&#xD;
      at postoperative 2., 6.,12.,24., and 48 hours at the ward by a research assistant who will be&#xD;
      blinded to the study groups. Pethidine IV 0.5 mg/kg will be given as a rescue analgesic when&#xD;
      the VAS score will be more than 3. The amount of pethidine consumption will be recorded&#xD;
      between 0-12., 12-24., and 24-48 hours. The following criteria will be recorded and compared&#xD;
      between the two groups : demographic data ( Age, Weight, sex and height) , ASA classification&#xD;
      ,mean operative times (min), VAS scores , time to the first rescue analgesic (h)&#xD;
      ,intraoperative fentanyl consumption(mg),postoperative opioid consumption ,sedation score,&#xD;
      hemodynamics intraoperative and postoperative ( blood pressure ,heart rate and spo2 ) and&#xD;
      complications. Complications include complications related to the block and the surgery&#xD;
      (nerve damage, local anesthesia toxicity, bleeding, infection, and thromboembolism) and&#xD;
      complications related to the general anesthesia , intrathecal morphine and IV opioids&#xD;
      (respiratory depression , nausea and vomiting, urine retension, hypotension , bradycardia,&#xD;
      pruritus, constipation and dizziness ).9&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean VAS score (score 0 =no pain and 10 =worst pain ever ) in the two groups of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome will include the following : demographic data ( Age, Weight, height,&#xD;
      body mass index) , ASA classification ,mean operative times (minutes), time to first rescue&#xD;
      analgesic (minutes) ,intraoperative fentanyl consumption(micrograme),postoperative opioid&#xD;
      consumption ,sedation score, hemodynamics intraoperative and postoperative ( blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      ,heart rate and spo2 ) and complications. Complications include complications related to the&#xD;
      block and the surgery (nerve damage, local anesthesia toxicity, bleeding, infection, and&#xD;
      thromboembolism) and complications related to the general anesthesia, intrathecal morphine&#xD;
      and IV opioids (respiratory depression, nausea and vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia,&#xD;
      pruritus, constipation and dizziness).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and sample size estimation :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated using G*power version 3.1.9.4. Previous similar studies indicated&#xD;
      that a minimal sample size of 37 patients in each group will be needed to achieve a power&#xD;
      level of 0.80 , alpha level of 0.05(two tailed) , will a medium effect size of 0.66 for the&#xD;
      VAS score at 24 hours. Estimating that 10% of patients may drop out of the study due to&#xD;
      different reasons , sample size was increased to 82 patients (41 in each group).10&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be performed using SPSS version 21.0 (IBM,Armonk,NY,USA).Data are&#xD;
      presented as mean (SD) , median [interquartile range (IQR) ], or number of patients (%) .&#xD;
      Distribution normality will be assessed using the Kolmogorov_Smirnov test. Comparisons&#xD;
      between groups will be made using independent t_test or Mann_Whitney U test , as appropriate.&#xD;
      Categorical variables will be analyzed using chi_square test or Fisher exact test. A p_value&#xD;
      less 0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
