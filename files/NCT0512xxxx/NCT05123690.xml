      A three-arm randomized trial of standard neurofeedback, virtual-reality based neurofeedback&#xD;
      and a waiting list for patientes with treatment resistent PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomized-controlled trial. In this study 45 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomised into one of three arms of the study. Treatment as usual (TAU) entails both&#xD;
      psychotherapy, medication and other interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. TAU + Neurofeedback using virtual-reality (VR) (experimental group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TAU + Neurofeedback using a PC-screen (experimental group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TAU as a waiting list (control group) - the participants in the control group will be&#xD;
           offered to choose one of the two experimental treatments at the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 45 participants will be randomized to one arm of the study (15 participants per group).&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited from Psychiatric Outpatient Care at Sahlgrenska University&#xD;
      Hospital, Crisis and Trauma Center Gothenburg and Psychiatric Care Center in Tranås,&#xD;
      Jönköping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the two experimental groups will have 24 sessions in total, (twice a week. 12&#xD;
      week period) with a trained neurofeedback specialist or trained neurofeedback physician.&#xD;
      Before session 1 and after session 24, a clinician will fill in the clinical scales and&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
