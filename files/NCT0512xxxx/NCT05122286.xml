  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unfavorable outcomes were associated with failed recanalization of acute large vessel&#xD;
      occlusions (LVO). The failed recanalization rate of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) was 12-41%&#xD;
      reported in multiple randomized controlled trials (RCT). Possible reasons of failed&#xD;
      recanalization included technical failure of access, failure of retrieving thrombus,&#xD;
      thrombotic re-occlusion, and pre-existing intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS).&#xD;
      Several studies have been published on balloon dilation or permanent stenting as rescue&#xD;
      approaches for failed thrombectomy in individual cases, but there is no evidence from RCTs&#xD;
      regarding this topic. ANGEL-REBOOT aims to close this gap by performing a randomized study of&#xD;
      bailout intracranial angioplasty (balloon dilation and/or stenting) for unsuccessful&#xD;
      thrombectomy in LVO patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ANGEL-REBOOT is a multicentered, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point&#xD;
      (PROBE) study. A total of approximately 348 patients within 8 hours of symptom onset of acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke (NIHSS：6-30) , who has the imaging evidence of an occlusion of intracranial&#xD;
      internal cerebral artery (ICA)，M1 of the middle cerebral artery (MCA)，V4 of vertebral&#xD;
      artery（VA) or basilar artery (BA) segment, anterior circulation stroke [defined as: NECT or&#xD;
      DWI ASPECTS≥6] or posterior circulation stroke [defined as: CTA-SI or DWI pc-ASPECTS≥6 and&#xD;
      Pons-Midbrain Index (PMI)&lt;3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization would take place after failed recanalization after 1-3 attempts（traget vessel&#xD;
      eTICI 0-2a) thrombectomy with stent retriever and/or contact aspiration. Patients fulfilling&#xD;
      all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 into&#xD;
      two groups after offering informed content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized into the bailout angioplasty arm, the choice of balloon dilation&#xD;
      or stenting will be left to the discretion of the interventionalist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is randomized into the thrombectomy alone arm, the interventionalist will&#xD;
      decide whether to stop the endovascular recanalization procedure or to perform further&#xD;
      recanalization attempts using stent-retrievers and/or aspiration catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the efficacy and safety of bailout intracranial&#xD;
      angioplasty with MT alone following unsuccessful recanalization by MT in acute LVO patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of three visits including 24 hours after treatment, 7 days or discharge,&#xD;
      and 90 days. Demographic information, symptoms and signs, laboratory test, neuro-imaging&#xD;
      assessment neurological function rating scale will be recorded during the study. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is the modified Rankin's scale (mRS) at 90 days. The study is anticipated to last&#xD;
      from October 2021 to March 2024 with 348 participants recruited form about 40 centers in&#xD;
      China. All the related investigative organization and individuals will obey the Declaration&#xD;
      of Helsinki and Chinese Good Clinical Practice standard. A scheduled Data and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) meeting will oversight the safety data of the study. The trial has&#xD;
      been approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Ethics Committee (EC) in Being Tiantan&#xD;
      hospital, Capital Medical University.&#xD;

    <measure>NIHSS score at 24 hours after treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The NIHSS is a 15-item neurologic examination stroke scale used to evaluate the effect of acute cerebral infarction on the levels of consciousness, language, neglect, visual-field loss, extraocular movement, motor strength, ataxia, dysarthria, and sensory loss. A trained observer rates the patent's ability to answer questions and perform activities. Ratings for each item are scored with 3 to 5 grades with 0 as normal, and there is an allowance for untestable items. The single patient assessment requires less than 10 minutes to complete. The evaluation of stroke severity depends upon the ability of the observer to accurately and consistently assess the patient.</description>

    <measure>Infarct in new territories (INT) within 18-36 hours</measure>
    <time_frame>18-36 hours after treatment</time_frame>
    <description>INT is classified based on two parameters: size (types I, II, and III) and catheter manipulation across territory ostium (types A and B). Thus an INT may be classified as IA, IIB, etc.&#xD;
Classification of INT based on size:&#xD;
Type I : ≤2 mm diffusion lesion (unidentifiable on non-contrast CT scan). Type II : &gt;2 mm to ≤20 mm lesion (could potentially be difficult to identify on CT scan).&#xD;
Type III : Large (&gt;20 mm) infarct in new territory.&#xD;
Classification of INT based on catheter manipulation across territory ostium:&#xD;
Type A : Catheter was manipulated past the ostium of the new territory (eg, large ACA infarct in a patient who originally had an M1 occlusion): increased likelihood infarct is related to procedure.&#xD;
Type B : Catheter was not manipulated past the ostium of the new territory (eg, left PICA infarct in a patient who originally had a right M1 occlusion): decreased likelihood infarct is related to procedure.</description>
