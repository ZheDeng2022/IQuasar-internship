  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this observational single-center cohort study, metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing&#xD;
      (mNGS) will be used to investigate the features and changes of gut microbiota in acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML) patients during the treatment of two different induction therapy&#xD;
      regimens [standard intensive chemotherapy (7+3) or bcl-2 inhibitor-based targeted therapy].&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infections remain one of the major complications during induction therapy of acute myelocytic&#xD;
      leukemia (AML). Previous studies have shown that the variation of gut microbiota was an&#xD;
      effective predictor for infection development of AML during induction therapy. A growing&#xD;
      number of patients with AML received bcl-2 inhibitor-based targeted induction therapy. The&#xD;
      investigators assume that there are different effects of bcl-2 inhibitor-based induction&#xD;
      therapy on gut microbiota compared with standard intensive chemotherapy (7+3 regimen).&#xD;
      Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing (mNGS) will be used to perform the investigation of&#xD;
      gut microbiota in AML receiving two different induction therapies. And the relationships of&#xD;
      gut microbiota with infection complication will be analyzed.&#xD;
