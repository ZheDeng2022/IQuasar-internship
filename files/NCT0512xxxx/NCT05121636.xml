      Assessment of the clinical performance and survivorship of the Corin Total Hip System with&#xD;
      Trinity™ cup MetaFix™ Collared stem in a prospective study. The primary endpoint of the study&#xD;
      is to evaluate the 3-year survivorship and clinical performance of the Corin Total Hip System&#xD;
      using Trinity™ cup and MetaFix™ Collared stem. Additionally, the study follow up will&#xD;
      continue until 10 years for subjects who consent to do.&#xD;
