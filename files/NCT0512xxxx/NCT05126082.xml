      The goal of the PedsBP CDS research project is to adapt a previously tested web-based&#xD;
      clinical decision support tool that appropriately identifies high blood pressure in youth for&#xD;
      use in a primarily rural health system and compare approaches to CDS implementation in 45&#xD;
      primary care clinics treating children in 3 upper Midwest states. This project will advance&#xD;
      implementation science and address a critical need for youth at risk for cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease and with limited access to pediatric subspecialty care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension (HT) in youth tracks into adulthood, contributing to adult cardiovascular&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. National guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of HT in&#xD;
      children and adolescents were last updated in 2017, with definitions for HT that vary by age.&#xD;
      To date, most children and adolescents with elevated blood pressure (BP) or HT are not&#xD;
      diagnosed or inadequately treated. Factors that contribute to these deficits in care include:&#xD;
      the need to translate pediatric BP measures into BP percentiles, lack of clinician&#xD;
      familiarity with pediatric HT guidelines, and competing demands at clinical encounters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic health record (EHR)-linked clinical decision support (CDS) can be used to address&#xD;
      these barriers and improve the identification and management of elevated BP and HT in&#xD;
      children and adolescents. In a previous study, the investigators developed, implemented, and&#xD;
      evaluated a sophisticated web-based, EHR-linked CDS to provide patient-specific clinical care&#xD;
      recommendations in real time and in accordance with national guidelines for BP management in&#xD;
      youth. In a 2-year cluster randomized trial in 20 urban and suburban primary care clinics in&#xD;
      an integrated health system in Minnesota, the investigators demonstrated that the CDS&#xD;
      increased repeat measurement of elevated BP during a visit and more than doubled clinician&#xD;
      recognition of HT, while promoting dietitian referrals and additional next steps in care&#xD;
      consistent with national guidelines. The CDS system was well accepted by providers and as&#xD;
      such, is now standard of care in 55 primary care and 17 subspecialty clinics serving children&#xD;
      across our health system. Implementation of this CDS in a new health system is a logical next&#xD;
      step, yet optimal strategies for adaptation and implementation of CDS in clinics serving&#xD;
      rural populations have not been well described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will implement PedsBP CDS in a large health system with many&#xD;
      clinics located in rural regions of Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota. In order to&#xD;
      compare approaches to implementation of PedsBP CDS to usual care, the investigators will&#xD;
      randomly assign 15 primary care clinics to receive high-intensity implementation (CDS with&#xD;
      online and in-person training, and audit-feedback), 15 clinics to receive low-intensity&#xD;
      implementation (CDS with online training only), and 15 clinics will continue with usual care&#xD;
      (no CDS).&#xD;
