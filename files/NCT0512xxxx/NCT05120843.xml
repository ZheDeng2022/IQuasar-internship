  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study continues an adaptation of care coordination to address the needs of women after&#xD;
      preterm birth. This is a small single arm open trial designed to test intervention&#xD;
      implementation and refine the intervention before ongoing feasibility testing.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventionists will be trained in care coordination strategies and Motivational&#xD;
      Interviewing (MI) techniques. Following training, investigators will enroll eligible women&#xD;
      from a postpartum unit at a single hospital, or within two weeks of birth. Investigators will&#xD;
      assess feasibility, adoption, reach, and fidelity of the intervention and of study data&#xD;
      collections strategies. The intervention protocol will be revised to reflect these&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;

    <measure>Screening Rate (feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through six months</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will compare the number of potentially eligible participants to those who are screened for eligibility. The number screened will be defined as the number of people whose are reviewed to approach for enrollment. The number of potentially eligible participants will be considered the number of women with preterm births with Medicaid insurance.</description>

    <measure>Enrollment Rate (feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through six months</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will track the proportion of eligible women approached for enrollment who enroll in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Reasons for non-participation (acceptability)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through six months</time_frame>
    <description>For women who decline enrollment we will ask them, if they are willing, to provide reasons for non-participation and potential study modifications that might have encouraged them to participate. Responses will be tabulated and reviewed for potential themes.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention rate (feasibility)</measure>

    <measure>Number of Completed Assessments (feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through six months</time_frame>
    <description>The study team will track the proportion of the baseline, 3-month, and 6-month assessments that are completed.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Care coordination fidelity (feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through six months</time_frame>
    <description>We will assess the proportion of intervention components completed, including interventionist completion of screening tools, as well as other tasks outlined in the care plan, including focused education, navigation, and addressing barriers to care, screening.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity (feasibility)</measure>
    <time_frame>Enrollment through six months</time_frame>
    <description>OnePass is a validated tool used to evaluate MI practice and assess fidelity based on review of a single session, using 23 items to assess MI components.61 This tool yields a global score while also identifying specific areas for additional practice and training. Scores range from 1 - 7 with 5 considered a minimum for competence. Interventionists will complete at least one OnePass within a month of starting MI sessions with participants.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autonomy Support</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomy support will be measured with the short form of the Health Care Climate Questionnaire (6 items, range 6 - 42, Cronbach alpha 0.82). Scores on the short form 6-item version are calculated by averaging the individual item scores. Higher average scores represent a higher level of perceived autonomy support.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Autonomous motivation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Autonomous motivation will be measured using the Autonomous Motivation and External Regulation scales of the Treatment Self-Regulation Questionnaire (10 items, range 7 - 70, Cronbach alpha 0.90) with a higher score indicating higher emotion regulation strategy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Count of preventive care visits</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This will include postpartum visits, visits for contraceptive management, routine preventive care visits, and visits to follow-up on complications of pregnancy (secondary prevention). Visits will be abstracted from the health record and from interventionist records.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of recommended care completed</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Recommended care will be abstracted from a care plan completed within the first two weeks after enrollment. Completed care will be abstracted from the health record and from interventionist records.</description>

The final intervention is expected to be six months in duration. However during this single-arm open testing phase, some participants may receive only key components of the intervention in order to assess feasibility, reach, adoption, and fidelity of those components.</description>
