    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the 80-Minute Water Resistant SPF of three&#xD;
      sunscreen products (ChapStick Active Performance [CAP] UnScented, CAP Herbal Mint Flavour and&#xD;
      CAP Mountain Berry Flavour) using the methodology described in the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) Final Rule (2011).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, controlled, intra-individual comparison, evaluator-blind,&#xD;
      clinical study to determine the 80-minute water resistant SPF of three sunscreen lip balms.&#xD;
      Each participant will evaluate two of the three test products, an SPF standard and no&#xD;
      treatment. Study treatments will be randomly assigned to 4 test sites delineated on the skin&#xD;
      of the participant's back. The two test products will be applied to their allocated test&#xD;
      sites prior to the 80-minute water immersion procedure (four 20-minute water immersion&#xD;
      periods, each followed by a 15-minute air-drying period); the SPF standard will be applied to&#xD;
      its allocated test site on completion of the water immersion procedure. Test sites will be&#xD;
      exposed to doses of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and erythemal response evaluated 16-24 hours&#xD;
      later. Minimal erythema dose (MED) will be determined for protected and unprotected sites and&#xD;
      used to determine the SPF value of each test product.&#xD;

    <measure>Arithmetic Mean of Individual Sun Protection Factor (SPFi) Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Arithmetic mean of all valid SPFi values of each product on each participant will be calculated from the individual Minimal Erythema Dose (MED) on product treated (MEDp) test sites in relation to unprotected (MEDu) test sites 16-24 hours after exposure to UV radiation. SPFi = MEDp/MEDu. The MED is defined as the lowest dose of UV radiation that produces the first perceptible unambiguous erythema with defined borders appearing over most of the field of UV exposure. The exposure shall be increased in geometric progression with 25% dose increment in relation to the expected SPF values. All individual SPF values will be converted arithmetically to calculate SPF of test material (or control standard).</description>
