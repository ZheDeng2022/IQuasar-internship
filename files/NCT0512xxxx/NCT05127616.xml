      The EPPIC (Easing Pelvic Pain Interventions Clinical Research Program) study evaluates an&#xD;
      ultra-brief, 4 session cognitive behavioral pain treatment transdiagnostic in design for&#xD;
      urologic chronic pain syndrome (UCPPS) with clinical and practical advantages over existing&#xD;
      behavioral therapies whose length and focus limits their adoption by clinicians and coverage&#xD;
      for mechanistically similar comorbidities. A theoretically informed, practical, empirically&#xD;
      grounded approach will systematically unpack CBT's working mechanisms, clarify for whom it&#xD;
      works, ease dissemination, appeal to patients, providers, payers, and policy makers in the&#xD;
      COVID-19 era favoring low resource intensity treatments, and reduce cost and inefficiencies&#xD;
      associated with high intensity therapies whose complexity, length, and scarcity restricts&#xD;
      uptake and impact.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urologic chronic pelvic pain syndrome (UCPPS) encompasses several common, costly diagnoses&#xD;
      including interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic&#xD;
      pain syndrome that are poorly understood and inadequately treated. Their prolonged personal&#xD;
      and economic costs are amplified by the frequent co-occurrence of a cluster of centralized&#xD;
      pain conditions (particularly irritable bowel syndrome 3 [IBS]) but also fibromyalgia [FMS],&#xD;
      chronic headache, chronic fatigue, etc.) called Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPC).&#xD;
      Clinically, the notion that these syndromes share a centralized pain phenotype with a&#xD;
      fundamental disturbance in pain or sensory processing dovetails with our preliminary research&#xD;
      showing that a novel transdiagnostic behavioral treatment emphasizing a single common&#xD;
      mechanistic pathway (i.e. inflexible cognitive style) reduces severity of both targeted (IBS)&#xD;
      and untargeted multisymptom COPCs that include (but is not limited to) to UCPPS, FMS, chronic&#xD;
      fatigue, and chronic headache. If effective in a larger scale study, a transdiagnostic UCPPS&#xD;
      treatment would offer a more efficient, accessible, and broadly useful strategy for improving&#xD;
      chronic pelvic pain and its most frequent and complicating comorbidities. To this end, the&#xD;
      investigators will randomize 240 UCPPS subjects (18-70 yrs.) of any gender and race to a&#xD;
      4-session version of CBT that teaches skills for self-managing UCPPS symptoms (e.g. pelvic&#xD;
      pain, urinary symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency) with minimal clinician oversight&#xD;
      (MC-CBT) or a four-session non-specific education/support control (EDU). Efficacy assessments&#xD;
      will be administered at pre-treatment baseline and two weeks after the end of the 10-week&#xD;
      acute phase using the patient version of the Clinical Global Impressions Scale and validated&#xD;
      with the physician version rated by MD assessors blind to treatment assignment. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize MC-CBT will deliver significantly greater UCPPS symptom improvement&#xD;
      than EDU (Aim 1). Additional aims include characterizing the durability of effects 3- and 6&#xD;
      months post treatment (Aim 2). To increase the efficacy and efficiency of behavioral pain&#xD;
      treatments, the investigators draw upon Beck's transdiagnostic cognitive model to&#xD;
      characterize the precise cognitive procedures and corresponding operative processes (e.g.,&#xD;
      cognitive distancing, context sensitivity, coping flexibility, repetitive negative thought)&#xD;
      that drive MC-CBT induced UCPPS symptom relief relative to EDU (Aim 3) as well as baseline&#xD;
      patient variables that moderate differential response (Aim 3) with the ultimate goal of more&#xD;
      proactive patient-treatment matching fundamental to the goals of personalized medicine. By&#xD;
      applying innovative statistical modelling (e.g. dominance analysis, Randomized Explanatory&#xD;
      Trial analyses) to study aims in the context of a rigorously designed behavioral trial, the&#xD;
      researchers expand the portfolio of nondrug pain treatments for UCPPS and co-aggregating&#xD;
      COPCs to include one whose brevity, convenience, and transdiagnostic design &quot;meets patients&#xD;
      where they are&quot; and addresses the practical (access, complexity, cost), clinical (breadth,&#xD;
      durability, magnitude of effects, patient preference) and conceptual (untargeted&#xD;
      comorbidities, non-pain somatic symptoms) challenges that have impeded uptake and public&#xD;
      health impact of evidence-based behavioral pain treatments at a time when our most vulnerable&#xD;
      high impact pain patients are in greatest need.&#xD;
