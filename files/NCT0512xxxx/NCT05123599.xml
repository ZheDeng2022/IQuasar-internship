      JNJ-73763989 is a liver-targeted antiviral therapeutic for subcutaneous injection designed to&#xD;
      treat chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection via a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi)&#xD;
      mechanism. JNJ-64300535 is a DNA vaccine encoding the core protein and the Polymerase (Pol)&#xD;
      protein of HBV. The therapeutic vaccine aims at inducing T-cell-specific immunity against HBV&#xD;
      antigens in participants with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Selected nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs)&#xD;
      used in this study are approved treatments of chronic HBV infection. This study is designed&#xD;
      to assess efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a 24-week (Day 1 to Week 24) combination&#xD;
      treatment with JNJ-73763989 + NA + JNJ-64300535. The study consists of a Screening phase (4&#xD;
      weeks), Treatment period with JNJ-73763989, NA and JNJ-64300535 (187 days), and a follow-up&#xD;
      period (FU Week 1 till FO Week 48). Safety will be assessed by adverse events (AEs), clinical&#xD;
      safety laboratory assessments, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs and physical&#xD;
      examinations. The total duration of the study is up to 88 weeks (including 4 weeks of&#xD;
      screening).&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants must be medically stable based on physical examination, medical history,&#xD;
             vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) performed at screening. Any&#xD;
             abnormalities, must be consistent with the underlying illness in the study population&#xD;
             and this determination must be recorded in the participant's source documents and&#xD;
             initialed by the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a body mass index (BMI; weight in kilograms [kg] divided by the&#xD;
             square of height in meters) between 19.0 and 32.0 kilograms per meter square (kg/m^2),&#xD;
             extremes included, and skinfold thickness measurement of less than 50 millimeters (mm)&#xD;

             pregnancy test on Day 1 before the first dose of study intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. HBV infection must&#xD;
             be documented by serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positivity at screening. In&#xD;

          -  History or evidence of clinical signs or symptoms of hepatic decompensation, including&#xD;

          -  Participants with a history of malignancy within 5 years before screening (exceptions&#xD;
             are squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the skin and carcinoma in situ of the&#xD;

          -  Participants with any history of or current clinically significant skin disease&#xD;
             requiring regular or periodic treatment&#xD;

             diagnostic surgery, within 12 weeks before screening; or will not have fully recovered&#xD;
