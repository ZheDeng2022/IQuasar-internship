        condom during sexual contact with a pregnant female or a female of childbearing potential&#xD;
        while participating in the study, during dose interruptions and for at least 30 days&#xD;
        following investigational product discontinuation, or longer if required for each compound&#xD;
        and/or by local regulations, even if he has undergone a successful vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        * True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
