  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to determine whether a new form of family-based treatment&#xD;
      for repetitive and inflexible behaviors, delivered using videoconferencing technology, can&#xD;
      counter any negative effects of those behaviors, but also improve positive outcomes for young&#xD;
      children with ASD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this project is to conduct a parallel group randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing remote delivery of FITBI (12-week intervention + 3 booster sessions over 6 months)&#xD;
      to remote delivery of a parent education only (PE) control condition in a final sample size&#xD;
      of 100 (3-9 years) children with ASD and high rates of ritualistic repetitive behaviors. We&#xD;
      will use TORSH, a comprehensive secure online platform that enhances therapist-parent&#xD;
      coaching via telehealth. Further, an important objective of this proposal is to examine child&#xD;
      and parent factors associated with treatment response and uptake in order to advance&#xD;
      translational research and knowledge on personalized intervention approaches. Thus, the aims&#xD;
      of this project are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the acute and distal effects of the FITBI intervention on child and parent&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: In comparison to a PE only condition, FITBI will result in reductions in children's&#xD;
      repetitive behaviors and increases in appropriate play skills immediately post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Effects of the FITBI intervention will be maintained at a 6-month follow-up and increases&#xD;
      in child adaptive functioning and decreases in parent stress will be found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Determine if the FITBI intervention shows differential treatment effects for lower&#xD;
      versus higher order repetitive behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: FITBI will be effective at treating both lower and higher order RRBIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Examine if child variables (i.e., IQ and anxiety) moderate treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Based on prior behavioral intervention research, it is hypothesized that children with&#xD;
      higher IQs and fewer symptoms of anxiety at pretreatment, will show a better treatment&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Explore if parent variables (i.e., SES, race/ethnicity, marital status, and stress)&#xD;
      predict intervention fidelity and telehealth acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: As this is an exploratory aim, we do not have specific hypotheses.&#xD;
