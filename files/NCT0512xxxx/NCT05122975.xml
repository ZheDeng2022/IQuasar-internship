  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed project is to determine the safety and tolerability as well as the&#xD;
      preliminary efficacy of a novel small molecule drug, S48168 (ARM210), for the treatment of&#xD;
      Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia (CPVT1). This disease is associated&#xD;
      with fatal changes in heart rhythms leading to sudden death with exercise or excessive&#xD;
      excitement. It is due to mutations in the Ryanodine Receptor calcium release channel, which&#xD;
      cause leaky channels leading to the disease. S48168 (ARM210) repairs these leaky channels and&#xD;
      can be a disease-modifying therapy restoring normal function to the channels. This result&#xD;
      would allow children and adults with CPVT to live normal, active lives.&#xD;

Sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT)/ ventricular fibrillation (VF) - 20 points&#xD;
