  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study team will conduct a feasibility study to develop and test out procedures for&#xD;
      improved triage and COVID-19 testing in dental practices to increase safety and perceptions&#xD;
      of the safety of Dental Health Care Workers (DHCW) and their patients. DHCWs in offices with&#xD;
      Practice-Based Regional Network (PBRN) members and their patients will be recruited to&#xD;
      participate in one of two protocols. The first, point-of-care (POC), will test out procedures&#xD;
      for point-of-care SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing in the dental office along with enhanced triage&#xD;
      using pulse oximeters. The second, laboratory (LAB), will test out procedures for a&#xD;
      saliva-based laboratory SARS-CoV-2 viral test along with enhanced triage. The feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing COVID-related testing and enhanced triage procedures in the dental setting will&#xD;
      provide preliminary data to inform a larger network-wide study grant application.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data derived from this research would enable dental health care workers to return to work,&#xD;
      providing essential oral health care services in the safest possible environment. It will&#xD;
      provide patients with confidence that they could resume seeking dental care under optimal&#xD;
      conditions that ensure their well-being. The specific aims of this proposal are divided into&#xD;
      three parts. The first aim is to apply the Delphi methodology, selecting a facilitator, a&#xD;
      panel of experts, defining the problem, addressing the problem with several iterations, and&#xD;
      coming to a consensus solution. The second aim is will address the concerns and recommended&#xD;
      solutions proposed by the Delphi group and formulated into pragmatic improvements that can be&#xD;
      applied to improved practice procedures that can be formulated into testable hypotheses that&#xD;
      can be incorporated into a practice strategy for the future of dentistry. Pragmatic and novel&#xD;
      methodological changes developed by the investigative team will be presented once again to&#xD;
      the Delphi group to gain their approval and/or recommended modifications. Our overarching&#xD;
      goal is to test these &quot;improved&quot; strategies in a pilot study and as such the investigators&#xD;
      are looking to incorporate two to three methodological suggestions that can be fit into a&#xD;
      pragmatic re-design of &quot;best dental practices&quot;. Thus, the third aim is designed to test these&#xD;
      &quot;best dental practice&quot; approaches in a pilot study. The goal of the third aim is to evaluate&#xD;
      how each of these strategies can be applied to different office settings. The data derived&#xD;
      from this approach will be used to provide a sample size calculation for a larger study using&#xD;
      the PBRN framework for office participation. The all-encompassing aim of the study is to&#xD;
      develop a new way of approaching dental practice that ensures a sense of security and&#xD;
      practicality for both patients and health professionals. The hypothesis to be tested derived&#xD;
      from these aims relates to the structured development of several methodologies that can be&#xD;
      applied to dental practice. These methodologic improvements in dental practice will be based&#xD;
      on the most current scientific knowledge that can be applied to ensure safety in a dental&#xD;
      office setting. To re-iterate the purpose of this study developed from the three aims&#xD;
      proposed is to assess and compare each of the pragmatic models developed such that a sample&#xD;
      size calculation can be computed. The pilot study design and the sample size calculation&#xD;
      derived from this pilot data will compare two to three pragmatic/innovative modifications in&#xD;
      the current practice guidelines and provide an estimate that can utilize the larger PBRN&#xD;
      framework to best determine the generalizability of the models chosen for study.&#xD;
