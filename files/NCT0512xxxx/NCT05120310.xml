      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of using the Calm app + coaching concierge&#xD;
      (one 20-min session) and/or Calm Coaching for sleep program on sleep, mental health, and work&#xD;
      productivity outcomes in employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees (N=5,000) will be randomized into one of two groups for 8-weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Workplace stress is highly prevalent and is linked to poor health outcomes including&#xD;
      depression and anxiety. Depression impacts a person's physical ability to complete job tasks&#xD;
      about 20% of the time while reducing cognitive performance 35% of the time. Mental health&#xD;
      issues are not often properly identified and less than half of people receive treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Calm app is a mindfulness meditation mobile app and has been evidenced to reduce stress,&#xD;
      improve sleep, and reduce anxiety/depressive symptoms in a range of populations (e.g.,&#xD;
      college students, cancer patients, sleep-disturbed adults). The Calm app provides daily,&#xD;
      10-minute, guided meditations grounded in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and&#xD;
      Vipassana meditation. Uniquely, the Calm app also offers &quot;Sleep Stories&quot;, narrated fictional&#xD;
      tales that use mindfulness- inspired techniques to help users sleep. However, the effects of&#xD;
      the Calm app in employees among worksites has not yet been explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of using the Calm app + coaching concierge&#xD;
      (one 20-min session) and/or Calm Coaching for sleep program on sleep, mental health, and work&#xD;
      productivity outcomes in employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees (N=5,000) will be randomized into one of two groups for 8-weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will randomize the employee sites into one of two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention group (N=2,500): Calm app + concierge (one live 20-minute coaching session)&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Calm Coaching for sleep Subsample (N=100): Participants with elevated sleep&#xD;
           disturbance (determined as a score of &gt;10 with the ISI) AND interest in Calm Coaching&#xD;
           for sleep will be assigned to the Calm Coaching for sleep Program in addition to having&#xD;
           the Calm app + concierge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Waitlist control group (N=2,500): Following 8-weeks from the study start date, employee&#xD;
           receives access to the Calm app a. Calm Coaching for sleep Subsample (N=100):&#xD;
           Participants with elevated sleep disturbance (determined as a score of &gt;10 with the ISI)&#xD;
           AND interest in Calm Coaching for sleep will be assigned to the Calm Coaching for sleep&#xD;
           Program in addition to having the Calm app + concierge&#xD;
