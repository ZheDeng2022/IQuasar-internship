    <textblock>
      This is a registry to identify changes in the expression of aging-related biomarkers, changes&#xD;
      in functional performance, and/or changes in quality-of-life across the aging spectrum in 250&#xD;
      participants ≥ 25 years of age that will be conducted by the University of North Carolina.&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this registry is to measure biomarkers of aging/senescence and build&#xD;
      computational models of aging in order to better understand the role of senescence in&#xD;
      aging-related functional decline and differences between aging in a general population vs&#xD;
      cohorts enriched for aging related disease (cancer, heart disease). Aging biomarker data in&#xD;
      cohorts with cancer and heart disease has already been collected; the current study will&#xD;
      enroll participants into the cohort of aging in the general population (Aging Cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past century, life expectancy has increased by 30 years. With that gain has come a&#xD;
      dramatic rise in age-related disease and an urgent need to understand, prevent, and treat&#xD;
      these conditions. While age-related diseases have diverse phenotypes, there is increasing&#xD;
      recognition of common biological underpinnings with cellular senescence as the nexus linking&#xD;
      subcellular changes due to epigenetic changes, DNA damage, and mitochondria dysfunction with&#xD;
      a decline in health due to multi-morbidity. The molecular changes that shift one's aging&#xD;
      trajectory from a 'healthy' state to a 'disease' state are poorly understood; however, there&#xD;
      is increasing evidence that senescence plays a key role in this shift. Computational models&#xD;
      of natural aging and aging related disease are important tools in understanding the&#xD;
      phenomenon of senescence, its regulation and dynamics, and its role in physiological or&#xD;
      pathological processes during human aging. These findings will serve as pilot data for future&#xD;
      analysis of cellular senescence, as measured by p16INK4 (hereafter referred to as p16)&#xD;
      expression, and aging in other cohorts and begin to establish comparisons between p16 and&#xD;
      other potentially clinically relevant aging biomarkers such as DNA methylation and plasma&#xD;
      proteomics.&#xD;

      The primary purpose of this registry is to collect aging biomarker data in a general&#xD;
      population across the entire lifespan (Aging Cohort). The investigators will then build&#xD;
      several computational models of aging in order to better understand senescence in the context&#xD;
      of general aging or specific aging associate diseases. As a secondary goal, The investigators&#xD;
      will determine the association between biomarkers of aging and health characteristics&#xD;
      (defined through blood chemistry panels and specific functional measures). Central to these&#xD;
      computational models is the measurement of a biomarker of aging/senescence, p16INK4&#xD;
      (hereafter referred to as p16) in peripheral blood T cells. The primary aim of this registry&#xD;
      is to determine if p16 mRNA expression measured in T cells reflects total organismal&#xD;
      senescent load. The secondary aim is to determine if senescence dynamics are affected by&#xD;
      age-associated chronic diseases. The exploratory aim is to determine the ability of&#xD;
      computational models of senescence to predict clinical and functional status. Active&#xD;
      participation in the study will end at the completion of the study questionnaires and&#xD;
      assessments, but The investigators will ask permission to recontact participants at a later&#xD;
      date for longitudinal sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the prominence of senescence as an aging mechanism and target of geroscience-based&#xD;
      therapies, little is known about the dynamics of senescent cells in humans. Understanding the&#xD;
      process of senescence, including its regulation, dynamics, and contribution to physiologic or&#xD;
      pathologic processes, is essential for an understanding of aging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this registry, the investigators will assess the contribution of senescence,&#xD;
      co-morbidities, functional performance, and quality of life to aging. The investigators will&#xD;
      determine the ability of these factors to aid in the development of a new stochastic model&#xD;
      that will be formulated specifically in the context of T-cell turnover and senescence,&#xD;
      thereby providing a cell level description of p16 accumulation and a mechanistic model with&#xD;
      parameters characterizing relevant physiological processes. The development of this new model&#xD;
      will thus enable a quantitative, predictive, mechanistic study of the role of senescence in&#xD;
      aging at both organismal and cellular levels&#xD;
