  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate a fixed-dose co-formulation (FDC) of&#xD;
      ivermectin and albendazole for the treatment of all Soil Transmitted helminths (STH). The&#xD;
      current strategy to control STH in endemic areas is mass administration of albendazole or&#xD;
      mebendazole, mainly to pre-school and school-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this treatment works well for some STH species, efficacy against Trichuris trichiura&#xD;
      is poor and it is not effective Strongyloides stercoralis. Thus new drugs or drug&#xD;
      combinations are an urgent priority to increase the effectiveness of control programmes.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the World Health Organisation has recommended combination therapy of ivermectin&#xD;
      with albendazole. The trial proposed, is an adaptive phase II/III trial where the phase II&#xD;
      component will evaluate the safety of the FDC as a single dose or 3-day single dose regimen&#xD;
      for the treatment of T. trichiura in paediatric population. After analysis of the safety&#xD;
      results the phase III trial will be executed to evaluate the efficacy of the FDC as a single&#xD;
      dose or 3-day single dose regimen compared to the standard single dose regimen of ALB (400&#xD;
      mg) for the treatment of T. trichiura, hookworm and S. stercoralis in paediatric and young&#xD;
      adult population. The estimated total sample size for the adaptive design (phase II and III&#xD;
      component) is 1223 participants. Of these, 126 will be enrolled in the phase II and 1097 in&#xD;
      the phase III components respectively in an adaptive trial design.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      An adaptive phase II/III clinical trial to evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of a Single Day&#xD;
      or 3-day Single Dose of an ALBENDAZOLE-IVERMECTIN Coformulation vs ALBENDAZOLE for the&#xD;
      Treatment of Soil-Transmitted Helminth Infections. The estimated total sample size for the&#xD;
      adaptive design (phase II and III components) is 1223 participants. Of these, 126 will be&#xD;
      enrolled in the phase II and 1097 in the phase III components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II component (Kenya only)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unicentric, 3-arm, parallel, open-label, individually randomised, phase II trial to determine&#xD;
      in three weight groups, the safety of the ALBENDAZOLEIVERMECTIN Co-formulation given as a&#xD;
      Single Day or 3-day Single Dose regimen for the treatment of Trichuris trichiura in children&#xD;
      and young adult aged between 5 to 18 years. Estimated sample size: 126 participants&#xD;
      Participants will be stratified in three different weight groups in order to gradually&#xD;
      increase the dose of ivermectin in the Fixed Dose Co-formulation (FDC):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (38 participants): with body weight of 23-&lt;30 Kg will receive 300-391 µg/Kg IVM&#xD;
           (FDC 400mg-9mg) or ALB&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (38 participants): with body weight of 30-45 Kg will receive 400-600 µg/Kg IVM&#xD;
           (FDC 400mg-18mg) or ALB.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3 (50 participants): with body weight of 15-23 Kg will receive 391-600 µg/Kg IVM&#xD;
           (FDC 400mg-9mg) or ALB. Where FDC stands for Fixed Dose Co-formulation and ALB stands&#xD;
           for Albendazole. Then, the participants will be allocated to one of the three study arms&#xD;
           with unequal probability (ALB: p=0.2, n=26; FDCx1: p=0.4, n=50; FDCx3: p=0.4, n=50)&#xD;
           starting with group 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Arm 1: Single dose of a tablet of ALBENDAZOLE 400 mg (active control&#xD;
                arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Arm 2: Single dose of a tablet of ALBENDAZOLEIVERMECTIN Co-formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment Arm 3: Daily dose of a tablet of ALBENDAZOLE-IVERMECTIN Co-formulation&#xD;
                for 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III Component&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multi-centre, 3-arm, parallel, open-label, randomised, phase III trial to compare safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of the active control arm (current standard of care) against 2 experimental arms&#xD;
      for the treatment of T. trichiura, hookworm and S. stercoralis, in children and young adult&#xD;
      aged between 5-18 years in three subSaharan African countries (Ethiopia, Kenya and&#xD;
      Mozambique) We hypothesise that the FDC of Ivermectin (IVM) and ALB either at single or 3-&#xD;
      day regimens will be more effective against some species of Soil Transmitted Helminths (STH)&#xD;
      (T. trichiura, hookworm and S. stercoralis) compared to the current use of a single dose&#xD;
      regimen of 400mg ALB. Estimated sample size: 1097 participants Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated with unequal probability, according to the specific expected cure rate by treatment&#xD;
      and specie, to one of the three study treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 1: Single dose of a tablet of ALB 400 mg (active control arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 2: Single dose of a tablet of FDC 400mg-18mg or 400mg-9mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For participants &lt;45 kg of body weight at baseline: FDC of 400mg ALB- 9mg IVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For participants ≥45 kg of body weight at baseline: FDC of 400mg ALB-18mg IVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Arm 3: Daily dose of a tablet of FDC 400mg-18mg or 400mg9mg for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For participants &lt;45 kg of body weight at baseline: FDC of 400mg ALB-9mg IVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  For participants ≥45 kg of body weight at baseline: FDC of 400mg ALB- 18mg IVM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase III component, allocation of participants to study arms will be done by block&#xD;
      randomization and stratified by the species of STH. Treatment allocation for each study&#xD;
      participant will be concealed in opaque sealed envelope that will be opened only after&#xD;
      enrolment. Study participants will be assigned a unique number linked to the allocated&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The phase II and III trial components comprise of a screening phase, an enrolment phase, a&#xD;
      treatment phase, a post-treatment phase with follow-up visits, and early&#xD;
      withdrawal/end-of-study evaluations. Participants recruited in Mozambique will be offered to&#xD;
      be tested for HIV serostatus due to the high HIV prevalence in the country, but the result&#xD;
      will not determine the participant's eligibility. In Kenya and Ethiopia, the low HIV&#xD;
      prevalence does not justify HIV testing&#xD;
