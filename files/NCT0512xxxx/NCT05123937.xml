    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is the most familiar motor disorder of childhood. Consistent with the results&#xD;
      of recent scientific researches BOBATH approach in physical restoration of youngsters with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy promotes formation of motor skills. Improvement in mobility has been primary&#xD;
      goal in treatment of CP. There are only a few studies available within the efficacy of&#xD;
      &quot;task-oriented training&quot; to improve gross motor function in CP child. Hence, this comparative&#xD;
      study is undertaken to gauge the effect of task-oriented training verses neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      training on gross motor function in cerebral palsy child. Objective of this study is to find&#xD;
      out the effects of BOBATH technique and Task Training on gross motor function in cerebral&#xD;
      palsy children. A Convenient sample of Cerebral Palsy children fulfilling inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, from physiotherapy OPD of Allied &amp; DHQ hospitals of Faisalabad will be&#xD;
      considered. Informed consent will be taken from all patient's caregivers. Patients will be&#xD;
      divided into two groups through chit draw randomization. Age of children will be 3 years to&#xD;
      10 years without discrimination of gender. Group A will receive BOBATH training and Group B&#xD;
      will receive task training. Data will be collected through Gross Motor Function Measure&#xD;
      (GMFM-88). Data analyses using SPSS version 25 as a statistical tool.&#xD;

    <description>The Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) is an observational clinical tool designed to evaluate change in gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy. The GMFM-88 item scores can be summed to calculate raw and percent scores for each of the five GMFM dimensions of interest selected goal areas and total GMFM-88 scores. The scoring system of the GMFM is a four-point scale divided into five categories (lying and rolling; sitting; crawling and kneeling; standing; walking, running) Reliability refers to dependability, consistency, and stability of scores on an assessment tool. Both versions of GMFM were shown to be highly reliable, with ICCs of greater than .98 (95% confidence interval=0.965-0.994) and both of them can be used in clinical practice or research.</description>

    <description>In group A (BOBATH) one session per day for three days lasting 1 hour for 3 months. Position transitions such as turning from supine to prone or from prone to supine from sitting to standing are facilitated according to the needs. Balance reflexes are attempted to stimulate by using a CP ball. Ambulation training appropriate to the child's motor development. Additionally, passive stretching of spastic muscle reduces spasticity and facilitates the motor function</description>

    <description>In group B (task training) will be applied for 60 minutes per day, 3 times per week for 3 months the individual session lasted roughly 10 minutes for each activity. Standing from a seated situation; (ii) reaching for an object high up, which required ankle plantarflexion from the standing position, and go back to the starting position with the heel leaning on the floor; (iii) stepping on and off a bench; (iv) walking up and downstairs.
