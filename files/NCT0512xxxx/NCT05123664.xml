  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study will be conducted to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of 2 billion CFU/day of B. coagulans Unique IS2 on improving bowel&#xD;
      movement characteristics, gastrointestinal-related symptoms and quality of life in healthy&#xD;
      adult participants who are experiencing more than 3.0 but less than 6.0 complete spontaneous&#xD;
      bowel movements (CSBM) per week on average.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a run-in period of 14 days to assess participants' baseline bowel habits, they are&#xD;
      randomized to either B. coagulans or placebo for one month. The primary endpoint is change&#xD;
      from baseline at 4 weeks in stool frequency in the test product group compared to the placebo&#xD;
      group for average number of daily bowel movements over the week prior to the study visits.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are stool frequency at weeks 1, 2, 3, stool quality measured by Bristol&#xD;
      stool type scores, and gastrointestinal quality of life index (GIQLI) scores and&#xD;
      subcategories (social, physical, emotional, symptoms).&#xD;
