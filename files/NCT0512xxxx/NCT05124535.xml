      This study is the second cross-sectional study conducted in the region. In the first cross&#xD;
      sectional study, conducted in the winter of 2020, we aimed to estimate the seroprevalence of&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among blood donors in Sarajevo Canton. We also assessed immune&#xD;
      durability among seropositive participants after 6 months. In total, of 1015 blood donors&#xD;
      aged 18-65 years in Sarajevo Canton between 2 November and 3 December 2020 were recruited and&#xD;
      population-weighted seroprevalence in Sarajevo Canton was 19.2% (95% CI: 16.7-21.6%). The aim&#xD;
      of this second cross-sectional study is to measure the seroprevalence SARS-CoV-2 antibodies&#xD;
      and assess antibody kinetics in the blood donor population after 12 months.&#xD;

        Recruitment will be convenience sampling of blood donors aged between 18 and 65 years. All&#xD;
        blood donors visiting the Institute for Transfusion Medicine of the Federation of Bosnia&#xD;
        and Herzegovina for routine blood donation will be approached during the study period to&#xD;
        participate in the study by the staff (medical doctors) of Institute for Transfusion&#xD;
        Medicine of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina at time of donation. Some blood donors&#xD;
        will also be called by the staff of the Institute for Transfusion Medicine during the&#xD;
        routine actions for donation of missing blood types, from an existing list maintained by&#xD;
        staff at the Institute for Transfusion Medicine, and will be also invited to participate in&#xD;
        the study by staff upon attendance at the blood clinic. Investigators will endeavor to&#xD;
        ensure that the following three age groups can be reported: 18-29, 30-39, 40-65.&#xD;
