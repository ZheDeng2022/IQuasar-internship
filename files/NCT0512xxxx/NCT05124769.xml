    <textblock>
      Overuse shoulder injuries such as rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy are common with a prevalence&#xD;
      estimated to be 14% in the general population of which 23% of the working population with&#xD;
      shoulder problems are sick listed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RC tendinopathy is a tendon-related pain in the proximal lateral aspect of the upper arm with&#xD;
      weakness, especially during active elevation and external rotation, and painful active range&#xD;
      of motion. The prevalence of RC tendinopathy is highest in the supraspinatus and&#xD;
      infraspinatus tendon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise therapy is regarded as an effective intervention for symptomatic RC tendinopathy for&#xD;
      reducing pain and disability and improving function. However, the prescription is diverse and&#xD;
      the effectiveness of specific characteristics of exercise programs is unknown. Many&#xD;
      contextual factors and prescription parameters, such as external resistance, training&#xD;
      intensity and frequency, home versus supervised exercises, duration of the program, etc. have&#xD;
      been described. Some of these prescription parameters have been extensively studied, with&#xD;
      some conflicting results. Although some level of resistance seems to matter, as well as&#xD;
      number of sets and repetitions, the 'optimal' level and volume are unclear. Inducing or&#xD;
      allowing pain based on tendon loading during exercises is todays consensus in the treatment&#xD;
      of patellar and achilles tendinopathy using a pain-monitoring model. Although a number of&#xD;
      shoulder studies report that pain either should be avoided (17-19) or allowed (20-22), not&#xD;
      one study ever examined the influence of pain allowance versus pain avoidance during a&#xD;
      shoulder exercise program on patient outcome in terms of pain, physical function and&#xD;
      disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is to examine the effect of allowing pain versus avoiding pain&#xD;
      based on tendon loading during an exercise regimen for patients with symptomatic rotator cuff&#xD;
      (RC) tendinopathy. This will be accomplished in a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,&#xD;
      comparing the effectiveness on patient reported and objective outcomes of a &quot;pain allowing&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;pain avoiding&quot; exercise program, performed for 26 weeks. Our hypothesis is that allowing&#xD;
      pain based on tendon loading during exercises would result in a better outcome in pain and&#xD;
      function measured on SPADI (the primary outcome) compared to avoiding pain in patients with&#xD;
      RC tendinopathy.&#xD;

      Aim The purpose of this project is to examine the effect of allowing pain versus avoiding&#xD;
      pain based on tendon loading during an exercise regimen for patients with symptomatic rotator&#xD;
      cuff (RC) tendinopathy. This will be accomplished in a Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial,&#xD;
      comparing the effectiveness on patient reported and objective outcomes of a &quot;pain allowing&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;pain avoiding&quot; exercise program, performed for 26 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Shoulder disorders are the third most common musculoskeletal disorder with a&#xD;
      life-time prevalence in the general population of 30% (1). Shoulder disorders are often&#xD;
      persistent and recurrent, with 54% of the patients reporting on-going symptoms after 3 years&#xD;
      (2). RC tendinopathy is regarded as a common source of shoulder pain with prevalence&#xD;
      estimated to be as high as 14% in the general working-age population (3). About 23% of the&#xD;
      working population with shoulder problems are sick-listed (4), with a potential individual&#xD;
      productivity loss (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RC tendinopathy is a tendon-related pain in the proximal lateral aspect of the upper arm with&#xD;
      weakness, especially during active elevation and external rotation, and painful active range&#xD;
      of motion (6). The pathoanatomic understanding is extended by classifying tissue irritability&#xD;
      and specific impairments (7). Tissue irritability is meant to guide intensity of treatment,&#xD;
      and identifying specific impairments guides specific tactics used for intervention. (7). The&#xD;
      prevalence of RC tendinopathy is highest in the supraspinatus and infraspinatus tendon (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise therapy is widely regarded as an effective intervention for symptomatic RC&#xD;
      tendinopathy for reducing pain and disability and improving function (9). It is well known&#xD;
      that tendon collagen regains formation and tensile strength faster than unstressed collagen&#xD;
      (10), and that it can take 12 month or longer before it reaches full maturity and strength&#xD;
      (11, 12). However, the prescription is diverse and the effectiveness of specific&#xD;
      characteristics of exercise programs is unknown. Many contextual factors and prescription&#xD;
      parameters, such as external resistance, training intensity and frequency, home versus&#xD;
      supervised exercises, duration of the program, etc. have been described and are summarized in&#xD;
      a systematic review (9). Some of these prescription parameters have been extensively studied,&#xD;
      with some conflicting results. Although some level of resistance seems to matter, as well as&#xD;
      a number of sets and repetitions, the 'optimal' level and volume are unclear. The existing&#xD;
      studies offer some preliminary guidance in relation to the development and application of&#xD;
      loading in exercise programs for RC tendinopathy (13, 14), however there is a gap in&#xD;
      literature with respect to allowing or avoiding pain during shoulder exercises. Inducing or&#xD;
      allowing pain based on tendon loading during exercises is todays consensus in the treatment&#xD;
      of patellar and achilles tendinopathy (15, 16) using a pain-monitoring model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although a number of shoulder studies report that pain either should be avoided (17-19) or&#xD;
      allowed (20-22), not one study ever examined the influence of pain allowance versus pain&#xD;
      avoidance during a shoulder exercise program on patient outcome in terms of pain, physical&#xD;
      function and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis Allowing pain based on tendon loading during exercises would result in a better&#xD;
      outcome in pain and function measured on SPADI (the primary outcome) compared to avoiding&#xD;
      pain in patients with RC tendinopathy.&#xD;
