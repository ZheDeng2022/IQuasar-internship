    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm, double blind randomized 12-week study to supplement omega-3&#xD;
      (Eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA + docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) among 100 adults (age 18+) who had&#xD;
      coronavirus-19 (covid-19) and are experiencing possible after-effects from post-acute&#xD;
      sequelae of covid-19 (also called post-covid syndrome or long covid syndrome).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1 - Omega-3 (Eicosapentaenoic acid - EPA + docosahexaenoic acid - DHA) - Dose is 2,100mg&#xD;
      per day via 3 mini-capsules, 2x/day (a total of 6 mini-capsules per day). Each capsule has&#xD;
      252mg of EPA and 102mg of DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support for dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The American Heart Association (AHA) says taking up to 3 grams of fish oil daily in&#xD;
           supplement form is considered safe;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 5,000mg of omega-3 fatty acids per day is considered safe;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends consuming no more than 3 g/day of EPA&#xD;
           and DHA combined, including up to 2 g/day from dietary supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2 - Placebo - made from soybean oil (same dosing schedule as intervention arm)&#xD;
