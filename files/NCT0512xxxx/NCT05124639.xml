  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background. Self-management support is a complementary approach to treatment that aims to&#xD;
      educate participants on the nature of anxiety and to improve their strategies to manage&#xD;
      symptoms and well-being, thus presenting the potential to enhance recovery, improve outcomes,&#xD;
      reduce recurrence rates and lower health care costs. There is limited evidence to support the&#xD;
      effectiveness of group self-management support for anxiety disorders in community-based care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. This study aims at examining the effectiveness of a virtual group self-management&#xD;
      support program (SMS) for anxiety disorders as an add-on to treatment-as-usual (TAU) in&#xD;
      community-based care settings. We will also assess the incremental cost/effectiveness ratio&#xD;
      and the implementability of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The trial is a multicentre pragmatic randomized controlled trial with a&#xD;
      pre-treatment, post-treatment (4-month post-randomization), and follow-ups at 8, 12 and&#xD;
      24-months. Intervention. The experimental condition will consist of a 10-week SMS program for&#xD;
      anxiety disorders in addition to TAU. The control condition will receive TAU without&#xD;
      restrictions for anxiety disorders. Inclusion criteria will comprise being 18 years old or&#xD;
      older, French-speaking, and meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&#xD;
      (DSM-5) criteria for anxiety disorders: Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Social Anxiety Disorder,&#xD;
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Patients will be recruited within four regions in Quebec&#xD;
      (Canada). Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure is the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI).&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures include self-reported instruments for specific anxiety&#xD;
      symptoms, recovery, self-management, quality of life, and service utilisation. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis. A mixed effects regression model will be used to&#xD;
      account for between and within-subject variations in the analysis of the longitudinal effects&#xD;
      of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcomes. The rigorous evaluation of the SMS intervention in the real world will&#xD;
      provide information to decision makers, health care managers, clinicians and patients&#xD;
      regarding the added value of group SMS for patients with anxiety disorders. Widespread&#xD;
      implementation of this intervention could lead to more efficient mental health care services,&#xD;
      to better long-term outcomes and to a significant reduction in the extensive social and&#xD;
      economic burden of anxiety disorders.&#xD;
