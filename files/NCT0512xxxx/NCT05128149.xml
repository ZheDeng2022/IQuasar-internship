  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of PKU implies for most patients that with strict adherence to dietary treatment&#xD;
      they can achieve excellent neurocognitive outcome. Dietary treatment, though, is hard to&#xD;
      comply to every day and with every single meal. Unsurprisingly, health-related quality of&#xD;
      life (HrQol) is negatively affected if patients have to follow a dietary regime of this kind.&#xD;
      Adherence to treatment in PKU is very variable. Factors of significant impact on adherence to&#xD;
      treatment and well-being in chronic disease such as self-efficacy or parenting stress have&#xD;
      not yet been widely investigated in PKU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ideal treatment prescription (and guideline) recommends as much as necessary and as&#xD;
      little as possible, based on the best evidence available. Patients should neither be deprived&#xD;
      of treatment options nor be exposed to overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates adherence, metabolic control, HrQol in PKU patients treated by&#xD;
      centres which follow different guidelines&#xD;
