      This is a Phase 1, 2 part, fixed-sequence open-label, crossover study to evaluate the&#xD;
      potential CYP1A2-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDI), safety, and tolerability of ABX464&#xD;
      combined with a known CYP1A2 substrate (caffeine) and a known CYP1A2 inhibitor (fluvoxamine).&#xD;
      Sixty (60) healthy adult male and female subjects 18 to 55 years of age are planned to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Separate cohorts of subjects will be enrolled for Part A (24&#xD;
