    <textblock>
      A prospective, multi-center, single-group target value method to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Aorta Arch Stent Graft System combined with the Endovascular Needle&#xD;
      System in situ fenestration technology in the treatment of aortic dissection involving the&#xD;
      aortic arch&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. Clinical trials using prospective, multi-center, single-group target value design;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 120 subjects with aortic dissection requiring partial arch reconstruction will be&#xD;
           enrolled in more than 30 centers in China, and they will meet the test enrollment&#xD;
           requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. CTA examination was performed at baseline, 30 days, 6 months, 12 months, 36 months, and&#xD;
           60 months after surgery to determine the pathological status and the status of&#xD;
           postoperative aortic and branch revascularization&#xD;
