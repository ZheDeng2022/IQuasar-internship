  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the CAFÉ Study is to determine the cancer risks associated with germline CTNNA1&#xD;
      loss-of-function variants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The CAFÉ Study aims to determine the degree to which loss-of-function variants in the CTNNA1&#xD;
      gene are associated with hereditary cancers, including gastric cancer, breast cancer, as well&#xD;
      as other cancers that may be associated with this gene. By obtaining personal and family&#xD;
      history information from individuals who carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant and their&#xD;
      family members, this study will aim to better define CTNNA1 associated cancer risks and&#xD;
      determine whether there is a genotype/phenotype correlation for CTNNA1 loss-of-function&#xD;
      variants. This information will be important for the future cancer risk management of&#xD;
      individuals who carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age and older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be carrier, or a first degree relative of a carrier, of a CTNNA1&#xD;
             loss-of-function variant defined as: a variant predicted to lead to protein truncation&#xD;
             (nonsense and frameshift variants), a large deletion of one or more exons, or a&#xD;
             consensus splice site variant predicted to disrupt splicing in CTNNA1. CTNNA1&#xD;
             loss-of-function variants do not need to be classified as pathogenic or likely&#xD;
             pathogenic to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to understand and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be able to provide informed verbal or written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Less than 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who do not carry a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant and are not a first&#xD;
             degree relative of a CTNNA1 loss-of-function variant carrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who cannot speak and read English&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major psychiatric illness or cognitive impairment that in the judgement of the study&#xD;
             investigators or study staff would preclude study participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unable to comply with the study procedures as determined by the study investigators or&#xD;
             study staff&#xD;
