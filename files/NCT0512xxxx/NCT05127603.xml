      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Worldwide, neck pain is the 3th most common disorder that interferes with people's daily&#xD;
      functioning. Many people with neck pain consult a physical therapist because of their pain,&#xD;
      however treatment effects are small. Recent studies in a broader group of people with&#xD;
      musculoskeletal pain show that physical therapy interventions tailored to individual risk&#xD;
      profiles for chronicity are more effective. Considering the importance of psychological&#xD;
      prognostic factors in neck pain it is hypothesized that influencing dysfunctional cognitions&#xD;
      and negative emotions affects the way people cope with their pain and therefore can influence&#xD;
      their self-perceived health condition in a positive way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does an individually tailored intervention that focuses on influencing dysfunctional&#xD;
           illness perceptions and dysfunctional movement/ pain behavior change people's illness&#xD;
           perceptions, the way they cope with their pain, their self-perceived health condition&#xD;
           and to what do these people attribute this change?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do changes in specific illness perceptions (i.e. cognitions and emotions measured by the&#xD;
           IPQ-k and FABQ-pa) mediate the effect of an individually tailored physiotherapy&#xD;
           cognitive behavioral intervention measured by the Global Perceived Effect, Self-efficacy&#xD;
           (PSEQ), Functioning (PSFS) and Pain (NPRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study a Single Subject Experimental Design (SSED) is applied with a baseline phase&#xD;
      (duration two weeks), an intervention phase with 5-7 treatment consultations (offered once a&#xD;
      week) and a follow up (3 months after the last consultation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the baseline phase, a qualitative assessment of the illness perceptions, the way&#xD;
      people cope with pain and their self-perceived health condition, is carried out through a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview. A second interview is carried out after the treatment phase (in&#xD;
      the week after the last treatment consultation) to explore changes in (1) the illness&#xD;
      perceptions, (2) the way people cope with pain, (3) their self-perceived health condition and&#xD;
      to explore to what these participants attribute a change in their perceived health condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative part of the study is used to investigate whether influencing illness&#xD;
      perceptions (measured by the B-IPQ and the FABQ-pa) is a mediating factor for the treatment&#xD;
      effect (i.e. self-perceived effect measured by the GPE scale, self-efficacy (PSEQ),&#xD;
      functioning (PSFS) and pain (NPRS)). Outcome measurements in this quantitative part of the&#xD;
      study will be performed two times a week during the baseline phase and the intervention&#xD;
      phase. The last measurement in the intervention phase will be performed in the week after the&#xD;
      treatment is completed (depending on the individual situation after 5-7 weeks of&#xD;
      consultations). A follow-up measurement will be performed 3 months after the last treatment&#xD;
      consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with non-specific neck pain and a middle or high risk profile for chronicity (i.e. a&#xD;
      score of â‰¥ 4 on the Start Neck Tool) are the target group for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in collaboration with 11 local physiotherapy clinics in primary&#xD;
      health care. People with non-specific neck pain will be recruited via information on the&#xD;
      website or social media channels of the physical therapy practices, via posters in the&#xD;
      waiting room, via the secretary upon registration and via the physical therapist after the&#xD;
      (regular) screening. After being screened by a physical therapist and when fulfilling the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, information is given about the study. When willing to&#xD;
      participate and after reading the information letter and signing the informed consent,&#xD;
      patients will be included in the study. Their decision on participating in the study will not&#xD;
      have consequences for their treatment. From enrollment, the participants will fill in the&#xD;
      baseline measurements on the outcome variables twice a week and contact the researcher for&#xD;
      making an appointment for an interview. The interview, performed by the leading researcher,&#xD;
      will take place half way the baseline period of two weeks. In this interview the&#xD;
      participant's illness perceptions, how they cope with their neck pain and their&#xD;
      self-perceived health condition will be explored. Two weeks after enrollment in the study the&#xD;
      intervention will start. The intervention, with a total of 5 till 7 treatment consultations&#xD;
      depending on the patient's needs, is offered once a week by a trained physical therapist.&#xD;
      During this phase, the self-reported outcome measures will be collected twice a week using&#xD;
      questionnaires. The data from these questionnaires will be used to tailor the intervention.&#xD;
      Within a week of completing the intervention, the researcher will be contacted and a second&#xD;
      interview will take place. In addition to a further exploration of the participant's illness&#xD;
      perceptions, how they cope with their pain and their self-perceived health condition at the&#xD;
      end of the intervention, it is also evaluated to what the participant attributes a possible&#xD;
      change in the perceived health condition and what the role of the intervention has been.&#xD;
      Three months after the last treatment consultation, a follow up measurement will be conducted&#xD;
      by completing a questionnaire on the aforementioned outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of individually tailored physiotherapy that fits within the&#xD;
      guideline non-specific neck pain (KNGF, 2016), with a focus on influencing dysfunctional&#xD;
      illness perceptions and movement/pain behavior by means of communication, body awareness&#xD;
      exercises, functional movements and exposure techniques. Depending on the patient's needs,&#xD;
      5-7 treatment consultations will be offered with a frequency of once a week. The intervention&#xD;
      will be delivered by a trained physical therapist with specific interests in a&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral approach within a biopsychosocial model. The aim of the intervention is&#xD;
      to influence dysfunctional beliefs and negative emotions to increase their self-perceived&#xD;
      health condition and confidence in carrying out specific activities despite their pain and&#xD;
      fulfill the patient's individually formulated goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed method multiple case design implies the study of the clinical progress in an&#xD;
      experimental set up by both a qualitative evaluation and frequent measurements of several&#xD;
      quantitative outcome variables in a small sample of participants during a pre-intervention&#xD;
      phase (A), an intervention phase (B) and an intervention withdrawal phase (A').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analyses: Within the qualitative part of the study a content analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using the inductive analytical approach. The following steps will be taken: 1. Open&#xD;
      coding (identifying domains and topics guided by the research questions) 2. Development of&#xD;
      categories into a framework 3. Interpretation of the raw data 4. Discussion about the&#xD;
      interpretations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative analyses: Within the quantitative part of the study the participants are seen as&#xD;
      single systems in the analyses and they act as their own controls. Repeated measures will be&#xD;
      used to verify whether changes in specific illness perceptions (i.e. cognitions and emotions&#xD;
      measured by the IPQ-k and FABQ-pa) mediates the effect of an individually tailored&#xD;
      physiotherapy cognitive behavioral intervention on Global Perceived Effect, Self-efficacy,&#xD;
      Functioning and Pain. Furthermore this quantitative research will be used to validate the&#xD;
      data and interpretations from the interviews (i.e. to check whether 'the story people tell'&#xD;
      corresponds to more objective markers (triangulation)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complementary data that will be collected within the project are the characteristics of the&#xD;
      participating physical therapists (i.e. gender, age, work experience and specializations) and&#xD;
      treatment related data (i.e. the number of physiotherapy sessions, the focus area within a&#xD;
      session and the use of specific tools).&#xD;
