  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) are widely used targeted agents that&#xD;
      have been approved for the treatment of various tumor types. In some clinical studies with&#xD;
      EGFRIs, the incidence of dermatology AE, the skin rash, is reportedly as high as 95%, which&#xD;
      profoundly impact the patients' quality of life. However no treament for onset skin rash has&#xD;
      been approved to be effective by any clinical trial yet. Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has&#xD;
      been approved for or studied in a variety of skin conditions such as alopecia areata, atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis, and psoriasis. Thus we intend to evaluate the efficacy and safety of JAK&#xD;
      inhibitor cream for the treatment of EGFRIs-induced skin rash in cancer patients.&#xD;
