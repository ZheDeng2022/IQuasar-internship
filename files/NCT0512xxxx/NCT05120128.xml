    <measure>CLDEQ-8 Score follow up 1</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>CLDEQ-8 is a validated outcome measure for soft contact lens wearers. It has been highly correlated with habitual baseline status and change in overall opinion when subjects are refit with contact lenses.10 The sum of the item scores of CLDEQ-8, ranging from 0 to 37, will be used to assess dry eye symptoms, where higher scores indicated more serious symptoms.</description>

    <measure>MMP-9 Expression in Epithelial Cells of Bulbar Conjunctiva</measure>
    <time_frame>at 1-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject will have EyeprimTM samples collected which involves the 'double impression' technique where samples are collected twice from the same location using a single EyeprimTM membrane. Samples will be collected from the temporal bulbar conjunctiva in both eyes. From these samples, biomarker expression for MMP-9 will be measured. A higher level of MMP-9 expression is associated with a stronger inflammatory response.</description>

    <measure>Average difference in CLDEQ-8 scores between Subjects' own lens and AO1D</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 2-week follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>CLDEQ-8 is a validated outcome measure for soft contact lens wearers. It has been highly correlated with habitual baseline status and change in overall opinion when subjects are refit with contact lenses.10 The sum of the item scores of CLDEQ-8, ranging from 0 to 37, will be used to assess dry eye symptoms, where higher scores indicated more serious symptoms. The score will be calculated for each group (subject's own lens and AO1D) and timepoint (1- and 2-week follow-up). The difference between subjects' own lens and AO1D will be calculated as (AO1D minus subjects' own lens). The average will be reported for each timepoint.</description>

&#xD;
               8. Have habitually worn rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses, orthokeratology lenses, or&#xD;

&#xD;
               9. Have clinically significant (grade 3 or higher on the Efron grading scale) slit&#xD;

                  redness) or any other abnormality which would normally contraindicate contact&#xD;
                  lens wear&#xD;
