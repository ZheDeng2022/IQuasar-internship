      Background (brief):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shigellosis is the second leading cause of death due to diarrheal diseases worldwide&#xD;
      (&gt;200,000 deaths/year). Though the mortality rate associated with Shigellosis has decreased,&#xD;
      the fact that the bacteria have acquired resistance to multiple antibiotics, is a cause for&#xD;
      major concern. Oral azithromycin and intravenous ceftriaxone are the recommend first and&#xD;
      second line therapies, respectively in Bangladesh. Approximately 20% of Shigella isolates are&#xD;
      resistant to azithromycin suggesting that a substantial number of children will require&#xD;
      second-line therapy. While resistance to ceftriaxone in shigellosis is low in Bangladesh at&#xD;
      5%, the potential for rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance to this third-generation&#xD;
      cephalosporin and ceftriaxone's resource-intensive delivery method, underscore the need for&#xD;
      evidence-based alternative antibiotic regimens for multidrug resistant Shigella infections&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children treated with tebipenem-pivoxil will have no worse clinical and microbiologic failure&#xD;
      rates compared to ceftriaxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study involves aims to determine whether tebipenem-pivoxil is non-inferior to&#xD;
      the currently WHO-recommended second line Shigella therapy (ceftriaxone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the number of adverse events, between children with shigellosis treated with oral&#xD;
      tebipenem-pivoxil or IV ceftriaxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the prevalence of ceftriaxone and tebipenem-pivoxil resistance, as well as ESBL-&#xD;
      and carbapenemase-producing E. coli, in children treated with tebipenem-pivoxil or&#xD;
      ceftriaxone 4- and 30-days after initiation of second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a phase IIb randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of oral tebipenem-pivoxil, compared to IV ceftriaxone, for children with Shigella infections&#xD;
      unresponsive to first-line antibiotic therapy. Bangladeshi children aged 24 to 59 months with&#xD;
      suspected Shigella infections and no clinical improvement within 48 hours of first-line&#xD;
      therapy will be randomized to a 3-day course of oral tebipenem-pivoxil (4 mg/kg 3x daily) or&#xD;
      3-days of IV ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg 1x daily). The children will be evaluated for key&#xD;
      clinical, microbiologic, and safety outcomes during the subsequent 30-day period.&#xD;
      Additionally, we propose a lead in study of 15 patients to confirm the safety profile and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and efficacy of tebipenem in the study population. During this&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic study period we will compare 15 children with oral Tebipenem randomizing with&#xD;
      15 children with oral Azithromycin arm. We will also check invitro susceptibility of&#xD;
      Tebipenem-pivoxil in 200 shigella isolates prior to the clinical trial in collaboration with&#xD;
      Infectious Diseases Division, icddr,b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures/variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical and microbiologic success as defined by the absence of both clinical and&#xD;
           microbiologic failure at Day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical failure of test drugs as defined by the presence of fever (axillary temperature&#xD;
           ≥38°C), diarrhoea (3 or more abnormally loose or watery stools in the last 24 hours), or&#xD;
           blood in stool, at Day 7 of follow-up or a death prior to Day 7&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microbiological failure as defined by the presence of Shigella in culture or Shigella&#xD;
           DNA at quantities equal to or higher than enrolment values or Shigella isolated by&#xD;
           microbiologic culture at Day 7.&#xD;

      Specific Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective To determine whether tebipenem-pivoxil is non-inferior to the currently&#xD;
      WHO-recommended second line Shigella therapy (ceftriaxone)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Describe the number of adverse events, between children with shigellosis treated with&#xD;
           oral tebipenem-pivoxil or IV ceftriaxone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the prevalence of ceftriaxone and tebipenem-pivoxil resistance, as well as&#xD;
           ESBL-and carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli, in children treated with&#xD;
           tebipenem-pivoxil or ceftriaxone 4- and 30-days after initiation of second-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background of the Project including Preliminary Observations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shigellosis is the second leading cause of death due to diarrheal diseases worldwide&#xD;
      (&gt;200,000 deaths/year). Among children under 5 years, 60,000 deaths and 74,000,000 cases of&#xD;
      diarrhoea were attributed to Shigella in 2016, approximately 20% of which occurred in South&#xD;
      Asia. In its severe form, Shigella invades the intestinal tissue resulting in the clinical&#xD;
      manifestation of dysentery, blood or mucoid stool. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      recommends antibiotic therapy for children with Shigella dysentery based on evidence from&#xD;
      randomized trials demonstrating clinical and microbiologic benefit of antibiotics for&#xD;
      dysentery (&gt;60% of which is caused by Shigella infections). Oral ciprofloxacin and&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) ceftriaxone are the recommend first and second line&#xD;
      therapies, respectively. In Bangladesh, based on the prevalence of Shigella isolates with&#xD;
      resistance to ciprofloxacin (~70%), the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin is used as a first&#xD;
      line therapy with ceftriaxone (second-line) reserved for the most severe cases. Approximately&#xD;
      20% of Shigella isolates are resistant to azithromycin suggesting a substantial number of&#xD;
      children will require second-line therapy (Dhaka hospital, data unpublished). While a study&#xD;
      conducted at icddrb showed resistance to ceftriaxone in shigellosis is low in Bangladesh at&#xD;
      2-5%, but Dhaka hospital surveillance system identified around 10% ceftriaxone resistance in&#xD;
      under 5 children with shigellosis in recent years (from unpublished data), the potential for&#xD;
      rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance to this third-generation cephalosporin and&#xD;
      ceftriaxone's resource-intensive delivery method, underscore the need for evidence-based&#xD;
      alternative antibiotic regimens for multidrug resistant Shigella infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a patency document regarding the dosage of oral tebipenem pivoxil, it was reported that&#xD;
      the drug is effective against a number a Gram negative bacteria, including Shigella. To&#xD;
      evaluate the susceptibility of Tebipenem -pivoxil among Bangladeshi shigella isolates, we&#xD;
      will perform in vitro susceptibility testing with previously collected 200 isolates in&#xD;
      collaboration with Infectious Diseases Division of icddr,b. Assessing the need for new&#xD;
      therapeutic regimes to counter the growing threat of development of antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      and development of multi-drug resistant strains, we propose a phase IIb randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial (RCT) to determine the efficacy and safety of oral tebipenem-pivoxil, compared to IV&#xD;
      ceftriaxone, for children with Shigella infections unresponsive to first-line antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy. Bangladeshi children aged 24 to 59 months with suspected Shigella infections and no&#xD;
      clinical improvement within 48 hours of first-line therapy will be randomized to a 3-day&#xD;
      course of oral tebipenem-pivoxil (4 mg/kg 3x daily) or 3-days of IV ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg 1x&#xD;
      daily). The children will be evaluated for key clinical, microbiologic, and safety outcomes&#xD;
      during the subsequent 30-day period. Additionally, we will monitor the acquisition of&#xD;
      antibiotic resistance, including ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing E. coli, among enrolled&#xD;
      children to determine the clinical and public health risk of using carbapenem antibiotics in&#xD;
      this context. Furthermore, a lead in study of 15 patients is proposed to confirm the safety&#xD;
      profile and pharmacokinetics of tebipenem in the study population. In parallel we will enroll&#xD;
      another 15 children in Azithromycin arm. At the end of study, we will compare the two drugs&#xD;
      in terms of safety and efficacy both clinically and microbiologically against shigellosis in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      In-vitro Susceptibility test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For invitro susceptibility MIC testing will be carried for Tebipenem against ~200 Shigella&#xD;
      isolates in liquid media. For this we will test ~220 stored strains to revive ~200 strains.&#xD;
      The test will be carried out in Mucosal Immunology and Vaccinology Laboratory, Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Division of icddr,b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study for efficacy and pharmacokinetics for Tebipenem&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is received, children will be screened in Dhaka Hospital, icddr,b after&#xD;
      admission and eligible children with suspected shigella infection (clinical features of&#xD;
      fever, mucus and/or blood in stools, tenesmus and RBC and leucocytes &gt;10 per hpf in stool)&#xD;
      will be randomized local standard antibiotic azithromycin 10 mg/kg once daily for 5 days or&#xD;
      oral tebipenem-pivoxil (4 mg/kg TID x 3 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purposive sampling will be done for pilot study with 15 children in arm. Those who do not&#xD;
      respond to treatment within 48 hours or whose symptoms worsen will be switched to IV&#xD;
      ceftriaxone. The point of randomization will be considered Day 0; 3, 7, and 30 days after&#xD;
      randomization into the trial, children will be assessed clinically by a physical exam.&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements will be taken from children at initiation of first line therapy&#xD;
      and at day 3, 7, and 30 of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected from children at prior to randomization and at day 3, day 7,&#xD;
      and day 30 of follow-up. Stool samples will be divided into three equal parts, part 1 used&#xD;
      for microbiologic culture and parts 2 and 3 stored at -80°C. For the first stool sample an&#xD;
      additional portion of the stool sample will be used for microscopy and fecal leukocyte&#xD;
      determination. Microbiologic culture (for isolation of Shigella and E. coli and antibiotic&#xD;
      susceptibility testing [AST]) will be performed on fresh stool on day 0, day 3, day 7, and&#xD;
      day 30. Quantitative PCR to detect the presence of DNA of Shigella through the identification&#xD;
      of the ipaH gene will be performed on day 0, day 3 and day 7 frozen stool samples in a single&#xD;
      batch at the end of the study. Culture-results will not be considered as confirmed Shigella&#xD;
      infection as previous reports indicate that that approximately 60% of clinically relevant&#xD;
      Shigella infections are missed by culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 ml of blood will be collected on day 3 to assess AST, ALT, serum creatinine, and serum&#xD;
      carnitine levels by ELISA) and to assess drug exposure (if possible). In addition, 3 ml of&#xD;
      blood will be collected from participants at Day 0, Day 7 and Day 30 of follow-up for the&#xD;
      isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which will be subsequently cryopreserved for&#xD;
      future immunological studies. If possible, we will do platelet count on 7 day follow up. To&#xD;
      confirm the tebipenem pharmacokinetic and safety profile in the patient population, a lead in&#xD;
      study will be performed with the first 15 participants enrolled in the tebipenem-pivoxil arm.&#xD;
      The 15 children will have additional 0.5 ml blood samples (one tenth tsf) collected via&#xD;
      traditional method at time points distributed over days 0-3 to evaluate tebipenem&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. Due to the established Azithromycin dosing regimen and safety profile,&#xD;
      enrolment in the azithromycin arm will continue throughout the study. Blood collection limits&#xD;
      by weight, age inclusive of all blood draws within the last 30 days, will be strictly&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As we have targeted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Tebipenem in shigellosis of 15&#xD;
      children. It will not be possible to have culture report before 48 hours, so we planned to&#xD;
      evaluate 15 children with Tebipenem arm among those at least 50% children should have&#xD;
      confirmed shigella infection in culture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of efficacy trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision will be to progress to the main study if the proportion of clinical successes in&#xD;
      the Tebipenem arm is greater than or equal to the number of successes in the Azithromycin arm&#xD;
      among shigella confirmed cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective At the end, we might only get a conclusion whether Tebipenem as treatment of&#xD;
      Shigella is somewhat better than Azithromycin based on clinical improvement and&#xD;
      microbiological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After consent is received, children will be screened and monitored in the study in hospital&#xD;
      despite not yet being randomized (Day -2). Children will be immediately started on first-line&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy according to the local standard of care (azithromycin 10 mg/kg once daily&#xD;
      for 5 days). At or within 48 hours of treatment initiation, the study physician will examine&#xD;
      the child and determine whether or not the child is considered to have clinical failure with&#xD;
      first-line therapy (presence of fever, clinical deterioration, blood in stool, ≥3&#xD;
      loose/watery stool 48 hours after initiation of therapy). Children who have clinically failed&#xD;
      at 48-hours7 since 1st line therapy initiation will be randomized to one of the two treatment&#xD;
      arms: oral tebipenem-pivoxil (4 mg/kg TID x 3 days) or IV ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg QD x 3 days).&#xD;
      Children randomized to tebipenem-pivoxil that do not respond to treatment within 48 hours or&#xD;
      whose symptoms worsen will be switched to IV ceftriaxone. The point of randomization will be&#xD;
      considered Day 0; 3, 7, and 30 days after randomization into the trial, children will be&#xD;
      assessed clinically by a physical exam. Anthropometric measurements will be taken from&#xD;
      children at initiation of first line therapy, randomization (enrolment in the RCT), and at&#xD;
      day 3, 7, and 30 of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stool samples will be collected from children at Day -2 (prior to starting first-line&#xD;
      therapy) and among those randomized, prior to administration of the first dose of second-line&#xD;
      therapy (day 0), at day 3, day 7, and day 30 of follow-up. Stool samples will be divided into&#xD;
      three equal parts, part 1 used for microbiologic culture and parts 2 and 3 stored at -80°C.&#xD;
      For the first stool sample (at Day -2) an additional portion of the stool sample will be used&#xD;
      for microscopy and fecal leukocyte determination. Microbiologic culture (for isolation of&#xD;
      Shigella and E. coli and antibiotic resistance testing [AST]) will be performed on fresh&#xD;
      stool on day -2, day 0, day 3, day 7, and day 30. Quantitative PCR to detect the presence of&#xD;
      DNA of Shigella through the identification of the ipaH gene, will be performed on day -2, day&#xD;
      0, day 3 and day 7 frozen stool samples in a single batch at the end of the study.&#xD;
      Culture-results will not be considered as confirmed Shigella infection as previous reports&#xD;
      indicate that that approximately 60% of clinically relevant Shigella infections are missed by&#xD;
      culture33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 ml of blood will be collected on day 3 to assess AST, ALT, serum creatinine, and serum&#xD;
      carnitine levels (by ELISA) and to assess drug exposure (if possible). In addition, 3 ml of&#xD;
      blood will be collected from participants at Day 0, Day 7 and Day 30 of follow-up for the&#xD;
      isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which will be subsequently cryopreserved for&#xD;
      future immunological studies. If possible, we will do platelet count on 7 day follow up. To&#xD;
      confirm the tebipenem pharmacokinetic and safety profile in the patient population, a lead in&#xD;
      study will be performed with the first 15 participants enrolled in the tebipenem-pivoxil arm.&#xD;
      The 15 children will have additional 0.5 ml blood samples (one tenth tsf) collected via&#xD;
      traditional method at time points distributed over days 0-3 to evaluate tebipenem&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics. Due to the established ceftriaxone dosing regimen and safety profile,&#xD;
      enrolment in the ceftriaxone arm will continue throughout the study. Blood collection limits&#xD;
      by weight, age inclusive of all blood draws within the last 30 days, will be strictly&#xD;
      followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation and Outcome (Primary and Secondary) Variable(s) To the best of our&#xD;
      knowledge, no randomized clinical trials have compared treatment options for clinically&#xD;
      non-responding children with shigellosis or children with drug resistant (or presumed&#xD;
      drug-resistant) Shigella. Therefore, the sample size estimation was derived from the most&#xD;
      recent of the three trials of IV/IM ceftriaxone for shigellosis34-36 which compared a 3-day&#xD;
      course of oral ciprofloxacin to IM ceftriaxone in Israeli children with invasive diarrhoea&#xD;
      (73 of whom had Shigella) and found 97% microbiologic success and 100% clinical success on&#xD;
      day 5 36. We therefore assumed a clinical and microbiologic success rate of 97%. We chose a&#xD;
      10% non-inferiority margin as the maximum risk difference in clinical and microbiologic&#xD;
      success between tebipenem-pivoxil or ceftriaxone that would be clinically acceptable, by&#xD;
      consultation with infectious disease and paediatric clinical specialists at the icddr,b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming an equal cure rate of 97% for both arms, a 10% non-inferiority margin and a 2.5%&#xD;
      one-sided alpha level, the study would require 46 confirmed Shigella patients per treatment&#xD;
      arm to have 80% power. To achieve 92 children with Shigella-confirmed infection we will need&#xD;
      to recruit 124 children in the RCT (approximately 75% of whom will have Shigella infection&#xD;
      confirmed by PCR). We anticipate a low (5%) dropout rate because of the short follow-up time&#xD;
      period for the primary outcome and the close monitoring of these children, requiring we enrol&#xD;
      132 children in the trial (66 in each arm). There are three major aims of this trial; each&#xD;
      aim along with the concurrent expected outcome has been described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether tebipenem-pivoxil is non-inferior to the currently WHO-recommended 2nd&#xD;
      line Shigella therapy (ceftriaxone). Here, clinical failure will be defined as presence of&#xD;
      fever (axillary temperature ≥38°C), diarrhoea (3 or more abnormally loose or watery stools in&#xD;
      the last 24 hours), or blood in stool, at Day 7 of follow-up or a death prior to Day 7.&#xD;
      Microbiological failure will be defined as the presence of Shigella DNA at the same or higher&#xD;
      quantities at Day 7 than at enrolment or Shigella isolated by microbiologic culture at Day 7.&#xD;
      Clinical and microbiologic success is therefore defined as the absence of both clinical and&#xD;
      microbiologic failure at Day 7. Change in length-for-age z-score (LAZ) and change in&#xD;
      mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) will be defined as the difference in LAZ and MUAC between&#xD;
      enrolment and follow-up time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the number of adverse events, between children with shigellosis treated with oral&#xD;
      tebipenem-pivoxil or IV ceftriaxone. Adverse events will be ascertained by caregiver report&#xD;
      or identified by the study clinicians during clinical exams in hospital, at scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up visits or during unscheduled visits. Severity (grades 1-5) will be defined&#xD;
      according to 2014 Division of AIDS Table for Grading the Severity of Adult and Paediatric&#xD;
      Adverse Events by the clinical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the prevalence of ceftriaxone and tebipenem-pivoxil resistance, as well as ESBL-and&#xD;
      carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli, in children treated with tebipenem-pivoxil or&#xD;
      ceftriaxone 4- and 30-days after initiation of second-line therapy. Resistance cut-offs will&#xD;
      be determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) 2021 Standards.&#xD;
      Accordingly, ceftriaxone resistance will be defined as MIC ≥4 as per CLSI guidelines. ESBL&#xD;
      will be detected by Vitek 2 system which is an automated bacterial identification and&#xD;
      susceptibility testing system. Carbapenemase resistance will be defined as resistance to any&#xD;
      of the following: meropenem (MIC ≥4), imipenem (MIC ≥4) or ertapenem (MIC ≥2). MIC cut-offs&#xD;
      have not been established for tebipenem-pivoxil in E. coli and therefore will be analysed as&#xD;
      a continuous variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug in this study will be tebipenem pivoxil administered orally as the pediatric&#xD;
      formulation, Orapenem (10% fine granules). Proposed dosing will be based on the following&#xD;
      weight bands:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-5.9 kg: 18 mg TID x 3 days (54 mg total daily dose) 6-9.9 kg: 32 mg TID x 3 days (66 mg&#xD;
      total daily dose) 10-13.9 kg: 48 mg TID x 3 days (144 mg total daily dose) 14-19.9 kg: 68 mg&#xD;
      TID x 3 days (204 mg total daily dose) 20-24.9 kg: 90 mg TID x 3 days (270 mg total daily&#xD;
      dose) 25-34.9 kg: 120 mg TID x 3 days (360 mg total daily dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tebipenem pivoxil will be administered in 3 separate doses throughout the day for 3&#xD;
      consecutive days. If clinical research staff members discover that a dose was not&#xD;
      administered on time, it should be administered immediately, and the actual time noted. The&#xD;
      following/subsequent dose should not be given any sooner than 4 hours after the &quot;late&quot; dose.&#xD;
      If the &quot;missed/late&quot; dose is within an hour of the next dose, then the missed dosed will be&#xD;
      skipped and the next dose will be given as scheduled (i.e., the subject will have 2 doses&#xD;
      rather than 3 in that 24-hour period). If a child vomits within 30 minutes of drug&#xD;
      administration, the dose will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK Sampling Schedule Plasma PK Sampling Schedule Below is a proposed sample schedule for PK&#xD;
      study that will be done on the first 15 patients. However, the final schedule will be&#xD;
      modified to confirm to all blood collection limits by weight, age inclusive of all blood&#xD;
      draws within the last 30 days. We plan to have sparse sampling for each participant in the&#xD;
      trial. Blood samples will be collected for determination of tebipenem concentrations and PK&#xD;
      parameters are shown below. Time of study drug administration, time of nutritional supplement&#xD;
      administration, PK blood sampling time, and meal timing will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 of tebipenem dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Dose 1: 0 hours Post-Dose 1: 0.5 hours (±6 minutes) 1 hours (±6 minutes) 4 hours (±24&#xD;
      minutes) Post-dose 2: 1-2 hours post-dose 2 Post-dose 3: 1-2 hours post-dose 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 of tebipenem dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Dose 1: 0 hours Post-Dose 2: 1-2 hours post-dose 2 Post-Dose 3: 1-2 hours post-dose 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 of tebipenem dosing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Dose 1: 0 hours Post-Dose 1: 0.5 hours (±6 minutes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 hours (±6 minutes) 4 hours (±24 minutes) Post-dose 2: 1-2 hours post-dose 2 Post-dose 3:&#xD;
      1-2 hours post-dose 3&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis The primary analysis will be limited to children in whom Shigella was&#xD;
      identified by PCR or culture at enrolment in the RCT (Day 0). Secondary analyses will include&#xD;
      all children enrolled in the RCT (some of whom may not have molecularly confirmed Shigella&#xD;
      infections but may have other inflammatory enteric bacteria, such as Campylobacter). Deaths&#xD;
      due to non-Shigella related causes will be excluded as treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary analyses will be intention-to-treat (ITT) based on randomization allocation to&#xD;
           the 3-day course of tebipenem-pivoxil or ceftriaxone with randomization group included&#xD;
           as the only covariate in models.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All investigators, statisticians, and laboratory personnel will be blinded to&#xD;
           randomization arm. However, due to the difference in administration of the two drugs,&#xD;
           oral vs. IV, study clinicians and local investigators will not be blinded. Clinical&#xD;
           outcomes will be determined using standardized questionnaires and measures (observed&#xD;
           stool frequency, stool appearance, and axillary temperature) so as to limit potential&#xD;
           bias in clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome will be a combined outcome of clinical and microbiologic success at&#xD;
           day 7.&#xD;
