  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aims to characterize the distributive pattern of viruses in upper airway and its&#xD;
      relationship with influenza seasons, symptomatology and exposure setting. A total of 500&#xD;
      adults residing in Hong Kong would be recruited, who would complete a questionnaire and&#xD;
      return self-collected nasal and throat swabs for metagenomic analyses.&#xD;

      1. This is a serial cross-sectional study. Participants would be asked to complete a&#xD;
           questionnaire and to self-collect nasal and throat swabs during a specified collection&#xD;
           period with reference to an influenza season.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects would be invited by post through randomly selected households throughout the&#xD;
           territory of Hong Kong. Eligible persons are adults normally resident in the address who&#xD;
           could communicate in written Chinese or English. Persons incapable of giving informed&#xD;
           consent would be excluded. Other exclusion criteria are: individuals with mental&#xD;
           illnesses, prisoners. Approval is obtained from the clinical research ethics committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A bilingual questionnaire would be administered, which consists of four parts,&#xD;
           including: (a) Socio-demographics; (b) History of SARS-CoV-1 infection and vaccination;&#xD;
           (c) Exposure settings preceding sample collection; (d) Presence and types (if any) of&#xD;
           influenza-like illnesses (ILI) at the time of sample collection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. With the provision of nasal and throat swab collection kits, participants shall collect&#xD;
           the nasal/throat sample within a 3-month period from the start of an influenza season&#xD;
           when one presents with influenza-like illnesses (ILI), or at the end of the season if no&#xD;
           such illnesses occur. The self-collected swabs would need to be returned with the&#xD;
           questionnaire within 48 hours after sampling. After returning the swabs, a HK$50 voucher&#xD;
           would be given to compensate participants' time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. RNA would be extracted from the collected samples, followed by by metagenomic analyses.&#xD;
           The collected data would be tidied, checked and collated to form a research database.&#xD;
           Descriptive statistics, including standard frequency tables and metrics, would be&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The key outcomes in this study are the change of abundance of viruses in different&#xD;
           influenza seasons, and the difference in distributions of viral taxa in samples from&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. On completion of the analyses, the transmission risk of respiratory infections could be&#xD;
           assessed, and emerging viral infections could be identified. Certain exposure setting&#xD;
           associated viruses could be identified to inform public health policies.&#xD;
