      Background The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has presented an important&#xD;
      and urgent threat to global health since its outbreak in December 2019. The COVID-19 does not&#xD;
      only affect the respiratory tract, but also other organs in human body including lungs,&#xD;
      liver, kidney, heart, vessels, and other organs (1). Respiratory failure and acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the most common serious complications of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection (2). The crude mortality rates (CMRs) of COVID-19 varies in different locations,&#xD;
      which ranges from 37.0/100,000 to 167.6/100,000 in several European countries up to 30th&#xD;
      August 2020 (3). The in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 was reported to be 17.1% based on 33&#xD;
      studies from 13,398 patients (4), and it was 2.9 times higher than that of influenza based on&#xD;
      the French national administrative database (5). It was reported that 26% of the COVID-19&#xD;
      patients admitted to ICU with severe status and 31% of the patients who admitted to ICU died&#xD;
      based on 37 studies from 24,983 patients (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several risk factors on patients' demographic characteristics and underlying&#xD;
      medical conditions which were shown be associated with the critical outcomes of COVID-19 (7).&#xD;
      In addition, poor oral health, in particular periodontitis, was also shown to be associated&#xD;
      with the critical outcomes of COVID-19 (8). Marouf et al. showed that COVID-19 patients with&#xD;
      periodontitis had 8 times higher odds of death and 3.5 times higher odds of ICU admission&#xD;
      than those without periodontitis based on a case-control study (9). This may be because&#xD;
      periodontal disease could enhance cytokine release via altered microflora, expression of&#xD;
      multiple viral receptors, bacterial superinfection, and aspiration of periodontal pathogens&#xD;
      (10). The increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokine, which is referred to as cytokine&#xD;
      storm, is the foremost cause of the adverse events of COVID-19 (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the high contagiousness, high ICU admission rate, and high mortality of COVID-19,&#xD;
      it has led to tremendous increases in the demand for hospital beds and shortage of medical&#xD;
      equipment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a pragmatic risk stratification tool that&#xD;
      allows the early identification of the COVID-19 patients who are likely to be at highest risk&#xD;
      of ICU admission and death (11). This can help clinicians and policymakers make the decisions&#xD;
      on the management and optimize resource allocation. A recent review identified multiple&#xD;
      prediction models which have been developed for prediction of prognosis of COVID-19 patients&#xD;
      (12). Those prediction models varied in their predictors and performance of the models. A&#xD;
      large number of prediction models reflected difficulties in their application in the rapid&#xD;
      risk stratification for general COVID-19 patients at their first intake in hospitals because&#xD;
      some predictors cannot be easily obtained without professional devices or lab tests, such as&#xD;
      C reactive protein, peripheral oxygen saturation, and urea level. Many prediction models&#xD;
      showed moderate performance in aspects of discrimination and calibration, and no benefit to&#xD;
      clinical decision making (12). In addition, the dental variables were not considered the&#xD;
      potential predictors in the previously developed models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to develop and externally validate a prediction&#xD;
      model for the critical outcomes of COVID-19 patients using predictors which can be easily&#xD;
      obtained in clinical practice, including patients' demographic characteristics, self-reported&#xD;
      medical conditions, and oral health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Participants We include hospitalized patients and outpatients from the&#xD;
      Isala Hospital (Zwolle, the Netherlands) with confirmed COVID-19 who visited the Department&#xD;
      of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMFS) between March 2020 and May 2021, if they have had a&#xD;
      dental panoramic radiograph (OPG), obtained up to a maximum of 5 years until the end of the&#xD;
      current study. The patients are used to develop the prediction model (derivation cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also include the hospitalized patients and outpatients from Noordwest Ziekenhuis (NWZ)&#xD;
      (Alkmaar, the Netherlands) with confirmed COVID-19 to externally validate the prediction&#xD;
      model (validation cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential predictors&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential predictors include patients' demographic characteristics, self-reported medical&#xD;
      conditions, and oral health. All the potential predictors are collected at baseline. The&#xD;
      potential predictors are presented below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gender&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Smoking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypercholesterolemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  COPD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CVD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chronic kidney disease&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OSAS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental variables (based on OPG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of dental implants&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome (endpoint) The endpoint of the study is the presence or absence of the critical&#xD;
      outcomes of COVID-19 (dichotomized). The course and outcome of the COVID-19 is classified&#xD;
      into (1) ambulatory; (2) hospitalized; (3) ICU admission or death based on the WHO Clinical&#xD;
      Progression Scale (13). In the study, the critical outcomes are defined as ICU admission or&#xD;
      death, while the non-critical outcomes are defined that patients are ambulatory or&#xD;
      hospitalized without ICU admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The prediction modes will be developed and externally validated.&#xD;
