    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of muscular endurance of the trunk,&#xD;
      upper extremities, and scapular region as well as cervical region, with pain, neck awareness,&#xD;
      and kinesiophobia in patients with cervical disc herniation. Thirty-six patients between&#xD;
      18-65 years with a diagnosis of cervical disc herniation and having neck pain of 2 and above&#xD;
      at rest according to the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) were included in the study. After the&#xD;
      evaluation of musculoskeletal system, endurance tests were performed for 9 muscles/muscle&#xD;
      groups in the cervical and scapular regions, upper limb, and trunk. Pain severity was&#xD;
      measured by VAS and Neck Disability Index (NDI), neck awareness with Fremantle Neck Awareness&#xD;
      Questionnaire (FreNAQ), and fear of movement with Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale (TKS).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical disc herniation occurs as a result of a sudden trauma or chemical/mechanical&#xD;
      degenerative changes in the cervical spine, and is more common in women. The most common age&#xD;
      range for disc herniation is 51-60 years with the increase in prevalence with age in both&#xD;
      genders, and the most affected disc level is C6-C7. The clinical presentation such as&#xD;
      weakness in cervical musculature, decreased endurance, loss of motor control and postural&#xD;
      stabilization, changes in reflexes, loss of sensation, and movement limitations varies based&#xD;
      on the location of the disc. The pain caused by any damage or compression in the cervical&#xD;
      spinal nerve root is seen along the affected nerve dermatome as well as the head, neck,&#xD;
      scapula, shoulder, and upper extremity, and accompanied by spasm in the cervical muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical muscles have a large number of sensory receptors responsible for vestibular, visual,&#xD;
      and postural control by the deep suboccipital muscles with dense muscle spindles. They are&#xD;
      responsible for the stabilization of the head, neck, and the thoracic region against&#xD;
      involuntary perturbation by maintaining the continuity of the posture; they ensure the&#xD;
      mobility of neck and upper limbs, and contribute neck awareness and postural reflexes.&#xD;
      Intense proprioceptive receptors of deep cervical muscles support the motor control of the&#xD;
      trunk muscles, mutually trunk muscles contribute to stabilization of the head and neck; and&#xD;
      through the thoracolumbar fascia they work in coordination with scapular muscles. It has been&#xD;
      known that any involvement of cervical, trunk, and scapular region muscles, as a whole,&#xD;
      contribute to the etiology of the neck pain in patients due to their strong anatomical&#xD;
      relations. In addition, the contribution of the upper extremity muscles in the stabilization&#xD;
      of the cervical spine and the triggering of neck pain during upper extremity movements also&#xD;
      reveal the importance of the motor control of upper extremity muscles in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endurance of the cervical muscles has been known to have more responsibility on the spinal&#xD;
      stabilization than strength in patients with chronic neck pain, causing an increase in pain&#xD;
      with the decrease in endurance. In cervical disc herniation, the pathology in the cervical&#xD;
      region causing the malalignment of the spine not only deteriorate the strength and endurance&#xD;
      of the neck muscles, but it also affects other muscles around the spine. Further,&#xD;
      proprioceptive receptors in the cervical muscles lose the ability to detect changes in muscle&#xD;
      tension due to the reduced endurance, which in turn affect neck awareness. On the other hand,&#xD;
      since chronic pain is closely related to cognitive and behavioral factors, pain worsens as a&#xD;
      result of activity avoidance according to the fear-avoidance model, hence the kinesiophobia&#xD;
      also increases by the decrease in cervical muscle endurance in chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies revealed the connection between the endurance of neck muscles and pain, neck&#xD;
      awareness, and fear of movement in patients with cervical disc herniation in literature.&#xD;
      However, the evidence related to the relation between scapular, upper extremities, and trunk&#xD;
      muscles' endurance and neck pain, neck awareness, and fear of movement has still been&#xD;
      lacking. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the association between&#xD;
      the endurance of these muscles and neck pain, neck awareness, and kinesiophobia in patients&#xD;
      with cervical disc herniation.&#xD;

    <description>The endurance of the 9 muscles/muscle groups including cervical flexor, extensor, deep flexor muscles, trunk flexor, extensor, lateral flexor, and stabilizer muscles, upper extremity, and scapular muscles (mm. serratus anterior and trapezius) were evaluated based on the assessment instructions given in the studies of Edmonston et al., Grimmer et al., Evans et al., Reece et al. and ACSM guideline</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Level of Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>In order to evaluate the pain levels of the patients, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), which was developed by Price et al. to evaluate the pain level of patients with chronic pain, was used.19 Patients were asked to rate their neck pain on the 10 cm horizontal line where &quot;0&quot; meant no pain, and &quot;10&quot; meant the most severe pain. The points that patients marked were measured with a ruler and noted as pain severity at resting, during activity, and night, separately.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Neck Awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Turkish version of the Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire (FreNAQ) which was developed by Wand et al. to assess neck awareness in patients with chronic neck pain was used in this study. The FreNAQ consists of 9 items related to neck pain, attention, and proprioceptive awareness. Each question is scored between 0 and 4 (0 = Never / I never feel this way, 1 = I rarely feel this way, 2 = I sometimes feel this way, 3 = I often feel this way, 4 = I often or always feel this way). The total score of the questionnaire is between 0 and 36. Higher scores indicate higher degrees of neck awareness</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Fear of Movement</measure>
    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The fear of movement was assessed by the Turkish version of the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia which originally developed by Kori et al. The questionnaire which evaluates injury avoidance and fear of movement consists of 17 items, and each item is scored between 1 and 4 (1 = Strongly disagree, 4 = Strongly agree). The total score ranges from 17 to 68. Higher scores indicate a higher kinesiophobia level.</description>

    <time_frame>two weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The NDI was developed as the neck version of the Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire to evaluate the disability caused by chronic neck pain. Each question is scored between 0 and 5 and the level of disability of the patients is classified according to the following scoring; 0-4 points, no disability; 5-14 points, mild disability; 14-24 points, moderate disability; 25-34 points, severe disability; and, 35-50 points, complete disability.</description>
