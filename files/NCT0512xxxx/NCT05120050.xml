      Prospective comparison of cytology slides (bronchoscopically derived fine needle aspiration&#xD;
      samples of lymph nodes at the time of rapid intraprocedural on site evaluation) created with&#xD;
      the ASP Health's specimen preparation system to slides made by existing conventional methods.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rapid On-Site Evaluation (ROSE) has dramatically improved patient care during Fine Needle&#xD;
      Aspiration procedures by providing adequacy feedback to the proceduralists. In the case of&#xD;
      endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures, the samples that are collected from the patients&#xD;
      are reviewed to determine adequacy of samples to ensure diagnostic quality samples are being&#xD;
      processed. If the amount of specimen is found to be adequate, the interventional&#xD;
      pulmonologists make additional passes to collect more specimen sample. While the existing&#xD;
      ROSE method performed by smearing the samples on the glass slide and staining the slides has&#xD;
      dramatically improved patient outcomes, it has several challenges/drawbacks. Some of the&#xD;
      challenges of ROSE slide preparation include: (i) high variability in sample quality, (ii)&#xD;
      cumbersome process in the procedure room and (iii) possibility of cross contamination between&#xD;
      samples, (iv) slow specimen preparation and staining process which leads to extended&#xD;
      procedure time and (v) the cost of the personnel to prepare slides. The goal of this study is&#xD;
      to conduct a trial of a novel automated sample preparation system from ASP Health that&#xD;
      combines both the specimen deposition and staining in a compact/mobile unit. This automated&#xD;
      system is expected to improve the workflow of the cytotechnologists and cytopathologists by&#xD;
      ensuring reproducibility and efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ASP's sample preparation instrument: The instrument is an integrated device with a short&#xD;
      processing time (measured in 2 to 3 minutes) that distributes cells from limited volume&#xD;
      samples (measured in microliters). The process involves a novel aerosolization technique that&#xD;
      transfers liquid sample to a glass slide via a burst of air. After the sample is deposited on&#xD;
      the glass slide, the automated system uses an integrated heating strip to heat the specimen&#xD;
      slide. This process is similar to using a hair dryer to dry the specimen slide in the current&#xD;
      ROSE setting. After drying the slide, the system uses series of pumps to dispense microliters&#xD;
      of stain reagent onto the slide to stain the cells. Currently, the system is configured to&#xD;
      perform DiffQuik staining, which is commonly used in the ROSE process. In the future, the&#xD;
      staining capability will be broadened to include other staining processes such as Rapid PAP,&#xD;
      H&amp;E staining etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early prototype of this instrument has been successfully tested at Cleveland Clinic on&#xD;
      residual of EBUS samples, serous body fluids, and bench top FNAs with high diagnostic&#xD;
      concordance.&#xD;
