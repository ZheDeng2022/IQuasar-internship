      All the pregnant women and newborns of both or one of the couples who gave birth in Ditan&#xD;
      hospital were collected as the observation group, and the pregnant women and newborns of both&#xD;
      husband and wife who gave birth in our hospital without new crown vaccine during pregnancy&#xD;
      were collected as the control group. The incidence of adverse events during pregnancy of the&#xD;
      two groups and the incidence of intrauterine development and congenital malformations of the&#xD;
      two groups were observed to observe the physical and intellectual development of children in&#xD;
      the two groups at the age of 1 year, and to explore the safety of perinatal neocrown&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
