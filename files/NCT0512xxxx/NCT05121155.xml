      Background: Although placement of an intra-cerebral catheter remains the gold standard method&#xD;
      for measuring intracranial pressure (ICP), there are several limitations to the method.&#xD;
      Objectives: The main objective of this study was to compare the correlation and the agreement&#xD;
      of the wave morphology between the ICP (standard ICP monitoring) and a new nICP monitor in&#xD;
      patients admitted with stroke. Our secondary objective was to estimate the accuracy of four&#xD;
      non-invasive methods to assess intracranial hypertension. Methods: We prospectively collected&#xD;
      data of adults admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH),&#xD;
      intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) or ischemic stroke (IS) in whom invasive ICP monitoring&#xD;
      placed. Measures had been simultaneously collected from the following non-invasive indices:&#xD;
      optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD), pulsatility index (PI) using transcranial Doppler (TCD),&#xD;
      a 5-point visual scale designed for Computed Tomography (CT) and two parameters (time-to-peak&#xD;
      [TTP] and P2/P1 ratio) of a non-invasive ICP wave morphology monitor (Brain4care[B4c]).&#xD;
      Intracranial hypertension was defined as an invasively measured ICP &gt; 20 mmHg for at least&#xD;
      five minutes.&#xD;

        From a total of 30 patients with invasive ICP monitor evaluated in our hospital between&#xD;
        March 2019 and March 2020 (pre-Covid-19), 18 patients fulfilled inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
        criteria. A total of 60 monitorizations were performed. We included 14 patients with&#xD;
        subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), one with IS, and three with ICH. All SAH were aneurysmatic,&#xD;
        all ICH were hypertensives and the only IS was a cardioembolic malignant middle cerebral&#xD;
        artery stroke. There were no side effects from the use of the noninvasive method.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Adult inpatients from a dedicated neurological intensive care unit with ischemic (IS) or&#xD;
        hemorrhagic stroke who needed invasive ICP monitoring were prospectively evaluated from&#xD;
        March 2019 to March 2020 (before the COVID-19 pandemic).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  We excluded patients with chronic neurological diseases (demyelinating diseases,&#xD;
             chronic hydrocephalus, pseudotumor brain), suspected brain death, and patients&#xD;
