      This is a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in which 150 pharmacy staff members will be&#xD;
      randomized to an experimental or control group and data on suicide prevention communication&#xD;
      and secondary outcomes will be collected over the course of the RCT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective pilot RCT that will evaluate the impact of suicide prevention&#xD;
      gatekeeper training (Pharm-SAVES) on 150 pharmacy staff member communication behaviors&#xD;
      (primary outcome). Data will be collected at baseline, immediately after training is&#xD;
      completed, and at 3-month follow up. Data sources include simulated patient observations (to&#xD;
      rate quality of communication) and survey data (for self-reports of knowledge, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and referral behaviors).&#xD;

    <description>An online survey will include a written case that asks participants what they would say to a patient who has expressed verbal suicide warning sign(s). Blinded coders will review the open-ended response to determine whether the participant asks about suicide. The responses will be coded as no=0 and yes=1.</description>

    <description>An online survey will include a written case with an open-ended question that asks if, and where, participants would refer a patient who has expressed verbal suicide warning sign(s). Blinded coders will review the open-ended response to determine whether the participant reported they would call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. The responses will be coded as no=0 and yes=1.</description>

    <measure>Change in suicide prevention knowledge score from baseline to immediate post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>An online survey including 5 multiple choice and 5 true-false questions will assess participants suicide prevention knowledge based on the content of Pharm-SAVES.A summary score that assesses the total number of correct answers (range: 0-10) will be created, with higher scores reflecting higher knowledge.</description>

    <measure>Change in mean suicide prevention self-efficacy score from baseline to immediate post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>A 6-item scale will be used to assess gatekeeper efficacy, or how confident trainees are that they can perform various suicide prevention tasks, including identifying signs of suicide and making a referral. Response options range from 1=not at all confident to 5=extremely confident. Item responses for each individual will be averaged to create a mean score, with higher scores indicating higher gatekeeper efficacy. Scores will range from 1 to 5.</description>

    <measure>Change in mean suicide prevention preparedness score from baseline to immediate post-intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and immediately post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Six items from a validated scale will be used to assess gatekeeper preparedness, or how well-prepared trainees feel they are to perform gatekeeper activities, including to &quot;ask appropriate questions about suicide.&quot; Response options range from 1=not prepared to 7=quite well-prepared. Item responses for each individual will be averaged, and higher scores will indicate higher levels of gatekeeper preparedness. Scores will range from 1 to 7.</description>

    <measure>Proportion of participants who ask about suicide</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 3-month follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>At 3-month follow-up, participants will complete a video-recorded standardized patient assessment via Zoom. One live standardized patient will enact a scenario in which they express verbal suicide warnings signs. After completion of the live standardized patient (SP) assessment, the participant will watch a pre-recorded video of a second standardized patient who also expressed suicide warning signs. The live standardized patient will then ask the participant how they would respond to the person depicted in the pre-recorded video. Using an observation guide, two masked coders will independently view the videos from each SP scenario and document whether the participant asked a direct question about suicide (yes/no). Examples of direct questions are provided in the observation guide. Scores for asking will range from 0 to 2.</description>
