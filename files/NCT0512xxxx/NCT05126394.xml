      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of ultra-sound guided serratus anterior plane&#xD;
      block versus conventional IV analgesics in postoperative pain management in modified radical&#xD;
      mastectomy (MRM)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing modified radical mastectomy were assigned to one of the following two&#xD;
      groups:Group A: Serratus anterior plane block group (SAPB group): this group consists of 20&#xD;
      patients who received ultra sound guided serratus anterior plane block just after induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia and Group B: IV analgesics group (control group): this group consists of 20&#xD;
      patients who did not receive any type of block.Further evaluations were carried out by a&#xD;
      different investigator who was unaware of the patients' grouping. The degree of&#xD;
      post-operative pain was assessed at: just upon arrival to the PACU, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours&#xD;
      using the VAS score and the haemodynamic data and respiratory rate were measured during the&#xD;
      first 24 hours after the end of the surgery. Postoperative analgesia regimen was standard in&#xD;
      both groups; patients from each groups received 1 gm of Paracetamol Q 8 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients reporting VAS ( visual analogue score) score greater than 40, mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate or respiratory rate &gt;20% from the baseline, were given Pethidine (50 mg&#xD;
      IV) as rescue analgesic. While, those reporting VAS score less than 40 with mean arterial&#xD;
      blood pressure, heart rate or respiratory rate &gt;20% from the baseline but still complaining;&#xD;
      Ketoralac (30 mg IV) was given with a maximum dose of 120 mg/ day.&#xD;
