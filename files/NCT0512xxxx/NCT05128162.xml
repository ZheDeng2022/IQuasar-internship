  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The pressing need for effective fibromyalgia (FM) treatments, the known safety of psilocybin&#xD;
      therapy, and the mechanistic plausibility for potential benefit provide a backdrop for&#xD;
      investigating TRP-8802 therapy as a treatment for FM. The primary objective of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical benefit of oral TRP-8802 in concert with psychotherapy to treat&#xD;
      chronic pain symptoms in patients with FM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia is a chronic syndrome of widespread musculoskeletal pain that often manifests&#xD;
      with a cluster of co-occurring symptoms, including sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction, and mood problems including anxiety and depression. Recent studies have provided&#xD;
      evidence of altered central pain pathways. Current management of FM typically takes a&#xD;
      multidimensional approach including behavioral therapy, exercise, and medication. However,&#xD;
      current medications provide only modest benefit and carry significant side effect burden,&#xD;
      leading many people with FM to seek other alternatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psilocybin therapy (psilocybin delivered in concert with psychotherapy) may be a potentially&#xD;
      safe and effective treatment for symptoms associated with FM. Indeed, psilocybin therapy has&#xD;
      shown positive effects in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress, depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, treatment-resistant depression, and nicotine or alcohol addiction. The United States&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted a Breakthrough Therapy designation for&#xD;
      psilocybin in treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder. Psilocybin&#xD;
      therapy is generally safe and well-tolerated when conducted under controlled conditions.&#xD;
      While no clinical studies have explored psychedelic effects among people with FM, a recent&#xD;
      review outlined potential mechanisms through which psychedelics could alleviate chronic pain&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
