      The aim of the study is to study the application of Lactobacillus rhamnosus X253 as oral&#xD;
      probiotics by the way of a randomised, double blinded, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical&#xD;
      trial, and to eto detect the changes in oral flora of volunteers, and judge the improvement&#xD;
      effect of X253 lozenges on the human oral flora.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      population experiments were carried out, and Quantitative Real-time PCR was used to detect&#xD;
      the expression level of the target strains in volunteers' oral, High-throughput sequencing&#xD;
      technology to detect the changes in oral flora of volunteers, and judge the improvement&#xD;
      effect of X253 lozenges on the human oral flora. The effects of X253 lozenges on the&#xD;
      volunteers' oral odor, defecation frequency and gum bleeding was surveyed and conuted by&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A total of 60 volunteers were recruited and randomly divided into three groups with 20 people in each group. Among them, 17 volunteers terminated the experiment due to taking antibiotics and hormone drugs during the experiment. The remaining 43 volunteers belonged to three different groups: Control group (n=16), Viable group (n=13), Inactivated group (n=14).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In a sterile operating table, place the collected dental floss in a 180μL lysozyme (20mg/mL) water bath, use a DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) to extract the DNA in the oral sample, and store the DNA sample at -20°C. Quantitative Real-time PCR (Tiangen Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) was performed for the Porphyromonas gingivalis(P.g), Streptococcus mutans(S.m), Streptococcus gordonii(S.g), and Bifidobacterium(Bif) contained in the DNA of the tartar sample. The experiment results at 0 weeks were used as the control, and the relative quantitative method which is named 2-∆∆ct method was used to calculate the gene expression level of the target bacteria in the 2th week.</description>

    <description>Every two weeks, all volunteers were given the number of probiotic lozenges to be used within two weeks. Edible method: 3 times a day, 1 tablet every time (0.8g/tablet). Put the tablet in the mouth and keep it in the mouth for at least 2-3 minutes before swallowing. Take it once every 30 minutes after breakfast, lunch and dinner. Do not brush your teeth, eat foods, or rinse your mouth within half an hour of consumption. Maintain oral hygiene according to the original habits during consumption, and do not use fluoride toothpaste during consumption.</description>
