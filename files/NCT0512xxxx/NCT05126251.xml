      Prediabetes is an intermediate transition to hyperglycemia between normal blood glucose and&#xD;
      diabetes, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)and the&#xD;
      presence of a combination of the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the prediabetes population in China is very large. Timely detection of this&#xD;
      sub-health population and effective intervention are the key to prevent or delay diabetes and&#xD;
      related complications. Basic research showed that Tangningtongluo had a good hypoglycemic&#xD;
      effect on db/db diabetic mice and STZ induced diabetic rats, and could alleviate pancreatic&#xD;
      islet destruction and insulin resistance to some extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the therapeutic effects of Tangningtongluo pian provided by Guizhou bailing&#xD;
      Enterprise Group Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd on patients with prediabetes was evaluated&#xD;
      clinically. A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was&#xD;
      designed to provide evidence-based medical evidence for Tangningtongluo pian in the treatment&#xD;
      of prediabetes . In the design of this trial, the therapeutic effects and safety of&#xD;
      Tangningtongluo pian in the treatment of prediabetes were evaluated with Tangningtongluo pian&#xD;

      Prediabetes is an intermediate transition to hyperglycemia between normal blood glucose and&#xD;
      diabetes, including impaired fasting glucose (IFG), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)and the&#xD;
      presence of a combination of the two.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the prediabetes population in China is very large. Timely detection of this&#xD;
      sub-health state and effective intervention are the key to prevent or delay diabetes and&#xD;
      related complications. Prediabetes is mainly IGT, and its core pathophysiological basis is&#xD;
      insulin resistance. The existing western medicine can improve insulin resistance to varying&#xD;
      degrees, but it can not prevent diabetes. Tangning Tongluo is an in-hospital preparation of&#xD;
      Guizhou bailing. It is used for diabetes caused by deficiency of Qi and Yin. The symptoms&#xD;
      include thirst, drinking, overeating, polyuria, weight loss, shortness of breath, fatigue,&#xD;
      hand, foot and heart heat and blurred vision; Type 2 diabetes and diabetic retinopathy see&#xD;
      the above syndrome.Basic research showed that Tang Ning Tong Luo had a good hypoglycemic&#xD;
      effect on db/db diabetic mice and STZ induced diabetic rats, and could alleviate pancreatic&#xD;
      islet destruction and insulin resistance to some extent. In addition, the drug has a certain&#xD;
      retarding effect on diabetic nephropathy animal models [renal function, renal pathology,&#xD;
      urinary protein (3+ to 2+)] and fundus lesions, and also improves liver function and&#xD;
      myocardial enzymes. Further mechanism studies show that Tangning Tongluo exerts its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory, hypoglycemic and obesity induced insulin resistance effects by up&#xD;
      regulating the expression of sequence binding protein (SBP) 2 in macrophages ; In addition,&#xD;
      mip1 was inhibited γ/ CCR1 axis improves in diabetic retinopathy.It is speculated that the&#xD;
      drug may be effective for prediabetes In this study, the therapeutic effects of&#xD;
      Tangningtongluo pian provided by Guizhou bailing Enterprise Group Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd on&#xD;
      patients with prediabetes was evaluated clinically. A multi-center, randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was designed to provide evidence-based medical evidence for&#xD;
      Tangningtongluo pian in the treatment of prediabetes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the design of this trial, the therapeutic effects and safety of Tangningtongluo pian in&#xD;
      the treatment of prediabetes were evaluated with Tangningtongluo pian in the treatment group&#xD;
      and placebo in the control group.&#xD;
