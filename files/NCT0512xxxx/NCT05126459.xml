  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the post sedation events from three different multi-drug oral&#xD;
      sedation regimens in order to help pediatric dentists determine the best course of action for&#xD;
      their patients and prepare parents appropriately and caution them about the expected effects.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated for adverse effects within two time periods at 8 and 24 hours post&#xD;
      oral sedation procedure using surveys.&#xD;

    <description>Compare the incidence of adverse sedation related events (categories: amount and frequency of sleeping, level of activity, gastrointestinal discomfort, central nervous system, respiratory depression, paradoxical reactions) between three different multi-agent oral sedation regimens in LLUSD pediatric dental patients who were scheduled for oral sedation.&#xD;
Data will be collected in the form of 3 survey sets: the surveys is survey set 1 are written surveys to be completed by the dentist (Survey 1), and survey sets 2&amp;3 are phone surveys to be conducted by the researcher with the parents 8 hours (Survey 2) and 24 hours (Survey 3) after discharge.</description>
