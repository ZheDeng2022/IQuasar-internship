      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the self-management of diabetes and&#xD;
      hypertension can be improved with the use of mobile monitoring devices and nursing support.&#xD;

      EXpanding Technology-Enabled, Nurse-Delivered Chronic Disease Care (EXTEND) seeks to address&#xD;
      evidence gaps that prevent practical use of mobile monitoring-enabled telehealth for&#xD;
      clinic-refractory chronic diseases, with an initial focus on patients who have poorly&#xD;
      controlled type 2 diabetes and hypertension despite receiving clinic-based care. Because our&#xD;
      population has already proven refractory to usual care, we will conduct an active comparator&#xD;
      randomized trial (N=220) of two 12-month interventions: 1) mobile monitoring as a self&#xD;
      management tool (EXTEND-Monitoring); and 2) a nurse-delivered intervention incorporating&#xD;
      mobile monitoring, self-management support, and medication management (EXTEND-Nursing). For&#xD;
      the medication management component, the nurse works with a Clinical Pharmacist to optimize&#xD;
      medications. Our primary effectiveness analyses of the 12-month EXTEND interventions will&#xD;
      occur at 12 months, and persistence of effect will be examined out to 24 months (Aim 1). We&#xD;
      will inform future scaling and dissemination in clinical practice by interviewing key&#xD;
      stakeholders (n=40) regarding implementation barriers/facilitators and comparing program&#xD;
      costs and reimbursement pathways (Aim 2). Finally, this proposal will also allow us to&#xD;
      examine a novel application for mobile monitoring technologies, as tools for predicting&#xD;
      patient safety events; we will examine combined mobile monitoring and electronic health&#xD;
      record data as a means to predict patient safety events in the EXTEND cohort over 24 months&#xD;
      (Aim 3).&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized to EXTEND-Monitoring receive mobile monitoring devices to facilitate chronic disease self-management, including a glucose meter and test strips, a BP cuff, a home scale, and an accelerometer. Mobile monitoring data are transferred Duke University Health System (DUHS). Participants can review data and trends within the device apps and modify self-management practices accordingly. The EXTEND-Monitoring group continues chronic disease care with their existing providers during the study, and are instructed at baseline to address management questions via their primary clinics' established avenues (as would be the case for any patient using mobile monitoring in clinical practice).</description>

    <description>For EXTEND-Nursing, participants receive mobile monitoring devices to facilitate chronic disease self-management as for EXTEND-Monitoring. Additionally, these data are transferred Duke University Health System (DUHS) for use as part of a nurse-delivered intervention combining mobile monitoring, self-management support, and medication management. Each intervention component is administered by clinical registered nurses (RNs) from Duke Primary Care (DPC) or Duke Endocrinology. For EXTEND-Nursing's medication management component, RNs work in conjunction with a PharmD study clinician affiliated with the participant's clinic. The PharmD determines whether medication changes are needed, and prescribes accordingly. The RNs deliver EXTEND-Nursing via scheduled telephone encounters throughout the 12-month intervention. The initial encounter frequency is every two weeks, but may be extended to every four weeks for patients achieving treatment goals.</description>

    <description>The EXTEND-Nursing approach builds patient self-management capacity by focusing on knowledge, self-efficacy, and goal setting (using an RN-delivered, module-based approach). All material is at an 8th grade reading level. Module topics include, but are not limited to, use of SMBG, BP monitoring, developing a diet plan, medication adherence, hypoglycemia and hypotension self-management, and self-managing insulin. In addition, this intervention component addresses diet and activity self-management during each encounter.</description>
