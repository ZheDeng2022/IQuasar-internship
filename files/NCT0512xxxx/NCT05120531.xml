  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Down syndrome (DS) often experience dangerously low heart rates on induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia for routine procedures and this occurs at 10 times the rate of non-DS patients.&#xD;
      Given that the cardiac output of children is heart rate dependent, bradycardia is especially&#xD;
      perilous in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Historically, individuals with DS were not expected to survive beyond childhood;&#xD;
      consequently, correction of congenital anomalies, e.g. cardiac defects, was not frequently&#xD;
      offered. Fortunately, today individuals with DS live into adulthood and surgical correction&#xD;
      of anomalies is universally offered. Thus, increasing numbers of children with DS are exposed&#xD;
      to anesthesia and at risk for this hemodynamic catastrophe. It is medically unacceptable and&#xD;
      an autonomic nervous system mechanism will be sought.&#xD;
