  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 30% of the patients receiving spinal anesthesia develop hypotension. Hypotension&#xD;
      developed during cesarean section (C/S) under spinal anesthesia may jeopardize uteroplacental&#xD;
      circulation leading to fetal compromise and even fetal death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of prophylactic ondansetron on blood pressure after spinal anesthesia has not been&#xD;
      compared in a clinical trial with that of a vasoconstrictor. We will compare ephedrine and&#xD;
      ondansetron for the prevention of maternal hypotension after spinal anesthesia for elective&#xD;
      cesarean delivery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Some vasopressive drugs including ephedrine and phenylephrine have been widely used to&#xD;
      prevent maternal hypotension. Although ephedrine has mixed a-adrenoceptor activity , it&#xD;
      maintains arterial pressure mainly by increases in cardiac output and heart rate as a result&#xD;
      of its predominant activity on Î²1-adrenoceptors. It has been demonstrated that ondansetron&#xD;
      preloading with crystalloid infusion reduces maternal hypotension in parturient women&#xD;
      undergoing cesarean delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron has been widely used in the clinic to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by&#xD;
      cancer chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. Ondansetron has been proven as a&#xD;
      well-tolerated drug, but the most common side effects of ondansetron include headache,&#xD;
      constipation, diarrhea, asthenia, and somnolence.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>According to patients' randomized groups, study medication was given over 1 min, 5 min before spinal anesthesia&#xD;
Patients were randomly assigned into 1 of 4 groups, using computer generated sequence and opaque envelopes, according to the prophylactic intravenous drug dose used:&#xD;
Group E: were administered intravenous ephedrine 10 mg diluted in 10 mL 0.9% saline over 1 minute;&#xD;
Group OL: were administered intravenous ondansetron 4 mg diluted in 10 mL 0.9% saline over 1 minute;&#xD;
Group OH: were administered intravenous ondansetron 8 mg diluted in 10 mL 0.9% saline over 1 minute;&#xD;
Group P: was a control group who received 0.9% saline 10 mL over 1 minute as a placebo.</intervention_model_description>
