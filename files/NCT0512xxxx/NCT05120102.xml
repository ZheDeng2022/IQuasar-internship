    <textblock>
      This is a single blind randomized controlled trial with split mouth design including 45&#xD;
      patients with extractions of maxillary 1st bicuspids. First leveling and alignment will take&#xD;
      place till 17 × 25 Stainless Steel wire pass passively through all the brackets. Canine&#xD;
      retraction will be done through elastomeric ligatures maintaining force of 150gm on both&#xD;
      sides. One of side of maxillary arch will be irradiated by diode laser&#xD;
      (aluminum-gallium-arsenide) of 980nm on cervical, middle, and apical third on buccal and&#xD;
      palatal surface of cuspid and the other side will act as placebo. Laser irradiation will be&#xD;
      done at baseline and then for 3 more consecutive visits. Measurements will be recorded from&#xD;
      maxillary canine hook to maxillary 1st molar hook at 3 weeks interval till complete canine&#xD;
      retraction will be achieved. Patients will be given a questionnaires supported numeric scale&#xD;
      to record their pain score for a week.&#xD;

      First ethical approval for the study is going to be taken from the scientific committee and&#xD;
      then Institutional Review Board of Dow University of Health Sciences. After getting informed&#xD;
      consent from the chosen study participants, banding and bonding of the maxillary arch are&#xD;
      going to be done through conventional fixed appliance Edgewise brackets. Initial leveling and&#xD;
      alignment are going to be achieved by using nickel titanium and round stainless-steel wires&#xD;
      until 0.017x0.025-inch stainless-steel wire passes passively through all fixed appliance.&#xD;
      Anchorage is going to be implemented by skeletal anchorage through mini implants and molar&#xD;
      stops on 0.017×0.025-inch stainless-steel wire just mesial to upper 1st molar band slot. As&#xD;
      this study features a split mouth design so, every study subject will receive&#xD;
      Gallium-Aluminum-Arsenic diode laser with a wavelength of 980nm ± 10nm on one maxillary&#xD;
      canine and a placebo effect on the other maxillary canine. The side receiving laser&#xD;
      irradiation is going to be alternated with every consecutive patient. To prevent from&#xD;
      chauffeuring effect, a plastic shield will be used. The patient will be given questionnaire&#xD;
      based scale to record pain score for a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distalization of the canines is going to be accomplished by elastomeric chain (Medium span,&#xD;
      Ortho Organizer) which can begin instantly after extraction of first premolars. There is no&#xD;
      distinction between retraction rate of canines using either elastomeric chain or Nickel&#xD;
      Titanium springs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study measurements will be taken using 0.01mm with digital Vernier caliper considering&#xD;
      hook of maxillary cuspid teeth and hook of maxillary 1st molar teeth as reference points.&#xD;
      Measurements will be recorded thrice in a single visit and mean is taken to avoid bias.&#xD;
      Readings will be recorded after every three-weeks interval until one of the canines is&#xD;
      completely retracted. Arch length will be measured on the cast as inter molar width. Patients&#xD;
      will be given a questionnaire supported numeric scale to record their pain score for a week.&#xD;
