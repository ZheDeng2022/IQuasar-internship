  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is associated with metabolic symptoms such as&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia. Time-restricted eating may reduce serum insulin and improve insulin&#xD;
      resistance in patients with PCOS. Currently, there are few studies investigating&#xD;
      time-restricted eating in patients with PCOS. The investigators plan to test the feasibility&#xD;
      of time-restricted eating in the management of PCOS by means of a real-world clinical&#xD;
      intervention. The investigators will determine if an 18:6 eating protocol reduces insulin&#xD;
      levels by means of a randomised controlled crossover trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common reproductive endocrinopathy&#xD;
      in women of reproductive age with many associated metabolic symptoms, in particular&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance and a high lifetime risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
      The effects of time-restricted eating on metabolic profiles have been investigated in many&#xD;
      endocrinopathies, but there are minimal data in PCOS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will investigate the feasibility of time-restricted eating in the&#xD;
      management of PCOS, and its effects on insulin levels and other metabolic parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve this, the investigators will recruit 50 patients with PCOS (normal weight,&#xD;
      overweight, obese).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a randomised cross-over design, participants will be observed for two consecutive 12 week&#xD;
      periods (with a 4 weeks washout period in between) following either 'time-restricted eating'&#xD;
      or 'usual eating', detailed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 18:6 protocol: 18 hours of fasting and a 6-hours eating window, with no other specific&#xD;
           dietary advice. Participants choose their own 6-hour period according to their lifestyle&#xD;
           and preference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Usual eating: follow usual eating patterns, no time restriction, no other dietary advice&#xD;
&#xD;
      When fasting, participants are permitted to consume plain water, unflavoured/unsweetened&#xD;
      sparkling water, black breakfast tea and black coffee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intake will be determined at baseline, at midpoint of each study arm, and at the end&#xD;
      of the study using Nutritics software. Participants will self-record dietary intake using the&#xD;
      Nutritics 'app'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoints will be serum insulin and feasibility of the intervention as well as&#xD;
      safety, acceptability, and compliance with time-restricted eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be insulin resistance (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin&#xD;
      Resistance (HOMA-IR)), androgens (testosterone, free testosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone&#xD;
      sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)), appetite&#xD;
      (10-point visual analogue scale), satiety (glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), grehlin), fasting&#xD;
      glucose, HbA1c, anthropometrics (weight, body mass index, waist circumference), dietary&#xD;
      intake (calorie and macronutrient intake; micronutrient intake including iron, calcium;&#xD;
      dietary pattern including timing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Safety and acceptability will be measured by adverse event reporting and measurement&#xD;
      of adherence. Paired t-test will be used to assess between baseline and post intervention&#xD;
      measurements. Results considered statistically significant if p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: Time-restricted eating has potential to aid in improvement of insulin resistance&#xD;
      in patients with PCOS based on studies in other populations. There is no substantial&#xD;
      literature on this subject to date in the PCOS patient cohort, with this being the first&#xD;
      randomised study to date. The investigators will discuss the effects of time-restricted&#xD;
      eating on insulin levels in the specific population of women with PCOS based on the results.&#xD;
