  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, single-blinded, three-center, randomized, controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing the effectiveness and safety of angioplasty guidewire-assisted transseptal puncture&#xD;
      (GW-TSP) technique to transseptal left atrial (LA) access with conventional transseptal&#xD;
      puncture with standard transseptal equipment (CON-TSP) in patients undergoing left atrial&#xD;
      appendage occlusion (LAAO) procedure for atrial fibrillation. The targeted population will&#xD;
      consist of patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing LAAO.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transseptal catheterization is a critical step for left atrial interventions (atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation ablation, LA appendage closure, mitral valve interventions). The availability of&#xD;
      suitable tools and techniques is essential to safely perform the TSP, effectively deliver&#xD;
      radiofrequency lesions, deploy LA devices, and anticipate difficult procedural situations in&#xD;
      which complications may arise. Historically, a conventional Brockenbrough (BRK) needle has&#xD;
      been used for this procedure to mechanically puncture the fossa ovalis, which has been well&#xD;
      described in the literature. Although generally safe, serious complications such as&#xD;
      perforation of the atrial wall or aorta can occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to assess the safety, performance and usability of the angioplasty&#xD;
      guidewire in facilitating access to the left atrium during LAAO procedures for the treatment&#xD;
      of atrial fibrillation (AF). Moreover, the study will assess the impact of the GW-TSP on&#xD;
      procedural times, including time to achieve left atrial accesses, total procedure times,&#xD;
      total fluoroscopy time. The study is a prospective, single-blinded, three-center, randomized,&#xD;
      controlled trial. Enrolled subjects who meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      evaluated during the LAAO procedures and followed until release from hospital post procedure&#xD;
      per institutional standard of care. After 30 days, patient will be contacted by telephone to&#xD;
      obtain information on their clinical condition and any adverse events; if necessary, a clinic&#xD;
      visit may be performed when required by the physician.&#xD;
