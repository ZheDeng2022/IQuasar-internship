  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a controlled trial of metformin in children with fragile X syndrome(FXS). The&#xD;
      age of FXS children range from 2 to 16 years old. Participants will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blind design to either drug or placebo for 6-month period. The primary objectives are&#xD;
      to assess metformin in treatment of behavior problems, cognitive and language with fragile X&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center study at the Children's Hospital of Fudan University for FXS patients&#xD;
      aged 2 to 16 years inclusive. It is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of&#xD;
      metformin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies showed that there were pathogenically over activates of mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways in&#xD;
      FXS. Metformin, a guanidine derivative ,has been shown to reduce mTORC1 pathway activity in&#xD;
      an AMPK-dependent manner and has also been shown to reduce MAPK pathway activity. Metformin&#xD;
      treatments for FXS have been reported in animal experiments, some open label trials of&#xD;
      metformin in FXS patients had been reported. Therefore, metformin has potential to rescue&#xD;
      symptoms in children with FXS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, researchers hope to investigate the improvement effect of metformin on FXS&#xD;
      symptoms such as behavior problems, cognition, language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention period is 6 months, follow-up visit at 1 year. The researchers will also&#xD;
      assess the side effects of the study medication throughout the trial.&#xD;

ABC is a 58-item behavior scale ranked from 0(&quot;not a problem&quot;) to 3(&quot;severe problem&quot;) being the most severe for each item. 5 subscales include irritability, lethargy, stereotypy , hyperactivity and inappropriate speech. The same parent of patient will complete the checklist from baseline to 6th month. The global score changes of ABC will be measured as the primary outcome.</description>
