    <textblock>
      This study will include 5 cohorts of 14 flavivirus-naïve female subjects, 18 - 40 years of&#xD;
      age (total: up to 70 subjects). Within each cohort, 10 subjects will receive ZIKV and 4&#xD;
      subjects will receive a placebo on Study Day 0. Cohorts 1 and 2 (Dose = 10^2 PFU) will be&#xD;
      enrolled first. Cohorts 3 and 4 may be enrolled if dose escalation criteria are met (Section&#xD;
      3.1.2.3). Enrollment into Cohort 5 may occur if dose escalation criteria are met following&#xD;
      enrollment into Cohorts 3 and 4. Only one ZIKV strain will be evaluated in Cohort 5.&#xD;

      This study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind study in normal healthy adult female&#xD;
      subjects 18 - 40 years of age, inclusive, recruited from the metropolitan&#xD;
      Baltimore/Washington, DC and Burlington, VT areas. The purpose of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the clinical and virologic response to escalating doses of 2 different ZIKV strains&#xD;
      administered subcutaneously in healthy, flavivirus-naïve, non-pregnant, female adult&#xD;
      volunteers to identify the most suitable ZIKV strain and dose for use in a ZIKV CHIM. The&#xD;
      ZIKV CHIM will then be used to evaluate the protective efficacy of candidate ZIKV vaccines&#xD;
      prior to evaluation of these candidates in Phase 2 clinical trials. Both ZIKV strains will be&#xD;
      studied at doses of 10^2 PFU and 10^3 PFU. Only one of the ZIKV strains will be studied at a&#xD;
      dose of 10^4 PFU. The ZIKV strain to be studied at 10^4 PFU will be determined following&#xD;
      review of the data from the 10^2 and 10^3 PFU cohorts. Placebo recipients are included in the&#xD;
      study as a control to better assess ZIKV-associated versus non-ZIKV-associated AEs.&#xD;
