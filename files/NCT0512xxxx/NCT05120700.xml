      A phase I/II clinical trial (first in human) to assess the effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      treatment of cartilage injury with a tissue engineering construct composed of stromal&#xD;
      vascular fraction collected from the synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat of the injured&#xD;
      knee, submitted to enzymatic processing in a single surgical time, associated with a collagen&#xD;
      scaffold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be assessed by 3T magnetic resonance imaging, quality of life and&#xD;
      knee function questionnaires, in addition to perioperative and post-operative complications.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be evaluated by measuring the health resources used to ensure&#xD;
      compatibility, reproducibility and generalizability of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors believe that adverse events will be similar to current surgical procedures and&#xD;
      that there will be an improvement in knee function scores and quality of life of patients&#xD;

      Introduction: Cartilage injuries affect up to 63% of the population, and can cause pain and&#xD;
      important functional limitations. The evolution to osteoarthritis can lead to a worsening of&#xD;
      quality of life, in addition to being highly disabling. Osteoarthritis is considered a public&#xD;
      healthcare disease with a high economic and social burden without definitive treatment.&#xD;
      Despite the various techniques available today, complete regeneration of damaged hyaline&#xD;
      cartilage is not possible. For these reasons, cell therapy with mesenchymal cells has&#xD;
      received more attention in research due to the relative ease of processing. Synovia and&#xD;
      infra-patellar fat-pad are predictable and easily accessible sources during routine&#xD;
      arthroscopic procedure, in addition to exhibiting the greatest potential for chondrogenic&#xD;
      differentiation between mesenchymal cell donor sites. In a previous pre-clinical&#xD;
      translational study (FAPESP - State of São Paulo Government Research Sponsor Agency), The&#xD;
      authors' group developed the tissue bioengineering protocol in a large animal model according&#xD;
      to the good laboratory practices for in human usage techniques (GMP). After completing this&#xD;
      step, The authors now propose the phase I/II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The aim of the study is to evaluate effectiveness and safety for the treatment of&#xD;
      articular cartilage injuries, with a compound of stromal vascular fraction acquired from the&#xD;
      synovia and infrapatellar fat pad of the knee, associated with a collagen scaffold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A phase I/II clinical trial (first in human) to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      the treatment of cartilage injury with a tissue engineering construct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Patients diagnosed with a single, 3 to 6 cm2 full-thickness cartilage&#xD;
      lesion, symptomatic and without improvement with non-operative treatment. Age between 18 and&#xD;
      40 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: any previous surgery to treat the injury, presence of pathology in the&#xD;
      contralateral knee or other pathologies that interfere with recovery. Serological tests will&#xD;
      be performed for autologous donors, complete serology: HIV, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B,&#xD;
      human T-lymphotropic virus, syphilis and Chagas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our institutional ethics committees approved the protocol (local CEP: 4.285.308 and national&#xD;
      CAAE: 34798720.5.0000.0068).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioengineering construct will be composed of stromal vascular fraction collected from the&#xD;
      synovial membrane and infrapatellar fat of the injured knee, submitted to enzymatic&#xD;
      processing in a single surgical time, associated with a collagen scaffold (Chondro-Gide,&#xD;
      Geistlich, Switzerland). The synovial and adipose tissue are collected through the usual&#xD;
      route of the initial surgical incision for cartilage repair, and subsequently centrifuged for&#xD;
      3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The isolation of the vascular-stromal fraction will be carried out through enzymatic&#xD;
      digestion with collagenase IA. The cell suspension will be centrifuged and the cell button&#xD;
      will be suspended in 1 mL of 0.9% saline solution. In one gram of adipose tissue, it is found&#xD;
      an average of 2x106 cells, 10% being composed of stromal cells derived from adipocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of patients will be collected, as well as data on the frequency of&#xD;
      complications in the perioperative, immediate and late postoperative periods. The impact on&#xD;
      quality of life and knee function will be assessed by questionnaires. The length of hospital&#xD;
      stay, as well as surgical and outpatient care costs, will be documented. The tissue formed&#xD;
      after the intervention will be evaluated using the modified 3D MOCART score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be presented in the form of graphs and tables, as well as the&#xD;
      respective frequency distributions of possible complications in the perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative period, and the assessment of economic feasibility. Statistical analyzes will&#xD;
      be performed to compare the preoperative and postoperative periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the assumption of normal distribution, the Shapiro-Wilk test will be performed, and&#xD;
      for the analysis of homogeneity of variances, the Levene test will be performed. In all&#xD;
      inferential analyses, a type I error probability (α) of 0.05 will be considered. To evaluate&#xD;
      the quantitative variables, Student's t test (or Mann-Whitney test, if the variables do not&#xD;
      present normal distribution) or Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) will be used. To&#xD;
      verify the association between categorical variables, the chi-square association test will be&#xD;
      used. For all analyses, the SIGMAPlot 12.5 software (Systat Software, Inc.) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors will also perform the assessment by laboratory characterization of the vascular&#xD;
      stromal fraction of mesenchymal stromal cells with two methodologies: flow cytometry&#xD;
      immunophenotyping analysis and cell differentiation analysis for osteogenic lineage,&#xD;
      previously validated by the research group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcomes will be assessed preoperatively, at 6 and 12 months postoperatively by&#xD;
      3T magnetic resonance imaging (quantity and quality of repair), quality of life and knee&#xD;
      function questionnaires, in addition to perioperative and post-operative complications.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be evaluated by measuring the health resources used to ensure&#xD;
      compatibility, reproducibility and generalizability of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The authors believe that adverse events such as pain, bleeding and fever will be&#xD;
      similar to current surgical procedures. The authors believe that there will be an improvement&#xD;
      in knee function scores and quality of life of patients undergoing the procedure from the&#xD;
      non-invasive evaluation by magnetic resonance with good quality cartilage tissue.&#xD;
