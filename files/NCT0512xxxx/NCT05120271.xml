      This is a first-in-human (FIH), Phase 1, open-label, multicenter study to assess safety and&#xD;
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of BOXR1030 administration after&#xD;
      lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LD chemotherapy) in subjects with glypican-3 positive (GPC3+)&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Refer to the Study Schema for a diagram of the study flow. After&#xD;
      signing informed consent and completing all screening assessments, eligible subjects will&#xD;
      undergo leukapheresis to obtain T cells for BOXR1030 manufacturing. Subjects will receive a&#xD;
      7-day LD chemotherapy regimen with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, administered according&#xD;
      to institutional standard practice for these drugs at this dosage, including inpatient&#xD;
      administration as appropriate. Subjects must be hospitalized for BOXR1030 administration and&#xD;
      will remain hospitalized for 10 days after the infusion. If at least 2 cohorts complete the&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) assessment period with no DLTs and no severe/delayed events of&#xD;
      cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome&#xD;
      (ICANS), the Sponsor may allow subjects in subsequent cohorts to be discharged earlier, with&#xD;
      daily follow-up clinic visits. For 28 days after BOXR1030 administration, all subjects must&#xD;
      stay within a distance that requires no more than 2 hours of travel to the study site. During&#xD;
      the Post-treatment Evaluation Period (6 months after BOXR1030 administration), study visits&#xD;
      will occur daily for the first week, twice in the second week, and then at Weeks 3, 4, 6, and&#xD;
      Months 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Safety (targeted physical examination, adverse event assessment,&#xD;
      and clinical labs) will be evaluated and samples will be collected for endpoint analyses. For&#xD;
      28 days after BOXR1030 administration, subjects will be required to monitor their temperature&#xD;
      and complete neurological evaluation via the immune effector cell-associated encephalopathy&#xD;
      (ICE) assessment tool every day (to be administered by a caregiver at home on non-clinic&#xD;
      days). At regular intervals, antitumor activity will be assessed per RECIST Version 1.1 and&#xD;
      iRECIST criteria. After 6 months of follow-up from BOXR1030 administration, subjects will&#xD;
      enter the Long-term Follow-up Period for a total duration of 15 years after BOXR1030 dosing.&#xD;
      Study visits are scheduled every 3 months from Month 9 to Month 24, every 6 months thereafter&#xD;
      until Year 5, and then annually through Year 15. Long-term follow-up assessments will focus&#xD;
      on long-term safety and disease status.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Aged 18 to 80 years at time of enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Able to provide a recent tumor specimen taken since the time of the subject's most&#xD;
             recent systemic anticancer therapy, for GPC3 expression assessment by IHC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically confirmed advanced unresectable or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
             (HCC), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the lung, liposarcoma, or Merkel cell&#xD;
             carcinoma (MCC) with GPC3 overexpression by IHC. Subjects must consent to IHC testing&#xD;
             in a separate informed consent. Note: Tumor samples will be sent to a central&#xD;
             laboratory for GPC3 expression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Documentation of disease progression or refractory disease or intolerance to prior&#xD;
             lines of standard-of-care (SOC) therapies. Patients with tumors with genetic&#xD;
             alterations and mutations (eg, breast cancer gene [BRCA], epidermal growth factor&#xD;
             receptor [EGFR] mutations, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK] translocation) who&#xD;
             have approved targeted therapies available for their cancer will need to have been&#xD;
             treated with such approved therapies or refused such approved targeted therapy for&#xD;
             their cancer prior to enrolling in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Life expectancy &gt;16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have adequate organ/renal function&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) â‰¥50% by multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA)&#xD;
             scan or echocardiogram (ECHO)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Eastern Cooperative Group performance status of 0 to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. For subjects with HCC:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-Pugh Score of A&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No fibrolamellar carcinoma or mixed hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma histology&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No moderate or severe ascites&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A minimum of 2 sites of disease, including at least 1 site that is measurable by&#xD;
             RECIST Version 1.1 criteria to ensure sufficient disease for response assessment. At&#xD;
             least 1 of the other lesions must be considered adequate for protocol-required tumor&#xD;
             biopsy. Consider prioritization of percutaneous lesions that are palpable, or guided&#xD;
             by imaging if necessary, and exclude biopsies of any lesions that are in proximity to&#xD;
             vital visceral, cardio-pulmonary, or any neurovascular structures. A single site of&#xD;
             disease is considered adequate to allow for response assessment and protocol-required&#xD;
             tumor biopsies if it measures at least 2 cm in the shortest axis).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Adequate wash-out of prior systemic therapy for underlying malignancy, relative to&#xD;
             leukapheresis:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Last dose of any antineoplastic treatment must be at least 2 weeks before&#xD;
                  leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Last dose of any investigational agent must be at least 3 half-lives of the&#xD;
                  treatment, or 28 days, before leukapheresis (whichever is shorter). Adequate&#xD;
                  wash-out of prior systemic therapy for underlying malignancy, relative to LD&#xD;
                  chemotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The last dose of systemic nitrosourea or systemic mitomycin-C must be at least 6&#xD;
                  weeks before the first dose of LD chemotherapy in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For all other for systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy, the wash-out must be the&#xD;
                  duration of a full cycle of that therapy. For example, if the prior therapy is&#xD;
                  given in 3-week cycles, there must be at least 3 weeks between the last dose of&#xD;
                  that therapy and the first dose of LD chemotherapy in this study. If the prior&#xD;
                  therapy is administered more frequently than every 2 weeks, a minimum 2-week&#xD;
                  wash-out is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For biologic therapy (eg, antibodies) the wash-out must be either the duration of&#xD;
                  the biologic agent dosing interval, or 3 weeks, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For small molecule therapies, the wash-out must be 5 half-lives of the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For any investigational agent, the wash-out must be 3 half-lives of the&#xD;
                  investigational agent, or 4 weeks, whichever is shorter.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Local radiation of lesions is allowed if indicated for palliation; locally&#xD;
             treated lesions will be considered non-target lesions. Hormone ablation is also&#xD;
             allowed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects or their legally acceptable representative must be able and willing to:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Provide IRB/IEC-approved written informed consent in accordance with regulatory&#xD;
                  and institutional guidelines. This must be obtained before the performance of any&#xD;
                  protocol related procedures that are not part of normal patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Comply with the study protocol and with the planned biopsy procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Willing and able to commit to study assessments and visit schedule, including&#xD;
             availability of a caregiver to conduct daily neurological assessments for 28 days&#xD;
             after BOXR1030 administration.&#xD;

             pregnant), confirmation of a negative serum pregnancy test and agreement to use of&#xD;
             highly effective contraception per Clinical Trials Facilitation and Coordination Group&#xD;
             (CTFG) criteria from screening through the first 12 months after BOXR1030&#xD;
             administration. For men with partners of childbearing potential, agreement to use&#xD;
             effective barrier contraception from screening through the first 12 months after&#xD;
             BOXR1030 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             increase proarrhythmic risk (eg, hypokalemia, bradycardia, heart block) including any&#xD;
             new, unstable, or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring medication, or other baseline&#xD;
             arrhythmia that might interfere with interpretation of electrocardiograms (ECGs) on&#xD;
             study (eg, bundle branch block). Patients with QTcF &gt;450 msec for males and &gt;470 msec&#xD;
             for females on screening ECG are excluded. Any patients with a bundle branch block&#xD;
