  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many patients in general practice present symptoms that do not refer to specific pathology.&#xD;
      We refer to these patients at Medical Unexplained Physical Symptoms (MUPS). Practice and&#xD;
      research have well documented that these patients frustrate most General Practitioners (GPs).&#xD;
      They also produce a lot of unnecessary investigations and are overrepresented on&#xD;
      sick-listing. The conversational tool Individual Challenge Inventory Tool (ICIT) offers an&#xD;
      aid for the GPS to the consultation and aims to increase the patients' coping abilities with&#xD;
      their health challenges. The aim of the study is to investigate whether patients experience&#xD;
      such increased coping following a session of consultations with their GP based on ICIT.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial (cRCT) with GPs as clusters. We plan to&#xD;
      includ 50 GPs to participate as intervention group and 50 GPs as controls. Each cluster will&#xD;
      include 10 patients. GPs in the intervention group will be trained in the use of ICIT through&#xD;
      a 30 hours course, partly digital and partly in presence. The participants will receive&#xD;
      lectures on the background for the conversation tool, and the study, and will practice on&#xD;
      each other. At the end of the study, also the 50 GPs of the control group will be invited to&#xD;
      an identical course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome of the study is any changes of the patients coping abilities. If the symptoms&#xD;
      cannot be healed, a goal for the patients will be to reduce the impact of the symptoms. In&#xD;
      practice, this is to reuptake normal activities, including work, in spite of pain, fatigue or&#xD;
      mood disturbances. Through the ICIT, the patients will be challenged to look at themselves in&#xD;
      a broader spectrum and decide for themselves which activities are possible to reuptake and&#xD;
      making a thorough plan for doing so.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be treated by their regular GP across several meetings and they will agree&#xD;
      on a specific plan across weeks or months to achieve their individual goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients of the GPs in the control group will represent identical medical symptoms and&#xD;
      will be treated and followed by their GP as usual. They will, however, be informed and asked&#xD;
      to consign to participate in the study, and will respond to the same questionnaires as the&#xD;
      patients in the intervention group.&#xD;
