    <textblock>
      This study, which is part of the Zambia Alabama HIV Alcohol Comorbidities Program funded by&#xD;
      NIH-NIAAA, is designed to examine the efficacy of brief and in-depth cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy-based interventions to address, unhealthy alcohol use, comorbid mental health&#xD;
      symptoms, and HIV treatment outcomes among people living with HIV in Zambia. A 3-arm trial&#xD;
      will be conducted with participants randomized to a brief intervention alone, the brief&#xD;
      intervention plus referral to Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), or standard of care&#xD;
      (SOC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with HIV are a priority population for alcohol screening and treatment; however, they&#xD;
      may be more likely to underreport their alcohol use and may respond less well to alcohol&#xD;
      treatments due to untreated comorbidities. Psychological treatments for unhealthy alcohol use&#xD;
      should ideally include components to address common mental health and other substance use&#xD;
      comorbidities. However, few current treatments can treat both substance use and mental&#xD;
      illness with a single protocol. Further, whether integrated treatment of unhealthy alcohol&#xD;
      use and its comorbidities is more effective than alcohol-focused treatment alone needs to be&#xD;
      established. There are psychological alcohol treatments that are consider brief interventions&#xD;
      (BI), which are time limited and require fewer resources to implement. There are also more&#xD;
      complex interventions that require multiple sessions with a provider and are more time and&#xD;
      resource intensive; however, they may have more potential for short- and long-term&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will examine the efficacy of both a brief intervention (BI) alone and a more&#xD;
      comprehensive and involving the BI followed by Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA;&#xD;
      www.cetaglobal.org) among adults with unhealthy alcohol use and HIV in urban Zambia. CETA is&#xD;
      a transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy-based intervention that can flexibly treat a&#xD;
      range of conditions including substance use, depression, posttraumatic stress, and anxiety.&#xD;
      Further, CETA can be delivered by professional and lay providers. There is already evidence&#xD;
      that CETA can reduce alcohol use in the general population in Zambia. In pilot study, the BI&#xD;
      plus CETA reduced alcohol use and mental health symptoms more at 6 months than the BI alone.&#xD;
      Whether the BI is superior to standard of care (SOC), antiretroviral therapy adherence&#xD;
      counseling, is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will build on existing knowledge by looking at longer-term effects (12 months) of&#xD;
      the interventions, assess impact on HIV outcomes (adherence to antiretrovirals, retention in&#xD;
      HIV care, viral suppression), and to understand whether the BI is superior to current SOC. In&#xD;
      the study, we will also evaluate implementation factors related to delivery of the two&#xD;
      interventions within public sector HIV clinics. Understanding how to implement interventions&#xD;
      for unhealthy alcohol use and mental illness is a major priority in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will have several groups of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 Adults with HIV and unhealthy alcohol use- this group will be enrolled and randomly&#xD;
           assigned to one of three Arms (A, B or C) of the study. Arm A will receive alcohol brief&#xD;
           intervention (BI), Arm B alcohol brief intervention (BI) plus referral to Common&#xD;
           Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), or Arm C standard of care (SOC). The participants in&#xD;
           Arm A will receive the single session alcohol brief intervention (BI). Participants in&#xD;
           Arm B will also receive the BI and then be referred for CETA, which includes 6-12&#xD;
           sessions with a provider. The participants in Arm C will receive standard of care (SOC)&#xD;
           only. All participants will be re-assessed at 6 and 12 months post-enrollment. Patients&#xD;
           who participate will provide data on alcohol use, mental health and other substance use&#xD;
           comorbidities, and HIV outcomes. Data will be generated through surveys and in some&#xD;
           cases through laboratory tests (blood and urine). CETA will be provided by HIV peer&#xD;
           counselors, a cadre of lay health worker that supports HIV care delivery at facilities&#xD;
           in Zambia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 CETA counselors- this group will be enrolled and their competency to provide the&#xD;
           intervention will be assessed through role plays. Further, they will be included in&#xD;
           focus group discussions to understand experiences delivering CETA at HIV clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 Clinic staff- these individuals will be HIV care providers at the study clinics and&#xD;
           they will be invited to focus group discussions so we can understand their perspectives&#xD;
           on integration of interventions into their clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 Key informants- these are high-level policymakers and HIV and mental health/substance&#xD;
           use policy makers and experts in Zambia who can guide us on understanding how to scale&#xD;
           up study interventions should they be effective.&#xD;

    <measure>HIV Viral Load Suppression at 6 months</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>The study will focus on HIV viral load suppression with the definition being HIV RNA concentration below the sensitivity of the assay. In Zambia, it is possible that assays with slightly different HIV RNA sensitivity (for example 20, 40, and 60 copies per milliliter) may be used. Our definition for VLS will be having HIV RNA below the level of the least sensitive assay used during the study. We will estimate and compare risk differences with 95% CIs across the three study arms (i.e. 1=HIV VS and 0=no HIV VS). HIV viral suppression (VS) is the ultimate goal of ART and has individual and public health benefits.</description>

MPR will be calculated from ART dispensation data that are extracted at enrollment, 6, and 12 months.</description>

    <description>The alcohol brief intervention (BI) was based on CETA'S substance use module and was designed for one-on-one delivery. It is comprised of 6 elements (i.e. assessment, understanding impacts, exploring possibilities of change, goal setting, identifying reasons for alcohol use and skill building) including a 2-week alcohol timeline follow back assessment completed by provider. The alcohol brief intervention (BI) will be conducted by a trained counselor.</description>

    <description>CETA is a multisession cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based model. CETA consists of elements: engagement, safety assessment, psychoeducation, substance use reduction, behavioral activation, cognitive coping, relaxation, exposure and problem solving. During a weekly clinic meeting, newly enrolled participants who are assigned to get CETA will be assigned to a specific counselor. The counsellor, together with their supervisor, will design an individualized treatment plan including type and order of Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA) for each participant. The counsellor will contact participants by phone or home visit to schedule CETA session. CETA sessions will begin with standardized clinical monitoring form to track progress of treatment and each session will last 45-90 minutes.</description>

All participants will receive Standard of Care (SOC), but for participants in Arm C it will be the only alcohol treatment. The ART adherence counseling includes brief unstructured discussion of substance use and mental health issues with a focus on issues that reduce adherence and retention issues. ART adherence counseling is delivered in a one-on-one format between patient and counsellor and it usually lasts 5-10 minutes.</description>
