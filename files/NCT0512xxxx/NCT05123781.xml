      The primary objective was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of Metformin XR after&#xD;
      administration of a Test Product Metformin 1000 mg Prolonged Release Tablets (JSC Farmak,&#xD;
      Ukraine) and Reference Product Glucophage® XR 1000 mg Prolonged Release Tablets (Merck Serono&#xD;
      Ltd, UK), administered as a single dose in healthy subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adverse events, physical examinations and vital signs were reported for the evaluation of&#xD;

      An Open, Comparative, Randomized, Crossover Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Bioequivalence of&#xD;
      Single Doses of Test Product Metformin 1000 mg Prolonged Release Tablets (JSC Farmak,&#xD;
      Ukraine) and Reference Product Glucophage® XR 1000 mg Prolonged Release Tablets (Merck Serono&#xD;
      Ltd, UK) in Healthy, Adult Male and Female Subjects Under Fasting Conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Single oral dose of Test of Reference product of Metformin 1000 mg Prolonged Release Tablets&#xD;
      was administered to volunteers under fasting conditions in the morning of Day 1 of each Study&#xD;
      Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two study periods with a washout period of at least 7 days between&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each study period 21 blood samples were taken: prior to dosing (-1.0) and 1.0, 2.0,&#xD;
      3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 32.0 and&#xD;
