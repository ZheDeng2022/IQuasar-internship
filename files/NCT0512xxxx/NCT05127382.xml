  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study will evaluate the use of osimertinib as 1st line therapy for patients with&#xD;
      advanced EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer who are treated at Hellenic Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group (HeCOG)-affiliated departments of oncology.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an observational, multicentric, retrospective/ prospective analysis of patients&#xD;
      with advanced EGFR positive non-small cell lung cancer that receive osimertinib as 1st line&#xD;
      therapy. The patient data will be collected at Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
      (HeCOG)-affiliated departments of oncology during scheduled patient clinical visits, from&#xD;
      February 2020 for a total period of three years. The biological material obtained from the&#xD;
      patients of this analysis will be possibly used in a future translational study as an&#xD;
      exploratory analysis.&#xD;
