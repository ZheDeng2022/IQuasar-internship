  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective and prospective non-interventional multicenter observational study.&#xD;
      Neither diagnostic approaches nor experimental drugs/procedure will be applied and the&#xD;
      samples will take place at the same time as the samples will be taken during routinary&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyze the immunobiology of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      relapses after allogeneic HSCT for the generation of guidelines and personalized therapeutic&#xD;
      pathways.&#xD;

      Background: The identification of leukemic relapses characterized by the &quot;Human Leukocyte&#xD;
      Antigens loss&quot; event or by changes in the expression levels of genes involved in antigen&#xD;
      presentation and lymphocyte co-stimulation demonstrate how a complete characterization of&#xD;
      disease recurrence is necessary to ensure the patient a treatment that is as personalized and&#xD;
      targeted as possible, avoiding the choice of sub-optimal or, sometimes, harmful therapies.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the identification of the post-transplant relapse mechanism is now far from&#xD;
      being part of an established clinical routine, mainly due to the lack of quick and&#xD;
      easy-to-access diagnostic tools and multicentre studies demonstrating the efficacy of a type&#xD;
      of personalized therapeutic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to favor, exploiting the consolidated collaboration&#xD;
      between the Italian transplant centers belonging to the Italian Group of Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Transplantation, Hematopoietic Stem Cells and Cell Therapies (GITMO), the implementation in&#xD;
      clinical practice of an in-depth biological study of relapses of leukemia in order to allow&#xD;
      an increasingly targeted and effective planning of the therapeutic strategies to be&#xD;
      implemented, ensuring better patient survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  data collection, from clinical standard practice, of patients with relapse of the&#xD;
           disease which will allow to standardize the therapeutic management process and will&#xD;
           allow us to promote innovative clinical studies on acute myeloid leukemia post&#xD;
           allogeneic HSCT, with the ultimate aim of improving the survival of these patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biological substudy that will allow to define the role of the tumor microenvironment in&#xD;
           promoting or counteracting the phenomenon of relapse by identifying its specific&#xD;
           alterations in the various forms of disease relapse.&#xD;

        The cohort of this study will be composed of adult patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia,&#xD;
        who will relapse after allogeneic transplantation from either familial or unrelated donor,&#xD;
        regardless of the cellular source of the transplant (bone marrow, mobilized peripheral stem&#xD;
        cells or cord blood).&#xD;
&#xD;
        The samples of interest are those taken at the time of post-transplant recurrence at the&#xD;
        same time as routine investigations and may be of both medullary blood and peripheral&#xD;
        blood, as long as the samples have a percentage of pathological cells equal to at least 5%&#xD;
        of cellularity.&#xD;
