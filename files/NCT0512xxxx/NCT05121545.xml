  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, phase I study, evaluating the feasibility, toxicity, and degree of&#xD;
      tumor response after novel proton pencil beam scanning (PBS GRID) treatment in patients with&#xD;
      bulky tumors that are difficult to manage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proton group at Sibley Memorial Hospital has developed a new method for multi-beam proton&#xD;
      delivery making it possible to arrange and optimize GRID dosimetry and normal tissue sparing&#xD;
      compared to other similar techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase I pilot study, patients with bulky tumors will receive this novel method of&#xD;
      GRID-therapy also called spatially-fractionated radiotherapy which involves delivering high&#xD;
      dose radiation to small amounts of tumor in a manner that creates alternating regions of high&#xD;
      and low dose radiation within the tumor and is often aligned in a grid pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In so doing, this study will ascertain the feasibility, safety and tumor response i.e.&#xD;
      shrinkage and resectability of this treatment. Ultimately, the goal is to improve local&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with bulky tumors and to offer new treatment options for patients with&#xD;
      difficult-to-manage bulky tumors.&#xD;

    <description>Patients enrolled in this study will receive spatially-fractionated radiotherapy or GRID-therapy, which involves delivering a one-time treatment of high dose radiation to small amounts of tumor in a manner that creates alternating regions of high and low dose radiation within the tumor. Patients will receive 2 (lowest dose) to 18 Gy (highest dose) in a single fraction.</description>

    <description>Study participants will receive a single treatment of Pro-GRID therapy. After which, the participants would be able to resume standard therapy (after one week) and receive additional radiotherapy one month after Pro-GRID therapy, if recommended. Participants will be in the study for one year. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months posttreatment, and may include a history and physical exam, labs and/or a CT scan and toxicity assessments.</description>
