      English Synopsis&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Title of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A trial of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy to reduce stroke-in-evolution and improve&#xD;
      short-term functional outcomes for dehydrated patients with acute ischemic stroke-version 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We use blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/blood creatinine (Cr) ratio≧15 as a dehydration biomarker.&#xD;
      This clinical trial aims to determine if more aggressive intravenous fluid supplement instead&#xD;
      of present treatment would yield a better outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      a BUN/Cr ratio≧15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Phase of Development:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III, randomized double-blind control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We have recently reported a novel finding that the blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine (Cr)&#xD;
      ratio, a marker of hydration status, was an independent predictor of early neurological&#xD;
      deterioration among patients who had suffered acute ischemic stroke. Pilot study was then&#xD;
      designed to determine if providing hydration therapy, specifically intravenous saline&#xD;
      infusion, to patients with a blood urea nitrogen/creatinine ratio (BUN/Cr) ≥15 improves&#xD;
      outcomes after acute ischemic stroke. The results showed that patients with a presenting&#xD;
      BUN/Cr ≥ 15 who received saline hydration therapy experienced a better functional outcome&#xD;
      compared with similar patients who received standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To compare the effectiveness of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy with&#xD;
      standard treatment in early neurological improvement (ENI) rate at 72 hours for dehydrated&#xD;
      subjects with acute ischemic stroke Secondary objectives: To compare the benefit of&#xD;
      BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy with standard treatment after three months using measure of&#xD;
      modified Rankin scale (mRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Treatment: 12 hours Number of Planned Patients: 288 subjects Investigational&#xD;
      Product: normal saline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary endpoint: To compare the ENI rate between group at 72 hours. ENI is defined as&#xD;
           the improvement of the NIHSS score by 2 or more points or a score of 1 or 0 at 72 hours&#xD;
           after the onset of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary endpoints: To compare the rate of favorable functional outcome at 3 months.&#xD;
           Scores &lt;=1 on the mRS are considered to indicate a favorable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation&#xD;

      endpoint of ENI rate, the proportion of subjects with ENI response will be summarized by&#xD;
      treatment group. The proportions of ENI will be compared between BUN/Cr-based hydration&#xD;
      therapy (Arm A) and Standard therapy (Arm B) using two proportion Z test. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to evaluate the benefit of BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy after&#xD;
      three months using measure of modified Rankin scale. For the secondary endpoint comparisons&#xD;
      between groups, independent t-test will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the Study: 3 years (or From 01/09/2020 to 31/08/2023) End of Study : When total&#xD;
      288 participants are enrolled or meet the criteria of early termination.&#xD;

      Study Procedures： Our preliminary data presented the proportion of patients who experienced&#xD;
      ENI in hydration group is 71.3% (82/115) and 51.4% for control group (55/107) based on NIHSS&#xD;
      1 to 10 patients. Therefore, a double- blind randomized, parallel-group clinical trial will&#xD;
      be conducted to evaluate the efficacy by ENI rate increase of the protocol treatment&#xD;
      schedule. In this trial, the primary objective is efficacy using the binary endpoint of ENI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is performed using two sample proportion test to achieving an 90%&#xD;
      power at the 5% level of significance. By assuming that the ENI rate of the treatment arm and&#xD;
      the control arm is set 71.3% and 51.4%, respectively, the sample size with equal allocation&#xD;
      is 120 per arm. According to the missing rate 20%, the sample size in this study is 144 per&#xD;
      arm. Sample size calculation was performed using PASS software (Power Analysis and Sample&#xD;
      Size version 11.0.8, NCSS, Kaysville, Utah, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first 12 hours, patients of control group will receive intravenous normal saline 10cc&#xD;
      per kilogram of body weight as a constant infusion, and patients of study group will receive&#xD;
      intravenous normal saline 30cc per kilogram of body weight, one fifth of which will be given&#xD;
      as a bolus followed by delivery of the remaining four fifth as a constant infusion over a&#xD;
      period of 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase of this study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion such that the&#xD;
      subject, the treating physician, the sponsor and the site staff responsible for performing&#xD;
      assessments will not know the identity of the subjects' study treatment assignment. This will&#xD;
      allow the research team to compare the treatment's effectiveness against the control's&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods： A double-blind randomized, parallel-group clinical trial will be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the efficacy by ENI rate increase of the protocol treatment schedule.&#xD;
      In this trial, the primary objective is efficacy using the binary endpoint of ENI.&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics on continuous measurements will include means, medians, standard&#xD;
      deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized using frequency counts and&#xD;
      percentages. For the primary endpoint of ENI rate, the proportion of subjects with ENI&#xD;
      response will be summarized by treatment group. The proportions of ENI will be compared&#xD;
      between BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy (Arm A) and Standard therapy (Arm B) using two&#xD;
      proportion Z test. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the benefit of&#xD;
      BUN/Cr-based hydration therapy after three months using measure of modified Rankin scale. For&#xD;
      the secondary endpoint comparisons between groups, independent t-test will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of Missing Data：Participants with missing data are excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction and Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience acute ischemic stroke generally have a poor prognosis. Indeed, recent&#xD;
      data indicate that 1 of 18 deaths in US are caused by stroke. Early neurological&#xD;
      deterioration after stroke, often referred to as stroke-in-evolution (SIE), is particularly&#xD;
      common, and has reported to be associated with especially poor outcomes. There is evidence to&#xD;
      suggest that more than one-third of stroke patients with SIE will die, compatible with less&#xD;
      than 10% of patients who do not experience SIE. Therefore, preventing the occurrence of SIE&#xD;
      can have a significant impact on a patient's prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have tried to identify early predictors of SIE to facilitate prompt intervention&#xD;
      in at risk patients. A variety of different predictors have been described, including medical&#xD;
      history (8), hemodynamic factors and perfusion abnormalities, severity of stroke, and&#xD;
      biochemical / physiological parameters. There is little evidence, however, that these&#xD;
      predictors are clinically useful for dictating treatment strategies and improving patient&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the 2018 Guidelines for the Early Management of Patients With Acute Ischemic&#xD;
      Stroke(16), patients with acute ischemic stroke are predominantly either euvolemic or&#xD;
      hypovolemic. Hypovolemia may predispose to hypoperfusion and exacerbate the ischemic brain&#xD;
      injury. Hypervolemia may exacerbate ischemic brain edema. Thus, euvolemia is desirable.&#xD;
      However, the cause-and-effect relationship between hydration during acute ischemic stroke and&#xD;
      outcome remains unclear. For patients who are euvolemic at presentation, clinicians should&#xD;
      initiate maintenance intravenous fluids. Daily fluid maintenance for adults can be estimated&#xD;
      as 30 mL per kilogram of body weight. However, for patients who are hypovolemic at&#xD;
      presentation, the replaced volume and timing for dehydration condition is not concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dehydration, as indicated by an increased BUN/Cr ratio, is known to be relatively common&#xD;
      among patients who have experienced stroke. However, increased BUN/Cr ratio is not always&#xD;
      caused by dehydration. According to the result of our pilot study, about 80 percent of&#xD;
      patients with a increased BUN/Cr ratio respond to hydration treatment. According to this&#xD;
      finding, we suppose 80 percent of these patients with an increased BUN/Cr ratio are caused by&#xD;
      dehydration. And a hydration strategy with intravenous 20 cc per kilogram of body weight&#xD;
      normal saline in first 8 hours was safe, effective to prevent dehydration related early&#xD;
      neurological deterioration. It is reasonable to hydrate all these patients at the initial&#xD;
      encounter if no contraindication of fluid supplement is present since it is time consuming to&#xD;
      identify the cause of increased ratio and even lead to miss of timely treatment. A recent&#xD;
      clinical trial demonstrated a hydration strategy of intravenous normal saline 100 cc/hour in&#xD;
      patients with non-dehydrated acute ischemic stroke is also safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hydration therapy is needed in most of the patients with acute ischemic stroke. We try to&#xD;
      find out the useful maker of dehydration, that is Bun/Cr ratio, and provide a more aggressive&#xD;
      hydration treatment than present treatment to see if it make difference. This trial will be&#xD;
      conducted as a randomized double-blind control trial to test the hypothesis that whether&#xD;
      BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy has clinical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks / benefits Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risks include complications of fluid supplement, such as acute pulmonary edema, brain&#xD;
      edema. However, in our recently completed clinical trial with similar protocol, there were no&#xD;
      complications caused by fluid supplement. The benefit could be the improvement of outcomes&#xD;
      after ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regulatory:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol approved by the Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board, and according to Good Clinical Practice standards. No deviation from the&#xD;
      protocol will be implemented without the prior review and approval of the IRB except where it&#xD;
      may be necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to a research subject. In such case, the&#xD;
      deviation will be reported to the IRB as soon as possible&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A permuted-block design with blocks of 4 will be used for randomization. Randomization codes&#xD;
      will be generated using SAS Version 9.2. In the first 12 hours, patients of control group&#xD;
      will receive intravenous normal saline 10cc per kilogram of body weight as a constant&#xD;
      infusion, and patients of study group will receive intravenous normal saline 30cc per&#xD;
      kilogram of body weight, one fifth of which will be given as a bolus followed by delivery of&#xD;
      the remaining four fifth as a constant infusion over a period of 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment phase of this study will be conducted in a double-blind fashion such that the&#xD;
      subject, the treating physician, the sponsor and the site staff responsible for performing&#xD;
      assessments will not know the identity of the subjects' study treatment assignment. This will&#xD;
      allow the research team to compare the treatment's effectiveness against the control's&#xD;
      effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the intravenous infusion set of the study and control group will be covered and look&#xD;
      exactly alike. The intravenous fluid infusion rate will be controlled by infusion pump which&#xD;
      the screen will be covered. Only the study nurse for this trial will remain unblinded. The&#xD;
      study nurse will track the distribution of the study and control group medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, both group treatment will be blinded to the research subjects and all study&#xD;
      and sponsor personnel. The investigator or treating physician may unblind a subject's&#xD;
      treatment assignment only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study treatment&#xD;
      is essential for the appropriate clinical management or welfare of the subject. Whenever&#xD;
      possible, the investigator must first discuss options with the medical monitor or appropriate&#xD;
      supervisor in our clinical trial center before unblinding the subject's treatment assignment.&#xD;
      The date and reason for the unblinding must be recorded in the appropriate data collection&#xD;
      tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood pressure will be managed according to &quot;Guidelines for the Early Management of&#xD;
      Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke&quot;, published by the American Heart Association, 2018. The&#xD;
      medical monitor reviewed each patient's compliance with the protocol throughout the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be followed up for 3 months to determine the primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes. This clinical trial will be conducted at Linko and Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is performed using two sample proportion test to achieving an 90%&#xD;
      power at the 5% level of significance. By assuming that the ENI rate of the treatment arm and&#xD;
      the control arm is set 71.3% and 51.4%, respectively, the sample size with equal allocation&#xD;
      is 120 per arm. As the rate of screen failure and early withdrawal are estimated as 5% and 15&#xD;
      % respectively, the sample size in this study is 144 per arm. Sample size calculation was&#xD;
      performed using PASS software (Power Analysis and Sample Size version 11.0.8, NCSS,&#xD;
      Kaysville, Utah, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Withdrawal criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. adverse event due to fluid supplement&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. violation of study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. informed consent withdrew by participant&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. the diagnosis is not ischemic stroke&#xD;
&#xD;
           The participants who are withdrew due to adverse events will be followed up for 3&#xD;
           months. When the participants fit any one of the above criteria, they will be&#xD;
           withdrawing from the study right away. And the data will be recorded and reported to the&#xD;
           IRB. The data of participants who fit the 4th criteria will not be included for&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Treatment Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the first 12 hours, patients of control group will receive intravenous normal saline&#xD;
           10cc per kilogram of body weight as a constant infusion, and patients of study group&#xD;
           will receive intravenous normal saline 30cc per kilogram of body weight, one fifth of&#xD;
           which will be given as a bolus followed by delivery of the remaining four fifth as a&#xD;
           constant infusion over a period of 12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two outcome measures, including modified Rankin scale, and NIHSS are selected on the&#xD;
           basis of their reliability, familiarity to the neurologic community, adaptability for&#xD;
           use in patients who have had a stroke, and comparability to end points used in other&#xD;
           trials. The modified Rankin scale is a simplified overall assessment of function in&#xD;
           which a score of 0 indicates the absence of symptoms and a score of 5, severe&#xD;
           disability. The NIHSS, a serial measure of neurologic deficit, is a 42-point scale that&#xD;
           quantifies neurologic deficits in 11 categories. These two measures will be checked by a&#xD;
           physician who are blind to the subjects' study treatment assignment. In part 1, the&#xD;
           NIHSS will be checked and recorded at ED admission and 72 hours after admission. In part&#xD;
           2, the modified Rankin scale will be checked and recorded at 3 months after stroke&#xD;
           onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interim analyses were required after every 3 acute pulmonary edemas plus acute coronary&#xD;
           syndrome and after every 10 deaths. A lower boundary (z = -2.0) are set to allow the&#xD;
           trial to be stopped if BUN/Cr ratio-based hydration therapy are found to be harmful. For&#xD;
           deaths, a direct comparison of the survival curves is made with a log-rank test. For&#xD;
           acute pulmonary edema and acute coronary syndrome, the rate among patients treated with&#xD;
           BUN/Cr ratio-based hydration therapy will be compared with the rate of zero percent&#xD;
           estimated from pilot studies using similar doses and times of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Events that may not meet these criteria, but which the investigator finds very&#xD;
                unusual and/or potentially serious, will also be reported in the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Adverse event follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All AEs, including lab abnormalities that in the opinion of the investigator are&#xD;
           clinically significant, will be followed according to good medical practices and&#xD;
           documented as such. Site staff should send follow-up reports as requested when&#xD;
           additional information is available. Additional information should be entered on the IRB&#xD;
           of Chang Gung Medical Foundation of SAE form in the appropriate format. Follow-up&#xD;
           information should be sent to Chang Gung Medical Foundation IRB as soon as possible&#xD;
           according to IRB's Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures and Guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Criteria for the termination of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
           When the Interim analyses are performed for safety issue, a lower boundary (z = -2.0)&#xD;
           are set to allow the trial to be stopped if BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy are&#xD;
           found to be harmful. For efficacy assessment, interim analyses for the primary outcomes&#xD;
           will be performed once during part 1 at 15th months and once during part 2 at 18th&#xD;
           month, and only stop if both p&lt;0.01.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sample size Determination:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Because there is new data presented the proportion of patients who experienced ENI in&#xD;
           hydration group is 71.3% (82/115) and 51.4% for control group (55/107) based on NIHSS 1&#xD;
           to 10 patients. Sample size calculation is performed using two sample proportion test to&#xD;
           achieving an 90% power at the 5% level of significance. By assuming that the ENI rate of&#xD;
           the treatment arm and the control arm is set 71.3% and 51.4%, respectively, the sample&#xD;
           size with equal allocation is 120 per arm. According to the missing rate 20%, the sample&#xD;
           size in this study is 144 per arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Planned Statistical methods of analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive statistics will be provided for selected demographic and safety for each&#xD;
           treatment. Descriptive statistics on continuous measurements will include means,&#xD;
           medians, standard deviations, and ranges, while categorical data will be summarized&#xD;
           using frequency counts and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Information on study treatment will be summarized by duration using descriptive&#xD;
           statistics. All hypotheses tests and confidence intervals will be two-sided. All&#xD;
           efficacy measures will be presented and summarized in tables or graphs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Efficacy analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the primary endpoint of ENI rate, the proportion of subjects with ENI response will&#xD;
           be summarized by treatment group. Point estimates will be reported with exact 95%&#xD;
           confidence intervals. The proportions of ENI will be compared between BUN/Cr-based&#xD;
           hydration therapy (Arm A) and Stand therapy (Arm B) using two proportion Z test. For the&#xD;
           secondary endpoint for comparisons of modified Rankin scale between groups, independent&#xD;
           t-test will be considered. Evidence of significant interaction will be assessed at the&#xD;
           5% level. Investigation of interactions will be confined to the primary endpoint. The&#xD;
           model-adjusted absolute difference in proportions and associated 95% confidence interval&#xD;
           will be estimated. The estimate will be derived using SAS software [SAS Institute Inc,&#xD;
           1996].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Safety analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The number (%) of subjects with adverse events will be reported. Frequency counts and&#xD;
           percentages will also be presented of subjects with serious adverse events, adverse&#xD;
           events leading to withdrawal, adverse events by severity and adverse events by&#xD;
           relationship to study drug. Recognizing the potential for differential follow-up,&#xD;
           incidence rates (i.e., events / subject time at risk) for adverse events of interest&#xD;
           will be reported with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Safety population will consist of all subjects who received any study medication.&#xD;
           Subjects will be evaluated according to treatment(s) received. This population will be&#xD;
           used to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interim analyses were required after every 3 serious adverse events. A lower boundary (z&#xD;
           = -2.0) are set to allow the trial to be stopped if BUN/Cr ratio based hydration therapy&#xD;
           are found to be harmful. For deaths, a direct comparison of the survival curves is made&#xD;
           with a log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additional analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Summary statistics for change from baseline for vital signs evaluations will be&#xD;
           presented by treatment group. Adverse events, clinical laboratory evaluations, and all&#xD;
           other safety measures will be analysed for the Safety population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The level of significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A p-value less than 0.05 was considered significant and was denoted by * and p-value&#xD;
           less than 0.001 was denoted by **.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Analysis Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Per-Protocol population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Per-Protocol (PP) population will consist of all randomized subjects (i.e., all&#xD;
           subjects who received a treatment randomization) who did not violate any important&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria that pertain to the assessment of treatment efficacy;&#xD;
           and who incurred no major protocol deviations that pertain to the assessment of&#xD;
           treatment efficacy. Further details on what will constitute these important inclusion&#xD;
           and exclusion criteria violations and major protocol deviations will be specified in the&#xD;
           Reporting and Analysis Plan (RAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The PP population will be identified prior to unblinding of the study. The PP population&#xD;
           will be used to analyze the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint. However,&#xD;
           the PP population will not be analyzed if it comprises more than 95% or less than 50% of&#xD;
           the ITT population.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedure for accounting for missing, unused and spurious data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The incomplete clinical data and sequencing data with poor quality will be excluded in&#xD;
           the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Procedures for reporting any deviation(s) from the original statistical plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All deviations from the original statistical analysis plan will be provided in the final&#xD;
           clinical study report.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Direct access to source data/documents:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators permit IRB to access to the source data of experiment for trial-related&#xD;
           monitoring, audits and regulatory inspection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Ethical considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study will be conducted according to Taiwan and international standards of Good&#xD;
           Clinical Practice for all studies. Applicable government regulations and Chang Gung&#xD;
           Medical Foundation research policies and procedures will also be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;

           Institutional Review Board (IRB) for formal approval to conduct the study. The decision&#xD;
           of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the&#xD;
           investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and&#xD;
           providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their&#xD;
           participation in this study. This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for&#xD;
           review and approval by the IRB. The formal consent of a subject, using the IRB-approved&#xD;
           consent form, will be obtained before that subject is submitted to any study procedure.&#xD;
           This consent form must be signed by the subject or legally acceptable surrogate, and the&#xD;
           investigator-designated research professional obtaining the consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Data handling and keeping:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical samples will be collected in Chang Gung Medical Foundation. The sequencing data&#xD;
           will be stored in computers of laboratory with an electronic encryption. The clinical&#xD;
           and source data can only be assessed by clinical doctors and investigators of the study.&#xD;
