    <textblock>
      This trial studies how a customized 3D-printed oral stent compares to a standard stent made&#xD;
      by a dentist for use in imaging scans in patients with head and neck cancer receiving&#xD;
      radiation therapy. Oral stents are designed to help prevent radiation-related side effects&#xD;
      while receiving radiation therapy. Traditional oral stents are created by dentists, require&#xD;
      at least 2 separate appointments, and may not be as cost-effective. A customized, 3D-printed&#xD;
      oral stent may perform as well as a standard stent made by a dentist and have a significantly&#xD;
      shorter turnaround to device delivery.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate whether a customized 3 dimensional (3D) printed oral stent achieves&#xD;
      non-inferior levels of patient reported outcomes as the standard dental-fabricated oral&#xD;
      stents at the time prior to starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the performance of the 3D stent on imaging parameters (i.e. mandibular and&#xD;
      soft tissue displacement) for degree of normal tissue sparing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate the levels of patient reported outcomes after patients have developed side&#xD;
      effects from radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the commercially available TruGuard oral cavity positioning system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients wear a customized 3D printed oral stent over 5-10 minutes in the supine position at&#xD;
      the time of radiation simulation, before starting radiation therapy, and in the 3rd to 5th&#xD;
      week of radiation therapy. Patients may also optionally wear the commercially-made stent&#xD;
      called TruGuard at these timepoints.&#xD;
