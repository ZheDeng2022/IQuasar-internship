  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose escalation study of the safety and tolerability of oncolytic&#xD;
      virus injection(RT-01) when administered via Intravenous injection in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and tolerability of RT-01 and to determine&#xD;
      the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for further study. The study will also evaluate antitumor&#xD;
      activity, objective response rate, pharmacokinetics and virus shedding of RT-01.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigator initiated , open-label, study of RT-01 given via intratumoral (IT)&#xD;
      injection as a single agent and in combination with IV PD-1/PD-L1 in participants with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two parts：In the single agent dose escalation part (Part A), four doses&#xD;
      (1×10^7 TCID50, 1×10^8 TCID50, 3×10^8 TCID50, 1×10^9 TCID50) of RT-01 will be delivered&#xD;
      Intravenous as single agent to observe the DLTs and to identify the MTD. Part A is a single&#xD;
      agent dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to evaluate escalating doses of RT-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the IV RT-01 MTD is established, the Part B part of the study will begin. Part B is IV&#xD;
      RT-01 in combination with IV PD-1/PD-L1 dose escalation which will use a 3+3 design to&#xD;
      evaluate escalating doses of IV RT in combination with IV pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total enrollment will depend on the toxicities and/or activity observed, with approximately&#xD;
      16-36 evaluable participants enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study objective is to determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) of Intravenous administration of RT-01 as a single agent and in combination with&#xD;
      immune checkpoint inhibitors. Secondary objectives will assess efficacy overall response&#xD;
      rate, as well as disease control rate, progression free survival, duration of response, and&#xD;
      anti-tumor immune responses.&#xD;

    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an investigational product (IP), and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of IP whether or not considered related to the IP</description>

    <description>Changes in tumor size and occurrence of metastases was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Complete Response is disappearance of all target lesions. Partial Response is at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. Progressive Disease is at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). And Stable Disease is neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters while on study.</description>
