  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background and objective(s): Periodontitis is initiated by a dysbiotic host-microbe&#xD;
      relationship. Standard periodontal treatment involves oral hygiene education, mechanical&#xD;
      debridement and periodic follow-ups with the aims of pocket closure and maintaining a&#xD;
      symbiotic microbial community. Nonetheless, this therapy alone may fail due to the&#xD;
      limitations of mechanical instrumentation. The use of antimicrobial in combination to&#xD;
      subgingival debridement has been proposed for initial and recurrent periodontitis to enhance&#xD;
      the effectiveness of mechanical instrumentation. Antimicrobial peptide (AMP) comprised of a&#xD;
      wide range of peptide, was found naturally in various life forms or manufactured as a&#xD;
      synthetic compound. This study was conducted to evaluate the use of AMP as an adjunct to&#xD;
      non-surgical periodontal treatment in terms of clinical and microbiological outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      • There are changes in clinical periodontal parameters and subgingival microbial profile&#xD;
      following treatment with locally delivered synthetic AMP.&#xD;

      study design: This was a split-mouth randomised pilot study of a 3-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation: The sample size was calculated using G*Power software version&#xD;
      3.1.9.4 (Franz Faul, Universitat Kiel, Germany). Estimation of sample size was based on the&#xD;
      mean and standard deviation of CAL between the test and control group of previous publication&#xD;
      (Singh et al., 2018). Four samples in each group (test and control) were required to achieve&#xD;
      80% power at a significant level of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation: The random allocation sequence was generated by another person who was not&#xD;
      directly involved in the study using a Research Randomizer tools&#xD;
      (https://www.randomizer.org/). Periodontal sites of each patient were randomised at a split&#xD;
      mouth level (left or right halves of the dentition) to one of the two treatment groups.&#xD;
      Allocated treatments were inserted into an opaque envelop. Treatment allocation was concealed&#xD;
      from the clinician and only revealed once subgingival debridement was completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      intervention: At baseline, clinical measurement was recorded and target sites (sites with PPD&#xD;
      ≥6mm) were identified. subgingival plaque were collected at target sites. The same clinician&#xD;
      performed full mouth scaling and subgingival debridement, coupled with standardised oral&#xD;
      hygiene instruction for all subjects. Upon the completion of treatment, second clinician&#xD;
      applied the treatments according to the randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test group: Subgingival instrumentation followed by Antimcrobial peptide gel (AMP)&#xD;
           application in all target sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group: Subgingival instrumentation and normal saline irrigation in all target&#xD;
           sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test and control intervention will be repeated for another 2 applications at an interval of 3&#xD;
      days. Subjects were re-examined and plaque sampling will be repeated at 6 weeks and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      statistical analysis: Clinical parameters were reported as mean and standard deviation.&#xD;
      P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. intergroup and intragroup comparison&#xD;
      of mean bleeding score, pocket depth, clinical attachment level will be conducted using SPSS&#xD;
      software. For the metagenomic data, alpha and beta diversity were computed using QIIME 2. The&#xD;
      difference in the relative abundance of individual genus over time will be analysed.&#xD;
