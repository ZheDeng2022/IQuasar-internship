  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of personalized move goals in the&#xD;
      Welltory mobile app on daily step count among adults from 30 to 65 years old. The study also&#xD;
      aims to assess how personalized move goals impact workout quality and frequency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Welltory app sends users messages with move goals to help people move smarter. Adapted&#xD;
      daily based on each user's historical data and overall wellbeing, Welltory's move goals&#xD;
      gradually increase physical activity levels, motivating sedentary people to move more without&#xD;
      demanding drastic lifestyle changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study will assess if messages with personalized move goals in the&#xD;
      Welltory mobile app help increase physical activity among adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants include individuals aged 30-65 who use iPhones, wear an Apple Watch, and lead&#xD;
      sedentary lifestyles (their median daily step count does not exceed 6,000). Participants are&#xD;
      selected among active Wellotry mobile app users who had previously not received any messages&#xD;
      with move goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants are randomly assigned to 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in group 1 receive daily messages with personalized move goals in the&#xD;
           Welltory mobile app. Personalized move goals are computed based on each participant's&#xD;
           historical physical activity data and their daily wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in group 2 receive daily messages with a static move goal of 10,000 steps&#xD;
           per day in the Welltory mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in group 3 use the Welltory mobile app but don't receive any messages with&#xD;
           move goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all participants, steps and workouts are automatically registered by their Apple Watch&#xD;
      wearable devices and the Welltory mobile app. Additionally, participants regularly measure&#xD;
      their body weight and manually record it in the Welltory mobile app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's duration spans a total of 24 weeks for each participant.&#xD;
