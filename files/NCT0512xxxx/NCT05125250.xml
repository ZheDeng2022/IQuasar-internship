  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The feelings of imbalance, unsteadiness, and disorientation with cervicogenic dizziness is&#xD;
      not clear. It has been suggested that a disruption of the normal afferent signals from the&#xD;
      upper cervical proprioceptors to the vestibular nucleus results in an inaccurate depiction of&#xD;
      head and neck orientation in space due to highly developed proprioceptive system that allows&#xD;
      the neuromuscular control of cervical spine and effective use of vital organs in the head&#xD;
      through unique connections to the vestibular and visual systems. Motor Control Therapeutic&#xD;
      Exercises and vestibular exercises have been used to increase motor control and reduce pain&#xD;
      and disability in patients with neck pain.&#xD;

      Cervicogenic dizziness is defined as a sensation of instability or disequilibrium that occurs&#xD;
      with the pain and stiffness in cervical spine and is aggravated by neck movements or&#xD;
      positions. Dizziness is a common indication in people with cervical spine dysfunction.&#xD;
      cervicogenic dizziness as &quot;a nonspecific sensation of altered orientation in space and&#xD;
      disequilibrium originating from abnormal afferent activity from the neck&quot; which is thought to&#xD;
      be caused by disorders in the upper cervical spine and commonly it is associated with&#xD;
      cervical stiffness neck pain or headache.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor control can also be defined as the capacity of how the central nervous system produces&#xD;
      of useful movements that are coordinated and integrated with the rest of the body and the&#xD;
      environment. Thus, motor control therapeutic exercises (MCTE) are used to improve the&#xD;
      conditions of patients. Motor Control Therapeutic Exercises have been used to increase motor&#xD;
      control and reduce pain and disability in patients with neck pain. MCTE comprised of&#xD;
      cranio-cervical flexor exercise, cranio-cervical extensor exercise, co-contraction of flexors&#xD;
      and extensors, a synergy exercise for retraining the strength of the deep neck flexors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schenk et al. have published case studies in which they describe the diagnosis, treatment,&#xD;
      and outcomes of a patient with cervicogenic dizziness co-managed by a vestibular and an&#xD;
      orthopedic manual physical therapist. They argue that manual therapy combined with vestibular&#xD;
      rehabilitation may be superior in the treatment of cervicogenic dizziness. Literature states&#xD;
      that vestibular exercises have been used to increase motor control and reduce pain and&#xD;
      disability in patients with neck pain.&#xD;

    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline , balance and fall prevention to 4Weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance Scale is a 14 items scale, to assess static and dynamic balance. Scoring of this scale is done on a 5 point scale where 0 is inability to perform a task and 4 shows the independent task performance. The maximum score of this scale is 56 showing excellent performance</description>
