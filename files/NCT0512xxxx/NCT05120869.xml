  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Healthcare providers (HCP) serving the El Paso U.S.-Mexico Border Region will be recruited to&#xD;
      compare educational and professional skills interventions focused on the human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV). Our hypothesis is that improving provider knowledge and communication strategies about&#xD;
      HPV and its vaccine will reduce hesitancy and increase uptake and completion among the&#xD;
      populations they serve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      A sample of emerging [in training] and current [in practice] health professionals from the El&#xD;
      Paso U.S.-Mexico Border Region will be recruited to participate in a human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HPV) educational and professional skills intervention. Hypothesis: improving provider&#xD;
      knowledge and communication strategies about HPV and its vaccine will reduce hesitancy and&#xD;
      increase uptake and completion among eligible individuals through a tailored multi-media&#xD;
      intervention to strengthen providers' ability to discuss HPV and vaccination in an informed&#xD;
      and culturally competent manner, and increase subsequent provider recommendations.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>A parallel trial design will be used to examine the effectiveness of a tailored HPV education and professional skills intervention. Emerging and current healthcare providers will be randomly assigned to one of two conditions: 1) treatment condition in which they will receive a tailored Education and Professional Skills Intervention, and 2) control condition in which they will receive general, publicly available information about HPV and communication skills. Participants will then be followed over time and the responses will be compared between groups.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Other</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Double (Participant, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>Participants [blinding]: participants will be randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, they will not be made aware of other participant's receipt of treatment or control materials. Participants will be asked not to discuss this project outside of the intervention; delivery of the intervention or other educational materials will be virtual, limiting the ability of participants to interact with one another during the study.&#xD;
Outcome assessor [blinding]: to reduce bias in the implementation and assessment of the clinical trial, participant information and pre-post survey responses will be maintained separately from the assignment and delivery of the intervention.</masking_description>
