      The evolution of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic makes it more necessary the&#xD;
      intervention of Primary Health Care Physiotherapy Units in patients with respiratory and/or&#xD;
      functional sequelae after suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since some months ago, Primary Health Care use telerehabilitation tools to connect patients&#xD;
      and health care professions while maintaining social distancing and restrictions.&#xD;
      Tele-physiotherapy is a field of physiotherapy which has the advantage of providing physical&#xD;
      therapy interventions to patients' complications after COVID-19 by using a videoconferencing&#xD;

      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#xD;
      2 (SARS-Cov-2), is a multisystem infectious disease which has led to a global pandemic. The&#xD;
      evolution of COVID-19 desease makes it more necessary the intervention of Primary Health Care&#xD;
      Physiotherapy Units in patients with respiratory and /or functional sequelae after suffering&#xD;
      from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Problems such as breathlessness, exercise intolerance and loss of&#xD;
      peripheral muscle strength can be observed in individuals who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      persistent post COVID19.&#xD;

Performance is classified into 4 categories:&#xD;
Category A: less than 350 meters; poor performance. Category B: between 350 and 450 meters; moderate performance. Category C: between 450 and 650 meters; good performance. Category D: more than 650 meters; excellent performance.</description>

Allocated participants to control group will receive one consultation session by the physiotherapist, but will not received any physical Therapy treatment. At this session, patients will be educated about how to perform their daily activities, breathing exercises, walking. Convencional medical care will be provided.&#xD;
In the control group, the same measurements will be made at the same times as the subjects in the intervention group. Once the study is finished, the researcher agrees to carry out the intervention to the patients in the control group.</description>
