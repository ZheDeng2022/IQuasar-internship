      We will conduct a Phase I trial testing whether local cystoscopic injection of tremelimumab&#xD;
      into the bladder wall in combination with systemic administration of durvalumab in localized&#xD;
      bladder cancer will stimulate an effective anti-tumour immune response with minimal systemic&#xD;
      immune response and clinical toxicity.&#xD;

      The Rideau trial is a multi-centre, prospective, randomized phase I/II trial to determine&#xD;
      whether the local cystoscopic injection of tremelimumab into the bladder wall in combination&#xD;
      with systemic administration of durvalumab in localized bladder cancer will stimulate an&#xD;
      effective anti-tumour immune response with minimal systemic immune response and clinical&#xD;
      toxicity. The study will be broken down into a dose escalation phase, to determine the&#xD;
      recommended phase II dose of each drug in combination, and a dose expansion phase, to&#xD;
      demonstrate an early signal of treatment efficacy (complete response at 6 months) in patients&#xD;
      with BCG-unresponsive carcinoma in situ of the bladder. A maximum of 48 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled from 3 participating sites across Canada. All patients with histologically proven&#xD;
      bladder cancer scheduled to undergo radical cystectomy at the trial hospital will be eligible&#xD;
      for the dose escalation phase, while patients must have histologically proven, recurrent&#xD;
      urothelial carcinoma in situ of the bladder to be eligible for the dose expansion phase. The&#xD;
      dose escalation phase will run with between 12-36 patients who will receive 18 weeks of&#xD;
      follow-up to determine the recommended phase II dose. Twelve patients will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      dose expansion phase. These patients will receive follow-up every 4 weeks for 48 weeks, and&#xD;
      then every 3 months for a total follow-up period of 24 months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - 1. Disease Related Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.1 Dose Escalation Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have histologically proven bladder cancer of any histology and any stage&#xD;
             or grade confirmed by biopsy or transurethral bladder tumour resection (TURBT) within&#xD;
             120 days of study registration (defined as date of signing informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects must be scheduled for radical cystectomy at the trial hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1.2 Dose Expansion Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects must have histologically proven, recurrent, urothelial carcinoma in situ of&#xD;
             the bladder within 60 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pure squamous carcinoma in situ will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects may have concomitant Ta or T1 bladder tumours that have undergone visible&#xD;
             complete resection within 60 days prior to registration. CIS disease is not expected&#xD;
             to be completely excised.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. All patient tumour tissue from the histologic diagnosis of recurrence is available for&#xD;
             central review by the study pathologist at Vancouver General Hospital. This does not&#xD;
             need to be completed before starting study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have had cystoscopy confirming no visible papillary tumour within 21&#xD;
             days prior to registration. (CIS disease is not expected to have been completely&#xD;
             excised). If the TURBT or bladder biopsy falls within 21 days of registration it will&#xD;
             fulfil this criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must have had urine cytology within 21 days prior to registration. Cytology&#xD;
             for subjects with CIS component is not expected to be negative for malignant cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. All subjects with T1 urothelial carcinoma at study entry must undergo re-TURBT within&#xD;
             60 days prior to registration, and must have evidence of uninvolved muscularis propria&#xD;
             in the pathologic specimen from either the first or the second TURBT. Tissue from the&#xD;
             re-resection must be submitted for central review in addition to the tissue from the&#xD;
             first TURBT (see Section 8.2). The TURBT that identified the recurrent T1 disease may&#xD;
             have taken place more than 60 days prior to registration but not more than 120 days.&#xD;
             Subjects with high-grade Ta or CIS do not require a re-TURBT, but if this is performed&#xD;
             at the discretion of the treating physician, the second TURBT must be within 60 days&#xD;
             of registration. There is no requirement for muscularis propria in the specimen of&#xD;
             Ta/CIS subjects, but the tissue from the first and second TURBTs must be submitted for&#xD;
             central review. If a patient with Ta/T1 disease undergoes repeat TURBT, the patient&#xD;
             can be included as having CIS if there is CIS on either TURBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with prior urothelial carcinoma in the upper urinary tract within the&#xD;
             previous 24 months will only be eligible if they had ≤ T1 carcinoma and were treated&#xD;
             with nephroureterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects must have a CT or MRI (including CT-IVP, CT-urogram or MR-urogram) of the&#xD;
             abdomen and pelvis to rule out upper tract malignancy and intra-abdominal metastases&#xD;
             within 90 days prior to registration. If a patient cannot tolerate intravenous&#xD;
             contrast, a retrograde pyelogram should be performed within 90 days prior to&#xD;
             registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects must be deemed unfit for radical cystectomy by the treating physician, or the&#xD;
             patient must refuse radical cystectomy, which is considered standard of care for these&#xD;
             subjects. The reason for subjects not to undergo cystectomy will be clearly&#xD;
             documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Prior/Concurrent Therapy Criteria (Dose Expansion Phase only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        a. For the Dose Expansion Phase of the trial, subjects must be BCG-unresponsive. A patient&#xD;
        is BCG-unresponsive if they meet one or both of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Patient has persistent or recurrent CIS after completing therapy with at least induction&#xD;
        BCG (≥ 5 doses) and first round maintenance (≥ 2 doses) or second induction BCG (≥ 2&#xD;
        doses). Both rounds of BCG must have been administered within a 12-month period. Trial&#xD;
        registration must occur within 9 months of the last dose of BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient does not meet these criteria only because the last dose of BCG was more&#xD;
             than 9 months ago, the patient may become eligible if he/she shows histologically&#xD;
             proven CIS after an additional round of induction or maintenance BCG (≥ 3 doses)&#xD;
             within 9 months prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             - Patient achieves disease-free state at 6-month time point (i.e., complete response;&#xD;
             presence of only low-grade tumour at this timepoint is still considered complete&#xD;
             response) after induction and maintenance (or second round of induction) BCG but later&#xD;
             experiences CIS recurrence (with or without concomitant a high-grade Ta/T1) within 12&#xD;
             months after the last dose of BCG. The time of eligibility is measured from the last&#xD;
             dose of BCG to the time of disease recurrence. The patient must be registered on the&#xD;
             trial within 60 days of this recurrence, or within 60 days of a re-TURBT if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Clinical/Laboratory Criteria (For Dose Escalation and Expansion Phases)&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
                  requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF) and in&#xD;
                  this protocol. Written informed consent must be obtained from the patient/legal&#xD;
                  representative prior to performing any protocol-related procedures, including&#xD;
                  screening evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Age &gt;18 years at time of study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Body weight &gt;30 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Adequate normal organ and marrow function as defined below (These results must be&#xD;
                  obtained within 42 days prior to registration):&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                  - Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN). This will not&#xD;
                  apply to subjects with confirmed Gilbert's syndrome (persistent or recurrent&#xD;
                  hyperbilirubinemia that is predominantly unconjugated in the absence of hemolysis&#xD;
                  or hepatic pathology), who will be allowed only in consultation with their&#xD;
                  physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  - AST (SGOT)/ALT (SGPT) ≤2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal unless liver&#xD;
                  metastases are present, in which case it must be ≤5x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Measured creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min or Calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
                       &gt;40 mL/min by the Cockcroft-Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976) or by&#xD;
                       24-hour urine collection for determination of creatinine clearance:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Males:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) 72 x serum creatinine&#xD;
                  (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Females:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  Creatinine clearance (mL/min) = Weight (kg) x (140 - Age) x 0.85 72 x serum&#xD;
                  creatinine (mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
               6. Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative urinary or serum pregnancy test&#xD;
                  for female pre-menopausal subjects. The intention of this restriction is to&#xD;
                  prevent or minimize embryo/fetal exposures to study drug. Women will be&#xD;
                  considered post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months without an&#xD;
                  alternative medical cause. The following age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  - Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone&#xD;
                  levels in the post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  - Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
                  chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent&#xD;
                  surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or&#xD;
                  hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               7. Subjects must have a baseline ECG performed within 42 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
