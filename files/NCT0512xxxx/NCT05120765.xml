    <textblock>
      This study will test a telephone-based group intervention called &quot;The CONNECT Program&quot; which&#xD;
      is designed for adults aged 65+ who are currently experiencing social isolation or&#xD;
      loneliness, and symptoms of anxiety or depression. A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      will be conducted to evaluate The CONNECT Program using a clinical sample of adults 65+. The&#xD;
      goals of this research include, (a) testing the feasibility of conducting a large-scale RCT&#xD;
      using a clinical sample of adults 65+; (b) understanding the experiences of this clinical&#xD;
      sample of adults 65+ in The CONNECT Program; and (c) investigating the preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness of this program with this sample. Participants (N=16) will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either the waitlist or intervention group. Both groups will receive the intervention and&#xD;
      share their experiences in The CONNECT Program. The waitlist group will receive the&#xD;
      intervention after the waiting period. All participants will complete questionnaires before&#xD;
      receiving the intervention, after receiving the intervention, and each week during the&#xD;
      intervention. This study will provide us with insight regarding what this clinical sample of&#xD;
      participants think of The CONNECT Program, how we can improve the program in the future in&#xD;
      order to meet the needs of this group, what changes to the study design are needed in order&#xD;
      to execute a large-scale randomized controlled trial in the future, and if this program shows&#xD;
      preliminary effectiveness in this sample.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population of adults aged 65+ in Canada is increasing (Statistics Canada, 2019). Some of&#xD;
      the most common mental health and psychosocial problems experienced by adults aged 65+&#xD;
      include anxiety, depression, social isolation, and loneliness. The current research will test&#xD;
      a telephone-based group intervention called &quot;CONNECT&quot; which is designed for adults aged 65+&#xD;
      who are currently experiencing social isolation or loneliness, and symptoms of anxiety or&#xD;
      depression. CONNECT stands for: &quot;Creating Opportunities to build social Networks, learn New&#xD;
      skills to manage challenging emotions Enhance mindful awareness and acceptance of emotions,&#xD;
      and increase self-Compassion, through Telephone-based group programming&quot;. A pilot randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial will be conducted to evaluate The CONNECT Program using a clinical sample of&#xD;
      adults 65+ recruited from Winnipeg and Brandon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use a randomized design to pilot this intervention and assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing and testing this intervention with a clinical sample of adults 65+. Participants&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to one of two conditions (1 = intervention, 2 = waitlist). The&#xD;
      quantitative data we collect will inform us about changes in self-reported symptoms on the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcome measures and it will reveal information about treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction and how participants experienced each session. Additionally, the questionnaire&#xD;
      that will be administered after each session and the post-CONNECT questionnaire will include&#xD;
      open-ended questions where participants can expand on their answers about treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction and their experiences in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within one week before the first CONNECT session, all participants will complete the baseline&#xD;
      questionnaire and will then be randomized to one of two groups (1 = intervention, 2 =&#xD;
      waitlist). One week after the baseline questionnaire is complete, participants in the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive six weeks of CONNECT group therapy, and participants in the&#xD;
      waitlist group will begin the waiting period. Within one week of the last CONNECT session,&#xD;
      all participants will complete the post-CONNECT questionnaire. Participants receiving the&#xD;
      intervention will also complete the Group Session Rating Scale (GSRS) after each session in&#xD;
      order to monitor the participant progress from session to session and to evaluate the&#xD;
      group-therapy alliance. Due to the exploratory nature of this pilot RCT, participants in the&#xD;
      waitlist group will complete the baseline questionnaire again, they will receive the&#xD;
      intervention and complete the GSRS each week, and they will complete post-CONNECT&#xD;
      questionnaire one week after the last session. We plan to collect this data because we want&#xD;
      to capture the experiences of the waitlist participants both when they are waiting for the&#xD;
      intervention and when they receive the intervention. The purpose of including a waitlist&#xD;
      group is to help determine if the current study procedures are acceptable. This will allow us&#xD;
      to better understand potential issues such as participant dropout, and it will help us&#xD;
      identify changes that should be made for a future RCT.&#xD;
