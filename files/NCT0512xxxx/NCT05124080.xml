    <textblock>
      . An open label proof of concept study will be conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      deucravactinib for treatment of nail psoriasis. Twenty adult patients with nail psorasis and&#xD;
      skin disease qualifying for a systemic agent per investigator will be treated with&#xD;
      deucravacitinib 6 mg daily. Subjects will be assessed for a total of 48 weeks. Psoriasis&#xD;
      assessments such as the modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index will be conducted. Photos will&#xD;
      be used to document nail involvement. Descriptive statistical analysis will be conducted at&#xD;
      the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
