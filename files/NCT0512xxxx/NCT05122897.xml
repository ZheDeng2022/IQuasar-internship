  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This in-vivo study investigates early (48h), mature (2 weeks) and long-term (3 months)&#xD;
      biofilm formation and composition on temporary push-on cones (exchangeable conical rings)&#xD;
      made of noble-alloy-based materials (Pagalinor, PA) in comparison to&#xD;
      Titanium-6Aluminum-7Niobium alloy (TAN) presently used in the transmucosal portion of dental&#xD;
      implant abutments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral biofilm (dental plaque) consists of bacteria and their metabolic products as well as&#xD;
      saliva components and food residues. It is recognizable as a tough and structured coating on&#xD;
      teeth and artificial surfaces within the oral cavity. Plaque development is a physiological&#xD;
      process that begins immediately after cleaning of the oral surface. If the biofilm is not&#xD;
      removed by daily oral hygiene, it continues to mature while changing the structure and its&#xD;
      microbial composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implant restorations comprise the osseous implant portion predominantly manufactured from&#xD;
      titanium alloys, the transmucosal implant portion (in most implant systems as a separate&#xD;
      abutment), and the clinical crown, which is in most systems extraorally cemented on an&#xD;
      abutment and screw-retained onto the implant. According to current knowledge, microbial&#xD;
      colonization of the implant abutment surface plays a significant role in the aetiology of&#xD;
      peri-implantitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the antibacterial potential of a temporary push-on cone (conical&#xD;
      ring) that could reduce the risk of bacterial related peri-implant diseases due to decreased&#xD;
      biofilm susceptibility, compared to current available transmucosal materials, in the short-&#xD;
      and long-run. The test material Pagalinor®2 (PA) is an established material in dental&#xD;
      medicine and has proven to accumulate least biofilm in an in-vivo biofilm sampling model&#xD;
      using removable splints. The control material consists of the current transmucosal implant&#xD;
      abutment material Titanium-6Aluminum- 7Niobium alloy (TAN). The push-on rings are designed&#xD;
      for repeated application along the transmucosal implant abutment portion with high precision&#xD;
      fit and will allow biofilm sampling in the natural implant environment. Profound insight into&#xD;
      the native homeostasis of biofilm formation will be obtained and therefore enhance the&#xD;
      knowledge about long-term tissue response.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All patients enrolled in the current investigation will wear both the test and control ring material for a within-subject comparison. Ideally, biofilm sampling can be performed in a split mouth design (randomly allocated materials within subjects) with one patient having two implants for placing the test and the control material at the same time. In addition, patients providing one implant, will receive test and control push-on rings in a randomly assigned order, so that both materials are assessed in a consecutive manner.</intervention_model_description>
