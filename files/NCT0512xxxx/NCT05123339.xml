      Primary outcome is to compare the frequency and clinical features of spinal symptoms between&#xD;
      Marfan patients with dural ectasia (cases) and those without (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. / Frequency of orthostatic headaches&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. / Frequency of low back pain due to orthostasis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. / Frequency of low back pain during Vasalva maneuvers&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. / Frequency of lumbar claudication&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. / Frequency of root claudication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are to compare activity limitations, quality of life and intensity of low&#xD;
      back and radicular pain between Marfan patients with dural sac ectasia (cases) and those&#xD;
      without (controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. / Average intensity of back pain measured on a self-administered digital scale (0 = no&#xD;
           pain and 100 = maximum pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. / Average intensity of radicular pain measured on a self-administered digital scale (0 =&#xD;
           no pain and 100 = maximum pain)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. / Activity limitations specific to the lumbar spine measured using the self-administered&#xD;
           Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire (ODI, 0 = no limitations and 100 = maximum&#xD;
           limitations)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. / Physical component of quality of life measured using the physical component of the&#xD;
           self-administered questionnaire 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12, 9.95 = worst&#xD;
           quality of life imaginable, 70.02 = worst quality of life imaginable )&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. / Mental component of the quality of life measured using the mental component of the&#xD;
           SF-12 self-administered questionnaire (5.89 = worst quality of life imaginable, 71.97 =&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Marfan's disease is a rare condition. Clinical phenotypes are heterogeneous. Among the&#xD;
      abnormalities of the spine, dural ectasia is common with a prevalence of 66%. This is a major&#xD;
      sign of Ghent's diagnostic criteria. To our knowledge, the clinical and functional signs&#xD;
      associated with dural sac ectasia have never been described with precision. Only a few&#xD;
      uncontrolled case series have been published. This is the case of the study by Foran and&#xD;
      colleagues published in the American Journal of Genetics in 2005 which included 22 patients&#xD;
      with Marfan disease with dural ectasia questioned about their symptoms and quality of life&#xD;
      (1). We hypothesize the existence of a clinical and functional spinal phenotype specific to&#xD;
      dural ectasia in patients with Marfan disease.&#xD;

      This description could help guide the prescription of additional examinations and also allow&#xD;
      more specific treatment than what is currently offered.&#xD;
