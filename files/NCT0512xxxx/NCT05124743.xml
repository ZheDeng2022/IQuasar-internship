    <textblock>
      This is a data collection study, also referred to as a &quot;screening&quot; study; no investigational&#xD;
      or standard therapy will be administered as part of this study. In order to identify subjects&#xD;
      for the Phase I/II study, TCR001-201, patients with following histologically confirmed tumor&#xD;
      types will be initially screened in this protocol for their somatic mutation and HLA type:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gynecologic cancer (ovarian or endometrial)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC includes but is not limited to squamous cell&#xD;
           carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinomas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholangiocarcinoma Subjects' somatic mutation(s) and HLA type restriction combination&#xD;
           will be examined against Ziopharm Oncology Inc.'s (Ziopharm) TCR library to determine if&#xD;
           a TCR match is available for that subject. Subjects without a match will be discontinued&#xD;
           from this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a TCR match in the Ziopharm TCR library will continue to be followed on this&#xD;
      protocol and their clinical status will be monitored on an ongoing basis for eligibility,&#xD;
      i.e., for progressive or recurrent disease, to enroll and receive TCR-T cell therapy on the&#xD;
      Phase I/II study. Subjects will complete participation on this protocol when the subject&#xD;
      enrolls on the Phase I/II study or if the subject dies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol will be used to perform and/or collect results from genetic mutation testing&#xD;
      (e.g., Oncomineâ„¢ or similar genomic test performed at a CLIA-certified laboratory) and high&#xD;
      resolution, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II typing from a CLIA-certified&#xD;
      laboratory. This protocol will also collect subject clinical baseline characteristics,&#xD;
      demographics, and cancer history. This protocol will be used to monitor subject disease&#xD;
      status to identify candidates for enrollment onto the Phase I/II study as patients must have&#xD;
      progressive or recurrent disease to be enrolled onto that protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's somatic mutation(s) and HLA type restriction combination will be examined&#xD;
      against Ziopharm's TCR library to determine if a TCR is available for that subject. Subjects&#xD;
      without a TCR match will be discontinued from this protocol. If the subject's somatic&#xD;
      mutation and HLA type restriction combination matched TCR is added to the Ziopharm TCR&#xD;
      library after the subject discontinues, the investigator may contact the subject to be&#xD;
      re-screened for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with a TCR match in the Ziopharm TCR library will continue to be followed on this&#xD;
      protocol and their clinical status will be monitored on an ongoing basis for eligibility,&#xD;
      particularly progressive or recurrent disease, to enroll and receive TCR-T cell therapy on&#xD;
      the Phase I/II study. Clinical status will be collected at enrollment and approximately every&#xD;
      3 months in conjunction with subjects' regularly scheduled standard of care visits. Subjects&#xD;
      with a TCR match will complete participation on this protocol once they enroll in the Phase&#xD;
      I/II study or if the subject dies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients must be currently treated at MDACC for one of the following cancer types:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Gynecologic cancer (ovarian and endometrial)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Pancreatic cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), NSCLC includes but is not limited to squamous&#xD;
                  cell carcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma or adenocarcinomas&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Cholangiocarcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with previous CLIA certified tumor genomic testing must be willing to&#xD;
             disclose results. Patients that do not have previous CLIA certified tumor genomic&#xD;
             testing must have a planned biopsy or resection as part of their standard of care (or&#xD;
             archived tumor tissue available for genomic testing). Patients undergoing a biopsy or&#xD;
             resection for tumor genomic testing must have evaluable or measurable disease per&#xD;
             RECIST guideline (version 1.1) (Eisenhauer et al., 2009) with at least one lesion that&#xD;
             can be measured. General guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Prior genomic testing results or an archival biopsy with sufficient tumor tissue&#xD;
                  to enable genomic testing, preferably after the last line of therapy and within 6&#xD;
                  months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. A new biopsy is recommended as feasible and if to be done as part of&#xD;
                  standard-of-care, should the patient have progressed for more than 6 months since&#xD;
                  the last line of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. If the patient never responded to prior therapy or has recurred without&#xD;
                  intervening therapy, prior genomic testing results or an archival biopsy with&#xD;
                  sufficient tumor tissue to enable genomic testing may be acceptable between 6-12&#xD;
                  months.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. If prior genomic testing results or archival biopsy with sufficient tumor tissue&#xD;
                  are older than 12 months, a new biopsy is recommended and if to be done as part&#xD;
                  of standard-of-care. If re-biopsy is not feasible, circulating tumor DNA may be&#xD;
                  considered if collected as part of standard-of-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients with previous high resolution, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I and II&#xD;
             typing from a CLIA certified laboratory must be willing to disclose results. Patients&#xD;
             that do not have previous typing results must be willing to provide a blood sample for&#xD;
             this testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must be age greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 68&#xD;
             years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients must have a clinical performance status of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group&#xD;
             (ECOG) of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with 3 or fewer brain metastases that are &lt; 1cm in diameter and asymptomatic&#xD;
             are eligible. Lesions that have been treated with stereotactic radiosurgery must be&#xD;
             clinically stable for one month after treatment for the patient to be eligible.&#xD;
             Patients with surgically resected brain metastases are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Lung Cancer subjects only: More than two weeks must have elapsed since any prior&#xD;
             palliation for major bronchial occlusion or bleeding and enrollment, and patient's&#xD;
             toxicities must have recovered to less than or equal to Grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active systemic infections, or any other unstable or clinically significant medical&#xD;
             condition that would, in the opinion of the Principal Investigator (PI) in&#xD;
             consultation as warranted with medical monitor, result in risks to safety of a subject&#xD;
             and/or their compliance with the protocol. Examples include, but are not limited to, a&#xD;
             history of myocarditis or congestive heart failure (New York Heart Associate&#xD;
             functional Class III or IV), unstable angina, serious uncontrolled cardiac arrythmia,&#xD;
             myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening, active interstitial lung disease&#xD;
             (ILD)/pneumonitis or a history of ILD/pneumonitis requiring chronic treatment with&#xD;
             systemic steroids, uncontrolled asthma, or colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as severe combined immunodeficiency&#xD;
             disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to cyclophosphamide,&#xD;
             fludarabine, or aldesleukin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant patient history which in the judgment of the PI in consultation&#xD;
             as warranted with the medical monitor would compromise the patients' ability to&#xD;
             tolerate high-dose aldesleukin; (please note: at the discretion of the PI, patients&#xD;
             enrolled in cohort 4 (Lung) may receive low-dose aldesleukin). Additionally, any other&#xD;
             chronic or persistent medical condition considered to be an absolute contraindication&#xD;
             for undergoing apheresis by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor&#xD;
             as warranted&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has uncontrolled Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Has another concurrent clinically active hematologic malignancy or solid tumor&#xD;
             malignancy requiring treatment, except for non-melanoma cancers of the skin, carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the cervix, or non-metastatic prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has a history of a bleeding disorder or unexplained major bleeding diathesis or is&#xD;
             currently receiving chronic anticoagulation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has received any type of organ transplant in the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has undergone xenotransplantation at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has received a dura mater graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with inadequate peripheral vascular access in whom the need for the central&#xD;
             (femoral) line is likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Lung cancer patients only: any major bronchial occlusion or bleeding not amenable to&#xD;
             palliation.&#xD;
