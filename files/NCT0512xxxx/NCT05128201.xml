      This trial was a single-arm, multicenter phase Ⅱ clinical study. Eligible oligometastatic NPC&#xD;
      patients were scheduled to evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of local consolidative&#xD;
      radiotherapy combined with camrelizumab and chemotherapy in patients with oligometastatic&#xD;
      NPC. Progression-free survival (PFS) determined will be the primary outcome measures.&#xD;
