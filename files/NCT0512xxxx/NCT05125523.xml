      The purpose of this study is to estimate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      antitumor activity of Sirolimus for Injection (Albumin Bound) in patients with solid&#xD;
      malignancies.&#xD;

      This study will be conducted in two stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Sirolimus for Injection (Albumin Bound)&#xD;
      in patients with advanced tumors, determine the MTD and RP2D. The dose escalation scheme&#xD;
      using the accelerated titration design for dose 1 and the rolling-six design for the&#xD;
      remaining doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: To preliminarily assess the antitumor activity of Sirolimus for Injection (Albumin&#xD;
      Bound). Patients will be assigned to different cohorts based on their tumor type.&#xD;
