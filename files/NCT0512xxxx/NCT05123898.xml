  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was an interventional prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) in parallel groups.&#xD;
      The sample size is 35 patients who were randomly divided into two groups depending on the&#xD;
      surgical intervention used. First group - patients underwent increasing the thickness of the&#xD;
      mucous membrane using free connective tissue graft from tuberosity area of the upper jaw.&#xD;
      Second group - patients used collagen matrix &quot;Fibromatrix&quot; (LLC &quot;Cardioplant&quot;, Russia;&#xD;
      registration in Russia 20/05/2019 No FSZ 2019/83671). In the postoperative period the value&#xD;
      of soft tissue thickness gain, duration of surgery, severity of pain syndrome and quality of&#xD;
      life were assessed. Also, after 3 months simultaneously with installation of gingiva formers&#xD;
      biopsy specimens were sampled with mucotome in the area of the intervention followed by&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis of the obtained biopsies.&#xD;

      The aim of this research was to perform a comparative clinical and histomorphometric analysis&#xD;
      of soft tissues in the area of soft tissue graft and collagen matrix transplantation. Thirty&#xD;
      five patients diagnosed with partial absence of teeth were examined on the basis of the&#xD;
      Department of Surgical Dentistry of the E.V. Borovsky Institute of Dentistry of I.M. Sechenov&#xD;
      First Moscow State Medical University. Patients had a soft tissue thickness deficiency from&#xD;
      the vestibular surface in the area of the planned dental implant placement which was an&#xD;
      indication for its increase. All patients were randomly divided into two groups depending on&#xD;
      method of soft tissue augmentation used. In 1 group (n=15) transplantation of a free&#xD;
      connective tissue graft (CTG) from tuberosity area of the upper jaw was performed. In 2 group&#xD;
      (n=20) collagen matrix &quot;Fibromatrix&quot; was used. According to gender and age characteristics&#xD;
      both groups were comparable. Randomization of patients was carried out at the stage of&#xD;
      surgical intervention as follows: after a dental implant placement and preparation of&#xD;
      recipient's bed an envelope with a randomly assigned treatment method (using a connective&#xD;
      tissue graft or a collagen matrix) was opened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation, incision was made along the top of the alveolar ridge within the&#xD;
      defect; a full-thickness muco-periosteal flap was elevated. Traditional 2-stage dental&#xD;
      implantation was performed according to surgical protocols of dental implant systems Ostem&#xD;
      (Osstem Implant Co., Ltd., Korea; registration in Russia 05.09.2018 No FSZ 2018/7577). A free&#xD;
      connective tissue graft was harvested in patients of the first group. Graft was fixed with a&#xD;
      horizontal U-shaped suture to the buccal muco-periosteal flap. In second patients group a&#xD;
      fragment of the collagen matrix &quot;Fibromatrix&quot; was fixed to the buccal muco-periosteal flap&#xD;
      (LLC &quot;Cardioplant&quot;, Russia; registration in Russia 20.05.2019 No â„– FSZ 2019/83671). For&#xD;
      patients of all groups mobilization of the muco-periosteal flap conducted followed by&#xD;
      suturing the wound tightly without tension with simple interrupted sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the early postoperative period the standard antibacterial and anti-inflammatory therapy in&#xD;
      combination with the use of local antiseptics for daily care was prescribed. The stage of the&#xD;
      implant uncovering with hilling abutments installation was carried out 3 months after the&#xD;
      intervention. At this stage, a soft tissue fragment was taken using a mucotome in the area of&#xD;
      the previously performed mucous membrane thickness increasing for subsequent&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis. In the study we used both conventional light microscopy&#xD;
      (microscopy in the light field) and polarizing microscopy - to estimate the content of&#xD;
      collagen fibers in preparations stained with picrosirius red. During a morphometric study we&#xD;
      carried out a quantitative assessment of the characteristics of the epithelial layer, the&#xD;
      basement membrane relative length (the ratio of the absolute length of the basement membrane&#xD;
      to the length of the epithelial layer), the characteristics of the underlying connective&#xD;
      tissue.&#xD;
