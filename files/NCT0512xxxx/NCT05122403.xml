  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To explore the pathogenesis underlying neuropathic pain as well as the mechanisms of pain&#xD;
      relief after Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) Central Lateral&#xD;
      Thalamotomy through multi-model MRI study, and to identify imaging biomarkers for triaging&#xD;
      patients and predicting the clinical outcomes. Craniofacial neuropathic pain is one of the&#xD;
      most serious debilitating symptoms, leading to emotional disorders and poor quality of life.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown that Magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (MRgFUS)&#xD;
      central lateral thalamotomy is a minimally invasive and effective procedure for&#xD;
      medication-refractory neuropathic pain patients. However, the clinical benefits were variable&#xD;
      among individuals. It is important to clarify the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain and the&#xD;
      mechanisms of pain relief induced by MRgFUS central lateral thalamotomy to triage suitable&#xD;
      candidates for the procedure and predict clinical outcomes. In addition, localization&#xD;
      precision and individualized treatment remain to be improved.&#xD;

      The study was designed as a prospective, sham-controlled randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      (randomized 1:1) with double-blinded assessments through the 3-month primary end point&#xD;
      analysis. Patients assigned to a sham procedure were offered open label treatment after the&#xD;
      3-month blinded assessment. All treated patients were followed unblinded to 1 year. Baseline&#xD;
      clinical demographics, Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) treatment parameters (energy,&#xD;
      power, duration time, temperature, target location) , associated adverse effects were&#xD;
      recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging protocols:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2; T2 Flair; DWI; ESWAN; MRS; 3D ASL 2.0s; 3D-T1; DTI; rs-functional MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lesion appearance and volume are measured by T2, T2 Flair, DWI, ESWAN, 3D-T1;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ESWAN and MRS manifests the changes of iron deposition and metabolism, respectively;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ASL shows regional cerebral blood flow associated with the procedure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. DTI demonstrates the destruction of white matter integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Rs-functional MRI reflects alterations of resting-state brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRgFUS central lateral thalamotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
