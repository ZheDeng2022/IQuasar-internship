    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the following hypotheses in a longitudinal, observational study in&#xD;
      pregnant women who will be randomized to received either a Blinded or Unblinded CGM sensor&#xD;
      and followed-up 6-12 weeks after delivery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CF-CGM device is well tolerable and accurate for glucose level monitoring in women with&#xD;
           a normal pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CF-CGM device is well tolerable and acceptable in women with GDM who are required&#xD;
           intensive glucose monitoring on a daily basis during pregnancy and even after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There are trimester-specific glucose profiles observed in the whole pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pregnancies complicated with GDM would show a specific glucose profile that is different&#xD;
           from non-GDM pregnancies (e.g. greater daily fluctuations, more episodes and longer&#xD;
           duration of glucose spikes after meal).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. There is a good correlation between one-day glucose profile and OGTT test at 24-31 weeks&#xD;
           gestation GDM screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pre-GDM screening glucose profiles is predictive of GDM diagnosis at 24-31 weeks&#xD;
           gestation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GDM affects 5-10% of pregnant women in Europe, while the prevalence in Asian populations is&#xD;
      significantly higher at approximately 15-20%. However, the GDM screening approaches, timing&#xD;
      and targeted population still varies greatly in clinical practice all over the world, which&#xD;
      makes the prevalence of GDM difficult to compare universally. Since the early days of the&#xD;
      21st century, the continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM) has been used for constant&#xD;
      evaluation of glucose levels by measuring interstitial glucose concentrations. It can&#xD;
      potentially improve diabetes care if used carefully with proper understanding of the&#xD;
      characteristics of this system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is longitudinal, observational and hospital-based study. A total of 500 pregnant women&#xD;
      will be recruited with consent form completion after meeting our inclusion criteria. The&#xD;
      recruited women will then be randomly assigned to a Blinded and Unblinded CGM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pregnant women aged 21 and above who plan to be followed up throughout pregnancy and&#xD;
      intend to deliver at KKH and currently attending KKH for antenatal consultation during their&#xD;
      early trimester will be approached by study research personnel, and will be followed up from&#xD;
      then onwards. If they agree to take part in the study, consent will be signed at the first&#xD;
      trimester clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All recruited subjects will be randomized to put on a Blinded or Unblinded CGM device for 14&#xD;
      days from the first trimester (9-13 weeks), 18-23 weeks, 24-31 weeks, and 32-33 weeks. If a&#xD;
      pregnant subject is diagnosed with GDM using International association of diabetes and&#xD;
      pregnancy study groups (IADPSG) guidelines at KKH at 24-31 weeks gestation, she will be&#xD;
      required to wear the sensor continuously until 38 weeks gestation, and will be followed up&#xD;
      for another 14 days at the 6-12 weeks postnatal period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through questionnaires and clinical measurements. The questionnaires&#xD;
      include socio-economic factors, medical histories, lifestyle factors, health status, and home&#xD;
      environment. Bio-physical measurements will be obtained from anthropometric measurements of&#xD;
      participants, human biological materials such as blood, are collected from the participants&#xD;
      at their follow-up time points with the I-PROFILE study upon their consent.&#xD;
