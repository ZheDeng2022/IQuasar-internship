  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability of the Test and Reference&#xD;
      products both containing Metformin 500 mg prolonged release tablets (MFM) in healthy male and&#xD;
      female volunteers under fed conditions and to assess the bioequivalence of these products&#xD;
      based on confidence acceptance intervals of 80.00% to 125.00% for AUC(o-t)and Cmax of MFM as&#xD;
      primary endpoints.&#xD;

      An Open, Comparative, Randomized, Crossover Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Bioequivalence of&#xD;
      Single Doses of Test Product Metformin, prolonged-release tablets 500 mg (JSC Farmak,&#xD;
      Ukraine) and Reference Product Glucophage® XR 500 mg prolonged release tablets (Merck Serono&#xD;
      Ltd, UK) in Healthy, Adult Male and Female Subjects Under Fed Conditions Single oral dose of&#xD;
      Glucophage® XR 500 mg prolonged release tablets of Reference product or Metformin,&#xD;
      prolonged-release tablets 500 mg of Test product will be administered to volunteers under fed&#xD;
      conditions in the morning of Day 1 of each Study Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of MFM were calculated from plasma concentrations determined by&#xD;
      validated HPLC/MS/MS method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of the Test and Reference tablets were compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each period 21 samples were taken: prior to dosing (-1.0) and 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5,&#xD;
      5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 10.0, 12.0, 16.0, 24.0, 32.0 and 36.0 hours&#xD;
      after IMP administration in each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two study periods with a washout period of at least 7 days between&#xD;
      doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events and clinically significant deviations from laboratory tests, physical&#xD;
      examinations and vital signs were reported for the evaluation of safety.&#xD;
