  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, we plan to evaluate whether a new, rotational thromboelastometry-guided&#xD;
      algorithm (ROTEM) to guide hemostatic resuscitation decreases the use of allogeneic blood&#xD;
      products, the total amount of bleeding, transfusion related side effects, thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications and costs. Its effect on each patient's post-operative hemostatic profile is&#xD;
      also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to enroll 140 patients having ACLF with variceal bleeding randomized into two groups:&#xD;
      one will be treated conventionally using clinical judgement and standard coagulation tests&#xD;
      such as prothrombin time, platelet count, etc. the other treated using a ROTEM-based&#xD;
      algorithm. They will be followed for development of rebleeding, complications of transfusion&#xD;
      and any signs of infection after hospitalization&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) have coagulation failure in the setting&#xD;
      of systemic inflammatory syndrome (SIRS), sepsis and extra-hepatic organ failures. The&#xD;
      utility of thromboelastography/thromboelastometry currently has unvalidated clinical benefit&#xD;
      in the assessment and reversal of coagulopathy among cirrhotic patients as compared to&#xD;
      standard coagulation testing.Need for periprocedural blood transfusion is still high in&#xD;
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis or ACLF who present with major bleeding. Allogeneic&#xD;
      blood transfusion may be detrimental in patients with cirrhosis, due to volume overload and&#xD;
      acute lung injury. Viscoelastic testing of global coagulation such as thromboelastometry has&#xD;
      been proposed as a superior tool to rapidly diagnose and help guide resuscitation with blood&#xD;
      products. In prior studies, we have clarified the pathophysiology of hemostasis in relation&#xD;
      to the evidence of sepsis in liver disease and described the accuracy of various available&#xD;
      laboratory tests in assessment of these patients. We have described the role of endogenous&#xD;
      heparinoids in severe alcoholic hepatitis and the pathogenesis of the coagulation defect in&#xD;
      ACLF. We determined the influence of sepsis on coagulation disorders in ACLF patients, to&#xD;
      correctly identify the type and optimal quantity of blood product requirement in at risk&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
