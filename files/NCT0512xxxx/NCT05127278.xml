  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psychosis is a severe mental disorder that involves abnormal experiences and altered&#xD;
      behaviour. Although the onset of psychosis occurs in young people, most cases will only be&#xD;
      identified later in the course of illness. The delayed detection is the main cause of&#xD;
      significant negative long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal will develop an innovative E-mental health detection tool to effectively&#xD;
      improve the identification of young people with emerging psychosis. This tool will be&#xD;
      implemented on digital platforms including websites, tablets and mobile phones. Young people&#xD;
      will be asked to complete an online questionnaire and two short online-exercises and will&#xD;
      then be invited for face-to-face assessments to further confirm whether they are experiencing&#xD;
      an emerging psychosis. This digital approach leverages previous expertise by our research&#xD;
      team and it is expected to provide novel avenues to enable the identification of young people&#xD;
      with emerging psychosis.&#xD;

      The current proposal will develop an innovative E-DetectioN Tool for Emerging Mental&#xD;
      DisoRders (ENTER). This tool will be implemented on a website and we will invite participants&#xD;
      to the site via email-invitations, flyers as well as through advertisements on social media&#xD;
      as in our previous work (McDonald, Christoforidou et al., 2019). Specifically, ENTER will be&#xD;
      tested in young people who are experiencing potentially an emerging psychosis, specifically&#xD;
      who may meet ARMS or FEP-criteria. The proposed digital approach leverages previous expertise&#xD;
      by our research team, and it is expected to provide novel avenues to enable the&#xD;
      identification of young people with emerging psychosis. This will ultimately improve the&#xD;
      mental health and the life of many young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The refined digital screening will enhance our previous approach by incorporating novel&#xD;
      features beyond the standard PQ-16 questionnaire, which encompass three overarching domains:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly we will assess robust epidemiologically-based environmental risk and protective&#xD;
      factors that are predicting the onset of psychotic disorders. Some of these factors have&#xD;
      already demonstrated prognostic utility, as highlighted by our previous work in this area&#xD;
      (Fusar-Poli, Rutigliano et al., 2017, Fusar-Poli, Werbeloff et al., 2018). The selection of&#xD;
      these factors has been informed by robust evidence-based synthesis (Radua, Ramella-Cravaro et&#xD;
      al., 2018). Digital assessment of exposure to these factors is collected through a Polyrisk&#xD;
      Prognostic Score (PPS). This self-rated questionnaire has previously shown to be feasible and&#xD;
      non-distressing for young people, discriminating ARMS individuals from healthy controls&#xD;
      (Oliver, Spada et al., 2020). Since most of these factors have been shown to accumulate in&#xD;
      ARMS participants (Fusar-Poli, Tantardini et al., 2017), we expect that the addition of these&#xD;
      environmental risk and protective factors will increase the prognostic accuracy of our tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, we will measure the frequent subthreshold features which characterise emerging&#xD;
      psychotic disorders in terms of bipolar risk To do so we will employ self-assessment tools&#xD;
      that have recently been validated for young people such as the self-rated Bipolar Prodrome&#xD;
      Symptom Scale for patients (BPPS-FP) (Van Meter, Guinart et al., 2019), a brief self-report&#xD;
      measure used to assess symptoms of the prodrome to bipolar disorder in order to screen and&#xD;
      identify people for whom further evaluation is indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirdly, we will build on recent evidence indicating that cognitive deficits (Seidman,&#xD;
      Shapiro et al., 2016) and speech analysis (Bedi, Carrillo et al., 2015; Corcoran, Carrillo et&#xD;
      al., 2018) can be used to better identify emerging psychosis. Impaired performance processing&#xD;
      speed is one of the most robust indicators of cognitive impairment in psychosis (Dickinson,&#xD;
      Ramsey et al., 2007) and predicts transition to psychosis in ARMS populations (Seidman,&#xD;
      Shapiro et al., 2016). We therefore plan to use the self-rated digit symbol task (DST) to&#xD;
      assess speed of processing (Dickinson, Ramsey et al., 2007). Moreover, subtle language&#xD;
      abnormalities, such as in semantic features and syntactic complexity, can predict outcomes in&#xD;
      ARMS populations (Bedi, Carrillo et al., 2015). To test this we plan to acquire speech&#xD;
      samples in response to Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) to assess speech anomalies (Corcoran,&#xD;
      Carrillo et al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENTER will represent a new integrated, comprehensive, scalable, first-in-class e-detection&#xD;
      tool that can be implemented in the community. This is particularly important as only 5% of&#xD;
      FEP cases are detected through conventional detection strategies that mostly focus on mental&#xD;
      health services (Fusar-Poli, Rutigliano et al., 2017). Following the validation of ENTER, we&#xD;
      plan that the resulting tool will be implemented on phones and tablets to allow for testing&#xD;
      of emerging psychosis in clinical and non-clinical settings.&#xD;
