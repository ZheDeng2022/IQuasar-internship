  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an exercise training intervention together with&#xD;
      conventional medical treatment can decrease the annual healthcare cost in patients with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is proposed a multicentral clinical trial with cluster randomization among research nodes&#xD;
      located in towns of Castilla-La Mancha and Toledo neighborhoods (Spain). The aim is to&#xD;
      compare the annual healthcare cost of patients receiving conventional medical treatment&#xD;
      against patients receiving the same intervention plus exercise training for 16 weeks.&#xD;
      Exercise training will be based on high-intensity interval training conducted on stationary&#xD;
      bikes, and strength training using weight-bearing exercises. Each research node will be&#xD;
      composed of the clinical center and the sports facilities available in the town/neighborhood.&#xD;
      Research nodes will be randomized into two experimental interventions: i.) conventional&#xD;
      medical treatment, and ii.) conventional medical treatment + exercise training. After verbal&#xD;
      and written information about the study and related potential risks, all patients fulfilling&#xD;
      inclusion criteria will be included after giving written informed consent. At baseline, and&#xD;
      after 12 and 24 months, annual healthcare costs will be obtained from the volunteers'&#xD;
      clinical records. In addition, at baseline, and after 4, 12, and 24 months, metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome components prevalence, metabolic syndrome z-score, body composition, and&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness will be tested.&#xD;
