  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) is a chronic, autoimmune and inflammatory disease&#xD;
      of the central nervous system that begins before the age of 18 years. POMS patients are&#xD;
      affected in terms of physical capacity, cognitive status and fatigue compared with their&#xD;
      healthy peers that has been reported. It has been reported that although individuals with MS&#xD;
      with low disability levels do not have respiratory complaints, respiratory parameters may be&#xD;
      affected. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate respiratory capacity, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength and fatigue levels of POMS patients. Evaluations will help prevent future&#xD;
      complications by detecting any existing problems early.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      People with pediatric onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) may experience sensory, motor,&#xD;
      cerebellar and cognitive dysfunctions due to the destruction of the central nervous system.&#xD;
      These disorders can cause decrease in physical capacity, increase in cognitive symptoms and&#xD;
      fatigue level in patients with POMS. There is no study in the literature examining the&#xD;
      relationship between respiratory capacity and respiratory muscle strength with fatigue in&#xD;
      POMS patients. The aim of this study is to compare POMS patients and healthy controls in&#xD;
      terms of respiratory capacity, respiratory muscle strength and fatigue. All participants's&#xD;
      respiratory function will be evaluated with &quot;Minispir Light Spirometer&quot;, respiratory muscle&#xD;
      strength with &quot;MD Diagnostics RP Check&quot; and fatigue with Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory&#xD;
      (PedsQL)-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale. Evaluations will not be repeated after a certain&#xD;
      interval.As a result of the comparison of both groups, it will be determined whether POMS&#xD;
      patients have difficulties or not.&#xD;

    <description>The Minispir Light Spirometer will be used to assess the respiratory function of the participants. Before starting the spirometric test, how to do the test will be explained. Before starting the test, the participant will be asked to sit with their back straight and put on the nose clip provided. Then the participant will take the disposable bacterial filter mouthpiece between his lips and hold it tightly. The person will be asked to take a few normal breaths followed by as deep a breath as possible and instructed to exhale forcefully and quickly without waiting. The test will be terminated by instructing the participant to take a deep breath after exhaling for at least six seconds. If the participant will coughs or cannot breathe deeply enough during the test, the test will terminated and the test will repeated after 20 minutes of rest. The FEV1/FVC ratio with the highest value from three consecutive correctly performed tests will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of Respiratory Muscle Strength</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of respiratory muscle strength will be done with the &quot;MD Diagnostics RP Check&quot; device in accordance with the guidelines of the American Thoracic Society (ATD) and the European Respiratory Society (ASD). The maximum expiratory pressure (MEP) and maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) of each participant will be measured. Before starting the test, it will be explained how to do the test. During the assessment, the participant will be asked to sit with his back straight and put on the nose clip provided. Then, for the MEP evaluation, the patient will be asked to take a deep breath and blow the whole breath forcefully into the device with a disposable bacteria filter mouthpiece. For the MIP evaluation, the patient will be asked to breathe strongly through the device with a disposable bacteria filter mouthpiece after exhaling the whole breath. Appropriate breaks will be given between assessments. Three correctly performed attempts for MEP and MIP measurements will be recorded.</description>

    <measure>Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)-Multidimensional Fatigue Scale is a valid and reliable scale for assessing fatigue in the pediatric population. This 18-item symptom-focused scale evaluates 3 areas of fatigue (general, sleep/rest, and cognitive). Each question is scored on a 5-point Likert system (0=Never, 1=Almost never, 2=Sometimes, 3=Frequently, 4=Always), and high scores indicate higher levels of fatigue. In our study, both the child form and the family form of the scale will be used.</description>
