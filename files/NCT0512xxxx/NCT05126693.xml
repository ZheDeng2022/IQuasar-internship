      This study investigates the effect of integrated Botulinum Neurotoxin A (BoNT) treatment on&#xD;
      morphologic muscle and tendon properties, spasticity, joint stiffness, joint range of motion,&#xD;
      muscle strength, gait and gross motor function. The integrated BoNT treatment combines&#xD;
      BoNT-injections with serial casting and intensive physical therapy, as previously described&#xD;
      by Molenaers et al. The current study will include 30 children who are clinically scheduled&#xD;
      for BoNT treatment in the medial gastrocnemius and/or the semitendinosus muscle in the&#xD;
      intervention group and 30 children in a control group who will receive usual care within a&#xD;
      time span of 3 months.&#xD;

      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the effect of integrated Botulinum Neurotoxin A (BoNT) treatment on&#xD;
      morphologic muscle and tendon properties (muscle length and muscle volume, assessed with a 3D&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement), spasticity and joint stiffness (measured with an instrumented&#xD;
      spasticity assessment), joint range of motion (measured through goniometry), muscle strength&#xD;
      (measured using dynamometry), gait (assessed through 3D gait analysis) and gross motor&#xD;
      function (assessed using clinical test batteries). The aim is twofold: (1) determine whether&#xD;
      integrated BoNT treatment of the medial gastrocnemius and the semitendinosus muscle(s) leads&#xD;
      to changes in the morphologic muscle and tendon properties of the medial gastrocnemius and&#xD;
      the semitendinosus muscle(s), the ankle and knee range of motion, spasticity, stiffness,&#xD;
      muscle strength and gait, and (2) determine the correlation between baseline morphologic&#xD;
      muscle and tendon properties and the changes in the primary outcome parameters (spasticity&#xD;
      and stiffness) following the BoNT-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study has a non-randomized controlled design. Because BoNT is proven an effective&#xD;
      treatment to reduce spasticity and improve gross motor function, it cannot be clinically&#xD;
      justified to allocate children to a non-treatment group, if a new BoNT treatment is required.&#xD;
      Delayed BoNT treatment could rapidly increase musculoskeletal impairments. It is therefore&#xD;
      considered unethical to temporarily withdraw BoNT treatment from patients. To compensate the&#xD;
      lack of randomization accurate matching of groups is required. Children will be matched on&#xD;
      diagnosis (uni/bilateral CP), GMFCS level, age and spasticity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BoNT-treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children in the intervention group will receive BoNT injections in the medial&#xD;
      gastrocnemius and/or the semitendinosus muscle(s) (other muscles may also be treated as part&#xD;
      of multilevel treatment). As part of the standard integrated treatment approach of the CP&#xD;
      Reference Centre of the University Hospitals Leuven, the injections are followed by a period&#xD;
      of bilateral stretching casts if indicated (below the knee walking casts and removable knee&#xD;
      extension casts when necessary) and all children will receive intensive physical therapy and&#xD;
      application of orthotic management following BoNT injections. The follow-up period for the&#xD;
      current study is 8-10 weeks. During this intensive physical therapy post-BoNT, the children&#xD;
      in the intervention group will work on individualized treatment goals. These goals will be&#xD;
      defined based on the baseline measurements during a multidisciplinary discussion with the&#xD;
      treating physician, which is scheduled prior to the BoNT treatment. The fulfillment of these&#xD;
      patient-specific goals will be evaluated by the Goal Attainment Score (GAS). During the&#xD;
      follow-up period, the treating physical therapist will be interviewed on a two-weekly basis&#xD;
      to verify whether and to what extend the therapy is focused on the personal treatment goals.&#xD;
      Assessments of morphologic muscle and tendon properties, spasticity, stiffness, joint range&#xD;
      of motion, muscle strength, and gait of the participants will be performed before the BoNT&#xD;
      injections, and 8-10 weeks after the injection. This period of 8-10 weeks follow-up post BoNT&#xD;
      injections was found to be appropriate, since the potential effect of BoNT on gross motor&#xD;
      function is expected to be optimal after 6-10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include patients who are diagnosed with spastic CP, aged between 4 and 11&#xD;
      years and with Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level I-III. The&#xD;
      intervention and control group will be group-matched based on diagnosis (uni/lateral CP),&#xD;
      GMFCS level, age and spasticity level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall exclusion criteria were: BoNT injections less than 6 months before inclusion, a&#xD;
      treatment history that includes previous selective dorsal rhizotomy treatment or a bony&#xD;
      surgery less than 2 years before inclusion, and limited cooperation that would prevent a&#xD;
      proper assessment. For all enrolled children, intensive rehabilitation post BoNT injections&#xD;
      had to be foreseen as the standard care. For the intervention group, 30 children with a&#xD;
      clinical indication for BoNT injections in the medial gastrocnemius and/or semitendinosus&#xD;
      muscle(s) will be recruited, while for the control group, 30 children without an indication&#xD;
      for a specific intervention in the next 3 months will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the intervention group, the baseline measures will be followed by the BoNT injections&#xD;
      combined with casting and goal-oriented physical therapy (as described above), and the&#xD;
      follow-up assessments will be planned 8-10 weeks post BoNT injections. Baseline and follow-up&#xD;
      assessments for the intervention groups include 3D ultrasound, the instrumented spasticity&#xD;
      measurement, functional strength tests, and 3D gait analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The children in the control group will also be assessed twice with an interval of 8-10 weeks.&#xD;
      During the 8-10 weeks, they will continue their usual care or normal routine treatment, i.e.&#xD;
      regular physiotherapy and orthotic devices. Baseline and follow-up assessments for the&#xD;
      control group include 3D ultrasound, the instrumented spasticity measurement and functional&#xD;
      strength tests.&#xD;
