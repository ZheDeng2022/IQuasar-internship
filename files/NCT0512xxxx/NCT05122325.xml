  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women with spinal cord injury frequently experience sexual dysfunction such as disturbances&#xD;
      during arousal and an increased time to orgasm. However, little evidence has been found on&#xD;
      its therapeutic approach and low adherence. To verify the effectiveness of two interventions:&#xD;
      the application of genital vibration and transcutaneous stimulation of the tibial nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized clinical trial. 54 women will be recruited who suffer from sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The allocation will be randomly assign to the three groups: an intervention group 1&#xD;
      transcutaneous electrostimulation of tibial nerve (n = 18), an intervention group 2 genital&#xD;
      vibration (n = &quot;18) and a control group (n = 18). The treatment time will be 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Treatment adherence, as well as treatment effectiveness, will be evaluated through the Female&#xD;
      Sexual Function Index, the &quot;Sexual Quality of Life-Female&quot; questionnaire, quantitative&#xD;
      sensory tests and the improvement reported by the patient in arousal and orgasm. Evaluations&#xD;
      will be carried out before treatment, at the end of the treatment, and at 3 and 6 months&#xD;
      after the end of treatment.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The &quot;Index of female sexual function (IFSF)&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This questionnaire showed validity, internal consistency in all its domains, specifically Cronbach's Alpha 0.745 in arousal and 0.753 in orgasm and test-retest reliability of ICC 0.96. This questionnaire consists of 19 questions and is grouped into six domains. The score for each domain is multiplied by a factor and the final result is the arithmetic sum of the domains. The higher the score, the better sexuality.</description>

    <measure>Sexual Quality of Life-Female (SQOL-F)</measure>
    <time_frame>5 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>SQOL-F showed good validity and reliability. The questionnaire was developed to measure the impact of sexual disorders on quality of life. This questionnaire consists of 18 questions with a response scale of 6 options. The quality of sexual life will be considered poor if the score is between 18-51, moderate between 51-84 and good if it is greater than 84.</description>

Inicially, frequency between 2-3 Hz, so that when the current passes, a contraction-relaxation will cause the first toe movement visually evident (excitomotor threshold).&#xD;
Once verified, the frequency is raised to what has been established between 10Hz and there the intensity is increased without having to now reach the excitomotor threshold, as long as the physiotherapist notice it is enough (it must be tolerable).</description>
