  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The MI-CARE trial tests 12 months of telephone-based nurse care management for patients with&#xD;
      depressive symptoms who take or have taken opioids at some time. The study tests whether&#xD;
      offering nurse support to the patient and their primary care team that addresses these things&#xD;
      and related issues can improve patients' health and well-being. Eligible subjects are&#xD;
      identified automatically using health system data and randomly assigned 50:50 to either a&#xD;
      no-contact usual care arm or to the arm offered the MI-CARE program.&#xD;

    <description>This study evaluates whether offering nurse collaborative care management for 12 months by telephone or video can improve depression-related symptoms, increase access to evidence-based medication treatment for opioid use problems, as well as decreasing adverse health events. Participants randomized to the nurse support arm can work with the nurse at no cost for up to 12 months via phone or video visits.&#xD;
The nurse asks questions about stress, mood, worry, pain, sleep, and medication and substance use; participants choose what to focus on. The nurse meets weekly with clinical consultants who may recommend treatment options, tailored to the patient. The participant and their regular provider(s) can discuss the options and decide which to try. The nurse and primary care provider can then help the patient access selected options. The nurse can also offer behavioral activation to help build skills to increase day-to-day positive adaptive experiences and support broader treatment gains.</description>
