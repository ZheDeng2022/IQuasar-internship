    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of experimental mouthwash&#xD;
      formulations compared to a hydroalcohol control mouthwash and a positive control mouthwash&#xD;
      for the reduction of gingivitis and plaque when used as an adjunct to tooth brushing during a&#xD;
      twelve-week product usage period.&#xD;

    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed by the MGI on the buccal and lingual marginal gingivae and interdental papillae of all scorable teeth where 0=normal (absence of inflammation), 1=mild inflammation (slight change in color, little change in texture) of any portion of the entire gingival unit; 2= mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit; 3= moderate inflammation (moderate glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy) of the gingival unit; 4= severe inflammation (marked redness and edema/hypertrophy, spontaneous bleeding, or ulceration) of the gingival unit.</description>

    <measure>Whole-Mouth Mean Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index (EBI) Score at 1, 4 and 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding will be assessed according to the EBI, 168 Sites. A periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 6 gingival areas (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual, mid-lingual, and mesiolingual) around each tooth will be assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit will be recorded according to the following scale: 0=absence of bleeding after 30 seconds; 1=bleeding after 30 seconds; 2=immediate bleeding.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Bleeding Sites, Based on the EBI Score at 1, 4 and 12 Weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>1, 4 and 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of bleeding sites will be calculated by taking the total number of sites with bleeding score greater than 0 divided by the total number of sites assessed for each participant. Bleeding will be assessed according to the Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index, 168 Sites. A periodontal probe with a 0.5mm diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium.
