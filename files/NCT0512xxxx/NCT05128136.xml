  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of this study is to assess different external diameters of intravaginal rings&#xD;
      (IVRs) for adherence, preference, and acceptability. To assess these domains, women in&#xD;
      male-partnered relationships will use three different size IVRs. As such, women must be&#xD;
      enrolled to conduct this research study.&#xD;

    <masking_description>We propose a randomized, open-label, parallel group, 3-way crossover study comparing adherence, preference and overall acceptability of 3 different-sized placebo IVRs (IVRs A, B and C) in 24 couples. At enrollment, each woman will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequences of IVR use (A-B-C, A-C-B, etc.) and will use each of the 3 IVRs (A, B and C) for 30d per IVR (90d total).</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>To determine which of 3 non-medicated IVRs each used continuously for 30 days yields the highest adherence as measured by the proportion of women who are adherent to instructions for IVR use for each for ~30 days continuously, based on daily text messages</description>

    <measure>Preference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>To assess which of 3 non-medicated IVRs each used continuously for 30 days is preferred by women and their male partners based on self reported preference by completing a questionnaire during and by the end of the study. Women and male partners will be asked to state their preference for one of the 3 IVRs at the end of the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will be asked to respond to a questionnaire measuring domains of acceptability at the end of using each of the 3 IVRs. Acceptability will be measured by the IVR acceptability measurement tool (IAMT). We will also explore the association between demographics, previous contraceptive use, parity, sexual/vaginal practices, and menses on acceptability. We will compare preferences between women and their male partners and we will compare actual preference at the end of the study with assumed preferences at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Collection of Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>To evaluate and compare the safety of 3 nonmedicated silicone IVRs each used and continuously for 30 days as measured by the number and percent of participants with AEs and serious AEs. AEs will be summarized overall by severity and by relation to product use. AEs that are potentially related could be abrasion or erythema due to the device.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>To explore patterns of adherence based on frequency of removals and expulsions per IVR and overall; duration of removals and expulsions per IVR and overall; reasons for removals for each IVR and overall; activities associated with expulsions per IVR and overall; and association between demographics and other background characteristics, sexual activity, and menstruation on adherence to each IVR and overall.</description>

    <description>The study design is a randomized, open-label, parallel group 3-way crossover study comparing adherence, preference and overall acceptability of 3 different-sized placebo IVRs (IVRs A, B and C) in 24 US couples. At enrollment, each couple will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 sequences of IVR use: A-B-C, A-C-B, B-A-C, B-C-A, C-A-B or C-B-A. Each couple will use each of the 3 IVRs (IVRs A, B and C) for 30 days per IVR, 90 days total.</description>
