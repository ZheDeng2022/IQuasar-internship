  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, single-arm, phase 2 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      anlotinib hydrochloride plus everolimus in patients with advanced non clear renal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma as first-line treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase II trial in non-clear renal cell carcinoma patients. The purpose&#xD;
      of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anlotinib hydrochloride combined with&#xD;
      everolimus in patients with no systematic treatment advanced non clear renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective: Overall Response Rate(ORR)(according to RECIST version 1.1). The&#xD;
      second objectives: progression free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR), Overall&#xD;
      Survival(OS) and safety.&#xD;

    <description>ORR was defined as the percentage of participants in the analysis population who experienced a Complete Response (CR; disappearance of all target lesions) or a Partial Response (PR; at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions) and was assessed using RECIST 1.1 based on investigator evaluation.</description>

  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression free survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The PFS time is defined as time from randomization to locoregional or systemic recurrence, second malignancy or death due to any cause; censored observations will be the last date of: &quot;death&quot;, &quot;last tumor assessment&quot;, &quot;last follow up date&quot; or &quot;last date in drug log&quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>up to approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. For participants still alive at the time of analysis, OS time was censored on last date that participants were known to be alive.</description>
