  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with leg amputations often experience daily changes in the size (volume) of their&#xD;
      residual limb. These daily changes can cause a prosthesis to fit poorly. They can also cause&#xD;
      limb problems like pain or skin breakdown. Prosthetic socket systems that accommodate limb&#xD;
      volume changes can help address these issues, but they require users to make adjustments&#xD;
      throughout the day. The aim of this research is to create a system that will automatically&#xD;
      adjust the fit of the socket and create a well-fitting prosthesis for people with leg&#xD;
      amputations who experience volume fluctuations when using their prosthesis.&#xD;

    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Participant's limb fluid volume will be measured during the structured in-lab protocol (Aim 2), and changes will be compared against an initial reference point of activity during which no interventions will take place.</description>

    <intervention_name>Auto Adjusting Prosthesis</intervention_name>
    <description>Participants will test the auto adjusting prosthesis. The prosthesis will be able to move up to 3 panels built into the socket walls to expand or tighten the socket's fit. The auto adjustments will take place during periods of sitting, standing, or walking. Manual adjustments will also be possible either via the researcher controlling the prosthesis or via the key fob developed in the first aim.</description>
