  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our primary objective is identifying the degree of self-perceived competence in medical&#xD;
      students without clinical rotations during the COVID-19 pandemic to know how prepared the&#xD;
      students could be when they are professionals because they lack clinical skills in front of&#xD;
      an actual patient and can be affected to be accepted in hospitals because they will have to&#xD;
      acquire a phase of training later. Without a clinical rotation, one can be deprived of the&#xD;
      essential educational value.The study design is an observational cross-section study in which&#xD;
      an anonymous survey will be shared online on Google Forms platform. Students will be asked&#xD;
      for their participation; after obtaining verbal and consent, the survey will be distributed&#xD;
      using social media groups such as foundation school groups. For this study, the Spanish&#xD;
      version of the Self-Perceived Competence scale will be used (REF). This scale is comprised of&#xD;
      21 questions divided into five factors that assess: 1) demonstration of the essential&#xD;
      clinical skills, 2) demonstration of clinical reasoning, decision making, and problem-solving&#xD;
      skills, 3) management of life-threatening medical conditions, 4) management of common medical&#xD;
      problems and 5) placing patients' needs and safety at the center of the care process. Each&#xD;
      item has a Likert scale answers of 4 options ranging from &quot;incompetent (1)&quot;, &quot;somewhat&#xD;
      incompetent (2)&quot;, &quot;somewhat.&#xD;
