      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of an intervention called Nutrition and Exercise for Wellness and Recovery&#xD;
      (NEW-R) in promoting healthy eating and increased physical activity for better weight&#xD;
      management among psychiatric outpatients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Weight management is a serious issue for individuals with mental health conditions,&#xD;
      especially those who are taking psychiatric medications. The latest estimates are that over&#xD;
      half of individuals receiving community mental health services are overweight or obese. This&#xD;
      project's objective is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of&#xD;
      an intervention called Nutrition and Exercise for Wellness and Recovery (NEW-R) in promoting&#xD;
      healthy eating and increased physical activity for better weight management among psychiatric&#xD;
      outpatients living and working in the community. It is an 8-week, recovery-oriented&#xD;
      intervention that is co-led by a trained health educator and a certified mental health peer&#xD;
      specialist. The study will take place at the UIC Department of Psychiatry in Chicago.&#xD;
      Research participants will be recruited from the Department's outpatient clinics and other&#xD;
      community programs, and randomly assigned to receive NEW-R along with services as usual or&#xD;
      services as usual alone.&#xD;
