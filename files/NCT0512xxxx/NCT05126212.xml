  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nowadays in France, the standards of hospital rooms are being questioned in view of the&#xD;
      particularities of certain populations admitted to hospitals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot; Groupement de Coopération Sanitaire des Hôpitaux Universitaires du Grand Ouest &quot; (GCS&#xD;
      HUGO) proposes to improve the quality of geriatric care through the modernisation of hospital&#xD;
      rooms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GCS HUGO has launched a project to co-design a hospital room adapted to the elderly,&#xD;
      called &quot;Hospi'Senior&quot;, with the help of the &quot;Dependency and Old Age&quot; steering committee. This&#xD;
      committee is made up of experts from HUGO and partner companies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hospi'Senior room is composed of innovative technologies concerning bed equipment (e.g.&#xD;
      bed canopy), autonomous (e.g. lifeline) and assisted mobility (e.g. rail lift system),&#xD;
      lighting (e.g. light guide), communication (touch tablet) and social space (furniture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project consists in evaluating the user experience (UX) of :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients hospitalized in the Hospi'Senior room,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  informal caregivers of patients hospitalized in the Hospi'Senior room,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  caregivers who have worked in the Hospi'Senior room.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specificities of Hospi'Senior room are multiple and concern in particular :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The equipment of the bed :to create a more personalized room: presence of a bed canopy,&#xD;
           orientation of the bed towards the windows, presence of a multifunctional space at the&#xD;
           head of the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The autonomous mobility of the patient by facilitating the movements and by preserving&#xD;
           the orientation in time of the patient: ephemeris for the temporal orientation, lifeline&#xD;
           and sliding door.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregiver-assisted mobility to facilitate patient movements: lifting rail above the bed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lighting to ensure safe movement, especially during the night: light guide, room light,&#xD;
           window mirrors, bathroom lighting.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The digital interface with a touch tablet to improve the occupational and communication&#xD;
           aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The socialization space to welcome visitors in the room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: A visit to the room is made to each participant (patients, informal caregivers,&#xD;
      caregivers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: no change in care or support for users during hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: UX assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients: collected at the end of the hospitalization,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informal caregivers: collected at the end of the patient's stay,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Caregivers: collected after 3 months of using the Hospi'Senior room.&#xD;
