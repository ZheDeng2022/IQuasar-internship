  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Occupational sexual harassment (HS) has come to the fore in recent years, particularly with&#xD;
      the #MeToo social movement that has encouraged women victims of sexual violence to speak out&#xD;
      around the world. The medical profession is not exempt from this phenomenon, whether during&#xD;
      the training or professional life of practitioners. In France, very little data is available&#xD;
      on this subject, particularly among general practitioners. However, the specific nature of&#xD;
      the doctor-patient relationship in general practice makes it a potentially high-risk setting.&#xD;
      Furthermore, practitioners' experiences of inappropriate sexual behaviour (ISB) can lead to&#xD;
      changes in professional practice, and can thus directly influence the quality of care&#xD;
      provided to patients. It is also described in the literature that sexual harassment in&#xD;
      physicians is independently associated with a decrease in job satisfaction and sense of&#xD;
      security at work, and may be associated with an altered mental health status. To date, the&#xD;
      only French studies on ISB and HS in medicine have focused on the period of medical study,&#xD;
      and none have looked at the particular problem of the patient as perpetrator of the violence.&#xD;
      It is in this context that it has been decided to set up this cross-sectional study with the&#xD;
      aim of evaluating the prevalence of ISB occurring during consultations with French general&#xD;
      practitioners, to describe their characteristics and to evaluate the responses provided and&#xD;
      the repercussions on professional practice.&#xD;
