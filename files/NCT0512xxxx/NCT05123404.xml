  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) is one of the most common and expensive human malignancies to manage.&#xD;
      Most BCs are urothelial cell carcinomas (UCCs), and histologically stratified into cancers&#xD;
      with low and high grade. The latter are subdivided into those with and without muscle&#xD;
      invasion.(1) Non-muscle-invasive BCs (NMIBCs) are often low grade and have an indolent&#xD;
      natural history. Muscle-invasive BCs (MIBCs) are aggressive tumors with an ominous prognosis.&#xD;
      (2) Non-muscle invasive bladder cancer is treated with transurethral resection of bladder&#xD;
      tumor with or without adjuvant intravesical chemotherapy or photodynamic therapy, whereas&#xD;
      muscle-invasive bladder cancer is treated with radical cystectomy, radiation therapy,&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or a combination(3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer staging is accomplished by the combination of clinical (examination),&#xD;
      pathologic (transurethral resection of bladder tumor specimens), and radiologic means. The&#xD;
      quality of the transurethral resection of bladder tumors often varies among surgeons, and it&#xD;
      may miss muscle infiltration in up to 25% of invasive cancers. (4) Radiological examination&#xD;
      looks for second urinary tract malignancies (5% of BCs may have an upper tract UCC) or other&#xD;
      pathologies. Most guidelines suggest cross-sectional imaging for MIBCs and high-grade NMI&#xD;
      cancers, due to the risks of invasion and regional or distant metastases, and upper urinary&#xD;
      tract involvement. (5) MRI is currently the best imaging technique for bladder cancer local&#xD;
      regional staging because of its superior soft tissue contrast, lack of ionizing radiation, in&#xD;
      addition, it clearly differentiates the layer of bladder wall and enables accurate assessment&#xD;
      of tumor depth invasion in bladder wall and extra-vesical extension. (6) During the past few&#xD;
      years, important improvements in MRI technology have been achieved and led to the&#xD;
      introduction of Multiparametric MRI (mp MRI) which combines functional sequences as diffusion&#xD;
      weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MR) with anatomic T1 and T2&#xD;
      weighted images (T1 and T2WI), that improves the accuracy of tumor detection and staging,&#xD;
      helps to monitor post-therapy response and identify local disease recurrence. (7) Recently&#xD;
      also standardized approach for imaging and reporting mp-MRI for bladder cancer was created by&#xD;
      developing VI-RADS score (Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System). This aims to&#xD;
      standardize bladder mpMRI for clinical and research applications to create a systematic&#xD;
      approach for reporting bladder mp-MRI and defining the risk of muscle invasion (NMIBC versus&#xD;
      MIBC). (8) The Final VI-RADS score is generated using all categories and suggests the&#xD;
      probability of muscle invasion ,It's graded from VIRADS 1 (muscle invasion is highly&#xD;
      unlikely) to VI-RADS 5 (ivasion of muscle and beyond the bladder is very likely) (9) In our&#xD;
      study we aim to evaluate role of Multiparametric MRI in differentiation between invasive and&#xD;
      non-invasive bladder cancer and accuracy of vesical imaging reporting and data system&#xD;
      (VI-RADS) score.&#xD;

&#xD;
      To evaluate the accuracy of Multiparametric MRI in differentiation between invasive and&#xD;
      non-invasive bladder cancer using vesical imaging reporting and data system (VI-RADS) score.&#xD;
