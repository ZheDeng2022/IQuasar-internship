    <textblock>
      This is a first in human, phase I/II open-label, dose-finding, safety, and proof-of-concept&#xD;
      clinical trial of T3P-Y058-739, a genetically-modified, live attenuated strain of the&#xD;
      bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica, in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study, which has a modular design with up to 6 parts, anticipates enrolling approximately&#xD;
      100 participants. Part A will open first. Part B and subsequent parts will open later. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate T3P-Y058-739 monotherapy given by intratumoural (IT) injection (Part A)&#xD;
      and by intravenous (IV) infusion (Part B). In addition, either IT or IV T3P-Y058-739 (route&#xD;
      of administration to be chosen based on emerging data) will be evaluated in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. All patients will receive low doses of desferrioxamine (which provides iron in&#xD;
      a form that can be used by the bacteria) to support bacterial survival and growth. All&#xD;
      patients will receive antibiotics on completion of therapy to eradicate any residual&#xD;
      T3P-Y058-739.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients, all parts of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically- or cytologically-proven advanced, solid tumour that cannot be removed&#xD;
             surgically and for which there is no curative therapy and no alternative therapy is&#xD;
             felt to be appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. At least one measurable lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Male or female, 18 years of age or older at the time of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Estimated life expectancy of ≥12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Resolution of all acute reversible toxic effects of prior therapy or surgical&#xD;
             procedure to baseline or Grade ≤1 (except alopecia).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate iron stores (defined as serum ferritin &gt;100 ng/mL and transferrin saturation&#xD;
             [TSAT] &gt;20%) without significant iron overload (defined as serum ferritin &lt; 800&#xD;
             ng/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Capable of giving signed informed consent which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the informed consent form (ICF).&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. At least one lesion that is measurable according to iRECIST/RECIST 1.1 and amenable to&#xD;
             direct IT injection, i.e., a lesion that is visible, palpable, or detectable by&#xD;
             ultrasound, and accessible for direct IT injection (injection via an endoscope is not&#xD;
             allowed for Part A at least; ultrasound and/or radiological guidance is allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients, all parts of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of&#xD;
             results. Patients curatively treated more than 2 years prior to enrolment, and&#xD;
             patients with adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ, are generally eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Known central nervous system (CNS) metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have previously received an allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell&#xD;
             transplant or with congenital or acquired immunodeficiency or receiving&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy (including any dose of systemic corticosteroids). Patients&#xD;
             should have recovered immunologically from any prior immunomodulatory therapies such&#xD;
             as CD20-targeted antibodies. Patients receiving inhaled corticosteroids for asthma or&#xD;
             chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and patients on steroid replacement therapy&#xD;
             (e.g. due to prior adrenalectomy or hypophysectomy) are eligible at the investigator's&#xD;
             discretion. Patients likely to require immunosuppressive treatment with systemic&#xD;
             steroids or other agent (e.g., patients with frequent exacerbations of asthma) should&#xD;
             not enter the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with active uncontrolled infection or known to be serologically positive for&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection. Patients&#xD;
             with recent major infection (such as pneumonia in the previous 4 weeks) should have&#xD;
             recovered to preillness levels with resolution of reversible infection-related&#xD;
             symptoms for at least one week prior to starting T3P.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a documented Yersinia infection in the 12 weeks prior to treatment or&#xD;
             with detectable Y. enterocolitica in a baseline stool sample (based on routine culture&#xD;
             at site).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients who have recently received antibiotics that could affect the viability of T3P&#xD;
             (at least 5 half-lives should have elapsed since the last dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients with known cardiac valvular disease or arterial aneurysms, artificial heart&#xD;
             valves and other implanted prostheses (such as joint replacements) that cannot be&#xD;
             easily removed or replaced. Patients with central venous access devices are allowed in&#xD;
             the study but T3P should be administered by peripheral vein, whenever possible.&#xD;
             Patients with a history of bacterial endocarditis, regardless of the organism, are&#xD;
             excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with a history of clinically significant autoimmune conditions, major cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia or ischaemia, New York Heart Association class III/ IV cardiac failure or&#xD;
             coronary angioplasty in the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients who are allergic to chloramphenicol or to all of the following antibiotics:&#xD;
             co-trimoxazole, doxycycline, ceftriaxone and cefotaxime.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with a bleeding diathesis or receiving therapeutic doses of anticoagulants&#xD;
             unless the lesion(s) to be injected are superficial and at low risk of bleeding.&#xD;
             Patients receiving lower doses of anticoagulants, aspirin or clopidogrel may be&#xD;
             eligible at the investigator's discretion, depending on the site of lesions to be&#xD;
             injected and perceived risk of bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Previous severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with Check Point Inhibitor&#xD;
             (CPI) or other monoclonal antibody.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of severe immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) for greater than 12 weeks.&#xD;
             CPI-related AEs (including irAEs) must have resolved back to Grade 0-1 and patients&#xD;
             received no corticosteroids for irAEs for at least two weeks prior to first dose of&#xD;
             pembrolizumab in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. History of interstitial lung disease or prior pneumonitis requiring systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroid therapy. In case of uncertainty, a high-resolution computed tomography&#xD;
             (HRCT) should be performed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients at high risk of bowel perforation, history of acute diverticulitis,&#xD;
             intra-abdominal abscess or abdominal carcinomatosis).&#xD;
