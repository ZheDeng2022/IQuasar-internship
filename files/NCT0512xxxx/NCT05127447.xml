      The aim of this study is to investigate effects of external electric stimulating in&#xD;
      individuals with urinary incontinence after prostatectomy.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is common in men after prostotectomy, and patients' quality of life&#xD;
      is adversely affected. In addition, electric stimulation (ES) can be played an important role&#xD;
      in the management of UI . However, there are limitations in clearly demonstrating the effects&#xD;
      of ES on men with UI after prostatectomy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pad Test</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>A 1-hour pad test will be applied. Beginning with an empty bladder, a pre-weighed sanitary napkin will be inserted into the underwear. The patient will be asked to drink 500 ml of water within 15 minutes and then remain active for half an hour. Then, various activities will be made to the patient to provoke involuntary urine leakage with a full bladder. weight will be measured.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>UI symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ICIQ_SF is a UI questionnaire that evaluates symptom type and severity. It consists of 6 questions in total and the total score is 3., 4., 5. It is obtained by adding the scores they get from the questions</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Life quality</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Life quality will be assessed with King's Health Questionnaire (KHQ).This questionnaire consists of two parts and 32 items.. The minimum possible score is 0 (best health) and the maximum possible score is 100 (worst health).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sexual Function</measure>
    <time_frame>change from baseline at 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of sexual functions will be evaluated with International Index of Erectile Function IIEF-5 (IIEF-5), which is one of the most commonly used forms in men presenting with sexual complaints. It includes 5 main topics; erectile function, orgasm function, sexual desire, sexual intercourse satisfaction and general satisfaction are questioned with a total of 5 questions. Each question gets a score between 0-5. Total score; severe (5-7), moderate (8-11), mild-moderate (12-16), mild (17-21), no erectile dysfunction (22-25).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Subjective Improvement Perception</measure>
    <time_frame>after treatment (8th week)</time_frame>
    <description>The subjective improvement of UI symptoms pf the patients after treatment was evaluated using a 4-item Likert-type scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Evaluation of Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>after treatment (8th week)</time_frame>
    <description>After the 8-week treatment program, the patients' satisfaction with the treatment for UI was evaluated using a 5-item Likert-type scale.</description>

    <description>External neuromuscular electrical stimulation was applied to the patients in supine position. It was applied for 30 minutes 3 days a week for 8 weeks. This stimulation consists of a total of eight external electrodes, including 2 sheaths wrapped around the thigh area and 4 electrodes for each leg. Electrodes were placed on the anterior and posterior proximal thighs, buttocks, and outside of the hips. The treatment protocol was applied with symmetrical biphasic current at a frequency of 50 Hertz (Hz), with stimulation and rest periods of 5 seconds of contraction and 5 seconds of rest.</description>

    <description>In the Sham group, for 45 minutes, 2 days a week, a vacuum electrode was connected from combined vacuum electrotherapy device over the pelvis and thigh, and only vacuum was applied while the patient was in the supine position, and no current was given from the applied device.</description>
