  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty patients were enrolled, and all patients used total intravenous anesthesia&#xD;
      (remifentanil-propofol based total intravenous analgesia) as anesthesia induction and&#xD;
      maintenance. According to the preliminary data of this department, patients who underwent&#xD;
      intracranial surgery for skull pin fixation used remifentanil 5.0-6.0 ng/ml, while the&#xD;
      hemodynamics is relatively stable. Therefore, when this plan is implemented, the patient&#xD;
      needs to be under the same depth of anesthesia (monitored by electroencephalography,&#xD;
      maintaining a value of 40-60), first start with remifentanil 6.0 ng/ml, and use the up and&#xD;
      down method as adjust 0.5 ng/ml of concentration of remifentanil each time. An Analgesia&#xD;
      Nociception Index(ANI) lower than 30 and hyperdynamics (the increased heart rate(HR) and mean&#xD;
      blood pressure(MBP) up 20% of baseline or HR&gt;100bpm and arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure(ABP)&gt;180/100mmHg) indicates insufficient analgesia, therefore increase it by 0.5&#xD;
      ng/ml; an ANI higher than 30 and stable hemodynamics (the changes of HR and MBP within 20% of&#xD;
      baseline or HR&lt;50bpm and ABP&lt;90/50mmHg) indicates that analgesia is acceptable, and the next&#xD;
      patient will decrease it by 0.5 ng/ml during skull pin fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: Heart Rate, Measure blood pressure, Analgesia Nociception Index, Bispectral&#xD;
      index, concentrations of propofol and remifentanil before 2 mins, during, 5, and 15 mins of&#xD;
      skull pin fixation were recorded and analyzed.&#xD;
