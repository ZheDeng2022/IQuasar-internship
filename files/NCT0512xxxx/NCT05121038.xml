    <description>FOLFIRINOX is a name for a chemotherapy treatment regimen that includes several different drugs that are given in a certain order.&#xD;
All of these drugs are given as an intravenous (IV) infusion (through a needle in a vein) at the clinic once every 14 days (or Day 1 of every 14-day cycle).&#xD;
Oxaliplatin - dose is 85 mg / m2 the infusion takes about 2 hours. then&#xD;
Leucovorin - dose is 400 mg / m2 - this is given at same time with irinotecan (below) and the infusion takes about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
Irinotecan - dose is 180 mg / m2 - this is given at same time with leucovorin (above), and the infusion takes about 1.5 hours.&#xD;
then&#xD;
â€¢ Fluorouracil - dose is 2400 mg / m2 - this infusion takes 46 to 48 hours (2 days) with an IV pump done at home.</description>
