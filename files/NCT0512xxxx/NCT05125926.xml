  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase Ⅰ trial in healthy adults aged&#xD;
      18 years and older, intended to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity&#xD;
      profile of LYB001. The study vaccine will be administered IM at upper arm deltoid as a&#xD;
      three-dose regimen with 28d interval on day 0, 28, 56.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure the safety of the participants, the phase Ⅰ trial was will be carried out in a&#xD;
      dose-escalation and age-sequential enrolment manner:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity will be firstly evaluated in a cohort of&#xD;
           adults aged 18-59 years randomly assigned (4:1) either to receive low-dose (25µg) LYB001&#xD;
           or placebo. After confirmation of an favorable 7-day safety, reactogenicity profile in&#xD;
           this cohort by investigator, the study was able to proceed to the cohort of adults aged&#xD;
           18-59 years receiving high-dose (50µg) LYB001 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. After completing a favorable 7-day safety observation following the first dose of 50μg&#xD;
           LYB001 in cohorts aged 18-59 years, the study was able to advance to cohorts aged ≥ 60&#xD;
           years receiving low-dose (25µg) LYB001 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By analogy, all dose and age-stratified groups will be sequentially enrolled. The study will&#xD;
      be ended after all participants completed 360-day safety observation following the 3rd dose&#xD;
      of vaccination.&#xD;
