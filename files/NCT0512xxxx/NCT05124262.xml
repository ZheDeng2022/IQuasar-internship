  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel disease (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that affects 10% of&#xD;
      the population. Comorbidities are common and fatigue is the most common extraintestinal&#xD;
      complaint in IBS patients. There are no cure for the disease but there are nutrition&#xD;
      treatments that can relieve symptoms. The main goal of this randomized controlled trial is to&#xD;
      test the hypothesis that low-Fermentable- oligo-di- monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs)&#xD;
      diet kan decrease gastrointestinal symptoms and improve quality of life and fatigue in&#xD;
      patients with IBS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by&#xD;
      stomach pain at least one day a week accompanied by change in stool frequency or appearance.&#xD;
      Prevalence of IBS is about 10 % of the population worldwide and more common in women. IBS is&#xD;
      divided into different subclasses: diarrhea predominant, (IBS-D), predominant constipation,&#xD;
      (IBS-C), mixed bowel habits, (IBS-M). Comorbidities are common and fatigue is the most common&#xD;
      extraintestinal complaint among the patients. Patients has severely reduced quality of life,&#xD;
      reduced work capacity and the cost are substantial for the patients and the society. IBS&#xD;
      canÂ´t be cured but the symptoms can be relieved by pharmacological as well as&#xD;
      non-pharmacological treatment as psychological- and nutritional treatment. The main goal of&#xD;
      this randomized controlled trial is to test the hypothesis that low FODMAPdiet kan decrease&#xD;
      gastrointestinal symptoms and improve quality of life and fatigue in patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FODMAPs is an acronym for Fermentable-Oligo-Di-Monosaccharides and Polyols. FODMAPs are&#xD;
      carbohydrates that can't be absorbed/splinted in the large intestine and they ferment rapidly&#xD;
      and exacerbate gastrointestinal symptoms as flatulence, pain, bloating and loose stools. In&#xD;
      total 120 patients with IBS-D and IBS-M will be randomized to immediate treatment start or&#xD;
      delayed treatment start. The treatment will be performed in clinical setting, led by a&#xD;
      dietitian and in group format including 12 patients in each group. The intervention time is&#xD;
      12 weeks with 5 group visits at a gastroenterology unit. The low-FODMAP treatment is divided&#xD;
      into three steps: elimination of FODMAPs, re-introduction and personalization of the diet.&#xD;
      Compliance to the diet will be measured by monitoring the FODMAP intake from three day food&#xD;
      diaries and a compliance form. Questionnaires will be self reported in a web based&#xD;
      application. Food diaries and the stomach diary will be filled out at baseline, at week 5, 12&#xD;
      and 6, 12 and 24 months post intervention.&#xD;
