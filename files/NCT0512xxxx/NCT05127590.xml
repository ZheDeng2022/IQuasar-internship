  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      RBN-2397 inhibits PARP7, an enzyme that is switched on by cancer stresses, such as the toxins&#xD;
      in cigarette smoke. Cancer cells use PARP7 to hide from the immune system by stopping the&#xD;
      cell from sending a signal (Type 1 interferon) that tells the immune system that something is&#xD;
      wrong and to kill the cell. RBN-2397 has been shown in animal and human studies to inhibit&#xD;
      tumor growth and also shuts down the &quot;don't kill me&quot; signal the tumor is sending to evade the&#xD;
      immune system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if RBN-2397 in combination with pembrolizumab (a&#xD;
      PD-1 inhibitor) has the ability to restore the response to treatment in patients with SCCL&#xD;
      that have been previously treated with a PD-1/PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) inhibitor and have had a&#xD;
      response followed by disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 1b portion of the study will assess the safety of RBN-2397 in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) and define the dose of RBN-2397 to be used in combination&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab for the Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2 portion of the study will assess the anti-tumor activity of RBN-2397 in&#xD;
      combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multicenter Phase 1b/2 single arm study that will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and antitumor activity of RBN-2397 in combination with pembrolizumab in patients with&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the lung who have received prior&#xD;
      therapy. The study consists of a Phase 1b Safety Run in and Phase 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the Phase 1b Safety Run-in, approximately 10 patients will be enrolled in a 3+3&#xD;
      fashion and treated with continuous oral dosing with RBN-2397 twice daily (BID) in&#xD;
      combination with the fixed approved dose of intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab every 3 weeks&#xD;
      [Q3W]) to establish RP2D of RBN-2397 in combination with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 2, approximately 40 patients will be treated with continuous oral dosing with&#xD;
      the RP2D of RBN-2397 BID in combination with the fixed approved dose of IV pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both the Phase 1b Safety Run in and Phase 2, a treatment cycle is defined as 21 days. On&#xD;
      Day 1 of each treatment cycle, RBN-2397 will be administered orally and followed by IV&#xD;
      infusion of pembrolizumab at the fixed approved dose according to the approved local product&#xD;
      label. During the remaining days of the 21-day treatment cycle, only RBN-2397 BID will be&#xD;
      administered. Treatment cycles will continue until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      treatment-related toxicity, or withdrawal of consent&#xD;

         15. s on chronic systemic steroids (e.g., &gt; 10 mg daily prednisolone or steroid equivalent&#xD;
             for &gt; 6 months). Subjects with asthma that require intermittent use of&#xD;
             bronchodilators, inhaled steroids, or local steroid injections would not be excluded&#xD;
             from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has an active systemic infection requiring therapy (e.g.: bacterial, fungal, viral).&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has known active Hepatitis B or C. Active Hepatitis B is defined as a known positive&#xD;
             HBsAg result. Active Hepatitis C is defined by a known positive Hepatitis C Antibody&#xD;
             result and known quantitative hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (RNA) results greater&#xD;
             than the lower limits of detection of the assay.&#xD;

             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Has interstitial lung disease or a history of pneumonitis that required oral or&#xD;
             intravenous steroids to assist with management. Lymphangitic spread of the NSCLC is&#xD;
             not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Is pregnant or breastfeeding or expecting to conceive or father children while on&#xD;
             study medication and for the required duration of contraception after the last dose of&#xD;
             study medication.&#xD;

             Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Grade ≥2 resulting from prior cancer therapies&#xD;
             (except alopecia, peripheral neuropathy and ototoxicity, which are excluded if ≥ Grade&#xD;
             3).&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Has had, within the past 6 months, the occurrence of one or more of the following&#xD;
             events: cerebrovascular accident, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, hemorrhage&#xD;
             (CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), chronic liver disease (meeting criteria for Child Pugh Class B&#xD;
             or C), organ transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Has, within 2 weeks prior to Day 1, received systemic therapeutic doses of&#xD;
             corticosteroids (e.g., &gt; 10 mg daily prednisolone or steroid equivalent). Topical,&#xD;
             inhaled, nasal and ophthalmic steroids are allowed for short term treatment of acute&#xD;
             conditions (e.g.: asthma, poison ivy contact dermatitis); for other immunosuppressive&#xD;
             agents, the exclusionary dose and duration will be determined in consultation with the&#xD;
             Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Has any other medical or personal condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may potentially compromise the safety or compliance of the patient, or may preclude&#xD;
             the patient's successful completion of the clinical study.&#xD;
