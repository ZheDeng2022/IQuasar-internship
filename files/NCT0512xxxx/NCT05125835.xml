  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Periodontal disease is a chronic condition affecting the teeth and surrounding support&#xD;
      structures, characterized by tooth loss and alveolar bone loss. Sanative therapy (ST) is the&#xD;
      gold standard non-surgical treatment for periodontal disease and involves mechanically&#xD;
      removing the subgingival bacteria from the periodontal pockets. Regular periodontal&#xD;
      maintenance appointments are needed to maintain periodontal health after ST. Moreover, the&#xD;
      periodontal health of individuals not requiring ST is also dependent on regular hygiene&#xD;
      appointments. Due to Ontario's March 2020 COVID-19-related clinic closure for approximately 3&#xD;
      months along with a reduced numbers of appointments available due to guidelines of&#xD;
      professional bodies and public health beyond this period of time, many appointments were&#xD;
      considerably delayed or cancelled. The effects of this disruption to periodontal health in&#xD;
      male and female patients who have undergone ST and continue with maintenance appointments or&#xD;
      who attend for regular hygiene appointments have not yet been investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sanative therapy (ST) is often the first line of treatment following a diagnosis of&#xD;
      periodontal disease. By mechanically removing the inflammation-inducing bacteria below the&#xD;
      gum line, a more controlled state of periodontal health can be achieved. Improvements in&#xD;
      periodontal health achieved through ST can be maintained long-term with regular maintenance&#xD;
      appointments that aid in preventing further progression of the disease. However, due to the&#xD;
      government-mandated clinic closure in March 2020 of dental offices for all but emergency&#xD;
      in-person care in Canada due to the COVID-19 pandemic, clinics were shut down for&#xD;
      approximately 3 months with a reduced availability of appointments in the following year due&#xD;
      to professional guidelines. Regular hygiene appointments (cleanings) were also considerably&#xD;
      delayed or cancelled. This disruption in routine care, accompanied with the potential&#xD;
      exacerbation of various risk factors for periodontal disease such as stress, diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, and smoking or alcohol use brought on by the pandemic has not yet been investigated&#xD;
      pertaining to the effect on clinical periodontal outcomes. The main objective of this study&#xD;
      is to determine if delays in regularly scheduled maintenance or regular hygiene appointments&#xD;
      caused by COVID-19 impacted clinical periodontal outcomes in male and female patients.&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include retrospectively determining the long-term clinical outcomes of&#xD;
      patients who underwent periodontal therapy or who have had regular hygiene appointments at&#xD;
      the clinic; comparing the long-term periodontal outcomes of patients who undergo maintenance&#xD;
      appointments and those who receive only regular hygiene appointments; and examining whether&#xD;
      there exists a sex-specific response to either treatment. Periodontal outcomes of interest&#xD;
      include probing depth, bleeding on probing, plaque index, and tooth loss.&#xD;
