  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate and compare the 2-year clinical performance of resin&#xD;
      composite restorations in class II cavities with deep sub-gingival margins relocated using&#xD;
      three different glass ionomer based restorative materials and flowable composite, based on&#xD;
      FDI criteria.&#xD;

      The description of the experimental design followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting&#xD;
      Trials (CONSORT) statement. The present study was a double-blinded (patients and examiner)&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial anticipating the parallel design. One hundred and twenty adult&#xD;
      patients seeking dental treatment in Operative Department clinic at Faculty of Dentistry,&#xD;
      University of Mansoura were enrolled in the current study with a total of 120 Class II&#xD;
      restorations. No advertisement was made for participant recruitment, forming a sample of&#xD;
      convenience. Each patient much sign a consent form before participating in the current study.&#xD;
      The study was conducted from January 2020 to January 2022 as a part of Doctoral dissertation.&#xD;
      Mansoura University institution's ethics committee approved the form and protocol before&#xD;
      conducting the study. The sample size was calculated based on the clinical success rate (100%&#xD;
      success rate at 2 years) of posterior class II restorations restored with open sandwich and&#xD;
      deep margin elevation techniques observed in previous studies. According to several&#xD;
      parameters including a significance level of 5%, the power of the test was calculated to be&#xD;
      80%, and equivalent limit of 15%. Upon these data, a sample size of 120 subjects was&#xD;
      appropriate. Allowing for a 20% drop-out, sample size was set totalizing 120 subjects.&#xD;
