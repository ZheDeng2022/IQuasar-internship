  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lateral epicondylitis (LE), also known as tennis elbow, has an estimated prevalence in the&#xD;
      general population of 1% to 3%, peaking at age 45 years to 54 years and affect both men and&#xD;
      women equally. A randomised controlled trial published in The Lancet showed that 83% of the&#xD;
      patients suffering from LE of more than 6 weeks duration on wait-and-see policy recovered&#xD;
      only after 1 year without any therapeutic interventions. The costs associated with LE is&#xD;
      substantial as patients not only incur hefty healthcare costs but also lose their&#xD;
      productivity owing to their long recovery period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is a paucity of evidence worldwide for the efficacy of PRP injections&#xD;
      compared to control in LE. This randomised controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of&#xD;
      PRP versus placebo (saline) injections in adults with LE.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pathogenesis of LE was initially believed to be a generalised inflammatory process.&#xD;
      However, in 1979, the pathology was better understood as invading immature fibroblasts&#xD;
      disorganizing the normal collagen architecture of the elbow, associated with immature&#xD;
      vascular responses to cellular repair. There is a variety of treatment modalities available&#xD;
      for LE, varying from watchful waiting without any therapeutic interventions, pharmaceutical&#xD;
      methods such as prescribing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy such as&#xD;
      encouraging bracing and exercise, injections, and surgical modalities once non-surgical&#xD;
      options fail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many years, injection with glucocorticoids has remained the mainstay of treatment.&#xD;
      However, several studies have proven that the effects of corticosteroid injections do not&#xD;
      seem to last in the long-term, amongst which a trial published in The Lancet showed that&#xD;
      long-term differences at 52 weeks between injections and physiotherapy was significantly in&#xD;
      favour of physiotherapy. Recently, many studies worldwide have demonstrated that&#xD;
      platelet-rich-plasma (PRP) stimulates cartilage repair by actively secreting growth factors&#xD;
      which activate cell proliferation and differentiation thereby promoting tissue regeneration.&#xD;
      It has been postulated that PRP stimulates repair mechanisms within tendons and hence promote&#xD;
      tendon healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is a paucity of evidence worldwide for the efficacy of PRP injections compared&#xD;
      to control in LE. Currently, PRP treatment is not formally recognized as a treatment modality&#xD;
      for LE in Singapore, with the accepted indications for PRP treatment being limited to&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment of acute muscle and ligamentous injuries, and the biological&#xD;
      augmentation of acute Achilles tendon repairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised controlled trial aims to compare the efficacy of PRP versus placebo (saline)&#xD;
      injections in adults with LE.&#xD;
