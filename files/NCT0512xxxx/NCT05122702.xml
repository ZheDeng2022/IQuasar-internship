  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Macular edema (ME) is caused by hyperpermeability of retinal vessels and/or decreased efflux&#xD;
      of fluid across the retinal pigment epithelium induced by outer/inner blood-retinal barrier&#xD;
      dysfunction (BRB). It is most commonly seen following many diseases such as diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM), intraocular surgery, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, and posterior segment&#xD;
      inflammatory disease. An estimated 11% of patients with DM develop diabetic macular edema&#xD;
      (DME). While the overall prevalence of DME among patients with DM aged 20 to 79 years is&#xD;
      approximately 7.5%, the risk increases over time. Currently, there is no cure for ME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chinese medicine (CM) is widely used to manage ME in China and other East Asian countries.&#xD;
      Among them, Shenling Baizhu San (SBS) is one of the most commonly used formulae. In this&#xD;
      proposal, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter clinical trial will be&#xD;
      undertaken to evaluate the efficacy and safety of modified SBS (mSBS) developed by the&#xD;
      project team for the treatment of ME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be recruited and assigned randomly to receive orally mSBS or placebo&#xD;
      twice a day for 12 consecutive weeks, with follow-up for another 4 weeks after stopping the&#xD;
      treatment to observe the duration of efficacy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Macular edema (ME) is characterized by hyperpermeability of retinal vessels and/or decreased&#xD;
      efflux of fluid across the retinal pigment epithelium, and the condition can be induced by&#xD;
      outer/inner blood-retinal barrier dysfunction (BRB). It is most commonly seen following a&#xD;
      number of local and systemic diseases and procedures such as diabetes, intraocular surgery,&#xD;
      uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, posterior segment inflammatory disease, and cataract&#xD;
      surgery. Pathologically, ME is characterized by a retinal thickening in the macular area due&#xD;
      to the breakdown of the BRB. ME patients often suffer from blurred vision, dark spots, and&#xD;
      deformation, which can seriously affect their central vision, and in severe case, can lead to&#xD;
      blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, ME treatment options include intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
      (VEGF) agents, intravitreal long-acting steroid, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,&#xD;
      corticosteroids, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, and subthreshold macular laser. Although the&#xD;
      above treatment options have made great progress, the possible side effects of the&#xD;
      potentially toxic pharmaceutical agents should be always alert by clinician. A stepwise&#xD;
      therapeutic approach is a challenge for the management of ME arises in the chronic and&#xD;
      persistent case. Additionally, surgical management should be considered for unremitting cases&#xD;
      of ME. Side effects such as scotomas, corresponding to the laser burns, have been frequently&#xD;
      noticed by the patients following photocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no cure for ME in conventional medicine. Chinese medicine (CM) is&#xD;
      becoming popular for managing ME in China and other East Asian countries. Several research&#xD;
      groups worldwide have previously conducted clinical studies to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Chinese herbal medicines for the treatment of ME in recent decades. This study is of an&#xD;
      innovative Chinese herbal formula modified from a famous ancient formula for the treatment of&#xD;
      macular edema. The goal of this treatment modality is to reduce the accumulation of&#xD;
      intraretinal fluid, thus leading to improved visual acuity. Among different Chinese herbal&#xD;
      formulae for ME, Shenling Baizhu San (SBS), which was originally described &quot;Formulas from the&#xD;
      Imperial Pharmacy&quot; (Taiping Huiming Hejiju Fang in Chinese), has been reported have good&#xD;
      efficacy in the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will use an innovative Chinese herbal formula modified from a famous ancient&#xD;
      formula for the treatment of ME. This clinical study will be able to provide robust clinical&#xD;
      evidence on the efficacy and safety of mSBS for ME. Subjects will be recruited and assigned&#xD;
      to receive orally mSBS or placebo twice a day for 12 weeks, with follow-up for another 4&#xD;
      weeks after stopping the treatment to observe the duration of efficacy.&#xD;
