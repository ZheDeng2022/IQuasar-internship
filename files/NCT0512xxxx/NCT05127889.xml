    <textblock>
      White spot lesions (WSLs), defined as &quot;white opacity,&quot; occur as a result of subsurface enamel&#xD;
      demineralization that is located on smooth surfaces of teeth. The reason of the white&#xD;
      appearance is the changes in light-scattering optical properties of the decalcified enamel.&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to compare the remineralizing ability of Self-assembling&#xD;
      peptide P11-4, 2% Arginine Enriched Sodium Fluoride and Functionalized Tri Calcium Phosphate&#xD;
      Fluoride varnishes&#xD;

&#xD;
           Materials used in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Self-assembling-peptide (P11-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluoride varnish with TCP5%&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  L-Arginine Sodium Fluoride Varnish&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All interventions will be performed by the primary investigator as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • The dental plaque deposit has to be removed before the assessment. Dental prophylaxis&#xD;
           will be performed with a bristle brush and non-fluoridated prophylactic paste during the&#xD;
           initial clinical examination and before any examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  photographic assessment by digital camera and color change( E) readings by digital&#xD;
                spectrophotometer ( VITA Easy shade) will be performed at 0 , 3 months, 6 months&#xD;
                and 9 months throughout the study period for all the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  During the photographic assessment, all the photographs will be taken with digital&#xD;
                camera, Macro lens configuration will be used, the image quality will be set as&#xD;
                fine and ISO sensitivity 200. All images will be saved as Joint Photographic&#xD;
                Experts Group (JPEG) files suitable for manipulation with the image analysis&#xD;
                software.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient's confidentiality will be respected through the photographic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After digital images captured, they will be downloaded and stored as JPEG. Then the&#xD;
                images will be analyzed, and compared with baseline images by Abode Photoshop and&#xD;
                Auto CAD&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The enamel color of each WSL will be measured using the spectrophotometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All measurements will be performed under standardized ambient conditions to ensure&#xD;
                accuracy and reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Three images will be randomly captured for each lesion and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 1 (Self assembling peptide P11-4) Prior to application of the test material the&#xD;
           following will be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Test lesions will be wiped with NaOCl to remove pellicle,&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Etched for 20 s with 35% H3PO4 Etching Gel to remove mineral deposits on the tooth&#xD;
                surface and rinsed with water in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The lesions will be dried and isolated with cotton rolls.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The varnish will be applied and left undisturbed for 5minutes (till disappearance)&#xD;
                to allow diffusion of self-assembly.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2 (Arginine Enriched Sodium fluoride group) Preparation and application of the&#xD;
           varnish as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • The Arginine powder will be suspended at 2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • A 10 mL of 5% sodium fluoride varnish tube dispensed in a sterile container.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • 200 mg of Arginine will be vigorously mixed with the varnish matrix for 60 sec using a&#xD;
           sterile microbrush.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • After dryness of the white spot lesion, the prepared varnish will be applied evenly&#xD;
           using the micro brush.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • After application the patient will be instructed to avoid rinsing, eating soft diet&#xD;
           and avoid hot drinks for 2 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 3 (Tri Calcium Phosphate fluoride) the material will be applied according to the&#xD;
           manufacturing instructions as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To limit undesirable oral ingestion, the appropriate dose for the patient will be&#xD;
                determined with the help of the dosing guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The varnish will be mixed with the brush to avoid separation of the material during&#xD;
                storage&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  However, to guarantee the best results suction will be used during application of&#xD;
                the varnish.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A thin uniform layer of the varnish will be applied on the lesion surface by using&#xD;
                the supplied brush&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The applicator brush won't be moved through accumulated saliva to prevent premature&#xD;
                setting on the bristles.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  After application the patient will be instructed to close his mouth, avoid rinsing,&#xD;
                eating soft diet and avoid hot drinks for 4 hrs.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All patients will be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene through regular brushing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients will be recalled for further applications after 3 and 6 months (20) and for&#xD;
           WSLs assessment after 3, 6, 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Photographic assessment and color change reading outcomes will be assessed by two other&#xD;
           blinded calibrated examiners at the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Baseline 2. 3-month evaluation 3. 6-month evaluation 4. 9-month evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Photographic assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be determined, from photographs for all the patients in relation to WSLs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The area of the labial surface of the tooth&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WSL area&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The area of WSL to area of the labial surface of the tooth ratio percent (Percent of&#xD;
           WSL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The percentage of WSL ratio related to initial condition at the measured time (Relative&#xD;
           Percent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The percentage of decrease in WSL ratio due to time (Percent Decrease)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The decrease in the WSL area related to the initial condition (Relative Decrease) Color&#xD;
           change readings&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The values of L* (differences in lightness munsell system ranging from O (black) to&#xD;
                100 (white)), a* (green-red coordinate), and b* (blue yellow coordinate) will be&#xD;
                recorded for the WSL and the adjacent sound enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Color change, will be calculated as the color difference between the treated and&#xD;
                untreated enamel.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participant timeline The study interventions are expected to be conducted from 2021&#xD;
