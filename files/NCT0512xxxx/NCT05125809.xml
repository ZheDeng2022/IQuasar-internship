  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the study are to identify a dose(s) of setrusumab based on safety&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) effects in participants with OI and to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      setrusumab vs placebo on reduction in total fracture rate.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in Cohort A will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive setrusumab (low or high dose) or&#xD;
      placebo. Participants will continue receiving their assigned dose of setrusumab until the&#xD;
      phase 3 dose is determined. After the phase 3 dose(s) of setrusumab has been selected, all&#xD;
      Cohort A participants will be included in the Phase 3 period of the study in a blinded&#xD;
      manner. Participants who received setrusumab during the Phase 2 period will transition to the&#xD;
      selected dose(s) of setrusumab, and participants in the placebo group will continue receiving&#xD;
      placebo in the Phase 3 period. Participants in Cohort B will be randomized 2:1 to receive&#xD;
      setrusumab (at the dose[s] selected in the primary analysis of Phase 2 period) or placebo.&#xD;
      Treatment assignments will remain blinded throughout the study. Participants will transition&#xD;
      to an open-label Treatment Extension Period after the Phase 3 primary analysis is complete,&#xD;
      or once a participant has completed 24 months of treatment in the double-blind period,&#xD;
      whichever is sooner.&#xD;
