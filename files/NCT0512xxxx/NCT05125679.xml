  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of guselkumab on coronary flow reserve&#xD;
      (CFR), measured by transthoracic doppler-echocardiography, in participants with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe psoriasis and intermediate cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a common chronic inflammatory disease that affects 2 percent (%)-3% of the&#xD;
      population and has an impact on physical and emotional health-related quality-of-life that is&#xD;
      comparable to major illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and depression. Guselkumab is a&#xD;
      fully human immunoglobulin G1 lambda monoclonal antibody that binds to the p19 protein&#xD;
      subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) with high specificity and affinity. Binding of&#xD;
      guselkumab to the IL-23 p19 subunit blocks the binding of extracellular IL-23 to the cell&#xD;
      surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL-23 specific intracellular signaling and subsequent&#xD;
      cytokine production. Guselkumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque&#xD;
      psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. This study aims to investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy of guselkumab in reducing surrogate parameters of vascular dysfunction and&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk. This study will consist of two Screening Visits (Screening Visit S1 at a&#xD;
      maximum of 2 weeks prior to Screening Visit S2, to occur at a minimum of 2 weeks and maximum&#xD;
      of 4 weeks prior to Week 0), a Treatment Phase (up to 28 weeks), Final Efficacy Visit 4 weeks&#xD;
      later (Week 32), and Final Safety Visit (Week 40). The efficacy assessments will be done&#xD;
      locally at the sites and safety will be monitored by assessment of adverse events, clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests, physical examinations, vital signs, and concomitant medication review. The&#xD;
      total duration of the study will be 40 weeks.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) at Week 32</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 32</time_frame>
    <description>CFR describes the ability of coronary blood flow to increase substantially when required by metabolic demands, which may be up to 4 to 5 times greater during normal exercise compared to resting, and even greater with administration of pharmacological agents. CFR assessment is conducted via transthoracic ultrasound of the coronary vasculature and provides an integrated measure of flow through both the large epicardial arteries and the coronary microcirculation.</description>
