      Dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and anti-tumor activity of single&#xD;
      agent IMU-935 in patients with progressive, metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer&#xD;
      (mCRPC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 dose escalation, followed by dose expansion,&#xD;
      study to define the safety, tolerability, biomarker change and anti-tumor activity of IMU-935&#xD;
      in patients with mCRPC. Throughout the study, safety, anti-tumor activity, biomarkers and&#xD;
      IMU-935 plasma concentrations will be evaluated at regular intervals as per schedule of&#xD;
      assessments. Disease progression will be assessed as per standard medical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation and expansion parts of the study will have the same treatment duration&#xD;
      with similarly structured treatment cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of the following periods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Period: Approximately 28 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main treatment over 3 cycles of 28 days each, extended treatment as long as patient benefits&#xD;
