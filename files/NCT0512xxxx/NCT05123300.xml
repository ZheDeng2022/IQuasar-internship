    <textblock>
      Early and correct diagnostic staging is paramount to keep patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      prostate cancer in the correct treatment tract to avoid under- and overdiagnosis in prostate&#xD;
      cancer staging. With accurate staging, the investigators aim to save patients from side&#xD;
      effects of insufficient or too extensive treatment. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      precise staging will lead to optimized individualized treatment and subsequently to prolonged&#xD;
      survival and increased quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate cancer is a very heterogeneous disease varying from indolent tumors to aggressive&#xD;
      cancer types. About one-fifth of patients with newly detected high- or intermediate-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer present with bone metastases and their 3-years survival is less than 50%.&#xD;
      Precise staging is required for planning relevant treatment that has the potential to&#xD;
      increase survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in prostate cancer cells and&#xD;
      can serve as a target for precise diagnosis and staging. PSMA-positron emission&#xD;
      tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) has shown to be more accurate than traditional&#xD;
      imaging, but there is a need for prospective trials analyzing the impact of primary staging&#xD;
      with PSMA-PET/CT on treatment planning and patient benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective multicenter study, the investigators plan to include 448 patients and&#xD;
      randomize 1:1 to either traditional imaging or PSMA-PET/CT. The investigators aim to analyze&#xD;
      whether PSMA-PET/CT increases progression-free survival and quality of life. Further, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to validate the accuracy of primary staging with PSMA-PET/CT compared with&#xD;
      conventional imaging.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project shall reveal whether primary staging with up-to-date imaging benefits&#xD;
      prostate cancer (PCa) patients in terms of yielding prolonged progression-free survival and&#xD;
      increased quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned in a collaborative effort between five centers in the Region of Southern&#xD;
      Denmark and the Central Denmark Region. The Department of Nuclear Medicine at Odense&#xD;
      University Hospital is the hosting department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective multicenter randomized design is planned. We expect to include 448 patients&#xD;
      with newly diagnosed PCa of high or intermediate risk. Eligible patients will be randomized&#xD;
      1:1 into an interventional arm using PSMA-PET/CT and a control arm using conventional&#xD;
      imaging. In a relevant subgroup, the investigators will also analyze the added value of&#xD;
      performing PSMA-PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRi).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that PSMA-PET/CT will lead to prolonged progression-free&#xD;
      survival and increased quality of life when used for staging patients with intermediate and&#xD;
      high-risk primary prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the most frequent cancer form in men, and approximately 4,500 new&#xD;
      cases are reported each year in Denmark. The course of disease ranges from slow-growing&#xD;
      tumors localized to the prostate gland itself to aggressive, rapidly disseminating variants.&#xD;
      Aggressive variants of the disease can be disseminated initially, e.g. to lymph nodes or&#xD;
      bone. The overall 5-year survival is as high as 87% for the broad group of PCa patients, but&#xD;
      for patients diagnosed with bone metastases initially, the prognosis is poor with a 3-year&#xD;
      survival of 62%. It is currently widely debated whether these patients should be managed&#xD;
      using systemic therapies or aggressive local and metastases-directed therapies. Early and&#xD;
      correct staging is paramount to get this closer, hence aiming to avoid under- and&#xD;
      overtreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Curatively intended surgery or radiation treatment is the initial intervention for patients&#xD;
      with localized disease, while androgen deprivation or chemotherapy is recommended for&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease in current guidelines. As regards the primary staging of&#xD;
      PCa, the guidelines recommend traditional imaging, including bone scan (BS) and contrast&#xD;
      enhanced CT (CECT), and these are rather inaccurate. BS reflects bone metabolism and has a&#xD;
      reported sensitivity as well as specificity of 80%. An emerging modality also reflecting bone&#xD;
      metabolism is the 18Fluoride(18F)-sodium fluoride(NaF)-PET/CT, but this method has not proven&#xD;
      any added value compared with BS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The transmembrane protein, PSMA, is expressed in abundance on the surface of prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells, and this has become a unique target for accurate diagnosis and is already implemented&#xD;
      for imaging in recurrent PCa. The PSMA ligands are labeled with positron-emitting isotopes&#xD;
      such as 18F and 68Gallium(68Ga) for imaging. The 18F isotope is advantageous regarding&#xD;
      availability and production, and the 18F-labeled ligand, PSMA-1007, is only sparsely excreted&#xD;
      in the urinary tract, making diagnostics in the pelvic region favorable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnostic accuracy studies performed in the primary PCa setting have been published&#xD;
      recently. A retrospective Danish study of 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT in the so-far largest cohort of&#xD;
      691 patients with newly diagnosed high-risk prostate cancer shows that about one-third of the&#xD;
      patients present with advanced disease with lymph node or bone metastases. High specificity&#xD;
      (96.5%) but low sensitivity (30.6%) was found for the diagnosis of pelvic lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis. It has also recently been shown in a well-designed randomized prospective trial&#xD;
      that 68Ga-PSMA-PET/CT had a 27% greater accuracy than conventional imaging with CECT and BS.&#xD;
      High accuracy is also supported by the results from a recent retrospective study of the&#xD;
      favorable 18F-PSMA-1007-PET/CT, which showed sensitivity for lymph node metastasis of 85.9%&#xD;
      and a specificity of 99.5% in a setting of patients with predominantly primary PCa. So, when&#xD;
      would it be time to implement PSMA-PET/CT for staging patients with primary PCa? The European&#xD;
      guidelines report that it could be tempting to replace BS and CECT by more accurate tests&#xD;
      such as PSMA-PET/CT in patients undergoing initial PCa staging. They are concerned, however,&#xD;
      that the clinical benefit of detecting metastases at an earlier time-point is undetermined.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is argued that results from randomized controlled trials evaluating the&#xD;
      management and outcome of patients by state-of-the-art diagnostic methods should be awaited&#xD;
      before a decision can be made to treat patients based on the results of these tests. However,&#xD;
      the investigators are not aware of any other current studies running or being planned to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of replacing traditional imaging with up-to-date PSMA-PET/CT on patient&#xD;
      outcomes such as survival and quality-of-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this project is to analyze the impact on survival and quality of life of&#xD;
      using PSMA-PET/CT for PCa primary staging compared with conventional imaging. In a randomized&#xD;
      design the investigators will compare 18F-PSMA-1007 PET/CT (interventional imaging) with CECT&#xD;
      and NaF-PET/CT (conventional imaging) as regards progression-free survival and quality of&#xD;
      life. In subgroup analyses, the investigators aim to analyze the accuracy of 18F-PSMA-PET/CT&#xD;
      compared with conventional imaging and the added value of 18F-PSMA-PET/MRi for local staging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment strategies will be planned and registered in multidisciplinary team conferences&#xD;
      based on the results of the scans and according to current guidelines. The strategies will be&#xD;
      categorized into radical prostatectomy, curatively intended radiotherapy, palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy, androgen deprivation therapy, chemotherapy, and metastases-directed therapy.&#xD;
      These treatment options can be used separately or combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoL changes will be considered clinically relevant for an 8-point decline in global&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P). Other QoL analyses include the&#xD;
      group difference in repeated measurement analyses, making use of data collected at baselinie&#xD;
      and 2 time points the first year after diagnoses and later at specific time points, and these&#xD;
      will be conducted using the European Quality of life - 5 Dimensions - 5 Levels (EQ-5D-5L) and&#xD;
      Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-26 (EPIC-26) (internationally accepted and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires translated into danish).&#xD;
