  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and efficacy of twice-daily ARD-101 in obese&#xD;
      subjects with a body mass index (BMI) of 30-45 kg/m2.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, placebo-controlled study to investigate the effects of&#xD;
      ARD-101, a small molecule targeting bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs), in obese subjects with a&#xD;
      body mass index (BMI) of 30-45 kg/m2. This study has a planned enrollment of 30 subjects and&#xD;
      will be conducted in a single center in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a Screening Period (up to 28 days), a Treatment Period (28 days),&#xD;
      and a Follow-up Period (End-of-Study Visit within 14 days after receiving the last dose of&#xD;
      ARD-101). The screening procedures will be initiated upon completion of the informed consent&#xD;
      process. Following completion of screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility,&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled to receive ARD-101 in an outpatient setting and will be instructed&#xD;
      to visit the clinical center periodically for safety and efficacy assessments.&#xD;

The numerical value will start at 1.0 cm and end 10.0 cm. Use a ruler to determine the numerical value (to the tenth decimal) associated with the line marked by subjects. Higher score indicates less control of eating and food cravings.</description>
