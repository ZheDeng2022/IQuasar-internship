  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to determine whether the study drug, EDP1815, is safe&#xD;
      and effective in the treatment of atopic dermatitis compared with placebo. The study will&#xD;
      look at different doses of the study drug, and whether there are differences when the drug is&#xD;
      given once daily or twice daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is a very common type of skin disease. It typically causes&#xD;
      red, dry, and itchy skin and may have a significant impact on quality of life. Rashes may&#xD;
      appear on the arms and behind the knees, or anywhere else on the body. While there are&#xD;
      existing therapies, there is currently no cure for atopic dermatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, Phase 2 study to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of EDP1815 in adult participants 18 to ≤75 years of age with&#xD;
      mild, moderate, and severe atopic dermatitis (AD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened within 28 days prior to the first dose of study intervention to&#xD;
      confirm study eligibility. Subjects must have mild, moderate, or severe AD involving at least&#xD;
      5% Body Surface Area (BSA); an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 2, 3, or 4; and&#xD;
      an Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI) of at least 6 at screening and Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants must agree to use a background therapy (per protocol) twice daily for at&#xD;
      least 14 days prior to Day 1 in order to be considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 300 participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three treatment&#xD;
      cohorts, in which they will receive either EDP1815 or matching placebo in a 3:1 ratio, and&#xD;
      therefore each participant has a 75% chance of receiving study treatment. Randomization will&#xD;
      be stratified by baseline disease severity (mild [IGA = 2], moderate [IGA = 3] or severe [IGA&#xD;
      = 4] AD). The investigational product will be administered either once or twice daily for 16&#xD;
      weeks. Background emollient (moisturizer) therapy must continue at least twice daily for the&#xD;
      duration of the treatment and follow-up periods. Topical rescue therapy is allowed during the&#xD;
      treatment period per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint is achievement of an EASI-50 response at Week 16. Secondary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints will look at EASI, IGA, BSA, SCORAD, DLQI, Pruritus-NRS, Sleep&#xD;
      Disturbance-NRS, POEM, and the need for rescue therapy at Weeks 4, 8, 12 and 16 (unless&#xD;
      otherwise specified in the protocol). Safety and efficacy assessments will be conducted at&#xD;
      the investigator site by a clinical assessor blinded to treatment assignment. Scheduled&#xD;
      clinic study visits for all subjects will occur at Screening, Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8,&#xD;
      Week 12, Week 16 (end of treatment) and Week 20 (post-treatment follow-up). Participants&#xD;
      discontinuing early from the study will undergo a 28-day follow-up period, where possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 16-week study treatment, qualified participants completing the study will&#xD;
      have the option to enter an open label study.&#xD;
