  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of individually planned therapeutic procedures,&#xD;
      using, among others, the concept of EMG biofeedback, to improve the general functional state,&#xD;
      selected motor activities, stimulation and strength of specific muscle syndromes as well as&#xD;
      postural parameters in children, adolescents and adults with neuromuscular diseases.&#xD;

    <description>Motor Function Measure Scale Each MFM32 item is scored on a 4-point Likert scale from 0 (cannot initiate the task) to 3 (performs the task fully). Item scores are summed, and the raw score is transformed to an overall total score ranging from 0 (severe functional impairment) to 100 (no functional impairment).</description>

    <measure>Hammersmith Functional Motor Scale Expanded</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It contains 33 items which are scored on a scale of 0, 1, 2 with a total achievable score of 66.&#xD;
Score 2 = performs without modification/adaptation/compensation Score 1 = performs with modification/adaptation/compensation Score 0 = unable to perform A total score can be achieved by summing the scores for all the individual items. The total score can range from 0, if all the activities are failed, to 66, if all the activities are achieved.</description>

    <measure>North Star Ambulatory Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, after 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>17-item rating scale that is used to measure functional motor abilities in ambulant children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.&#xD;
The activities are graded as follows:&#xD;
2 - &quot;Normal&quot; - no obvious modification of activity&#xD;
1 - Modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another 0 - Unable to achieve independently This scale is ordinal with 34 as the maximum score indicating fully-independent function.</description>
