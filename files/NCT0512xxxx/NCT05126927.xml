      Primary objective To investigate the safety and tolerability profile of 68Ga- NODAGA-SNA006&#xD;
      in patients with solid tumors; To investigate the radiation absorbed dose characteristics of&#xD;
      68Ga-NODAGA-SNA006 in patients with solid tumors; To investigate the distribution profile of&#xD;
      68Ga-NODAGA-SNA006 in patients with solid tumors. Secondary objectives To investigate the&#xD;
      optimal administration dose and radiation safety profile of 68Ga-NODAGA-SNA006; To&#xD;
      investigate the PET imaging characteristics and high-quality imaging time window of&#xD;
      68Ga-NODAGA-SNA006 in patients with solid tumors; To explore the correlation between PET&#xD;
      imaging characteristics of 68Ga-NODAGA-SNA006 binding to CD8 and histological CD8 expression&#xD;
      characteristics; To explore peripheral blood T lymphocyte differentiation (CD8, CD4, CD3,&#xD;
      etc.) in patients with solid tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study had a dose-escalation, open-label design. Intravenous injection of SNA006 was used&#xD;
      to observe its safety tolerance, radiation absorbed dose, distribution, and PET imaging&#xD;
      characteristics in patients with solid tumors. The study consists of three phases, namely, a&#xD;
      screening period, a trial period, and a safety follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety evaluation Observe any AE occurred in all subjects during the clinical study,&#xD;
           record the clinical features, severity, occurrence time, end time, duration, treatment&#xD;
           measures and outcome, and determine the correlation between any AE and the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. efficacy evaluation 2.1. Evaluation of imaging characteristics In this clinical trial,&#xD;
           PET imaging characteristics will be evaluated by an independent imaging evaluation&#xD;
           committee, and the PET imaging operating procedures and parameters will be detailed in&#xD;
           the PET/CT standard operating procedures. 2.2. Evaluation of correlation between imaging&#xD;
           expression and immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
