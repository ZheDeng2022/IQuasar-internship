    <measure>MDS-UPDRS Total Score for Part II Item 2.1 + Part III Item 3.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Movement Disorders Society Sponsored Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is designed to monitor the burden and extent of Parkinson's disease. The MDS-UPDRS is divided into 4 parts: (Part I; 13 items) non-motor experiences of daily living, (Part II; 13) motor experiences of daily living, (Part III; 34) motor examination, and (Part IV; 6) motor complications. In each part, all items are rated on a scale from 0-4, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.&#xD;
The sum of items 2.1 (Speech) and Part III 3.1 (Speech) will be used to calculate a total score to assess speech abilities.</description>

    <description>The sum of items 2.7 (handwriting), 3.4 (finger tapping), and 3.5 (hand movements) will be used to calculate a total score to assess manual dexterity. All items are rated on a scale from 0-4, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.</description>

    <measure>MDS-UPDRS Part II Total Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>For MDS-UPDRS Part II (motor experiences of daily living) scores, the scale range for Part II Total Score is 0-52, with higher scores reflecting greater severity.</description>
