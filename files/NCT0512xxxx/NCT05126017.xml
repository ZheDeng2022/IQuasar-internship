  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reliable scar assessment is essential not only when designing clinical trials to investigate&#xD;
      the efficacy of new and existing scar therapies, but also in everyday, clinical practice, to&#xD;
      examine the progress of our patients' care. Subjective assessments are extremely important;&#xD;
      they demonstrate to the patient the changes and improvements in their scars since the primary&#xD;
      burn injury. Nevertheless, clinicians require reliable, validated, and objective tools which&#xD;
      can yield measurable and reproducible outcomes. These are ultimately needed to achieve the&#xD;
      goal of reducing the physical and psychosocial burden of scarring through compelling&#xD;
      research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, a pilot study (BOSS-1) was conducted in 55 patients with post burn hypertrophic&#xD;
      scars. The investigators measured, among other parameters, scar thickness, density, and&#xD;
      pliability, using a panel of objective scar assessment tools, alongside standard subjective&#xD;
      measurements (questionnaire-based), and skin biopsy assessments. Measurements were performed&#xD;
      at a single time point which varied from 3 months to 6 years post burn injury. This work&#xD;
      indicated that measuring scar thickness, pliability and colour together, may provide a global&#xD;
      scar objective score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BOSS-2 is a multi-centre study that will validate the preliminary findings in BOSS-1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 60 burn patients with a burn wound &gt; 1% TBSA that did not achieve 100%&#xD;
      wound healing at 3 weeks post injury. Healed wounds will be assessed at 4 time points (3, 12,&#xD;
      18 and 24 months) from time of injury until scar maturation. From the time of recruitment (3&#xD;
      weeks post injury) the open wounds will be closely monitored (clinical assessments,&#xD;
      photography and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL)) until time of complete wound closure will&#xD;
      be recorded. The time to healing will be used as a &quot;recognised standard&quot; to validate both the&#xD;
      objective and the subjective tools; time to healing has previously been shown to correlate&#xD;
      with severity of hypertrophic scarring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A panel of tools, rather than a single device, has been selected since they capture all scar&#xD;
      characteristic changes (thickness, pliability and colour) during the scar maturation process.&#xD;
      These objective measurements along with subjective (e.g. POSAS, Vancouver) assessments will&#xD;
      be recorded at each time point. At the same time points, blood samples will be taken and 5mm&#xD;
      punch biopsy will be taken from SIFTI-2 cohort co-enrolled with BOSS-2 at Queen Elizabeth&#xD;
      Hospital Birmingham (QEHB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project will: (1) validate the global burn objective scar score, identified in&#xD;
      BOSS-1 study; (2) correlate objective versus subjective measures; (3) assess the&#xD;
      acceptability of the global scar score with clinicians and patients; (4) correlate the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes with tissue and blood scarring markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The creation of a validated panel of objective scar measurement devices will form the basis&#xD;
      of future scar therapy research (outcome measures for clinical trials). These tools coupled&#xD;
      with the haematological and histological data will further the understanding of the process&#xD;
      of burn scar maturation and guide future care management.&#xD;
