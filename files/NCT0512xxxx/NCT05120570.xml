  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, phase I/II, study of PTCy/sirolimus plus VIC-1911 to prevent GVHD and&#xD;
      relapse after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (alloHCT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Determination of the optimal dose during the Phase I trial is based on Dose Limiting Toxicity&#xD;
      for safety and reduction of CD4+, pH3ser10+ T cells (phosphorylated histone 3 serine 10 is a&#xD;
      biomarker of Aurora kinase A activity) for efficacy. Phase II will be powered to improve&#xD;
      grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease and relapse after alloHCT, compared to&#xD;
      historical estimates at the University of Minnesota.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive myeloablative conditioning (MAC) with total body irradiation (TBI)&#xD;
      followed by infusion of HLA-matched related or unrelated peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC)&#xD;
      on day 0. Cyclophosphamide will be administered on days +3 and +4. Sirolimus targeting&#xD;
      8-12ng/ml will begin on day +5 until day +365. VIC-1911 will be administered as 25 mg, 50 mg,&#xD;
      or 75 mg orally BID from day +5 to day +45 according to the rules of our phase I study. The&#xD;
      lowest biologically active and safe dose of VIC-1911 will be identified as the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose.&#xD;
