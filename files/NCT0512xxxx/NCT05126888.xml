  <brief_summary>

      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the cannabinoid-based medication SCI-110&#xD;
      compared to placebo in subjects with Tourette syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that SCI-110 will be a valuable treatment option, especially for t those&#xD;
      subjects with TS, who do not benefit from or do not tolerate first-line treatment with&#xD;
      antipsychotics. Since there is evidence that currently available CBM improves not only tics,&#xD;
      but also psychiatric comorbidities, SCI-110 might be even more beneficial to improve a&#xD;
      broader spectrum of symptoms resulting in both improved quality of life and decreased disease&#xD;
      related costs. Moreover, PEA was shown to minimize AEs associated with cannabinoids use and&#xD;
      to reduce their required effective dose (data not published). Hence, the use of SCI-110 is&#xD;
      expected to show a therapeutic effect superior to currently available CBMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It can be assumed that AEs in TS subjects do not differ from AEs described in other groups of&#xD;
      subjects treated with medicinal cannabis and/or cannabinoids. In general, cannabinoids are&#xD;
      considered as well tolerated.&#xD;
