  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-eclampsia (PET) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) are common complications of pregnancy&#xD;
      that affect up to 15% of pregnancies in the UK. These conditions can have potentially&#xD;
      devastating consequences to mothers and babies in pregnancy. Pre-term birth, that is often&#xD;
      medically indicated to treat severe PET and FGR can cause cerebral palsy, breathing&#xD;
      difficulty, developmental delay and even death in affected babies. Mothers who suffer from&#xD;
      PET are at risk of seizures, strokes, multi-organ failure and future chronic hypertension. It&#xD;
      is now thought that PET and FGR may result from poor adaptation of the maternal&#xD;
      cardiovascular system to normal pregnancy. This project aims to study the patterns within the&#xD;
      maternal cardiovascular system and haemodynamic profile in women who are at high risk of PET&#xD;
      and FGR by using non-invasive methods to gather information about the functions of their&#xD;
      hearts and major blood vessels. The investigators hope to elucidate the patterns that may&#xD;
      offer an early warning to mothers who may develop PET and whose fetuses may be growth&#xD;
      restricted. This would be an opportunity to more closely monitor, modify risk factors and&#xD;
      treat earlier women who develop these conditions. Women who are at a high risk of PET and FGR&#xD;
      as stipulated in the relevant Royal College of Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology and National&#xD;
      Institute of Clinical Excellence guidelines and who give their consent will be eligible for&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnosis of pre-eclampsia</measure>
    <time_frame>From 20 weeks gestation to 12 weeks post-partum.</time_frame>
    <description>This is defined as hypertension of &gt;140/90 mmHg and significant proteinuria. This is defined as urinalysis showing proteinuria of &gt;1+ or laboratory-quantified urine protein:creatinine ratio of &gt;30mg/mmol. These are assessed at every study visit.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnosis of fetal growth restriction</measure>
    <time_frame>From 20 weeks gestation to birth.</time_frame>
    <description>This is diagnosed on ultrasound or at birth. During ultrasound scans at visits 2 and 3, fetal weight is estimated using the Hadlock formula from measurements of the fetal abdominal circumference, femur length and head circumference. This is then plotted onto customised growth chart. Fetal growth restriction is diagnosed antenatally when the estimated fetal weight is under the 3rd centile or under the 10th centile in the presence of abnormal ultrasound dopplers. Abnormal ultrasound dopplers are defined as raised pulsatility index in the fetal umbilical artery, middle cerebral artery or ductus venosus. At birth, fetal growth restriction is diagnosed when the measured birthweight plots under the 10th centile on the customised growth chart.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pregnancy outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>From birth to 12 weeks of age</time_frame>
    <description>This is concerned with the 3 possible outcomes of the pregnancy: livebirth, stillbirth or neonatal death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Gestational age at delivery</measure>
    <time_frame>At delivery</time_frame>
    <description>This is the recorded age of gestation at the time of delivery, in weeks and days</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Birthweight centile</measure>
    <time_frame>At birth</time_frame>
    <description>This is a measure of the baby's weight at birth, in grams. This is then plotted onto a customised growth chart, accounting for maternal ethnicity and body mass index.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of neonatal unit admission</measure>
    <time_frame>At delivery</time_frame>
    <description>This is concerned with whether the baby is admitted to the neonatal admission unit following delivery. If admitted, duration would be quantified in days and hours.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intrapartum or immediate postpartum complications.</measure>
    <time_frame>From the onset of active labour (4cm cervical dilatation and regular contractions of 3-4:10 minutes) till 48 hours post-delivery</time_frame>
    <description>This is concerned with the development of complications in the mother, in relation to haemorrhage and hypertensive disorders.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Persistence of maternal haemodynamic changes</measure>
    <time_frame>6-12 weeks postpartum (during study visit 4)</time_frame>
    <description>Maternal haemodynamic changes assessed postpartum showing the persistence of haemodynamic changes noted antenatally</description>
