  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase III clinical trial is an endpoint-driven randomized, double-blind,&#xD;
      parallel-controlled, multicenter clinical trial, and around 13,000 subjects aged 18 years and&#xD;
      above who have previously received 1 dose of intramuscular Ad5-nCoV will be recruited.&#xD;
      Volunteers should have been vaccinated with intramuscular Ad5-nCoV &gt; 56 days prior to&#xD;
      enrollment. All subjects will receive 1 dose of investigational vaccine or placebo through&#xD;
      nebulized inhalation. The ratio of subjects in the vaccine group and placebo group is 1:1 and&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of the investigational vaccine will be followed up for 52 weeks after&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
