  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The concept that the roots of cardiometabolic disease start in early life was established by&#xD;
      Dr. David Barker, who documented relationships between low birthweight (as a marker for&#xD;
      challenges during gestation) and later cardiovascular disease (CVD). Later work has suggested&#xD;
      that post-natal challenges (similar to prenatal ones) may also exhibit links to later&#xD;
      cardiometabolic disease, with the strongest links appearing to be between low weight in early&#xD;
      childhood and later hypertension and high waist circumference (WC). However, assessments for&#xD;
      the relationship between early childhood challenges and insulin resistance and glucose&#xD;
      regulation have been lacking and long-term cohort studies are few. In this project, we aim to&#xD;
      assess children initially followed as part of The Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of&#xD;
      Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the Consequences for Child Health (MAL-ED) study,&#xD;
      where they received frequent measures of anthropometry and laboratory assessments for&#xD;
      intestinal pathogens. These children are now of peri-pubertal age--a time period associated&#xD;
      with metabolic shifts. We will assess for glucose dysregulation and findings associated with&#xD;
      the metabolic syndrome, and we will analyze potential associations between current chronic&#xD;
      disease risk findings with early life poor growth and intestinal pathogen carriage rate. As&#xD;
      such, we hope to uncover potential targets in early life health to reduce later chronic&#xD;
      disease risk.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The relationship between prenatal challenges and later risk for chronic disease has been well&#xD;
      established. Our group previously assessed the hypothesis that post-natal challenges (similar&#xD;
      to prenatal ones) would exhibit links to later cardiometabolic disease. This was performed&#xD;
      using retrospective data from a long-term cohort of children in Guatemala, demonstrating&#xD;
      novel findings that higher degrees of diarrhea burden in the first 6 months of life (as a&#xD;
      marker of nutritional and/or inflammatory stressors) were associated with a greater risk of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome as adults The causes of these findings are not known, though postulated&#xD;
      mechanisms include epigenetic reprograming of metabolic rate, hormonal regulation and&#xD;
      vascular tone. Unfortunately, long-term cohort studies are few, limiting opportunities to&#xD;
      evaluate these links prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Haydom Global Health Research Center in north central Tanzania represents an important&#xD;
      rural setting for performing high-quality medical research in sub-Saharan Africa (5). The&#xD;
      region around Haydom has a high degree of stunting and enteric pathogen carriage among a&#xD;
      cohort of children followed in the area from 2009-2013 as part of the multi-country study&#xD;
      &quot;The Etiology, Risk Factors, and Interactions of Enteric Infections and Malnutrition and the&#xD;
      Consequences for Child Health (MAL-ED).&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      These children followed in Haydom during MAL-ED had monthly anthropometry and stool pathogen&#xD;
      analysis, as well as extensive demographic data. This provides an opportunity to follow up on&#xD;
      these children to assess for potential links between early life challenges (both enteric&#xD;
      disease, infections and nutritional deficiencies) and later chronic disease risk, including&#xD;
      lipid abnormalities, glucose intolerance and blood pressure elevations. The current proposal&#xD;
      is to follow up on these children at the age of typical entry into puberty, as this is a&#xD;
      common shift in metabolism when many children begin to exhibit metabolic abnormalities. We&#xD;
      will assess these children for multiple measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometry (height, weight, BMI, waist circumference)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of pubertal stage by exam or questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lipids (LDL, HDL, triglycerides)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CRP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasting insulin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metabolic syndrome (MetS) severity score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood saved for future epigenetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use linear and and logistic regression to determine associations between 1) mean&#xD;
      number of monthly pathogens (individual pathogens and in aggregate) and 2) reported symptoms&#xD;
      (fever, cough, diarrhea), with multiple MetS-related outcomes: BMI percentile, WC, fasting&#xD;
      insulin, 2-hour glucose following OGTT, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, normalized BP and a&#xD;
      MetS diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying hypothesis is that there will be consistent links between features of MetS (in&#xD;
      particular blood pressure, waist circumference and insulin resistance) with 1) enteric&#xD;
      pathogen burden (overall and for particularly virulent pathogens such as Enterotoxigenic&#xD;
      E.coli) and 2) poor early life growth.&#xD;
