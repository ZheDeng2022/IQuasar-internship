  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ED-VeRT will enroll up to 100 adult emergency department (ED) patients presenting with a&#xD;
      chief complaint of dizziness or vertigo to collect longitudinal outcomes over 3 months of&#xD;
      follow-up. This will include 50 patients who were evaluated by an ED physical therapist (ie,&#xD;
      vestibular rehabilitation) during their ED visit and 50 patients who received usual care. The&#xD;
      aims of this trial are to: (1) obtain initial estimates of participant recruitment and&#xD;
      retention, intra-cluster correlation, and between-group outcome differences that will inform&#xD;
      sample size calculation for a future randomized clinical trial, and (2) assess feasibility&#xD;
      and fidelity of a clinical classification protocol for undifferentiated dizziness among&#xD;
      patients receiving ED vestibular rehabilitation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the index ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The DHI contains 25 items quantifying self-perceived handicapping effects of dizziness symptoms.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Vestibular Activities Avoidance Instrument (VAAI-9)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the index ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The VAAI-9 identifies fear avoidance beliefs in persons with dizziness. The VAAI-9 is the 9-item short form version of the VAAI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ED Diagnostic Imaging Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Index ED visit (one day)</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of ED visits in which any diagnostic imaging of the brain was performed, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ED Length of Stay</measure>
    <time_frame>Index ED visit (up to one week)</time_frame>
    <description>Total length of stay, inclusive of hospitalizations and observation stays.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Patient-Reported Medication Use in Last 24 Hours</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the index ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Patient-reported medication use for dizziness will be collected using a standardized instrument assess whether participants have taken any dizziness medication in the last 24 hours (binary yes/no). The 24-hour timeframe was selected to maximize accuracy in patient recall. In brief, dizziness medications are listed by brand and generic names; a &quot;yes&quot; response to any medication triggers an additional query asking the participant to specify the medication dose (e.g., meclizine 25mg) and quantity (e.g., one pill).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Global Rating of Change (GROC)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the index ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The GROC is a single-item survey used to evaluate overall recovery from the time that symptoms began until now. Responses are provided on a 15-point Likert scale ranging from &quot;a very great deal worse&quot; to &quot;a very great deal better.&quot;</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the index ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>The NRS measures intensity of dizziness symptoms from 0 to 10. Participants will report average dizziness intensity over the last 24 hours.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Advanced Healthcare Utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>Three months after the index ED visit.</time_frame>
    <description>Proportion of participants who utilized any advanced healthcare resources for dizziness after their index ED visit, defined as advanced imaging (e.g., computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) or procedures/surgery.</description>

    <intervention_name>Vestibular Rehabilitation</intervention_name>
    <description>Vestibular Rehabilitation refers to the specific interventions that physical therapists provide to patients with dizziness and vertigo symptoms. These interventions can involve repositioning maneuvers, habituation exercises, gaze stabilization, and/or balance training exercises, depending on the specific etiology of dizziness and vertigo per an established clinical protocol utilizing a patient's history and exam findings. Physical therapists instruct patients in how to perform these exercises at home and provide instructions and referral for patients to follow-up with an outpatient physical therapist for further care.</description>
