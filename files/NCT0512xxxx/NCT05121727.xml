  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) has become a common procedure in thoracic surgery.&#xD;
      Severe postoperative pain may be encountered in patients undergoing VATS. Analgesic methods&#xD;
      such as thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB), intercostal block and erector spina plane block&#xD;
      (ESPB) are widely used for VATS. Among these methods, ultrasound (US) guided TPVB is the most&#xD;
      preferred method. In recent years, the frequency of application of plane blocks as a&#xD;
      component of multimodal analgesia has been increased. ESPB and SAPB are some of them.&#xD;
      Generally, comparisons are made between ESPB and TPVB in studies and the analgesic effect is&#xD;
      evaluated.There are two techniques for SAPB application. In Deep SAPB (DSAPB) application,&#xD;
      local anesthetic agent is given under the serratus anterior muscle. In the Superficial SAPB&#xD;
      (SSAPB) application, the local anesthetic agent is given above the serratus anterior muscle.&#xD;
      Since it is done by entering from the same point in two applications, it is possible to&#xD;
      perform these two applications at the same time with a single needle entry. The mechanisms of&#xD;
      regional analgesia techniques used after thoracic surgery operations are also different from&#xD;
      each other. Therefore, it may be possible to obtain a more effective analgesic effect in&#xD;
      patients by combining the mechanism of action of DSAPB and SSAPB , as in the multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia method. This study seeks to evaluate the effect of ESPB and combined DSAPB-SSAPB&#xD;
      pain after VATS.&#xD;

    <description>After the linear ultrasound (US) probe will be placed 2-3 cm lateral to the T5 spinous process, 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride will be injected into the interfacial space below the erector spinae muscle, above the transverse process.</description>

    <description>In patients who are planned to have combined deep and superficial serratus anterior plane block, following the visualization of the anatomical structures, the nerve block needle will be advanced via the in-plane technique beneath the serratus anterior muscles until the interfascial space was reached. After hydrodissection with 2 ml normal saline, 10 ml 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected into the area. Then, with the same needle, will be returned 1-2 cm from the deep serratus anteror area to superficial serratus anteror area above the serratus anterior muscle and will be injected 2 ml normal saline for hydrodissection. Finally 10 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected for superficial serratus anetrior block into the interfacial area.</description>
