  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of the study drug 2141-V11 in people whose&#xD;
      NMIBC did not respond to standard treatment, and who will not have the standard surgical&#xD;
      procedure to remove the bladder. The researchers will test different doses of 2141-V11 to see&#xD;
      which dose is safest in people. The researchers will also do tests to see how the body&#xD;
      absorbs, distributes, and gets rid of 2141-V11. This study is one of the first to test&#xD;
      2141-V11 in people, and the first to test 2141-V11 delivered through a catheter into the&#xD;
      bladder.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a phase I trial investigating an intravesically-delivered anti-CD40 agonist antibody (2141-V11) for the treatment of subjects with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) unresponsive to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) therapy who are considered ineligible for or have elected not to undergo radical cystectomy.</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <description>The MTD will be defined as the dose level at which the estimated DLT rate from the MCRM model is closest to the target acceptable rate of 20%. If an MTD is not found after the full dose escalation study has been completed, the next dose recommended by the MCRM algorithm will be considered the RP2D. A DLT will be defined as the occurrence of any clinically significant grade 3 or 4 AE (per CTCAE version 5.0) within the DLT evaluation period that is considered by the Principal Investigator or designee to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to 2141-V11.</description>

    <description>All subjects will receive the anti-CD40 antibody 2141-V11 administered by intravesical instillation once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks, at weeks 1 (±3 days), 2 (±3 days), and 3 (±3 days) for a total of 3 doses. As discussed further below, depending on disease status at week 13 and week 25 evaluations, subjects may be eligible for re-treatment (once weekly for 3 doses) at these time points. Dose escalation of 2141-V11 will proceed incrementally from the initial dose of 0.7 mg to doses of 2 mg, 7 mg, 21 mg, and 70 mg using an MCRM design to assess AEs/DLTs (according to CTCAE version 5.0) and to determine the MTD and/or a RP2D. There will be no intra-patient dose escalations or dose reductions of 2141-V11.</description>
