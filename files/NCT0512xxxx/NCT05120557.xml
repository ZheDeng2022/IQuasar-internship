  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to determine the diagnostic performances of an&#xD;
      ultraportable diagnostic ultrasound system for the assessment of liver fibrosis severity in&#xD;
      patients with NASH, and to compare them to other non-invasive tests.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cross-sectional study that will recruit approximately 1000 patients&#xD;
      across 30 clinical sites in Europe and the USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target recruited population will include adult patients at risk of, or with known chronic&#xD;
      liver diseases, whether or not screened for inclusion in NASH pharmaceutical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After being informed about the study objectives and potential risks, patients who consent to&#xD;
      participate will undergo an non-invasive external ultrasound exam of their liver using an&#xD;
      ultraportable diagnostic ultrasound system. The system will derive quantitative information&#xD;
      related to physical and acoustic properties of the liver tissue, which are known to correlate&#xD;
      with the severity of chronic diffuse liver diseases such as fibrosis and steatosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also assess the repeatability, reproducibility and robustness of quantitative&#xD;
      parameters. Collected data will also enable exploring ultrasound-based liver tissue&#xD;
      characterization correlated to NASH-specific histological lesions such as intra-hepatic&#xD;
      inflammation and hepatic cell ballooning.&#xD;
