  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational real world clinical trial with prospective follow up&#xD;
      that will evaluate the treatment outcome of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) patients in the&#xD;
      first line with intensive chemotherapy based regimens in Argentina.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to gather real world evidence of the characteristics of AML&#xD;
      patients in Argentina who receive intensive chemotherapy based treatment in first line&#xD;
      following our national guidelines. The study primary endpoint is to evaluate event free&#xD;
      survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients diagnosed with AML and treated in first&#xD;
      line with intensive chemotherapy combined with different consolidation modalities depending&#xD;
      on risk category. Secondary endpoints are to evaluate EFS and OS according to: cytogenetic&#xD;
      and molecular classification, measurable residual disease (MRD) (by flow cytometry) post&#xD;
      induction. Assess treatment-related mortality and limitations in completing treatment due to&#xD;
      toxicity. Evaluate the role of allogeneic stem cell transplantation in terms of EFS in&#xD;
      intermediate and adverse risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every AML patient diagnosed in our institutions will follow our guidelines with respect to&#xD;
      diagnosis procedures. Risk category will depend on molecular and cytogenetic features&#xD;
      according to European Leukemia net 2017 risk stratification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive induction with 7+3 scheme; if CR is not met induction will be&#xD;
      followed by a reinduction with FLAG-IDA. According to post induction remission status and&#xD;
      risk assessment, consolidation will consist of three courses of cytarabine (2g/m2) +&#xD;
      daunorubicin (60mg/m2) for low risk group; or consolidation with cytarabine (2g/m2) +&#xD;
      daunorubicin (60mg/m2) followed by allogeneic stem cell transplantation for intermediate and&#xD;
      adverse risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients harboring Flt3 mutation will add midostaurin during induction and consolidations:&#xD;
      midostaurin 50 mg orally every 12 hours on days 8-21 of each 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cases of Coring Binding Factor AML and NPM1 mutated AML, molecular MRD assessment will&#xD;
      be done at the end of consolidations by RQ-PCR and thereafter a follow-up RQ-PCR evaluation&#xD;
      every 3 months during the first two years.&#xD;
