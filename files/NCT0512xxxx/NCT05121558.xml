  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether yoga can reduce nerve pain caused by cancer&#xD;
      treatment (chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, or CIPN). Participants will take one&#xD;
      of three approaches:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Yoga classes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Educational sessions on the causes and impacts of CIPN, how yoga may help with CIPN, and&#xD;
           how different therapies may help with CIPN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Usual care with standard-of-care medications for CIPN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will compare how these different approaches affect participants' balance,&#xD;
      their risk of falls, and their quality of life. This study will also measure how much yoga&#xD;
      can help the reduced sense of touch caused by CIPN.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of CIPN based on symptom history, loss of deep tendon reflexes, or the&#xD;

             pain based on the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version&#xD;
             5.0&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Self-reported moderate to severe CIPN pain, as defined by a score of 4 or greater on&#xD;
             the BPI-SF average pain item over the past week&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On a stable regimen (no change in three months) if taking anti-neuropathy or other&#xD;
             pain medications and not taking acetyl-L-carnitine 77&#xD;
&#xD;

             first 12 weeks of the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to adhere to all study-related procedures, including randomization to one of&#xD;
             the three arms&#xD;
&#xD;

             result of your CIPN?&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received physical therapy or practiced yoga for CIPN in the past 3&#xD;
             months. As patients who have received physical therapy or practiced yoga in this time&#xD;
             period may already be experiencing the benefits of yoga/stretching therapy, we will&#xD;
             exclude such patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who demonstrate a high risk of falls during screening, denoted by FR &lt;15.24&#xD;
             cm, will be excluded to ensure participant safety in practicing the yoga intervention&#xD;
