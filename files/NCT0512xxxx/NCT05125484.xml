      The aim of this research is to compare the effects of Bowen's technique and Myofascial&#xD;
      Release technique on pain and disability in patients with trapezitis.Randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials done at Islamabad Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Centre(IPRC) and Benazir Bhutto&#xD;
      Hospital. The sample size was 66. The subjects were divided in two groups, 33 subjects in&#xD;
      Bowen's Technique group and 33 subjects in Myofascial Release Technique group. Study duration&#xD;
      was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was non probability purposive sampling technique.&#xD;
      The patients aged 20-40 years and clinicaly diagnosed with Trapezitis(spasm,trigger&#xD;
      points,tenderness,stiffness) were included in the study. Tools used in the study are Cervical&#xD;
      ROMs, NPRS, NDI, Isometric Scapular Pinch Test and Lateral Scapular Slide Test.&#xD;

      Trapezitis is a condition that involves inflammation of the trapezius muscle. The upper&#xD;
      fibers of trapezius, being the postural muscles, are highly susceptible to overuse injuries&#xD;
      and thus the inflammation.[1]This results in pain that is present during the rest, is&#xD;
      aggravated with activity and is referred to the other areas. The pain results in protective&#xD;
      spasm of the antagonistic muscle group that also restricts the passive range of motion and&#xD;
      makes it painful too. [2] In people working for long hours at a desk and computers or&#xD;
      spending many hours driving, the low level of upper trapezius activity is frequently found&#xD;
      because of head posture during sitting and standing , which is common cause of tension and&#xD;
      neck pain in such people.[3] Various recent studies have hypothesized that trapezitis occurs&#xD;
      due to muscle tissue overloading and injury, that results in involuntary shortening of&#xD;
      localized muscle fibers. The stressed soft tissue area thus receives less glucose, oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrients supply; subsequently high levels of metabolic waste products are accumulated. And&#xD;
      this cascade of events ends in altered status of tissue, pain and the development of the&#xD;
      Trigger points in the muscle.[4] Myofascial Release(MFR) is a soft tissue mobilization&#xD;
      technique that is defined as &quot; the facilitation of mechanical, neural and psycho&#xD;
      physiological adaptive potential as interfaced via the myofascial system&quot;.[5] MFR decreases&#xD;
      the pain and restores the proper alignment by changing the ground substance's viscosity to&#xD;
      more fluid state resulting in elimination of excessive pressure of fascia on the pain&#xD;
      sensitive structures.[6]&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is one more soft tissue technique called 'Bowen Technique' that is useful and indicated&#xD;
      in myofascial pain. The Bowen technique is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
      '…dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy……. [which] balances the body to&#xD;
      allow it to heal itself. The work consists of a series of precise moves on specific points of&#xD;
      the body. These moves are light and can be done through clothing. There are frequent and&#xD;
      important pauses between each series of moves giving the body time to benefit from each. The&#xD;
      technique uses positive moves that initiate a positive energy flow and negative moves that&#xD;
      isolate this energy to a specific area' (Rentsch and Rentsch,1997) The Bowen technique was&#xD;
      developed by late Tom Bowen in Geelong, Australia in 1950. It is a connective tissue&#xD;
      technique that uses subtle inputs called 'Bowen moves' to the body that stimulates the body's&#xD;
      self-healing. [7] The Bowen moves applied are in several sets in a complete session of 15-45&#xD;
      minutes duration.[7] While applying the technique, the therapist uses the thumb when the&#xD;
      Bowen move is executed away from the patient's body and two fingers are used when the Bowen&#xD;
      move is executed towards the patient's body. The technique can be used anywhere on the&#xD;
      origin, insertion or the belly of the muscle and produces a physical and an energetic&#xD;
      action.[6] This technique can be used to treat many types acute and chronic injuries and&#xD;
      other health issues. It does this by using holistic approach in which body's innate healing&#xD;
      mechanism is stimulated. [7] This technique has been recommended in many conditions like&#xD;
      headache, cervical pain, back pain, whiplash injury, TMJ dysfunction, herniated disk, tennis&#xD;
      elbow, hamstring tightness and frozen shoulder, work related injuries etc. [7],[8] An RCT was&#xD;
      done by Ekta S. Chaudhary, Nehal Shah, Neeta Vyas, Ratan Khuman1, Dhara Chavda1, Gopal Nambi&#xD;
      that compared the effectiveness of MFR and cold pack in Upper trapezius Spasm and concluded&#xD;
      both MFR and cold pack along with exercises to be effective in upper trapezium muscle spasm&#xD;
      but the overall effects of MFR surpassed the cold therapy.[9] Another study by Pooja Mane ,&#xD;
      Amrutkuvar Pawar , Trupti Warude compared the effects of Myofascial Release technique with&#xD;
      Deep Friction Massage on pain and cervical ROM, the results concluded both therapies to bring&#xD;
      improvement in pain and cervical ROM but MFR was more effective.[10] Similarly, a systematic&#xD;
      review of RCTs was conducted to determine the effectiveness of MFR in decreasing pain ,&#xD;
      improving function and elongate length and concluded MFR to be emerging strategy with strong&#xD;
      evidence base and solid treatment option for many conditions.[11] A study was conducted to&#xD;
      compare the effects of MFR with hot pack in reducing pain and improving passive ROM in&#xD;
      shoulder joint and that concluded both to be effective but MFR proved to be more favorable&#xD;
      because of the less time spent and no need of equipment.[12] A study has been done to see the&#xD;
      effects of Bowen technique as an adjunct therapy to conventional physiotherapy treatment on&#xD;
      the pain and functional outcomes in patient with Acute trapezitis and the results established&#xD;
      Bowen technique to be effective in decreasing pain and improving functional outcomes in Acute&#xD;
      trapezitis.[7]A few studies were conducted that evaluated the effectiveness of Bowen&#xD;
      technique in frozen shoulder and concluded this technique as a positive intervention in&#xD;
      improving mobility, functional status and decreasing pain.[13],[14, 15] A few studies were&#xD;
      conducted that compared the effects of Bowen technique vs MET in treatment of hamstring&#xD;
      tightness.[16] And few other worked to establish the effectiveness of Bowen technique in&#xD;
      different complex and common conditions and found positive results.[17] A study was done to&#xD;
      show Bowen technique to be effective in health service workplace to improve physical as well&#xD;
      as mental well-being of the working staff.[8] This study aims to compare the short term&#xD;
      effects of Bowen Technique and MFR on pain and neck disability in patients with trapezitis.&#xD;
      Also it intends to study the short term effects of both techniques on scapular motions. Bowen&#xD;
      technique is a relatively new technique, having easier application and has been less worked&#xD;
      on. So, if this study proves the effectiveness of Bowen technique in comparison with MFR in&#xD;
      patient with trapezitis. Further studies can be conducted to evaluate its efficacy as an&#xD;
      independent and preferable procedure in treatment of other conditions and further work can be&#xD;
      conducted on other areas as well. As this is a holistic technique, so it could be a&#xD;
      beneficial addition in the daily clinical practice.&#xD;
