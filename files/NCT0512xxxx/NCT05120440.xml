      This study is a randomized crossover trail examining the effect of breakfast consumption or&#xD;
      omission on afternoon resistance training performance. Resistance-trained adults will&#xD;
      complete a resistance training workout comprised of barbell back squat, barbell bench press,&#xD;
      and barbell conventional deadlift following either consuming breakfast and lunch, or the same&#xD;
      amount of food consumed solely at lunch. For each testing session the participants will be&#xD;
      provided with all food to consume prior to arriving at the laboratory. Major performance&#xD;
      outcomes will be total repetition volume completed for each exercise (i.e. bench press,&#xD;
      squat, and deadlift) and the entire workout (each individual trial), along with barbell&#xD;
      kinematics for each exercise.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized crossover trail examining the effect of breakfast consumption or&#xD;
      omission on afternoon resistance training performance. Resistance-trained adults will&#xD;
      complete a resistance training workout comprised of barbell back squat, barbell bench press,&#xD;
      and barbell conventional deadlift following either consuming breakfast and lunch, or the same&#xD;
      amount of food consumed solely at lunch. For each testing session the participants will be&#xD;
      provided with all food to consume prior to arriving at the laboratory. Major performance&#xD;
      outcomes will be total repetition volume completed for each exercise (i.e. bench press,&#xD;
      squat, and deadlift) and the entire workout (each individual trial), along with barbell&#xD;
      kinematics for each exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will report to the laboratory on three separate occasions, with 3 to 10 days&#xD;
      between each visit. At the first visit, after initial screening and provision of informed&#xD;
      consent, each participant will undergo a performance screening and familiarization session to&#xD;
      confirm eligibility and become accustomed to the study procedures. This familiarization&#xD;
      session will include initial assessments of bench press, barbell back squat, and conventional&#xD;
      deadlift maximal strength in order to determine final eligibility. Additionally, body&#xD;
      composition will be assessed via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and digital anthropometry&#xD;
      at this session for descriptive purposes. Following the familiarization session, each&#xD;
      participant will complete two laboratory visits consisting of completion of the resistance&#xD;
      training workout described below after consuming the provided meals either divided between&#xD;
      breakfast and lunch (~3-4 hours after breakfast), or solely at lunch. This will ensure each&#xD;
      participant consumes identical quantities and types of foods prior to both exercise sessions.&#xD;
      Thus, the only difference will be the food distribution as two meals (breakfast and lunch) or&#xD;
      one meal (lunch). Throughout the study, participants will be asked to maintain their normal&#xD;
      lifestyle practices. In addition, participants will report their dietary intake during the&#xD;
      24-hour period prior to the first testing session and will be asked to replicate this intake&#xD;
      during the 24-hour period prior to the subsequent testing sessions. A background&#xD;
      questionnaire will also be completed to assess general supplement use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this investigation is to examine the effect of breakfast consumption or&#xD;
      omission on afternoon resistance training performance in habitual breakfast consumers and&#xD;
      non-consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GENERAL HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that afternoon resistance training performance will be impaired in&#xD;
      habitual breakfast consumers when breakfast is omitted, but similar decrements will not be&#xD;
      observed in habitual non-consumers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES TO BE TESTED/SPECIFIC AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. To determine the effect of breakfast consumption on afternoon resistance&#xD;
      training performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. It is hypothesized that afternoon resistance training performance will not be&#xD;
      impacted by breakfast consumption or omission when the cohort is examined as a whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. To determine whether habitual breakfast consumption patterns impact afternoon&#xD;
      resistance training performance following consumption or omission of breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. It is hypothesized that habitual breakfast consumption patterns will impact the&#xD;
      effect of breakfast consumption on resistance training performance. More specifically,&#xD;
      performance will be negatively affected by the omission of breakfast in those who habitually&#xD;
      consume breakfast. Yet the omission of breakfast will not negatively impact resistance&#xD;
      training performance in those that regularly do not consume breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3. To determine the impact of breakfast consumption on subjective responses&#xD;
      throughout an afternoon resistance training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. It is hypothesized that subjective responses during afternoon resistance training&#xD;
      will not be impacted by breakfast consumption or omission when the cohort is examined as a&#xD;
      whole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4. To determine whether habitual breakfast consumption patterns influence&#xD;
      subjective responses throughout an afternoon resistance training session, following&#xD;
      consumption or omission of breakfast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis. It is hypothesized that worsened subjective responses will be observed after&#xD;
      breakfast omission only in those who habitually consume breakfast.&#xD;
