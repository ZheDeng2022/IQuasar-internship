      After being informed of the study and potential risks, all patients giving informed consent&#xD;
      will go undergo a screening period to determine eligibility for study entry. Patients who&#xD;
      meet the eligibility requirements will be given cobimetinib to take by mouth once daily at&#xD;
      the same time each day for 21 days and then have 7 days with no treatment. Patients will&#xD;
      receive cobimetinib as a tablet (adult) or as a liquid (child).&#xD;

    <description>Cobimetinib will be administered at a maximal dose of 60 mg daily for 21 days on, then 7 days off, in a 28-Day treatment cycle for 12 cycles (approximately 12 months). Cobimetinib should be taken once daily at approximately the same time each day, and no later than 4 hours after the scheduled time. Cobimetinib can be taken with or without a meal. Cobimetinib tablets should never be chewed, cut, or crushed. Therapy may continue for up to 12 cycles provided the subject meets the criteria for starting subsequent cycles and does not meet any of the criteria for cobimetinib discontinuation. At least 7 days off cobimetinib (within +7 days) is required prior to starting a new treatment cycle.</description>
