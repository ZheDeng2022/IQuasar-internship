  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 828 overweight and obese individuals with&#xD;
      gestational diabetes designed to compare standard to intensive glycemic targets.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of both obesity and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have increased, and&#xD;
      each is associated with adverse perinatal outcomes including fetal overgrowth, neonatal&#xD;
      morbidity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and cesarean delivery. Women with GDM who are&#xD;
      also overweight and obese have higher rates of pregnancy complications when compared to&#xD;
      normal weight women with GDM, which may occur in part due to suboptimal glycemic control. The&#xD;
      current recommendations for glycemic targets in pregnant women with diabetes are not&#xD;
      rigorously defined, and they far exceed the mean fasting (70.9 ±7.8 mg/dL) and 1 hour post-&#xD;
      prandial (108.9 ± 12.9 mg/dL) glucose values in pregnant women without GDM. Our prior work&#xD;
      demonstrated that use of intensive (fasting &lt;90, 1 hr post-prandial &lt;120 mg/dL) compared to&#xD;
      standard (fasting &lt;95 mg/dL, 1 hr post-prandial &lt;140 mg/dL) glycemic targets resulted in&#xD;
      improved glycemic control without increasing the risk for hypoglycemia. The Intensive&#xD;
      Glycemic Targets in Overweight and Obese Women with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus: A&#xD;
      Multicenter Randomized Trial (iGDM Trial) is a large, pragmatic randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      designed to investigate the impact of intensive versus standard glycemic targets on perinatal&#xD;
      outcomes in women with GDM who are overweight and obese. During the 5-year project period, a&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team of investigators from 4 medical centers representing regions of the&#xD;
      U.S. with high rates of obesity will randomize 828 overweight and obese women with GDM to&#xD;
      either intensive or standard glycemic targets. The specific aims of this project are: 1)&#xD;
      Determine the effectiveness of intensive glycemic targets in reducing the risk for neonatal&#xD;
      composite morbidity and large for gestational age birthweight in overweight and obese women&#xD;
      with GDM, 2) Assess the safety of intensive glycemic targets as measured by the frequency of&#xD;
      maternal hypoglycemia in overweight and obese women with GDM, and 3) Evaluate the&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of intensive glycemic control compared with standard glycemic control as&#xD;
      measured by the incremental cost per case of neonatal morbidity and LGA birth weight&#xD;
      prevented and per Quality-adjusted Life-year. The expected outcome of this study is&#xD;
      high-quality evidence on the effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of intensive&#xD;
      glycemic targets in reducing adverse perinatal outcomes among overweight and obese women with&#xD;
      GDM. If proven effective, use of intensive glycemic targets in overweight and obese women&#xD;
      with GDM will have an important positive impact on the health of these high risk women and&#xD;
      their infants.&#xD;
