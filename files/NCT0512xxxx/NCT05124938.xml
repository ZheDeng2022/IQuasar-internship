  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is a rare disease that represents approximately 3.8% of all new cancer&#xD;
      cases.Incidence of thyroid cancer in north Africa about 2.8% of all new cancer cases with&#xD;
      mortality rate about 0.73%.Thyroid malignancies are classified into different groups as&#xD;
      follows:Papillary thyroid cancer which is the most common form of thyroid cancer form about&#xD;
      80-90% of all thyroid cancers,Follicular thyroid cancer that forms about 10-15% of all&#xD;
      thyroid cancers,Anaplastic thyroid cancer that forms less than 2% of all thyroid&#xD;
      cancers,Medullary thyroid cancer that forms about 5-10% and other rare types include thyroid&#xD;
      lymphoma, and thyroid sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare disease, and its classic tumor marker is&#xD;
      calcitonin. However, recently, very aggressive cases have been reported to also secrete&#xD;
      carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and its role as a marker of worse prognosis has been&#xD;
      questioned.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a rare disease, and its classic tumor marker is&#xD;
      calcitonin. However, recently, very aggressive cases have been reported to also secrete&#xD;
      carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and its role as a marker of worse prognosis has been&#xD;
      questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CA19-9 was originally described as a gastrointestinal system and pancreas specific tumor&#xD;
      marker. Immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that CA19-9 is expressed in both&#xD;
      differentiated and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas. Increased serum levels of CA 19-9 were&#xD;
      reported in few patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer.The idea that CA19.9 could be&#xD;
      predictive of mortality in MTC stems from early research which showed that serum creatinine&#xD;
      and increased carcinoembryonic antigen levels were not important markers in MTC, but that&#xD;
      Ca19.9, which is secreted in MTC, was significantly associated with progressive disease.&#xD;
