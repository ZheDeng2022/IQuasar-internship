    <textblock>
      This phase I trial evaluates the effects of CBM588 in combination with standard therapies,&#xD;
      nivolumab and cabozantinib, in treating patients with kidney cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body (advanced/metastatic). The digestive microbiome may have an effect on how&#xD;
      patients respond to treatment, and previous research shows that a specific bacteria found in&#xD;
      the gut (Bifidobacterium) may predispose participants to a better response to standard&#xD;
      therapies. CBM588 is a strain of bacteria that can restore species of Bifidobacterium to the&#xD;
      microbiome. The primary aim of this study is to determine how CBM588 changes the microbiome&#xD;
      of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies,&#xD;
      such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere&#xD;
      with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving CBM588, nivolumab, and&#xD;
      cabozantinib may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of clostridium butyricum CBM 588 probiotic strain (CBM588) (in&#xD;
      combination with cabozantinib/nivolumab) in modulation of the gut microbiome in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the effect of CBM588 on the clinical efficacy of the cabozantinib/nivolumab&#xD;
      combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the effect of CBM588 on systemic immunodulation of the cabozantinib/nivolumab&#xD;
      combination in patients with mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess the effect of CBM588 on toxicities such as diarrhea and nausea using Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5 criteria with the&#xD;
      cabozantinib/nivolumab combination in patients with mRCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      cabozantinib S-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2: Patients receive CBM588 PO twice a day (BID), nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1,&#xD;
      and cabozantinib S-malate PO QD. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             Furthermore, subjects with a history of additional risk factors for torsades de&#xD;
             pointes (e.g., long QT syndrome) are also excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute value &gt; 500 ms, two&#xD;
                  additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be performed within 30&#xD;
                  min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three consecutive results for&#xD;
                  QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;

             such as basal or squamous cell skin cancer, superficial bladder cancer, or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the prostate, cervix, or breast.&#xD;
