  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People living with Parkinson's disease experience progressive motor and non-motor symptoms,&#xD;
      which negatively impact on health-related quality of life. Symptoms emerge and evolve as the&#xD;
      disease progresses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current care models are often inadequate to meet their needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate whether a complex and innovative model of integrated care will&#xD;
      increase an individual's ability to achieve their personal goals, have a positive impact on&#xD;
      health and symptom burden, and be more cost-effective when compared with usual care.&#xD;

      Background: People living with Parkinson's disease experience progressive motor and non-motor&#xD;
      symptoms, which negatively impact on health-related quality of life and can lead to an&#xD;
      increased risk of hospitalisation. It is increasingly recognised that the current care models&#xD;
      are not suitable for the needs of people with parkinsonism whose care needs evolve and change&#xD;
      as the disease progresses. This study aims to evaluate whether a complex and innovative model&#xD;
      of integrated care will increase an individual's ability to achieve their personal goals,&#xD;
      have a positive impact on health and symptom burden, and be more cost-effective when compared&#xD;
      with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This is a single centre, randomised controlled trial where people with parkinsonism&#xD;
      and their informal caregivers are randomised into one of two groups: either PRIME Parkinson&#xD;
      multi-component model of care; or usual care. Adults ≥18 years with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      parkinsonism, able to provide informed consent or the availability of a close friend or&#xD;
      relative to act as a personal consultee if capacity to do so is absent, and living in the&#xD;
      trial geographical area are eligible. Up to three caregivers per patient can also take part,&#xD;
      must be ≥18 years, provide informal, unpaid care and able to give informed consent. The&#xD;
      primary outcome measure is goal attainment, as measured using the Bangor Goal Setting&#xD;
      Interview. The duration of enrolment is 24 months. The total recruitment target is n=214 and&#xD;
      the main analyses will be intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: This trial tests whether a novel model of care improves health and&#xD;
      disease-related metrics including goal attainment, and decreases hospitalisations whilst&#xD;
      being more cost-effective than the current usual care. Subject to successful implementation&#xD;
      of this intervention within one centre, the PRIME Parkinson model of care could then be&#xD;
      evaluated within a cluster-randomised trial at multiple centres.&#xD;
