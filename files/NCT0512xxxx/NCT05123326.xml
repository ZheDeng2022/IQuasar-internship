  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Portal vein thrombosis is defined as partial or complete occlusion of the portal vein lumen&#xD;
      by the blood clot or its replacement by multiple collateral vessels with the hepato-petal&#xD;
      flow, known as 'portal cavernoma'. [1,2] Based on the published literature, 15-25% of&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis have portal vein thrombosis (PVT) [3], and 35-50% of patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have malignant PVT [4] compared to 1-3.8 per 100,000 patients&#xD;
      in the general population. [5] The reported cumulative incidence of PVT in patients of&#xD;
      Child-Pugh A and B is 4.6% and 10.7% at 1 and 5 years respectively with higher incidence&#xD;
      among those with decompensated disease or with an underlying hypercoagulable disorder. [6].&#xD;
      Similarly, the prevalence of PVT in compensated cirrhosis is around 1% which increases to 8 -&#xD;
      25% in liver transplant (LT) candidates and 40% in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) [7,8]. Based on the published literature 7-9 % of all chronic liver disease patients&#xD;
      have hepatic vein outflow tract obstruction (HVOTO) in the Indian population. [9] HVOTO is&#xD;
      defined as obstruction to hepatic venous outflow at any site from the right atrium inlet to&#xD;
      the small hepatic venules. The Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) results from occlusion of one or&#xD;
      more hepatic veins (HV) and/or the inferior vena cava (IVC). In the West, the most common&#xD;
      cause is HV occlusion by thrombosis. More recent Indian studies have however shown that&#xD;
      isolated HV and combined IVC+HV obstruction are now more common. [10]&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post COVID-19 era, there has been great interest in the prothrombotic states&#xD;
      associated with the SARS-Cov-2 virus infection, and the adverse effects of some vaccines.&#xD;
      [11] With the availability of better molecular tests for hypercoagulable states, use of&#xD;
      global coagulation tests (GCT) like rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM),&#xD;
      thromboelastography (TEG) and Sonoclot, use of therapeutic procedures like Transjugular&#xD;
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), availability of novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC),&#xD;
      the natural course of disease can be changed with good outcomes. [12] Standard Coagulation&#xD;
      tests (SCTs) like PT, aPTT, and platelet count are not predictive of bleeding or coagulation&#xD;
      risk as they exclude the cellular elements of hemostasis and are unable to assess the effect&#xD;
      of thrombomodulin and cannot assess the stage of the coagulation pathway which is affected.&#xD;
      Global coagulation tests provide dynamic information on the coagulation pathway that is not&#xD;
      available from conventional tests. [13]&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our proposed study is important for the following 4 reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SCTs cannot be used to demonstrate the thrombomodulin mediated normal thrombin&#xD;
           generation in patients with liver disease, so the monitoring of such patient using&#xD;
           global coagulation tests can be validated. The use of point-of-care global coagulation&#xD;
           tests like ROTEM and Sonoclot enables us to identify the true prothrombotic and&#xD;
           hypocoagulable states which can be used to assess for increased clot strength, clot&#xD;
           formation time, and indicate hyperfibrinolysis. The use of conventional tests like&#xD;
           prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time and INR cannot bolster the therapeutic&#xD;
           strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. This study will also help to determine role of global coagulation tests rather than&#xD;
           PT/INR /aPTT in monitoring the dose and response of anticoagulants like vitamin K&#xD;
           antagonists and novel oral anticoagulants (NOAC) in patients who are on therapeutic&#xD;
           anticoagulation for HVOTO/PVT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This study will also help to determine the prevalence and role of CALR, JAK2V617F,&#xD;
           factor V Leiden mutations in patients with PVT and HVOTO in our population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. We will also be prospectively assessing the rate of thrombophilia complications in the&#xD;
           Post COVID-19 era, and the study will generate information regarding new incidence of&#xD;
           PVT/HVOTO in those exposed to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the current study is the need of the hour, as we intend to assess the relevance of&#xD;
      PVT and outcomes, test the genetic predisposition of Indian patients to hyper coagulable&#xD;
      states, develop anticoagulation algorithms using NOAC, and determine the true burden on&#xD;
      disease in India.&#xD;
