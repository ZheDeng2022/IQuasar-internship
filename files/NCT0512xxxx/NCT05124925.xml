    <intervention_model_description>This is an open label study (with no control arm) with a 4-week screening period, a 6-month treatment period and a follow up period of up to 2 years after the last dose The study consists of a first Run-in Phase that includes Screening and Baseline period of 28 days. After signing the Informed Consent, participants will be assessed as per inclusion/exclusion criteria. All study participants who successfully pass the screening will be considered eligible for the baseline labial minor salivary biopsy.&#xD;
All eligible participants will then enter in the 6 months treatment period. However, only participants with a baseline labial minor salivary gland biopsy lymphocyte focus score &gt;0.5 or B/B+T ratio in the gland &gt;0.2, will have the two other biopsies taken at the end of treatment (6 months after the baseline) and end of the study (EOS) after blood B cell recovery (from 5 months up to 2 years after the last dose).</intervention_model_description>

                  (WOCBP), defined as all women physiologically capable of becoming pregnant,&#xD;
                  unless they are using highly effective methods of contraception during dosing and&#xD;
                  for 6 months after stopping of investigational medication. Highly effective&#xD;
                  contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy) total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking investigational drug. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the&#xD;
                  reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
                  assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Male sterilization (at least 6 months prior to screening and confirmed as&#xD;
                  successful). For female patients in the study, the vasectomized male partner&#xD;
                  should be the sole partner for that patient&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods&#xD;
                  of contraception or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine&#xD;
                  system (IUS) or other forms of hormonal contraception that have comparable&#xD;
                  efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal&#xD;
                  hormone contraception. In case of use of oral contraception women should have&#xD;
                  been stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking&#xD;
                  investigational drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g., age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at&#xD;
             least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
             status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she&#xD;
             considered not of child bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
             If local regulations deviate from the contraception methods listed above to prevent&#xD;
             pregnancy, local regulations apply and will be described in the informed consent form&#xD;
             (ICF).&#xD;
