  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 11 week telehealth intervention focusing on increasing physical activity in&#xD;
      adolescents who are receiving medical care for obesity. The participants will be randomized&#xD;
      into two groups: control and intervention. During the 11 weeks both groups will be contacted&#xD;
      once a week for a video call. The control group will report their past week physical activity&#xD;
      levels and the intervention group will review the material in weekly newsletters on behavior&#xD;
      changes related to physical activity. Physical activity levels will be measures before and&#xD;
      after the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a physical activity telehealth intervention will&#xD;
      increase the amount of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity among 14-17 year olds who are&#xD;
      receiving obesity treatment. A secondary purpose is to determine if a telehealth physical&#xD;
      activity intervention will impact the adolescents' body mass index (BMI) z-score who are&#xD;
      receiving treatment for obesity. The participants will complete questionnaires to measure&#xD;
      current physical activity levels, physical activity enjoyment, motivation, and strategies to&#xD;
      be active. The study investigators will also review the participants medical records to get&#xD;
      BMI. Participants will be randomized into either an intervention or standard care control&#xD;
      group at a 1:1 ratio (intervention-control). A computer-generated randomization list will be&#xD;
      created by an individual not associated with the study. The intervention will last 11 weeks,&#xD;
      and participants in the intervention group receive standard medical care and will have&#xD;
      individual weekly web-meeting using a video conferencing platform, Microsoft Teams. The&#xD;
      weekly meeting is expected to last approximately 30 minutes. During this meeting,&#xD;
      participants will report on the past week's physical activity goals, failures and successes,&#xD;
      set goals for the next week, discuss that week's behavioral strategy to promote physical&#xD;
      activity for that week, and engage around 5 minutes of physical activity. The topics that&#xD;
      will be discussed in the newsletters and weekly meetings will include behavioral strategies&#xD;
      for physical activity changes. Those in the control group will also receive standard medical&#xD;
      care and be contacted weekly for 11 weeks and will be asked about their physical activity&#xD;
      levels for the past week. These meetings will also occur using video conferencing and last 5&#xD;
      minutes. After a regular visit to the medical clinic (6 weeks from the 1st study visit) the&#xD;
      study investigators will review medical records from all participants for height, weight, and&#xD;
      BMI. About 12 weeks after the 1st study visit, during a regular clinic visit all participants&#xD;
      will complete questionnaires to measure current physical activity levels, physical activity&#xD;
      enjoyment, motivation, and strategies to be active. The study investigators will also review&#xD;
      the participants medical records to get height, weight and BMI.&#xD;
