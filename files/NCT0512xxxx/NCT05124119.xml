  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this research project will be to obtain feedback from consumers to help&#xD;
      develop a manual called I-DREM (Innovative Development of Research Engagement Manual). The&#xD;
      researchers hope to learn information from the consented participants to help map out&#xD;
      solutions to improve recruitment of African American/Black individuals into Substance Abuse&#xD;
      Disorder (SUD) clinical trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Black individuals represent 12% of the U.S. population, but only 2-3% participate in various&#xD;
      clinical trials (Byrne et al., 2014; Murthy et al., 2004). Black individuals are&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by substance use and have higher rates of associated mortality,&#xD;
      suggesting the need for action to address this racial disparity in health outcomes (Hedegaard&#xD;
      et al., 2020). Under-representation of ethnic minorities in clinical trials has significant&#xD;
      scientific implications and ultimately compromises generalizability of research findings and&#xD;
      further exacerbates existing racial health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although incremental progress has occurred since the establishment of the National Institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act, barriers that influence participation of the African&#xD;
      American and ethnic minority populations in research continue to exist. The NIH has&#xD;
      acknowledged the need for increased enrollment of ethnic minorities in research, yet minority&#xD;
      enrollment into clinical and translational research remains low (FDA, 2017). There are no&#xD;
      concrete developments (e.g., protocols, toolbox) to aid clinical researchers' effort to&#xD;
      enhance recruitment and retention to date in substance using populations despite the&#xD;
      detrimental disproportionate effects of substance use observed in the African American and or&#xD;
      Black populations. This suggests the importance of initiating more innovative ways of&#xD;
      retainment, recruitment, and education of ethnic minorities about Substance Use Disorders&#xD;
      (SUDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, almost 1 million Americans (estimated 977,000) met criteria for cocaine use&#xD;
      disorder in 2018 (Hedegaard et al., 2020). The rate of overdose deaths attributed to cocaine&#xD;
      increased by an average of 27% each year from 2012-2018, reaching a rate of 4.5 deaths per&#xD;
      100,000 standard population in 2018. This increase is a tripling in deaths from 2012-2018&#xD;
      (Hedegaard et al., 2020), and appears to be continuing to increase (Karisa, 2020). The rate&#xD;
      of death is highest among non-Hispanic Blacks at a rate of 8.3 per 100,000 population, which&#xD;
      is nearly double the rate of death attributed to cocaine among non-Hispanic Whites. This&#xD;
      differential death rate is seen despite similar rates of cocaine use among Blacks and Whites&#xD;
      (1.8 % vs 2.1%, respectively in 2018), suggesting the need for action to address this racial&#xD;
      disparity in health outcomes (Hedegaard et al., 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Nearly 40% of Americans belong to a racial or ethnic minority group. However,&#xD;
      participants in clinical trials for new pharmacotherapies skew heavily Caucasian. In the area&#xD;
      of substance use disorders, Blacks are also disproportionally affected and have higher rates&#xD;
      of associated mortality. One study using data from multiple Clinical Trials Network trials&#xD;
      showed higher rates of combined opiate and stimulant use among Black compared to White adults&#xD;
      (Brooks et al., 2013). The rate of death is also highest among Black participants using&#xD;
      cocaine at a rate of 8.3 per 100,000 population, which is nearly double the rate of death&#xD;
      attributed to cocaine among non-Hispanic Whites. This differential death rate is seen despite&#xD;
      similar rates of cocaine use among Blacks and Whites (1.8 % vs 2.1%, respectively in 2018),&#xD;
      suggesting the need for action to address this racial disparity in health outcomes (CDC,&#xD;
      2019). In general, Blacks represent 12% of the U.S. population, but only 2-3% participate in&#xD;
      various clinical trials (Byrne et al., 2014; Murthy et al., 2004; Olshan et al., 2007;&#xD;
      Olstedal et al., 2011). Under-representation of ethnic minorities in clinical trials has&#xD;
      significant scientific implications and ultimately compromises generalizability of research&#xD;
      findings and further exacerbates existing racial health disparities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: While significant attention has been devoted to identifying barriers to inclusion,&#xD;
      the current proposal seeks to redirect efforts away from documenting barriers and instead&#xD;
      towards improved recruitment and retention of Black/African American (AA) individuals into&#xD;
      Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs). This will be achieved by developing a comprehensive and&#xD;
      innovative manual that maps out concrete strategies for both increased recruitment and&#xD;
      retention in RCTs&#xD;
