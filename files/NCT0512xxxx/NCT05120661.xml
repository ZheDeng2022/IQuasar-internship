  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that person-specific factors, such as the fecal microbiome, influenced&#xD;
      postprandial glycemia. The small intestine is the site of nutrient digestion and absorption.&#xD;
      The small intestine microbiota is amendable by dietary changes, and plays a key role in host&#xD;
      adaptability to dietary variations. The role of the human small intestine microbiota in&#xD;
      regulating postprandial glycemic responses towards food products will be investigated. First&#xD;
      a screening will take place with to choose the test products that elicit most differential&#xD;
      glucose responses and to select subjects with differential postprandial response to the same&#xD;
      food product. The study will be a 6-day randomized cross-over trial with two test days. Four&#xD;
      test (food) products, each containing 50 gram carbohydrates, and an oral glucose tolerance&#xD;
      test will be provided to participants. Twenty men or women (BMI≥25 kg/m2, 40-75 years old)&#xD;
      will be included. The main study parameters/endpoints are the food product-induced plasma&#xD;
      glucose responses (iAUC) and the small intestine microbiota.&#xD;

      Rationale: It has been shown that person-specific factors, such as the fecal microbiome,&#xD;
      influenced postprandial glycemia. The small intestine is the site of nutrient digestion and&#xD;
      absorption. The small intestine microbiota is amendable by dietary changes, and plays a key&#xD;
      role in host adaptability to dietary variations. Differences in small intestine microbiota&#xD;
      are hypothesized to be key in explaining the interpersonal differences in glycemic responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To investigate the role of the human small intestine microbiota in regulating&#xD;
      postprandial glycemic responses towards food products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The subjects will wear a continuous glucose monitor during the screening and&#xD;
      the study. First a screening (14 days in total) will take place with to choose the test&#xD;
      products (2 out of 4) that elicit most differential glucose responses and to select subjects&#xD;
      with differential postprandial response to the same food product. Also an OGTT will be&#xD;
      performed. The study will be a randomized cross-over trial with two test days (length of&#xD;
      trial is 6 days in total). During the trial, the subjects will be intubated with a&#xD;
      naso-jejunum catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Twenty men or women (BMI≥25 kg/m2, 40-75 years old). Intervention (if&#xD;
      applicable): Four test (food) products, each containing 50 gram carbohydrates, and an oral&#xD;
      glucose tolerance test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: test (food) product-induced plasma glucose responses (iAUC),&#xD;
      small intestine microbiota.&#xD;
