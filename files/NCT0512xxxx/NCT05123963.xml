  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is well-known to improve skeletal muscle energy metabolism and is an established&#xD;
      intervention to improve muscle insulin sensitivity and to counter the development of type 2&#xD;
      diabetes (T2D). However, given the 24h rhythmicity in substrate metabolism previously&#xD;
      observed in healthy, lean men and the lack of such rhythmicity in men with&#xD;
      insulin-resistance, the investigator hypothesize that appropriate timing of exercise training&#xD;
      can maximize the metabolic health effects of exercise. Indeed, a preliminary study in humans&#xD;
      revealed that afternoon high-intensity interval training (HIIT) exercise was more effective&#xD;
      than morning exercise in improving 24h blood glucose levels in men with T2D. Another recent&#xD;
      study in mice showed that the time of day is a critical factor in augmenting the beneficial&#xD;
      effects of exercise on the skeletal muscle metabolome as well as on whole-body energy&#xD;
      homeostasis. However, human studies that specifically target the impact of timing of exercise&#xD;
      training on glucose homeostasis and metabolic health are scarce and the potential underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goals of this project is to improve 24-hour rhythmicity of metabolism in men&#xD;
      and women with prediabtes by appropriate timing of exercise and to assess its effect on&#xD;
      metabolic health and immune response. Acute and prolonged exercise interventions timed in the&#xD;
      morning vs late afternoon will be carried out in individuals with prediabetes to determine&#xD;
      whether acute exercise in the afternoon and prolonged exercise training in the afternoon can&#xD;
      improve peripheral insulin sensitivity, compared to exercise in the morning, and positively&#xD;
      affect adipose tissue dietary fatty acid storage and partitioning of dietary fatty acids in&#xD;
      skeletal muscles.&#xD;

      Three metabolic studies A, B and C using PET imaging will be carried out at the CRCHUS. The&#xD;
      12-week exercise training intervention will consist of supervised cycling high-intensity&#xD;
      interval training (i.e. short bouts of high-intensity exercise interspersed with short&#xD;
      periods of rest) every other day at the CRCHUS. Continuous glucose monitoring will be used to&#xD;
      measure 24h glucose profiles over 3-4 days prior to and following the acute exercise bout and&#xD;
      again during the last week of the intervention. Continuous blood pressure monitoring will be&#xD;
      used over 18-24 h, at the beginning and at the end of the 12 week-training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take part in three postprandial metabolic studies: 1) before (A); 2) 18-24h&#xD;
      after an acute exercise bout (B), and; 3) after 12-weeks of exercise training (C).&#xD;
      Experiments will be conducted between 07:30 AM and 5:00 PM, following a 12 hr fast. Adipose&#xD;
      tissue dietary fatty acid storage and partitioning of dietary fatty acids in skeletal muscles&#xD;
      will be measured by the oral [18F-]-FTHA PET method. Changes in lean tissue mitochondrial&#xD;
      function in vivo will be determined using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Participants&#xD;
      will complete Visit A (baseline), followed 7 to 14-days later by a pre-breakfast (9 AM) or&#xD;
      pre-dinner (4PM) exhaustive glycogen lowering exercise bout. The following day (18-24h after&#xD;
      the exercise bout), participants will return for a second metabolic visit (Visit B).&#xD;
      Participants will then begin a 12-week supervised high-intensity interval training program,&#xD;
      performed either only in the morning or only in the afternoon (9 AM vs. 4 PM), on every other&#xD;
      day. At the end of the 12 weeks, and at least 48h after the last exercise bout, participants&#xD;
      will return for their final metabolic visit (Visit C).&#xD;
