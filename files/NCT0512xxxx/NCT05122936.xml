      Obesity becomes a worldwide chronic health problem, including China. Meta-analyses showed in&#xD;
      recent years anti-obesity effects of Chinese herbal therapy (CHT) in overweight and obese&#xD;
      patients. However, there are still few observational studies on its effect in patients&#xD;
      undergoing CHT more than 6 months, or on its safety. This is a mono-centric, prospective&#xD;
      study conducted at Shanghai Municipal Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Patients with&#xD;
      body mass index ≥ 28 Kg/m2 and chartered by heat-dampness is consecutively recruited. All the&#xD;
      patients will undergo an integrated SRXPY-based Obesity Wellness Intervention (lifestyle&#xD;
      invention + XRXP granule). Patients will be instructed by Traditional Chinese Medicine(TCM)&#xD;
      practitioner and nutritionist. They will be investigated every 3 months, until 2 years after&#xD;
      enrollment. The study will test anti-obesity effect and safety of the integrated obesity&#xD;
      wellness intervention, and test changes of appetite, health-related quality of life, bio&#xD;
      markers as well.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obesity is a worldwide problem to public health, with a prevalence rate of 12.4% according to&#xD;
      recent studies. It is associated with a series of chronic non-communicable diseases,&#xD;
      including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver, polycystic&#xD;
      ovary syndrome, cancer, and so on. Many publications reported Chinese herbal therapy as an&#xD;
      effective anti- obesity management. However, there are still few observational studies on its&#xD;
      effect in patients undergoing Chinese herbal therapy more than 6 months, or on its safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a mono-centric, prospective study conducted at Shanghai Municipal Hospital of&#xD;
      Traditional Chinese Medicine. Patients with body mass index ≥ 28 Kg/m2 will be consecutively&#xD;
      recruited in out-patient clinic of the department of endocrinology or nutrition. Another&#xD;
      important including criteria is that each subject is supposed to be chartered by&#xD;
      heat-dampness pattern in TCM. Patients will undergo an integrated SRXPY-based obesity&#xD;
      wellness intervention(SOWI). They will report weekly diet, daytime physical activities and&#xD;
      sleeping time, by means of WeChat and Electrical bracelet. Meanwhile, TCM practitioner and&#xD;
      nutritionist will be involved in helping them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The integrated obesity wellness intervention is based on lifestyle invention and XRXP&#xD;
      granule. XRXP granule is composed of several herbs, such as Huang Qin (Baical Skullcap Root),&#xD;
      Zi Cao (Root of Sinkiang Arnebia), Hu Zhang (Rhizoma Polygoni cuspidata), Cang Shu&#xD;
      (Atractylodis Rhizoma), He Ye (Lotus Leaf), etc. Some components have been found, which can&#xD;
      ameliorate serum concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1 by stimulating gut taste receptors&#xD;
      in db/db mice. Also, XRXP granule showed anti-obesity effects (reduction of body weight, body&#xD;
      mass index and waist circumstance) in a 12-week pilot study on obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this observational study, patients will be investigated every 3 months, until 2 years&#xD;
      after enrollment. We will not only test the effect and safety, but test changes of appetite,&#xD;
      health- related quality of life, bio markers as well.&#xD;
