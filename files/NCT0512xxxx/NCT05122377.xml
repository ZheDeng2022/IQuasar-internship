      The purpose of this study is to assess the patient's feedback from using GnRHa depot&#xD;
      formulation in postoperative, premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      This was a real world, observational study of adjuvant therapy with GnRHa for OFS in&#xD;
      postoperative, premenopausal women with endocrine responsive breast cancer. This trial is&#xD;
      designed to compare patients' QOL and treatment compliance measured by FACT-B and&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires during OFS treatment period. Total score of FACT-B and&#xD;
      self-administered questionaries, and change from baseline will be calculated and summarized&#xD;
      descriptively. Change from baseline will be compared between GnRHa 3-month and GnRHa 1-month&#xD;
      using ANCOVA model with baseline value as a covariate.The number depends on the patients who&#xD;
      received questionnaire during 18 months recruitment in planned 10 sites. This analytical plan&#xD;
      assumes homogeneity across 10 sites so that strata is not considered.&#xD;
