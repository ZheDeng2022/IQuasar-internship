  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The principal aim of this study is to evaluate whether virtual CBTm is effective in improving&#xD;
      mental wellness among public safety personnel (PSP). The investigators have adapted the CBTm&#xD;
      classes to two virtual formats: 1) a facilitator-led set of virtual CBTm classes, and 2) an&#xD;
      online self-guided version of the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Can virtual CBTm increase resiliency among PSP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Does virtual CBTm improve clinical symptoms of mental and substance use disorders (e.g.,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, PTSD, alcohol abuse) among PSP? ii. Does virtual CBTm improve&#xD;
      self-perceived health-related quality of life among PSP? iii. Does virtual CBTm reduce&#xD;
      burnout among PSP?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of all primary and secondary objectives will focus on clinically significant&#xD;
      improvement in scores on well-validated measures. Steps to evaluate these objectives will&#xD;
      include: 1) Recruit a cohort of PSP; 2) Assess baseline levels of resiliency, mental health&#xD;
      symptoms, substance use, level of burnout, and current health-related quality of life; 3)&#xD;
      Randomize individuals to one of two intervention arms or a waitlist control group; 4) Deliver&#xD;
      CBTm in 2 different virtual formats; 5) Evaluate whether scores over time are significantly&#xD;
      improved among individuals in each of the virtual CBTm groups compared with the waitlist&#xD;
      control group. Comparisons of similarities and differences between the two intervention arms&#xD;
      will also be conducted, particularly in terms of feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      facilitators/barriers of the virtual format for participants. The investigators will identify&#xD;
      the demographic/symptom profiles of those who benefit most from each virtual-based CBTm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a nonblinded three-arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a 5-session CBTm program. Arm 1 will be a videoconference-based,&#xD;
      facilitator-led, group CBTm course (ZOOM); Arm 2 will be a self-guided online web-based CBTm&#xD;
      course (WEB); and Arm 3 will be a waitlist control group (WAIT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators initially developed a 4-session (90 min each) facilitator-led CBTm program.&#xD;
      As part of their initial pilot work with this population, they created a Project Advisory&#xD;
      Committee (PAC), formed of researchers and PSP stakeholders and leaders. Based on their&#xD;
      discussions with the PAC, it was recommended that a fifth class be added that focused on&#xD;
      responding to traumatic events and stress using a CBT approach along with safety planning for&#xD;
      managing crisis situations. As such, the program was adapted to a 5-session model for use in&#xD;
      PSP. Session topics are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1. Mindfulness, Basics of Cognitive Therapy, Thought Records Session 2. Mindfulness,&#xD;
      Basics of Behaviour Therapy, Exposure Therapy Session 3. Mindfulness, Healthy Activity, Sleep&#xD;
      Hygiene Session 4. Mindfulness, Goal Setting, Assertiveness Session 5. Mindfulness, Dealing&#xD;
      with Stress and Stressful Experiences, Wellness Planning&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the proposed study, Arm 1 (ZOOM) participants will be offered the opportunity to join one&#xD;
      of 2-3 weekly meeting times. Participants will be sent a link to join a Zoom videoconference&#xD;
      session at the outset of each week, allowing them to log in at their chosen time slot. These&#xD;
      meeting times will be arranged based on discussions with the PAC around optimal time slots&#xD;
      for their shift workers. Sessions will be 90 minutes in length and will be facilitated by a&#xD;
      minimum of 2 trained clinician facilitators and 1 research assistant. The session will&#xD;
      include a PowerPoint presentation of the CBTm material in a lecture format. Participants will&#xD;
      be invited and encouraged to discuss, comment and ask questions of the facilitators about the&#xD;
      material throughout the presentation. Homework will be assigned each session relating to the&#xD;
      material that was covered. Participants will have 1 week to work through and practice the&#xD;
      skills learned, and this homework will be discussed at the next session. Arm 2 (WEB)&#xD;
      participants will receive access to the online self-guided CBTm course. The material within&#xD;
      that program is identical to the material taught within the facilitator-led groups.&#xD;
      Participants will receive access to the Session 1 material upon joining the study at which&#xD;
      point they will be able to move through the material at their own pace. The material is&#xD;
      presented in a slide show format with pre-recorded audio to accompany each slide, in&#xD;
      accordance with the material that they would cover if the class was held in-person. Material&#xD;
      may be completed in a single sitting or the participant can choose to pause the session and&#xD;
      return to it at a later time. Homework will be assigned as in the ZOOM arm through online&#xD;
      forms that appear at the end of each session. These forms will be able to be completed online&#xD;
      at any point during or after the session. Handouts will be able to be printed if the&#xD;
      participant would like to complete the homework on paper. If the participant has any&#xD;
      questions, they will have access to a 'contact us' button which will allow questions to be&#xD;
      sent to the research team. These emails will be accessed daily by the research team. Some&#xD;
      questions may need to be forwarded on to facilitators or clinicians depending on the content.&#xD;
      One week after completion of Session 1, participants will receive access to Session 2. This&#xD;
      one-week timeframe prior to accessing the next session is used to mirror most closely the&#xD;
      time in which participants in the facilitator-led groups will have to practice the skills&#xD;
      learned each week before another class is held. The online CBTm course has been in&#xD;
      development through Safeandcertified.com, a company with substantial experience in developing&#xD;
      and delivering courses for workplace safety and the SafeWork initiative in Manitoba. Arm 3&#xD;
      (WAIT) participants will be assigned to a waitlist control. These individuals will not&#xD;
      receive any type of active intervention but will continue to receive mental health&#xD;
      questionnaires to complete in line with the ZOOM and WEB participants at weekly intervals.&#xD;
      These individuals will be offered a choice of videoconference CBTm or online CBTm at&#xD;
      completion of their waitlist period (6 months).&#xD;

    <description>Group-based cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment that allows service providers to interact with high volumes of individuals who need mental health support. CBT is the most well-researched and well-recognized of all psychotherapies, and is often considered the gold-standard in psychotherapy treatment. While CBT has shown efficacy in the treatment of a range of mental and substance use disorders, it has also been shown to be useful in building resiliency, being used as a tool to better cope during stressful life situations even among individuals who do not have an existing mental illness. Furthermore, research suggests that gains achieved in mental health during CBT are maintained long after treatment completion.</description>
