    <textblock>
      This study is observational study to analyze the actual overall survival of the patients who&#xD;
      did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We developed prediction model for the overall survival of these patients and validated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) after curative gastrectomy is the standard treatment for patients&#xD;
      with locally advanced gastric adenocarcinoma in East Asia; however, for various reasons, some&#xD;
      patients do not receive this treatment. The aim of this study was to develop a system that&#xD;
      reflects the survival rate of patients without AC. A survival prediction model was developed&#xD;
      based on the modified staging system and risk factors for OS, which were examined using the&#xD;
      Cox proportional hazards regression model. The model was validated for the power of&#xD;
      prediction and discrimination, compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)&#xD;
      Cancer Staging Manual 8th edition; it was externally validated using an independent dataset.&#xD;
      the newly developed survival prediction model improves the accuracy of OS prediction for&#xD;
      stage II and III gastric cancer patients without AC after curative gastrectomy.&#xD;

        Informed consent was not required because of the retrospective nature of the study. For the&#xD;
        development set, the database of the Gastric cancer center at Seoul St. Mary's hospital was&#xD;
        reviewed between January 2009 and December 2016. The inclusion criteria were:&#xD;
        histologically confirmed primary gastric adenocarcinoma, curative R0 resection with D2&#xD;
        lymph node dissection, and pathologic stage II or III. Exclusion criteria were: neoadjuvant&#xD;
        or AC treatment, follow-up loss or death within 30 days of surgery, completion of total&#xD;
        gastrectomy, and other malignancy within 5 years before gastrectomy. Finally, 185 patients&#xD;
        with locally advanced GC, all of whom underwent curative gastrectomy without chemotherapy,&#xD;
        were included in the development set. The validation set consisted of patients who&#xD;
        satisfied the above inclusion and exclusion criteria from St. Vincent's hospital in the&#xD;
        same period. Finally, 157 patients were included in the validation set&#xD;
