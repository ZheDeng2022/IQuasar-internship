      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of corticosteroidcombining&#xD;
      noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory therapy (NCSIT) for the treatment of Vogt&#xD;
      Koyanagi Harada disease (VKH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vogt Koyanagi Harada disease (VKH) is a sort of autoimmune disease directed against uveal&#xD;
      melanocytes, which is a common vision-threatening noninfectious uveitis in colored people.&#xD;
      VKH patients given prednisone monotherapy are prone to relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noncorticosteroid systemic immunomodulatory therapy (NCSIT) demonstrated inflammation control&#xD;
      and steroid-sparing effect in autoimmune diseases. Methotrexate as an antifolate metabolite&#xD;
      has been widely used for its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating properties. Adalimumab,&#xD;
      humanized monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody, have demonstrated the efficacy of noninfectious&#xD;
      uveitis. Several randomized controlled trials have proved the efficacy and safety of NCSIT&#xD;
      such as antimetabolite and biologics in non-infectious uveitis, while the optimal dose and&#xD;
      treatment course remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose to explore the effect, safety and optimal dose of prednisone&#xD;
      combining NCSIT in the treatment of VKH.&#xD;
