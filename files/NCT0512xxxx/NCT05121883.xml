  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Edaravone dexborneol, comprised of 2 active ingredients, edaravone and (+)-borneol, has been&#xD;
      developed as a novel neuroprotective agent with synergistic effects of antioxidant and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory in animal models. The TASTE trial (Treatment of Acute Ischemic Stroke with&#xD;
      Edaravone Dexborneol) administered edaravone dexborneol or edaravone alone to stroke patients&#xD;
      within 48 hours after stroke onset, finding that 90-d functional outcome was better in&#xD;
      edaravone dexborneol group. However, the TASTE trial excluded patients undergoing reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy (i.e., intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy). Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy of edaravone dexborneol in addition to mechanical&#xD;
      thrombectomy in the treatment of acute ischemic stoke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized clinical trial in multiple stroke centres of China. The&#xD;
      total sample size will be 200. Patients with anterior-circulation large artery occlusion&#xD;
      obtaining successful recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) will be assigned into&#xD;
      edaravone dexborneol or standard medication treatment group based on whether or not receiving&#xD;
      edaravone dexborneol. Only patients with edaravone dexborneol initiating within 48 hours of&#xD;
      stoke onset at 37.5 mg/dose, once every 12 hours, and continuing for more than 7 days could&#xD;
      be enrolled as edaravone dexborneol group. Patients in standard medication treatment group&#xD;
      must not receive edaravone dexborneol. Other neuroprotective agents are not limited to use.&#xD;
