  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Existing evidence has shown that medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians (MAPPs), are a&#xD;
      core function within the pharmaceutical industry. Despite their expertise, there are ongoing&#xD;
      concerns about recognition and respect for the MAPP's role within the pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industry. Anecdotal evidence further suggests that this lack of recognition and respect for&#xD;
      the valuable contribution of this specialised group of medical doctors may impact their&#xD;
      quality of life, resulting in stress, anxiety, depression and occupational burnout. Hence,&#xD;
      they are likely to use NHS services as patients, when experiencing the physical, mental, and&#xD;
      emotional issues associated with occupational burnout, an internationally recognised&#xD;
      condition (ICD-11 code QD85) resulting from chronic occupational stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will recruit participants to contribute data to creating a MAPP&#xD;
      work-related participant-reported outcome measure on the impact of work-related performance&#xD;
      on quality of life (QoL). The created MAPP work-related participant-reported measure will be&#xD;
      used longitudinally with study participants to measure their QoL monthly for 12 months. In&#xD;
      total, up to 180 Medical Affairs Pharmaceutical Physicians are expected to be recruited to&#xD;
      the study. The study will be conducted in two main phases, involving three online surveys.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase One - the development of a MAPP work-related participant-reported quality of life&#xD;
      (MAPPWrQoL) measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit between nine and 15 participants in this phase. Firstly, a novel method, the&#xD;
      Jandhyala Method [16], will be used to elicit medical affairs pharmaceutical physicians'&#xD;
      preferences for a QoL tool addressing work-related performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below is the outline of activities to be completed during Phase One:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Awareness Round survey (first survey, hosted on Survey Monkey) - asking for areas of&#xD;
           their life which the participants feel have been impacted by work-related performance,&#xD;
           including details and examples of those impacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The research team will collate and code these responses and generate a list of&#xD;
           statements based on the information provided by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Consensus Round survey (second survey, hosted on Survey Monkey) - the list of statements&#xD;
           will be sent to participants. They will be asked to rate their agreement or disagreement&#xD;
           with the inclusion of these areas in a MAPP work-related QoL tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The research team will collate this information, group it into relevant domains and&#xD;
           develop a weighting tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Weighting tool (online Microsoft excel template) - participants will be asked to assign&#xD;
           a percentage value (as weights) to the individual items and domains for the finalised&#xD;
           MAPP work-related QoL tool using an online excel spreadsheet template.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The research team will use this information to develop the finalised MAPP work-related&#xD;
           QoL measure to be completed by participants and to develop the system to score this&#xD;
           tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect the Awareness Round survey (first survey) to be completed within a month. Following&#xD;
      this, two weeks will be allocated for the research team to analyse and finalise the survey to&#xD;
      be used during the Consensus Round (second survey). The consensus Round survey will be open&#xD;
      for two weeks, and participants will be prompted after one week if yet to complete the&#xD;
      survey. We will send five reminder emails to the participants. The research team will have&#xD;
      two weeks to complete the weighting tool, and participants will be given another two weeks to&#xD;
      complete this. The research team will have an additional two weeks to finalise the MAPP&#xD;
      work-related QoL at this stage. Thus, it is expected that Phase one activities will take up&#xD;
      to 3 months to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase two - the longitudinal completion of the quality of life tool by Medical Affairs&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Physicians each month for 12 months - observational patient study&#xD;
      (MAPPWrQoLReg)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the MAPP work-related QoL tool development, we will recruit additional participants&#xD;
      to complete the developed tool monthly for 12 months. We aim to recruit a maximum of 165&#xD;
      study participants for this phase. Participants involved in Phase one will have the option to&#xD;
      continue to Phase two. However, participation in Phase two is not a criterion for&#xD;
      participation in Phase one. Recruitment will remain open for phase two for a minimum of one&#xD;
      year and then reviewed, with another year following this to gain the full 12 months of data&#xD;
      from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finalised MAPP work-related QoL measure will be hosted on a secure online system (Survey&#xD;
      Monkey), and participants will be allocated an identification (ID) record number. They will&#xD;
      be asked to complete this measure at monthly intervals for 12 months. Statistical methods for&#xD;
      this phase will be finalised when the measure has been completed at the end of phase one by&#xD;
      the Biostatistician Team at Medialis Ltd.&#xD;
