  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Forty-four patients aged 4-10 years who applied to Aydın Adnan Menderes University Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry for dental treatment under general anesthesia will be selected and divided into 2&#xD;
      groups by simple randomization. The group in which a direct laryngoscope was used for&#xD;
      intubation, which is a part of the routine general anesthesia procedure, Group DL; The group&#xD;
      in which the video laryngoscope is used will be called Group VL. Routine general anesthesia&#xD;
      procedure and dental treatments will not differ between groups. The necessity of external&#xD;
      laryngeal manipulation, intubation difficulty scale (IDS) will be evaluated and the&#xD;
      difficulty level will be determined as easy, medium and difficult. All intubations will be&#xD;
      confirmed by auscultation as part of the routine procedure.&#xD;

      Forty-four patients aged 4-10 years who applied to Aydın Adnan Menderes University Faculty of&#xD;
      Dentistry for dental treatment under general anesthesia will be included and divided into 2&#xD;
      groups randomly. The group in which a direct laryngoscope was used for intubation, which is a&#xD;
      part of the routine general anesthesia procedure, Group DL; The group in which the video&#xD;
      laryngoscope is used will be called Group VL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine general anesthesia procedure and dental treatments will not differ between groups.&#xD;
      The time from the moment the laryngoscope touches the patient until the endotracheal tube is&#xD;
      inserted and the end-tidal carbon dioxide is detected will be recorded as intubation time,&#xD;
      and the Cormack and Lehane glottic scale score will be recorded when the best glottic view is&#xD;
      obtained. The necessity of external laryngeal manipulation, intubation difficulty scale (IDS)&#xD;
      will be evaluated and the difficulty level will be determined as easy, medium and difficult.&#xD;
      All intubations will be confirmed by auscultation as part of the routine procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desaturation (SpO2 &lt; 90%) will be assessed during intubation, Hemodynamic data will be&#xD;
      recorded at four points in time: at baseline (before induction, T0); 1 min after induction&#xD;
      (T1); in intubation (T2); and 5 minutes after intubation (T3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intubation time, Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), C&amp;L grade, number of intubation attempts,&#xD;
      External Throat Manuplation, Intubation related trauma-bleeding, Intubation-related pain&#xD;
      scores will be recorded in the case report form. In addition, age, gender, weight, ASA status&#xD;
      of patients, blade and tube size, operation time, number of caries-filled extracted teeth&#xD;
      (dmft) values will also be recorded. The patient whose operation is completed will be taken&#xD;
      to the recovery room. Post-operative discomfort will be recorded in the case report form.&#xD;

The 3 classifications were as follows: if the IDS was 0 points, then it was considered an easy endotracheal intubation. If the score was 1-5 points, it was a slightly difficult intubation. More than 5 points was considered moderate-to-difficult intubation.</description>
