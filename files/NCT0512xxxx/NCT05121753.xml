  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common life-threatening gastrointestinal&#xD;
      emergency of prematurity, associated with a significant morbidity and mortality. Early&#xD;
      diagnosis and early treatment interventions may reduce the risk of mortality and morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary goal of this observational study is to gather survey data to establish a national&#xD;
      database of NEC in newborns in order to better understand the risk factors underlying NEC.&#xD;
      Survey data will be used along with a medical history to identify the mechanism(s) underlying&#xD;
      the increased prevalence of NEC in non-breast fed, formula fed premature infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NEC affects between 2 to 7% of premature infants. It is is an acquired disease, caused, in&#xD;
      part by inflammation of the intestinal lining. NEC is the most common life-threatening&#xD;
      gastrointestinal emergency of prematurity and it is associated with significant morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have linked the consumption of non-breast milk, commercial infant formula (made from&#xD;
      cow's milk) or formula-derived nutrition with increased risk of NEC compared to consumption&#xD;
      of human breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of the NEC lesions appears to involve factors including allergic reaction to&#xD;
      the infant formulas containing cow's milk, immaturity of the intestinal barrier and the&#xD;
      immune system, microvascular imbalance, disturbed gut flora and systemic inflammation that is&#xD;
      hypothesized to be exacerbated by infant formula consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this National observational study is to gather survey data in order to&#xD;
      establish a database of NEC in newborns to gain a better understanding of the risk factors&#xD;
      underlying NEC. Survey data will be used along with a medical history to identify the&#xD;
      mechanism(s) underlying the increased prevalence of NEC in non-breast fed, formula fed&#xD;
      premature infants.&#xD;
