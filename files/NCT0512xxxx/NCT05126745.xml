  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural analgesia is commonly used for pain relief in labor and involves placement of a&#xD;
      catheter in the epidural space. Failure of epidural analgesia may occur in 12-16% of epidural&#xD;
      catheter placements. It is defined as inadequate analgesia after the local anesthetic loading&#xD;
      dose, despite use of appropriate dose/concentration of local anesthetic. Failure to provide&#xD;
      adequate epidural analgesia is commonly caused by malposition of the epidural catheter. Many&#xD;
      factors may influence the position of the tip of the epidural catheter and the resulting&#xD;
      spread of local anesthetic into the epidural space, and consequently the quality of&#xD;
      analgesia. Previously, X-ray exposure was required to assess catheter position in the&#xD;
      epidural space. Recent developments have allowed the anesthesiologist to assess the catheter&#xD;
      position at the bedside after its placement, using color flow Doppler ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform an observational study to determine epidural catheter flow&#xD;
      direction in the obstetrical population using color flow Doppler ultrasound. Women who have&#xD;
      delivered under epidural analgesia, either vaginal or caesarean delivery, will be approached&#xD;
      for the study before the epidural catheter is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to determine epidural flow relative to the insertion site, describe the&#xD;
      findings and to correlate them with other clinical outcomes.&#xD;
