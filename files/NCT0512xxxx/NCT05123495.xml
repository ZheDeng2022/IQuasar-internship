  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to implement a quality improvement initiative using the device briefing&#xD;
      tool (DBT) and the Safe Surgery Checklist (SSC) and to evaluate its effect on patient safety&#xD;
      measures and on safety culture with the introduction of a new surgical device in Singapore&#xD;
      hospitals. Within eligible hospitals, J&amp;J and Ariadne Labs staff will train local&#xD;
      implementation teams to, in turn, train operating room teams to use the DBT and SSC.&#xD;
      Project-specific outcomes will be measured by neutral observers and via survey data.&#xD;
      Throughout the quality improvement initiative, hospitals will receive ongoing training and&#xD;
      coaching on their interventions and feedback on their outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Design of Quality Improvement Initiative Using a prospective observational implementation&#xD;
      design, surgical teams will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Group I will receive the complete&#xD;
      intervention, which includes implementation of the DBT from the start, and then the DBT and&#xD;
      SSC package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II does not receive the DBT alone; these teams continue with their usual care, and then&#xD;
      receive the DBT and SSC package.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device-related interruptions, non-technical skills of surgical teams, and Culture of Safety&#xD;
      Survey will be measured pre- and post-implementation of the SSC and DBT interventions, with&#xD;
      specific timing depended on group allocation. OR teams at each hospital will be observed&#xD;
      longitudinally to assess the effects of the DBT and SSC interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target Population for the Quality Improvement Initiative Participants will be members of the&#xD;
      OR team at each participating hospital. These members include practicing surgeons,&#xD;
      anesthesiologists, OR nurses, and OR staff. Hospitals will be participating institutions of&#xD;
      SingHealth and NUHS hospital clusters. J&amp;J device sales representatives (&quot;reps&quot;) will serve&#xD;
      as key trainers during the multidisciplinary trainings to use the DBT during an operation. A&#xD;
      separate implementation team will be trained by Ariadne Labs to execute the SSC at each&#xD;
      eligible hospital. Hospital leadership will be key stakeholders to engage at each hospital in&#xD;
      order to implement the DBT, team training, and SSC program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions Device Briefing Tool: a 4-item mini-checklist focused on raising OR team&#xD;
      awareness to the nuances of a new surgical device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trained J&amp;J sales reps will be responsible for training OR teams to use the DBT with the new&#xD;
      surgical device. Ariadne Labs will provide initial training to the J&amp;J reps and be available&#xD;
      for ongoing training support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safe Surgery Checklist: Developed with the World Health Organization, the SSC is a 19-item&#xD;
      checklist consisting of verbal confirmation by surgical teams of the completion of the basic&#xD;
      steps for ensuring the safe delivery of anesthesia, prophylaxis against infection, effective&#xD;
      teamwork, among other essential practices in surgery. As described elsewhere in greater&#xD;
      detail, it is used at 3 critical junctures of care: before anesthesia is administered,&#xD;
      immediately before incision is made, and before the patient is taken out of the operating&#xD;
      room. A successful implementation of the SSC is a labor-intensive iterative process that&#xD;
      includes 4 phases: prepare, own, expand, and improve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ariadne Labs will provide the specialists needed to implement the SSC and to support local&#xD;
      hospitals' implementation teams. Please refer to the SSC Implementation Guide for process&#xD;
      details in the Supplemental Materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes to Study Device-related interruptions: Any interruption in the surgical team's&#xD;
      workflow as the result of the use of the study device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-technical skills: Evaluation of OR team performance for non-technical skills (situation&#xD;
      awareness, decision-making, cooperation and teamwork, and leadership), using the NOTECHS&#xD;
      assessment, a validated rating system for intraoperative OR team behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perception of safety, i.e. &quot;safety culture&quot;: The perception of safety among members of the OR&#xD;
      team will be measured using the Culture of Safety Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site readiness assessment: We will evaluate the readiness capacity of institutions to&#xD;
      implement the DBT/SSC intervention using the Readiness Assessment Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal: Determine if the pre-intervention Readiness Assessment Tool is predictive (R2 &gt; 0.7) of&#xD;
      implementation success as gauged by the post-intervention Implementation Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility of scale: The scale of this project will be measured by the number of personnel&#xD;
      trained, the number of hospitals at which the DBT, team training, and SSC intervention is&#xD;
      implemented, and adherence rates to the intervention.&#xD;

        All surgical teams operating in participating SingHealth hospitals will be eligible.&#xD;
        Surgical teams include surgeons, anesthetists, nurses, and (in some cases) ancillary&#xD;
        providers. The patient is not included as a member of the surgical team. Patients are not&#xD;
        being evaluated as part of this study.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Refusal by any team member to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note - there are NO specific age criteria, since the unit of analysis is the surgical team&#xD;
        rather than the patient. It is highly unlikely that any surgical team member would be less&#xD;
        than 18 years of age or greater than 89 years of age, but there are no explicit age-based&#xD;
        exclusions.&#xD;
