  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional study that aims to study the prevalence of risk factors of&#xD;
      noncommunicable diseases in people aged 18 to 69 years using the standardized and adopted&#xD;
      STEPS questionnaire in the Republic of Kazakhstan.&#xD;

      The WHO STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) is a simple, standardized&#xD;
      method for collecting, analysing and disseminating data on key NCD risk factors in countries.&#xD;
      The survey instrument covers key behavioral risk factors: tobacco use, alcohol consumption,&#xD;
      physical activity, unhealthy diet, as well as key biological risk factors: overweight and&#xD;
      obesity, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, and abnormal blood lipids.&#xD;

    <description>The WHO STEPwise Approach to NCD Risk Factor Surveillance (STEPS) is a simple, standardized method for collecting, analysing and disseminating data on key NCD risk factors in countries. The survey instrument covers key behavioral risk factors: tobacco use, alcohol consumption, physical activity, unhealthy diet, as well as key biological risk factors: overweight and obesity, raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, and abnormal blood lipids. Through the use of expanded modules, the survey instrument can be expanded to cover a range of topics beyond these risk factors, such as oral health, sexual health and road safety.</description>
