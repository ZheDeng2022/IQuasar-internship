  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GoFresh is a randomized trial, testing the effects of a home-delivered DASH-patterned grocery&#xD;
      intervention on blood pressure in Black adults, residing in Boston urban food deserts.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension affects over half of Black adults in the United States - more than any other&#xD;
      group - and diet is a principal determinant of disparities in hypertension among Black&#xD;
      adults. While the DASH diet is a proven strategy for lowering blood pressure in Black adults,&#xD;
      diet disparities are increasing in urban food deserts due to poor access and the high costs&#xD;
      of healthy foods. Our proposed clinical trial will randomize 150 Black adults residing in&#xD;
      Boston urban food deserts to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 12 weeks of dietitian-assisted, DASH grocery delivery via an online, virtual grocery&#xD;
           store at an amount sufficient to replace all Calorie needs of each participant, allowing&#xD;
           for some sharing with family members&#xD;
&#xD;
           or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-directed shopping with a monthly stipend over a 3-month period&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 12-week intervention phase, participants will undergo a 9-month observation phase.&#xD;
      At 3-months after the intervention is complete the investigators will repeat in-person study&#xD;
      assessments and perform qualitative interviews in a subset of the population to determine&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to intermediate-term maintenance of the intervention. At 9-months&#xD;
      after the intervention, participants will participate in a phone visit designed to assess&#xD;
      longer-term maintenance of the intervention.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will order groceries sufficient to meet their caloric needs each week for 12 weeks with the assistance of a dietitian/nutrition interventionist. Groceries will be delivered to participants' homes or picked up at a convenient location. The dietitian/nutrition interventionist will provide brief educational content at the time of food delivery. Orders will be placed via phone or through virtual counseling sessions. During the remainder of the study (months 4-12), participants will be asked to apply what they learned without the provision of groceries.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive a monthly stipend over a 3 month period and some basic information about healthy eating. The stipend is not restricted to foods.

    <description>The DASH (&quot;Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension&quot;), is a healthy dietary pattern that lowers blood pressure without reducing weight. The DASH diet emphasizes fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products; includes whole grains, poultry, fish, and nuts; and is reduced in red meat, sweets, and sugar-containing beverages.&#xD;
Intervention Phase:&#xD;
This intervention is a weekly, 12-week DASH dietary intervention. A dietitian will assist participants in ordering groceries in a pattern consistent with the DASH diet to be delivered to their homes. The quantity of groceries will be based on participant Calorie needs and family size.&#xD;
Observation Phase:&#xD;
For months 4-12 of the study, participants will be asked to continue following a DASH grocery shopping pattern without the provision of weekly groceries.</description>
