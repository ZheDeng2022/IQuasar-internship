  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, two-arm, randomized multicenter study to investigate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics (PK), and potential interactions between dolutegravir (DTG) and&#xD;
      rifapentine (RPT) during pregnancy in people with HIV when RPT is given with isoniazid (INH)&#xD;
      daily for 4 weeks (1HP) or weekly for 3 months (3HP) as part of tuberculosis (TB) preventive&#xD;
      therapy (TPT). Adults (age â‰¥18) who are pregnant with a singleton pregnancy (confirmed by&#xD;
      ultrasound) at a gestational age of 20-34 weeks and virally suppressed on an existing&#xD;
      DTG-based plus two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) antiretroviral (ART)&#xD;
      regimen for at least four weeks may participate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Enrolled participants will be randomized 1:1 to Arms 1 and 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 1: 1HP (n=126):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will start twice-daily DTG on Day 0, and will receive once-daily HP for 28 total&#xD;
      doses, starting on Day 1. HIV viral load (VL) will be measured at baseline (screening), week&#xD;
      3 (Day 17), at delivery, and post-partum week 12. Safety labs: complete blood count (CBC),&#xD;
      urea and electrolytes (U&amp;E), creatinine, prothrombin time and international normalized ratio&#xD;
      (PT/INR), and liver function tests (LFT) will be obtained at screening for everyone and at&#xD;
      follow-up visits, if clinically indicated; CBCs and LFTs will be checked at delivery in all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 25 participants enrolled to Arm 1 who consent to be in a PK substudy will&#xD;
      participate in sparse PK blood collections for DTG. Sparse PK sampling for DTG will be&#xD;
      performed on the morning of Day 1, before starting 1HP and before the morning dose of DTG.&#xD;
      Additional sparse PK sampling for DTG will be performed prior to DTG dosing on Day 17 (to&#xD;
      track with 72 hours after the 3rd dose of HP in Arm 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A plasma specimen for RPT PK will also be collected on Day 17.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm 2: 3HP (n=126):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will start twice-daily DTG on Day 0, and will receive once-weekly HP for 12&#xD;
      total doses starting on Day 1. HIV VL will be measured at baseline (screening), week 3 (Day&#xD;
      17), at delivery, and at post-partum week 12. Safety labs: CBC, U&amp;E, creatinine, PT/INR, and&#xD;
      LFTs will be obtained at screening for everyone and at follow-up visits, if clinically&#xD;
      indicated; CBCs and LFTs will be drawn at delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 25 participants enrolled to Arm 2 who consent to be in a PK substudy will&#xD;
      participate in sparse PK blood collections for DTG. Sparse PK sampling for DTG will be&#xD;
      performed on the morning of Day 1, before starting 3HP, and before the morning dose of DTG.&#xD;
      Additional sparse PK sampling for DTG will be performed on Day 17 prior to DTG dosing (72&#xD;
      hours after the 3rd dose of HP) and on Day 52 prior to DTG dosing (72 hours after the 8th&#xD;
      dose of HP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will not be plasma collection on Day 17 for RPT PK in Arm 2, because specimen&#xD;
      collection would be 72 hours after the weekly HP dose and a RPT level will likely not be&#xD;
      detectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will occur when 25 participants each from Arms 1 and 2 have completed the&#xD;
      Week 3 (Day 17) sparse PK visit. Ongoing enrolment will not be paused during the interim&#xD;
      analysis, which will assess DTG PK, safety, and VL data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be paused if accrual to each arm reaches 101 participants before the interim&#xD;
      analysis has been completed. Once results are available, then enrollment will restart with&#xD;
      dosing (daily vs. BID) based on the DTG PK results.&#xD;
