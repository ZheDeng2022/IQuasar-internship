  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oncolytic viruses can selectively replicate in and destroy tumor cells. Recent studies&#xD;
      indicate that recombinant human adenovirus type 5 (H101), which is the first approved&#xD;
      oncolytic virus drug in the world, shows anti-tumor effects on liver cancer. This study aims&#xD;
      to further verify the effect and safety of recombinant human adenovirus type 5 combined with&#xD;
      HAIC in the treatment of intrahepatic mass-forming cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a perspective, single-arm trial. According to previous studies, the PFS of HAIC for&#xD;
      unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma is approximately 8 - 10 months, and one year&#xD;
      progression free rate is about 40%. We assumed that the study could detect 20% absolute&#xD;
      difference and 1 year PFS rate could achieve 60% PFS by (FOLFOX + H101) over conventional&#xD;
      HAIC (FOLFOX). Simon's two-stage design is used to estimate the sample size, with α value of&#xD;
      0.05 and power of 0.9. A total sample size of 66 participants are required.&#xD;
