      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore effects of ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane block with compound&#xD;
      lidocaine and esketamine on postoperative pain after colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor post-surgical pain control is a leading factor that hinders the physical rehabilitation,&#xD;
      and causes acute cognitive impairment and chronic pain syndrome. Recently, the multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia strategies to minimise opioid related side effects are highly desirable in open&#xD;
      surgical procedures. The transversus abdominis plane block is a novel technique involving&#xD;
      injection of local anaesthetic between the internal oblique and the transversus abdominis&#xD;
      muscles of the abdominal wall. Although ropivacaine is most commonly used for this technique,&#xD;
      the analgesic duration remains not dissatisfied. Compared with ropivacaine, compound&#xD;
      lidocaine injection has a better and longer analgesic activity since it contains menthol and&#xD;
      ethanol with appropriate concentrations. However, whether compound lidocaine injection is&#xD;
      efficiency in the transversus abdominis plane block for abdominal surgery lacks&#xD;
      investigations. Herein, we will evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound-guided transversus&#xD;
      abdominis plane (USG-TAP) block with compound lidocaine injection and esketamine for&#xD;
      postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery.&#xD;

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Normalized Area of Hyperalgesia Around the Incision</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The skin around the incision is stimulated in steps of 5 mm at intervals of 1 s starting outside of the hyperalgesic area in the direction of the incision. The distance from the incision to the first point where a 'painful', 'sore' or 'sharper'feeling occurred is measured and noted. This measurement is repeated at predefined radial lines around the incision. To eliminate the variable length of incision, this length is subtracted from the longer diameter leaving four radial distances from the end and from the middle of the incision. The normalized area of hyperalgesia is calculated by summing up the areas of the remaining four triangles measured by and Von Frey filament.</description>
