  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) consists of kidney damage, with a consequent progressive and&#xD;
      irreversible loss of kidney function. In the early stages of the disease, there is already a&#xD;
      reduction in circulating levels of α-klotho protein, which is related to worsening renal&#xD;
      function. Therapeutic strategies that increase serum α-klotho levels can be of great value in&#xD;
      the treatment of CKD. Electrical stimulation contributes to the reduction of reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species, DNA damage and improves the efficiency rate of dialysis, suggesting a systemic&#xD;
      effect in patients with end-stage CKD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      bioelectric stimulation on renal function and physical capacity in patients with CKD. For&#xD;
      this, patients will be randomized into bioelectric stimulation or a control group.&#xD;
      Bioelectric stimulation will be performed three times a week for eight weeks. The control&#xD;
      group will only be evaluated and re-evaluated. The following pre-and post-intervention&#xD;
      assessments will be performed: analysis of the plasma content of α-Klotho and soluble&#xD;
      creatinine to assess renal function, six-minute walk test to assess functional capacity;&#xD;
      dosage of interleukins and tumor necrosis factor to analyze the inflammatory profile; sit and&#xD;
      stand test with 10 repetitions and load cell dynamometry to assess lower limb muscle strength&#xD;
      and application of the EuroQoL-5D questionnaire for quality of life. Biochemical analyzes for&#xD;
      renal function and inflammatory profile will also be performed after four weeks of follow-up.&#xD;

    <description>The sessions will include 20 minutes for stimulation of the thigh muscles and 45 minutes for stimulation of the kidneys. The electrodes will be placed on the motor point of the quadriceps muscle in both lower limbs. The neuromuscular electric stimulation will be applied by symmetrical biphasic pulsed current, at an 80 Hz frequency, 400 ms pulse width, 10 s contraction time, rest time decreasing as the protocol advanced, at reciprocal mode. The intensity will be individually adjusted to produce visible muscle contraction. Concomitant, two electrodes will be placed in the abdominal corresponding to the kidney anatomical site and two electrodes on the dorsal region at the level of the 10th thoracic vertebra. The stimulation of the kidneys will include in addition to Klotho, precise signals for several pro-regenerative proteins. The intensity of the electric current will be individually adjusted to sensory stimulation.</description>
