    <textblock>
      This experimental study aims to investigate the effect of different types of educational&#xD;
      interventions on overcoming Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine hesitancy among the&#xD;
      Higher School of Economics (HSE) bachelor students in Russia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The researchers aim to investigate the effectiveness of three types of educational&#xD;
      interventions on overcoming COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the HSE bachelor students. The&#xD;
      study design implies the comparison of three types of educational interventions which differ&#xD;
      in the message that they deliver to the participants: the personal, the social, and a&#xD;
      combination of the two. The effects of these interventions will be compared to the control&#xD;
      group with no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in these three experimental groups will receive a link to an educational video&#xD;
      about the benefits and costs of vaccination against COVID-19. The videos for the three groups&#xD;
      will contain information about vaccination, but each of them will have a different focus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be hired on a voluntary basis. All the participants will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form, and the measures will be taken to ensure that their personal data will&#xD;
      be protected.&#xD;
