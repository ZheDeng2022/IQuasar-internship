  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Apnoeic oxygenation refers to oxygenation that occurs through the insufflation of oxygen into&#xD;
      the lungs in the absence spontaneous respiration or positive pressure ventilation. It is used&#xD;
      to extend the time to desaturation at induction of anaesthesia and as a primary oxygenation&#xD;
      technique during airway surgery. The impact of high-flow nasal oxygen flow rate selection on&#xD;
      gas exchange is poorly understood. Participants in this study will be randomised to receive a&#xD;
      certain nasal oxygen flow rate during apnoea and its effect on gas exchange will be measured&#xD;
      by blood gas analysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apnoeic oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen has been proposed to result in carbon dioxide&#xD;
      clearance. However, this has been poorly quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare use of nasal oxygen at different flow rates during apnoea with that&#xD;
      of a control that does not receive nasal oxygen. Participants are anaesthetised after&#xD;
      standardised pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen, after which they will receive one&#xD;
      of three nasal oxygen flow rates (0, 70, 120 L/min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of carbon dioxide elevation will be measured by arterial blood gas analysis after&#xD;
      the onset of apnoea and compared between the three groups to discern the relative rates of&#xD;
      carbon dioxide clearance after the first minute of apnoea. The effect of nasal oxygen flow&#xD;
      rate on oxygenation will also be measured.&#xD;

    <description>After 2mins 45 seconds of pre-oxygenation with high-flow nasal oxygen at Fio2 1.0 at 50L/min, anaesthesia is induced with 1-1.5mcg/kg remifentanil plus 2-3mg/kg propofol. Propofol (10mg/kg/hr) and remifentanil (0.15mcg/kg/min) infusions administered until study conclusion.&#xD;
At the onset of apnoea, 1mg/kg rocuronium administered. Jaw thrust performed. High-flow nasal oxygen adjusted to the randomised flow rate. Videolaryngoscopy after 1 minute of apnoea. Airway patency maintained. Tracheal intubation after 4 minutes of apnoea.&#xD;
Positive pressure ventilation commenced at Spo2 92%. Failure to obtain view of glottis with videolaryngoscope results in withdrawal from the study.&#xD;
Blood samples obtained from an arterial catheter immediately prior to commencing pre-oxygenation, after 90 and 180 seconds of pre-oxygenation, after each minute of apnoea until six minutes of apnoea, and every two minutes of apnoea thereafter, until Spo2 92%.</description>
