      This study is aimed to determine the effect of abdominal massage on excretory activity and&#xD;
      pulmonary function tests (PFT) in patients undergoing PKP.&#xD;

      Methods: The research will be carried out with 78 patients who underwent partial hip&#xD;
      replacement. Patients were assigned to study (abdominal massage) and control groups by&#xD;
      randomization. Abdominal massage will be applied to the patients at least 30 minutes after&#xD;
      the morning and evening meals (08:30 in the morning, 20:30 in the evening) for 15 minutes,&#xD;
      similar to the literature. Patients' data will be collected 15 minutes before and after the&#xD;
      application of abdominal massage. Within the scope of the patient's data, information on&#xD;
      pulmonary function test values, intra-abdominal pressure value and excretory activities will&#xD;
      be collected. Abdominal massage will start in the evening of the day the patient is&#xD;
      transferred to the clinic (20:30), and will be terminated when the patient defecates. No&#xD;
      treatment will be applied to the patients in the control group. The data recorded before and&#xD;
      after the abdominal massage in the study group will be recorded in the Excretory Activity&#xD;
      Form and the Pulmonary Function Test Form as a result of the measurements made at the same&#xD;
      time in the control group.&#xD;

    <masking_description>According to the randomization table, the information showing the patients included in the research sample is assigned to the A and B groups will be put in an opaque envelope. This envelope will be kept by the coordinator researcher (GAU) and when the researcher (CK) goes to the patient for application, after filling out the &quot;Informed Voluntary Consent Form&quot;, he will open the envelope and learn which group is in which group. Due to the nature of the study, patients and the researcher (CK) will not be blinded, since abdominal massage will be applied only to the patients included in the study. When the research is completed, the data will be transferred to the computer environment by a statistician who does not know the A and B groups, and the data will be analyzed by a statistician independent of the research and the findings will be reported. Thus, the data analysis and statistics phase will be blind to group assignment.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Intra-abdominal Pressure Value</measure>
    <time_frame>up to first defecation an average of 3 days</time_frame>
    <description>Intra-abdominal pressure measurement will be performed using the existing urinary catheter in the patient. This measurement method, which is performed through the bladder, is accepted as the gold standard for intra-abdominal pressure measurement because it is an easy-to-apply and minimally invasive procedure [25,43]. The investigator (CK) will measure the intra-abdominal pressure via a sterile single-transducer pressure monitoring set, which will be attached to the patient's urinary catheter at one end and to a portable monitor capable of measuring pressure at the other end. The measured value will be recorded in Excretory Activities Form.</description>

    <description>Abdominal massage will be applied to patients at least 30 minutes after morning and evening meals (8:30 in the morning, 20:30 in the evening) for 15 minutes each, similar to the literature [33,34,38]. Data of the patients will be collected again 15 minutes after the application of abdominal massage (09:00-09:15 in the morning, 21:00-21:15 in the evening). Abdominal massage will start in the evening of the day the patient is transferred to the clinic (20:30), and will be terminated when the patient defecates. In order to stimulate bowel movements, four basic movements will be used in the abdominal massage to be applied clockwise: superficial effusion, deep effusion, petrissage, and vibration.</description>
