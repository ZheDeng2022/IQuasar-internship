    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of experimental mouth rinse&#xD;
      formulations compared to a hydroalcohol control mouth rinse and a positive control mouth&#xD;
      rinse for the reduction of gingivitis and plaque when used as an adjunct to tooth brushing&#xD;
      during a twelve-week product usage period.&#xD;

    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean Modified Gingival Index (MGI) Score After 12 Weeks of Product use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed by the MGI on the buccal and lingual marginal gingivae and interdental papillae of all scorable teeth: 0 (Normal [absence of inflammation]), 1 (Mild inflammation [slight change in color, little change in texture] of any portion of the entire gingival unit); 2 (Mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit); 3 (Moderate inflammation [moderate glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy] of the gingival unit); 4 (Severe inflammation [marked redness and edema/hypertrophy, spontaneous bleeding, or ulceration] of the gingival unit).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean Plaque Index (TPI) Score After 12 Weeks of Product use</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque area will be scored by the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index, on 6 surfaces (distobuccal, midbuccal and mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual) of all scorable teeth, following disclosing: 0 (No Plaque); 1 (Separate flecks or discontinuous band of plaque around the gingival (cervical) margin); 2 (Thin (up to 1 millimeter [mm]), continuous band of plaque at the gingival margin); 3 (Band of plaque wider than 1mm but less than1/3 of the surface); 4 (Plaque covering 1/3 or more, but less than 2/3 of the surface); 5 (Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the surface).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean TPI Score After 1 and 4 Weeks of Product use</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 1 and 4</time_frame>
    <description>Plaque area will be scored by the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index, on 6 surfaces (distobuccal, midbuccal and mesiobuccal, distolingual, midlingual and mesiolingual) of all scorable teeth, following disclosing: 0 (No Plaque); 1 (Separate flecks or discontinuous band of plaque around the gingival (cervical) margin); 2 (Thin [up to 1 mm], continuous band of plaque at the gingival margin); 3 (Band of plaque wider than 1mm but less than1/3 of the surface); 4 (Plaque covering 1/3 or more, but less than 2/3 of the surface); 5 (Plaque covering 2/3 or more of the surface).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-mouth Mean MGI Score After 4 Weeks of Product Use</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Gingivitis will be assessed by the MGI on the buccal and lingual marginal gingivae and interdental papillae of all scorable teeth: 0 (Normal [absence of inflammation]), 1 (Mild inflammation [slight change in color, little change in texture] of any portion of the entire gingival unit); 2 (Mild inflammation of the entire gingival unit); 3 (Moderate inflammation [moderate glazing, redness, edema, and/or hypertrophy] of the gingival unit); 4 (Severe inflammation [marked redness and edema/hypertrophy, spontaneous bleeding, or ulceration] of the gingival unit).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Whole-Mouth Mean Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index (EBI) Score at 4 and 12 Weeks of Product use</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Bleeding will be assessed according to the EBI, 168 Sites. A periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 6 gingival areas (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual, mid-lingual, and mesiolingual) around each tooth will be assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit will be recorded according to the following scale: 0 (Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds); 1 (Bleeding after 30 seconds); 2 (Immediate bleeding).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Bleeding Sites, Based on the EBI Score at 4 and 12 Weeks of Product use</measure>
    <time_frame>Weeks 4 and 12</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of bleeding sites will be calculated by taking the total number of sites with bleeding score greater than 0 divided by the total number of sites assessed for each participant. Bleeding will be assessed according to the Expanded Gingival Bleeding Index, 168 Sites. A periodontal probe with a 0.5 mm diameter tip will be inserted into the gingival crevice and swept from distal to mesial around the tooth at an angle of approximately 60 degrees, while in contact with the sulcular epithelium. Each of 6 gingival areas (distobuccal, mid-buccal, mesiobuccal, distolingual, mid-lingual, and mesiolingual) around each tooth will be assessed. After approximately 30 seconds, bleeding at each gingival unit will be recorded according to the following scale: 0 (Absence of bleeding after 30 seconds); 1 (Bleeding after 30 seconds); 2 (Immediate bleeding).</description>
