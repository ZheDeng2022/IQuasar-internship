      A Clinical Study to Evaluate the Immunogenicity and Safety of Sequential Immunization of&#xD;
      Recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Fusion Protein Vaccine (V-01) Against COVID-19 in Healthy Adults Aged&#xD;
      18 Years and Older After the Vaccination of 2 Doses of Inactivated Vaccines&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, open-label clinical study. 45 participants aged 18 years and older who&#xD;
      have completed the 2 doses of administration of inactive vaccines will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of V-01.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be collected blood before immunization, on day 7, day 14, day 28 and 6&#xD;
      month to evaluate humoral immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events (AEs) within 30 minutes and 0-7 days after booster immunization, and&#xD;
      unsolicited AEs from 8 to 28 days after booster immunization, as well as SAEs and AESIs from&#xD;
      the first vaccination to 12 months after booster immunization will be collected from all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
