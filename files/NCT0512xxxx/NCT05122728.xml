  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal injuries (MSKI) and traumatic brain injury (TBI) are the signature injuries&#xD;
      of the ongoing military conflicts. MSKI affect 800,000 Service Members annually and TBI have&#xD;
      impacted more than 350,000 in the past 19 years and account for 22% of all combat casualties.&#xD;
      Concussion, a mild form of TBI, increases MSKI risk in physically active individuals,&#xD;
      including Service Members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to identify the neuromuscular control mechanisms that&#xD;
      increase MSKI risk following concussion. It is hypothesized that concussed individuals will&#xD;
      display abnormal neuromuscular function that increases MSKI risk, as compared to&#xD;
      non-concussed controls. The study will employ a multi-center, prospective, case-matched&#xD;
      control observational study to identify the differences in neuromuscular function following&#xD;
      concussion that may contribute to increased MSKI risk. Once the neuromuscular control&#xD;
      mechanisms that increase MSKI risk following concussion are identified, targeted risk&#xD;
      mitigation strategies can be developed to reduce MSKI risk.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Musculoskeletal injuries are the greatest unsolved public health problem facing the military&#xD;
      and significantly diminish Service member's medical readiness. MSKI affect 800,000 Service&#xD;
      members and result in 25 million limited-duty days annually. Additionally, among civilians&#xD;
      peers, sport-related MSKI affect as many as 12 million people annually. In total, MSKI place&#xD;
      a significant burden on military and civilian populations, with a combined financial burden&#xD;
      of more than $980 billion per year in the US alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injuries (TBI), specifically concussions a mild form of TBI, have been&#xD;
      classified by the National Institutes of Health and Centers for Disease Control as a &quot;serious&#xD;
      health problem&quot; in the US. TBIs have impacted more than 350,000 Service members in the past&#xD;
      19 years. Concussions negatively affect individuals' quality of life, as assessed by patient&#xD;
      report outcome (PRO) psychosocial measures, including worse scores for measures of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, fatigue, anger, and pain immediately following concussion, as compared to when&#xD;
      they are cleared to return-to-duty/activity (RTD/A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Musculoskeletal injury (MSKI) risk is increased following RTD/A after concussion. However,&#xD;
      despite the well-documented increased MSKI risk following concussion, the underlying&#xD;
      neuromuscular mechanisms contributing to this increased risk have yet to be definitively&#xD;
      determined. The underlying mechanism contributing to increased MSKI risk is likely a&#xD;
      multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive study to identify all of the factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Understanding the neuromuscular control deficits that persist after concussion and how these&#xD;
      deficits change over time (longitudinally) will greatly expand the existing knowledge of why&#xD;
      individuals are at greater MSKI risk following concussion. Thus, the overall objective is to&#xD;
      elucidate the neuromuscular control mechanisms that contribute to increase MSKI risk&#xD;
      following concussion so that effective MSKI risk mitigation strategies can be developed. The&#xD;
      study team hypothesizes that concussed individuals will display aberrant neuromuscular&#xD;
      control function that increases MSKI risk, as compared to non-concussed controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will address the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: Determine the neuromuscular control factors that differ between concussed&#xD;
      and non-concussed military Service Members and physically active civilians that may&#xD;
      contribute to MSKI risk after concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #1: Concussed individuals will display aberrant neuromuscular functioning (e.g.,&#xD;
      atypical joint loading, slower time to stabilization, lower muscular twitch interpolation)&#xD;
      that increases MSKI risk following RTD/A as compared to non-concussed controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Determine the differences in patient reported outcome (PRO) measures between&#xD;
      military Service Members and physically active civilians with and without concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis #2: Concussed individuals will report worse functioning on PRO measures (e.g.,&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System&#xD;
      [PROMIS] and psychological resiliency) as compared to non-concussed matched controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Aim #1: Determine the time-dependent changes in neuromuscular control factors&#xD;
      following concussion (initial, 6-week post-initial, 12-week post-initial) for concussed and&#xD;
      non-concussed military Service Members and physically active civilians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis #1: Concussed individuals will display greater changes, regressing&#xD;
      toward the non-concussed population, in neuromuscular control (e.g., joint loading, time to&#xD;
      stabilization, muscular twitch interpolation) from initial-to-6-week and initial-to-12-week&#xD;
      measures as compared to non-concussed controls (anticipate non-significant changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multi-center prospective, case-matched control observational study to identify the&#xD;
      differences in neuromuscular function following concussion that may contribute to increased&#xD;
      MSKI risk. A convenience sample of concussed Service Members and physically active civilians&#xD;
      who have been medically cleared to RTD/A and sex, age, occupation, and physical activity&#xD;
      matched non-concussed controls will complete the study procedures described below: 1) within&#xD;
      5 days of being medically cleared for full RTD/A (&quot;initial&quot;); 2) 6 weeks post-initial&#xD;
      neuromuscular control assessment (&quot;6-week post-initial&quot;; ±72 hours); and 3) 12 weeks&#xD;
      post-initial neuromuscular control assessment (&quot;12-week post-initial&quot;; ±72 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concussed and non-concussed matched control participants will complete the same dynamic&#xD;
      movement assessment, neuromuscular testing, and sensory assessment batteries. Control&#xD;
      participants will complete the battery at the same time intervals as their concussed&#xD;
      counterpart, ± 72 hours. Full-body kinematics will be tracked via stereophotogrammetric&#xD;
      motion capture systems and kinetic measures will be captured via 6-degree-of-freedom force&#xD;
      platforms. Peak isometric strength and voluntary muscle activation, via the interpolated&#xD;
      twitch technique (ITT), and muscular ramp contraction assessment of the dominant and&#xD;
      non-dominant knee extensors and plantar flexors will be assessed via a dynamometer. The&#xD;
      sensory assessments will examine proprioception and light touch sensation. The proprioception&#xD;
      assessments will utilize the three-dimensional motion capture equipment (closed chain) and&#xD;
      the dynamometer (open chain). The light touch sensation will utilize Semmes-Weinstein&#xD;
      Monofilaments to assess the participant's ability to detect various sensory thresholds on the&#xD;
      foot. Additionally, study participants will self-report any MSKI they sustain and&#xD;
      psychosocial measures monthly for up to 1-year following the initial neuromuscular control&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data and Statistical Analysis Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collapsed across trials for all for multi-trial assessments for each data&#xD;
      collection time point (initial, 6-Week post-initial, 12-Week post-initial). The time from&#xD;
      initial concussion diagnosis until the first data collection time point (&quot;initial&quot;),&#xD;
      over-ground gait velocity, and potentially limb dominance will be utilized as a covariates&#xD;
      for all statistical analyses. Other covariates, including sex, age, occupation, and physical&#xD;
      activity will be explicitly controlled between groups by the matching procedure used in the&#xD;
      study design and will therefore be unlikely to contribute to any observed effects; however,&#xD;
      the study team will evaluate the importance of these variables in each analysis. These&#xD;
      covariates will initially be included in each model, when appropriate; however, if a&#xD;
      covariate accounts for little or no variance (p &gt; 0.2), it will be removed from the models.&#xD;
      For all statistical analyses, statistical significance will be set a priori as α ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim #1, generalized linear mixed effects models including the fixed effects of&#xD;
      study group (concussed group; non-concussed control group) and the random (subject-level)&#xD;
      effect of participant will determine whether there is a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between concussed and non-concussed matched controls in each biomechanical outcome collected&#xD;
      during the movement assessments, while accounting for the aforementioned covariates. Models&#xD;
      will be generated for each movement assessment. Additionally, the models exploring gait&#xD;
      variables will include task complexity (single-task vs dual-task) to determine whether there&#xD;
      is a statistically significant difference in performance in regards to task complexity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Specific Aim #2, generalized linear models including group (concussed group;&#xD;
      non-concussed control group) as the independent variable and each PRO as the dependent&#xD;
      variable to determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in&#xD;
      self-reported function and symptoms between concussed and non-concussed matched controls for&#xD;
      each PRO. These models will include similar covariates as were used to analyze Specific Aim&#xD;
      #1. For ordinal outcomes, the study team will use cumulative link models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Exploratory Aim #1, generalized linear mixed effects models treating time as both a fixed&#xD;
      effect and including a random slope of time by participant, and fixed effects of group&#xD;
      (concussed and non-concussed matched control), time point (initial, 6-Week post-initial,&#xD;
      12-Week post-initial), the interaction of group and time, as well as other covariates as&#xD;
      previously described will determine whether there is a statistically significant difference&#xD;
      between concussed and non-concussed matched controls in the outcomes of interest over time.&#xD;
      Planned comparisons will evaluate between group differences at each time point. The study&#xD;
      team will also analyze loss to follow up (&quot;attrition&quot;), to identify if any trends in&#xD;
      performance on any of the biomechanical measures or PRO relate to the likelihood of study&#xD;
      dropout. If no trends in missing data are observed, participants with at least one follow-up&#xD;
      session will be included in all analyses.&#xD;

    <description>The participant will stand on a 30cm tall box, set at a distance that is equal to 50% of the participant's height behind a set of force platforms. Once the participant receives a visual stimulus, he/she will jump so that both feet leave the box at the same time. The participant will jump off the box and land on a single leg. Immediately upon landing, the participant will cut at a 45° angle (marked with tape on floor) in the direction provided by the study team prior to the trial (cut towards dominant = land on non-dominant foot; cut towards non-dominant = land on dominant foot). Participants will complete 5 trials cutting in each direction (10 total trials). Whole body biomechanics will be collected and kinematic and kinetic measures will be identified at initial ground contact (&quot;initial contact&quot;), the peak angle (&quot;max&quot;) during the &quot;landing phase&quot; of the initial landings of the anticipated cutting tasks, and the difference between these angles (&quot;displacement&quot;).</description>

    <description>Participants will complete over-ground gait trials at self-selected walking speed. Participants will start approximately 3m in front of the force platforms so that he/she is at a steady walking speed by the time the participant's foot makes contact with a force platform. No verbal instructions will be provided to indicate that clean foot strikes are required, and participants will be instructed to look straight ahead while walking (i.e., minimizing &quot;targeting&quot;). Participants will complete 5 gait trials so that each foot makes contact with the force platform (10 total trials) for both tasks. Gait velocity, center of mass displacement, and center of mass velocity will be collected from these tasks.</description>

    <description>Participants will be seated in the dynamometer so that the axis of rotation of the participants' knees and ankles coincide with the servomotor. Participants will be secured to the chair using seat belts along the chest, thigh, and ankle. Adhesive stimulating electrodes will be placed on the skin overlying the distal vastus medialis muscle and proximal vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh, and distal and proximal gastrocnemius muscles of the calf, and will be controlled by electrical stimulators. Participants will perform a maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC). During the MVIC, the muscle group will be stimulated with a paired-pulse stimulation, and the increase in torque over the MVIC level (i.e., interpolated twitch torque [ITT]) will be recorded. Following the MVIC, the paired-pulsed stimulation will be administered again (twice) to the relaxed muscle to determine peak electrically-evoked twitch torque (EET).</description>

    <description>The participant will stand with feet shoulder-width apart, feet (toes) pointed anteriorly, heels on the floor, and arms extended overhead. Participants will be asked to squat in a deep, slow, and controlled manner, to what they believe is 60-degrees of knee flexion and to hold that position for 5 seconds. Participants will then return to a full, upright position, march in place 10 times (5 each leg), and regain the original starting position. Participants will then be asked to replicate the same knee joint angle as they did in their initial trials. Participants will perform 3 trials following the initial trial (4 total trials).</description>

    <description>Participants will report all of their previous MSKI sustained within 1- year prior to enrollment into the study and any &quot;severe&quot; MSKI they have sustained that resulted in 3 or more consecutive weeks of missed physical activity. Participants will also self-report if they sustain any new MSKIs during the study follow-up period. MSKIs will be operationally defined as: 1) a MSKI that required the participant to seek medical attention from a healthcare provider; or 2) a MSKI that required the participant to not participate in normal physical activity for 3 or more consecutive days. The following information will be self-reported for each injury: 1) date of injury; 2) activity at the time of injury; 3) mechanism of injury (overuse, traumatic); 4) if the injury is recurrent (i.e., previously experienced); and 5) if the MSKI resulted in less than or more than 1 week of missed or altered physical activity.</description>
