  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The number of adolescents engaging in a transidentity journey has been increasing rapidly&#xD;
      over the last decade. However, the knowledge of the medical world concerning the&#xD;
      specificities of these adolescents is still too little in France. The objective of this study&#xD;
      is to refine the knowledge of the different health care providers who are brought to meet&#xD;
      these adolescents. This research proposes to study more specifically the register of&#xD;
      psychological vulnerabilities: to cite only a few examplesThese include disorders such as&#xD;
      depression, anxiety disorders and eating disorders, all of which cause suffering and&#xD;
      difficulties in everyday life. A better understanding of the presence or absence and the&#xD;
      distribution of these different types of vulnerabilities among transgender adolescents would&#xD;
      allow, among other things, to promote their their screening by health care providers. This&#xD;
      better screening would allow doctors to physicians to offer targeted treatment for these&#xD;
      disorders in parallel with the transition process. transition process.&#xD;
