  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major public health problem related to a variety of illnesses such as heart&#xD;
      disease and diabetes. Prior research indicates that social stressors contribute to risk for&#xD;
      obesity, possibly through alterations in diet and physical activity. However, it is not fully&#xD;
      clear how these alterations contribute to obesity. The purpose of this study is to examine&#xD;
      how the stressors of social isolation and discrimination relate to eating behaviors and&#xD;
      dietary patterns, and further, how these behaviors affect the brain-gut-microbiome (BGM)&#xD;
      connections. This study will focus on Mexican and Filipina women because research shows that&#xD;
      they encounter a high burden of obesity and exposure to social stressors. Approximately 300&#xD;
      Mexican and Filipina women will be screened and enrolled. They will then provide information&#xD;
      about social stressors via food diaries, physical body measures (e.g. waist circumference),&#xD;
      questionnaire data regarding diet and eating behaviors, and measures of physical activity.&#xD;
      Stool and serum will be collected to analyze microbes and metabolomics, and MRI to assess&#xD;
      brain changes in the reward network. Analytic techniques will be used to integrate data from&#xD;
      these multiple data sources. This analysis will determine the unique differences associated&#xD;
      with ethnicity and social stressors in moderating eating behaviors and dietary patterns. The&#xD;
      results of this study will provide new information about a possible pathway whereby social&#xD;
      stressors affect behavioral, neurological and microbiome mechanisms related to obesity risk&#xD;
      and provide new information in BGM patterns in two understudied ethnic groups. In the long&#xD;
      term, this research may suggest possible approaches for intervention that may help reduce&#xD;
      inequalities in obesity and related health problems.&#xD;
