      This study was designed to assess the bioequivalence of single oral dose of Progesterone 200&#xD;
      mg Soft Capsule (JSC &quot;Farmak&quot;, Ukraine) Versus Utrogestan® 200 mg Soft Capsule (Manufacturer&#xD;
      by: Cyndea Pharma, S.L., Spain, MAH: Laboratoires Besins International, France) In healthy&#xD;
      female subjects under fasting conditions&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An open-label, randomized, single dose, two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence, fully&#xD;
      replicated crossover bioequivalence study with a washout period of 7 days in healthy&#xD;
      postmenopausal female subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each period 26 blood samples were drawn 5 mL at (-1.00, -0.50, -0.137) before dosing&#xD;
      and at 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00, 2.33, 2.67, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 7.00,&#xD;
      8.00, 9.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00, 48.00, 72.00 and 96.00 hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mode of administration: Orally, with 240 mL of water at dosing in sitting position&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioequivalence Acceptance Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ▲Cmax (Maximum plasma concentration): Scaled average bioequivalence will be performed.&#xD;
      Bioequivalence limits will be defined and widened according to the variance of σw2 within&#xD;
      subject variability for the reference based on corrected progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AUC0-last (the area under the plasma concentration-time curve): The 90% confidence interval&#xD;
      for this measure lies within an acceptance range of 80.00% - 125.00% based on corrected&#xD;
      Progesterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ▲Based on Cmax CVR% (Coefficient of Variation Ratio )=50.97% the calculated confidence&#xD;
      interval acceptance limits were (69.83%-143.19%)&#xD;
