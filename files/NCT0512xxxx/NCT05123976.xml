      crossover clinical trial to evaluate the bioequivalence of single doses of test product&#xD;
      Olanzapine film-coated tablets 5 mg (JSC Farmak, Ukraine) and reference product Zyprexa®&#xD;
      coated tablets 5 mg (Eli Lilly, Nederland B V) in healthy, adult male and female subjects&#xD;
      under fasted conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During each period 22 blood samples were taken in each Study Period: prior to dosing (-1.0)&#xD;
