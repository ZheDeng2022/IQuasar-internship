  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity could be avoided but once declared it become a chronic disease with numerous health&#xD;
      complications, including cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, cancers, and finally a loss&#xD;
      of life expectancy. Considering that after the age of 6 years old, half of the obese children&#xD;
      will become obese adults, the WHO has been declared childhood obesity prevention as a health&#xD;
      priority area. Large-scale prevention of obesity is challenging and it would be more&#xD;
      efficient to proceed to early identification of high risks children to implement personalized&#xD;
      prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ELIPSE study main objective is to evaluate the efficacy of personalized multidisciplinary&#xD;
      care to reduce the BMI of overweight or obese children. A 2 years educational program will be&#xD;
      evaluated at short and longer terms (after a 12 months follow-up), and its benefits will also&#xD;
      be assessed based on comparison with a historical control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with efficacy evaluation, scientific objectives were designed to investigate clinical,&#xD;
      genetic, social, and behavioural risk factors and to analyse potential correlations between&#xD;
      these factors and a predisposition to overweight or obesity. Moreover, advanced analyses will&#xD;
      be performed to decipher the impact of diverse risk profiles on the efficacy of the&#xD;
      educational program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motive of the ELIPSE study is to promote the health and well-being of children and their&#xD;
      families to tackle the health burden represented by childhood overweight and obesity.&#xD;
      Combined with innovative scientific objectives, this study ambitions to develop more&#xD;
      efficient and more personalized preventive care methods.&#xD;
