  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study on Metacognitive therapy in general practice in Norway. The intervention is a&#xD;
      small pilot study to examine whether Metacognitive therapy is feasible in an ordinary general&#xD;
      practice. Will the physicians be capable to learn and provide the therapy method for their&#xD;
      patients with MUPS and is is possible to implement this in an ordinary general practice&#xD;
      routine? Both physicians and their patients will be asked to respond to a questionnaire on&#xD;
      perceived utility of the treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metacognitive therapy is different from Cognitive therapy in the sense that it adresses the&#xD;
      individual's attention towards potential worries and threats and also the management&#xD;
      performed by the patient to avoid these. Also the individual's capacity to produce&#xD;
      empowerment to manage these threats are of interest in the talks with the health care&#xD;
      provider. - In this study, General Practitioners with specific training in Metacognitive&#xD;
      therapy will be asked to recruit 2-3 patients with Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms&#xD;
      each and invite them to a series of Metacognitive Therapy. The patients and physicians will&#xD;
      then provide their assessments of the treatment on a number of questionnaires. To explore the&#xD;
      Sense of coherence and Empowerment among patients with Medically Unexplained Symptoms, the&#xD;
      physicians will be asked to recruit six patients each to respond to a questionnaire.&#xD;
