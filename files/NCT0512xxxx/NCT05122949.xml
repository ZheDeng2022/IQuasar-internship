      Study Design and Subject Recruitment: This was a cross-sectional study in a single centre&#xD;
      outpatient setting at the Foot Care and Limb Design Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital. As this&#xD;
      was a proof-of-concept clinical trial for the introduction of 3D printed AFOs as a patient&#xD;
      service, only 5 subjects were recruited based on consecutive sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions: Thermoformed AFOs moulded over the subject's lower limb plaster model served&#xD;
      as the control intervention. The plaster models were rectified by an orthotist with over 20&#xD;
      years of experience and the AFO design was determined according to the subject's clinical&#xD;
      presentation and needs. The AFOs were manufactured from 4 - 5mm thick homopolymer&#xD;
      polypropylene. 3D printed AFOs served as the treatment intervention. It was fabricated&#xD;
      through 3D scanning with an Artec Eva 3D scanner (Artec 3D, Luxembourg, Luxembourg) and an&#xD;
      adjustable Perspex glass foot plate, CAD modelling with the OrtenShape software (Proteor,&#xD;
      Saint-Apollinaire, France), and printed using fused deposition modelling with the Fortus&#xD;
      450mc (Stratasys, Minnesota, United States). The 3D printed AFO is printed of Polyamide&#xD;
      Nylon-12 material in the same thickness as the thermoformed AFO. There were no blinding&#xD;
      procedures as both interventions were distinctly different and it is not possible to blind&#xD;
      subjects with daily use of the AFOs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Schedule: A thermoformed and a 3D printed AFO were fitted to each subject in a single&#xD;
      session. The QUEST survey was administered post-fitting. Subjects brought home both AFOs and&#xD;
      were instructed to wear them during ambulation, alternating between the AFOs daily. Subjects&#xD;
      returned for follow-up at 3 weeks and 6 weeks post-fitting for necessary adjustments and the&#xD;
      administration of the QUEST surveys was repeated for each AFO.&#xD;

    <description>QUEST 2.0 comprises of 12 items, with 8 items related to user satisfaction with assistive devices and 4 service-related items. Responses for the QUEST items were based on a 5-level response scale, with 1 - Not satisfied at all; 2 - Not very satisfied; 3 - More or less satisfied; 4 - Quite satisfied; and 5 - Very satisfied.</description>
