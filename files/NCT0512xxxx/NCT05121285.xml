  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While delivery of an FMT-treatment to the cecum is visualized in a lower GI-endoscopy, it is&#xD;
      uncertain whether delivery by enema distributes the FMT to the proximal segments of the&#xD;
      colon. Positioning of the patient during the enema procedure may improve distribution to the&#xD;
      proximal colon. Differences in distribution may explain the wide effect range and inferiority&#xD;
      when enema is compared to delivery by lower GI endoscopy. Thus, in this study we will compare&#xD;
      the distribution of FMT from delivery by lower GI endoscopy versus enema with and without&#xD;
      positioning of the patient. We will use contrast fluid as a surrogate liquid for FMT to&#xD;
      project the distribution on colon X-ray pictures. To our knowledge this is not done in any&#xD;
      previous study.&#xD;

    <description>Each participant will receive one delivery of 440 ml contrast fluid by lower GI endoscopy to the cecum of the colon. The participants perform a bowel lavage using Sodiumpicosulphate/Magnesiumcitrate (Picoprep, Ferring) 24 hours before the delivery of contrast fluid. An colon X-ray is obtained within 10 minutes after the contrast fluid is delivered. The participants is in a supine position fram delivery and until the colon x-ray is obtained.</description>

    <description>Each participant will receive one delivery of 440 ml contrast fluid by enema. The participants perform a bowel lavage using Sodiumpicosulphate/Magnesiumcitrate (Picoprep, Ferring) 24 hours before the delivery of contrast fluid. The enema procedure includes:&#xD;
The participant lies on his/her left side in neutral position when the enema is delivered&#xD;
X-ray of the colon is obtained with the participant lying on his/her back.&#xD;
The participant is positioned back to his/her left sided position and tilted in a Trendelenburg position. The position is held for two minutes&#xD;
The participant is turned to an abdominal position while the bed remains tilted in Trendelenburg position.&#xD;
Participant turne to the right side. When positioned the bed is tilted the opposite way (anti-Trendelenburg.) The position is held for two minutes.&#xD;
A second colon X-ray is obtained after the participants has rested for ten minutes in a supine neutral position</description>
