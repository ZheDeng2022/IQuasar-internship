    <textblock>
      The CANCOV study will be the first Canadian study to provide a comprehensive evaluation of&#xD;
      early and 1-year outcomes of outpatient and hospitalized COVID-19 survivors and their family&#xD;
      caregivers, their varied trajectories and associated clinical risk factors. The overall&#xD;
      objectives are to determine short- (in hospital) and longer-term (1, 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      post-acute hospital discharge) outcomes COVID-19+ patients across the spectrum of symptom&#xD;
      severity, including outpatients and inpatients from GIM and ICU wards and their caregivers,&#xD;
      and the clinical, sociodemographic, multi-omic predictors of these outcomes. By leveraging&#xD;
      expertise from investigators across disciplines and divisions, this study presents a suite of&#xD;
      complementary projects that explore the genetic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and immunologic&#xD;
      evaluation of COVID-19 infection across the illness and recovery trajectory during the acute&#xD;
      illness and in the context of multidimensional long-term outcomes.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19)-infected pneumonia was identified in Wuhan,&#xD;
      China, and is a current global pandemic. Early studies are emerging, but it is still unclear&#xD;
      what may determine better or worse outcomes for these patients and their caregivers, and the&#xD;
      detailed nature of long-term consequences from this infection. Current data suggest that&#xD;
      80-85% of patients infected with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are not hospitalized. Of&#xD;
      those who are hospitalized, 60-80% will be discharged from hospital after a few days, and&#xD;
      20-40% may require treatment in an intensive care unit (ICU) and/or mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      (approximately 4-6% of all COVID-19 positive patients). The determining factors of these&#xD;
      varied clinical paths are urgently needed and unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CANCOV investigator group is conducting a national Canadian COVID-19 Prospective Cohort&#xD;
      Study (CANCOV). This will be a multi-centre, one-year follow-up of 1000 COVID-19 patients who&#xD;
      are hospitalized in acute care hospitals (those admitted to general internal medicine (GIM)&#xD;
      wards, and/or ICUs) and their caregivers, and 1000 non-hospitalized patients (those who were&#xD;
      tested positive and asked to isolate at home) in participating centres across Canada. In&#xD;
      addition, a cohort of 500-1000 patients who do not have a COVID-19 positive test but who&#xD;
      present with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 will be included for investigation and&#xD;
      comparison. The overall objectives are to determine short- (in hospital, and 2-week outcome&#xD;
      for non-hospitalized patients) and longer-term (1, 3, 6 and 12 months post-acute hospital&#xD;
      discharge or post diagnosis for outpatients) outcomes in patients and their caregivers, and&#xD;
      the clinical, sociodemographic, genetic/ transcriptomic/epigenomic/immunological predictors&#xD;
      of these outcomes. Due to patients with 'long-COVID' syndrome, we have added an optional&#xD;
      study extension for an additional 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By leveraging expertise from investigators across disciplines and divisions, this study&#xD;
      presents a suite of complementary projects that explore the genetic, transcriptomic,&#xD;
      epigenomic and immunological evaluation of COVID-19 infection across the illness and recovery&#xD;
      trajectory in mild as well as acute illness and in the context of multidimensional long-term&#xD;
      outcomes. The investigators will access electronic data through the GEMINI network, and&#xD;
      explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) analyses and linkages through Institute of Clinical and&#xD;
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES) data. This project will contribute new knowledge to outcomes in&#xD;
      patients with COVID-19 infections and will inform large-scale public health planning,&#xD;
      clinical care, and ongoing resource needs.&#xD;
