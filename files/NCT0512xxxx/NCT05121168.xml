    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, triple-masked, placebo-controlled parallel-arm human subjects clinical&#xD;
      trial investigating the addition of a continuous erector spinae plane nerve block to a&#xD;
      single-injection erector spinae plane block to provide postoperative analgesia following&#xD;
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Participants will all receive a single-injection nerve block&#xD;
      and perineural catheter insertion. Following surgery, participants will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to receive either perineural local anesthetic or normal saline until the second day following&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Enrollment. Participants will be consenting adults undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy.&#xD;
      Study inclusion will be proposed to eligible patients prior to surgery. If a patient desires&#xD;
      study participation, written, informed consent will be obtained. The study population of&#xD;
      interest includes women and men of all races, ethnicity, sexual identity, and socioeconomic&#xD;
      status. Of note, the investigators will be using local anesthetic, perineural catheters, and&#xD;
      infusion pumps as approved/cleared and do not plan to research a possible change of&#xD;
      indication or use of these medications/devices as part of this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedures. Following written, informed consent, the investigators will record&#xD;
      baseline anthropometric information (age, sex, height, weight, stone size/burden, and stone&#xD;
      location) that is already provided by all patients having surgery. Participants will have a&#xD;
      peripheral intravenous (IV) catheter inserted, standard noninvasive monitors applied,&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal cannula or face mask and positioned sitting.&#xD;
      Midazolam and fentanyl (IV) will be titrated for patient comfort, while ensuring that&#xD;
      patients remain responsive to verbal cues. The area of insertion on the ipsilateral side as&#xD;
      the surgery will be sterilely prepared, and a clear, sterile, fenestrated drape applied. With&#xD;
      ultrasound guidance after subcutaneous local infiltration with lidocaine, a 17g Tuohy and&#xD;
      5-10 ml of saline with 1:200,000 epinephrine will be used to identify the correct plane, as&#xD;
      defined by a hyperechoic shadow of the 8th transverse process and erector spine muscle&#xD;
      immediately superficial. Once appropriate needle tip location is confirmed, a perineural&#xD;
      catheter will be inserted under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following negative aspiration, 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 of epinephrine will&#xD;
      be injected via the catheter with sonographic confirmation of local anesthetic spread. Blocks&#xD;
      will be considered successful if, within 30 minutes, the participant experiences decreased&#xD;
      sensation to cold temperature over the level of the ipsilateral 8th thoracic dermatome at the&#xD;
      level of anterior axillary line. Failed blocks/catheters will be successfully replaced, or&#xD;
      the participant withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group Assignment. Each participant will be randomized to one of two treatment&#xD;
      groups: bupivacaine 0.25% or normal saline (&quot;study infusate&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by surgeon, in block sizes of 4. The randomization list will&#xD;
      be created by the University of California San Diego Investigational Drug Service.&#xD;
      Investigational pharmacists will prepare all study solutions as determined by the&#xD;
      randomization list. Bupivacaine and normal saline are indistinguishable in appearance, and&#xD;
      therefore investigators, participants, and all clinical staff will be masked to treatment&#xD;
      group assignment for the duration of the enrollment and data collection period. Unmasking&#xD;
      will not occur until statistical analysis is complete (termed &quot;triple masking&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention. Perineural study infusate administration will be initiated within the&#xD;
      operating or recovery rooms. The infusion pump will be programmed to deliver an automatic&#xD;
      intermittent bolus of 21 mL every 4 hours and no patient-controlled bolus (300 mL reservoir).&#xD;
      This dose of bupivacaine is well-within the standard maximum dose at the University of&#xD;
      California San Diego for perineural local anesthetic administration for other truncal&#xD;
      locations such as the paravertebral space. For any cases of inadvertent premature catheter&#xD;
      dislodgement, the subject may opt to have the catheter replaced if logistically possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be discharged home when ready, as determined by standard criteria by the&#xD;
      masked surgical service. Perineural catheters will be removed by patient caretakers upon&#xD;
      study infusate reservoir exhaustion (approximately 55 hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesics. In addition to the perineural study infusate, subjects will receive&#xD;
      standard-of-care oral and intravenous postoperative analgesics which can include&#xD;
      acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, and opioids (this is surgeon- and patient-dependent).&#xD;
      Therefore, all patients of this study-regardless of the treatment arm they are randomized&#xD;
      to-will continue to receive current usual and customary analgesia: all will receive the same&#xD;
      combination of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, ketorolac, opioids, and a single-injection erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block as they would regardless of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Methods. The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine the risks&#xD;
      and benefits of adding a continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block to a single-injection&#xD;
      ESP in patients undergoing percutaneous nephrolithotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim: To determine the benefits and risks of adding a continuous ESP block to the&#xD;
      current standard-of-care treatment of a single-injection ESP block and oral opioids following&#xD;
      percutaneous nephrolithotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compared with a single-injection ESP block following percutaneous nephrolithotomy…&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1 [primary]: The addition of a multiple-day continuous ESP block will decrease the&#xD;
      severity of pain over the two days following surgery (as measured on the 11-point numeric&#xD;
      rating scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2 [primary]: The addition of a multiple-day continuous ESP block will decrease&#xD;
      cumulative opioid consumption over the two days following surgery (as measured in oral&#xD;
      oxycodone equivalents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: To claim that the addition of an ambulatory continuous ESP block is superior&#xD;
      to a single-injection ESP block alone, at least one of the first 2 hypotheses must be&#xD;
      superior while the other at least non-inferior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The addition of a multiple-day continuous ESP block will decrease the maximum&#xD;
      daily severity of pain during the two days following surgery (as measured on the 11-point&#xD;
      numeric rating scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: The addition of a multiple-day continuous ESP block will decrease the number of&#xD;
      sleep disturbances due to pain during the second night following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 5: The addition of a multiple-day continuous ESP block will decrease pain's&#xD;
      interference with physical and emotional functioning the day following surgery (as measured&#xD;
      with the Interference subscale of the Brief Pain Inventory, Short Form).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Approach Baseline characteristics by randomized group (bupivacaine vs placebo) will&#xD;
      be summarized with means, standard deviations, and quartiles. Balance between groups will be&#xD;
      assessed. Specifically, standardized differences will be calculated using Cohen's d whereby&#xD;
      the difference in means or proportions is divided by the pooled standard deviation estimates.&#xD;
      Any key variables (age, sex, height, weight, and body mass index) with an absolute&#xD;
      standardized difference &gt;0.78 (with 1.96×√(2/25)=0.554 [with a sample size of 50, we expect&#xD;
      about 25 randomized to bupivacaine vs placebo]) will be noted and included in a linear&#xD;
      regression model to obtain an estimate of the treatment effect adjusted for the imbalanced&#xD;
      covariate(s). If residuals from the linear regression indicate violations of key assumptions&#xD;
      (i.e. homoscedasticity or Gaussian distribution), data transformations and/or alternative&#xD;
      generalized linear models will be applied as appropriate. If no imbalance is detected, the&#xD;
      primary analysis will proceed by a two-sample Mann-Whitney test. Secondary outcomes will also&#xD;
      be analyzed by Mann-Whitney test, or linear models (or generalized linear models) as&#xD;
      appropriate to adjust for any imbalanced covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gatekeeping strategy Again, to claim that the addition of an ambulatory continuous ESP block&#xD;
      is superior to a single-injection ESP block alone, at least one of the first 2 hypotheses&#xD;
      must be superior while the other at least non-inferior. Additional hypotheses will be tested&#xD;
      with strong control of the family-wise error rate at 5%. Testing begins with co-primary&#xD;
      hypotheses H1 and H2. If a given test does not reach local significance, alpha is spent and&#xD;
      cannot be passed along to hypotheses further along the graph. Otherwise, alpha is not spent&#xD;
      and is passed along.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated Power for Numeric Rating Scale for Pain Power is estimated by the following:&#xD;
      Numeric Rating Scale difference scores are distributed with a median (interquartile range) of&#xD;
      3 (2 to 4) for placebo and 2 (1 to 3) for active. A sample size of n=25 individuals per group&#xD;
      will provide 82% power to detect such an effect with two-sided α=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated Power for cumulative opioid consumption over the two days Similarly assuming the&#xD;
      standard deviation of opioid consumption is about 1 mg, a sample size of n=25 individuals per&#xD;
      group will provide 92% power to detect a group difference of 1 mg with two-sided α=0.05.&#xD;
