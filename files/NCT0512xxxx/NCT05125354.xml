      Medical records of patients that previously underwent the Alpha DaRT treatment will be&#xD;
      reviewed by an authorized staff member.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of long-term outcomes of patients previously treated with the Alpha DaRT seeds for&#xD;
      management of their malignancy following initial response. These outcomes include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety - assessment of late onset of Alpha DaRT related AE in patients treated with the&#xD;
           Alpha DaRT seeds&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy -&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assessment of local recurrence rates in patients who achieved initial complete&#xD;
                response (CR) following the Alpha DaRT treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assessment of duration of response in patients who achieved initial CR following&#xD;
                the Alpha DaRT treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  assessment of survival status in patients treated with the Alpha DaRT seeds&#xD;
