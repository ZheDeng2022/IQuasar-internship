  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All first-time mothers in Sweden are offered parental support, but local conditions mean that&#xD;
      not everyone gets the opportunity to take part in this. Studies show that there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines for the design of parental support in maternal health care. Early&#xD;
      labour or latent phase of labour is the part of childbirth were women often feel insecure, in&#xD;
      stress and left out from care. First-time mothers who have no experience of one labour before&#xD;
      are particularly vulnerable. Many women today use digital applications during pregnancy and&#xD;
      in connection with childbirth. There are several digital applications that will help the&#xD;
      woman by guiding her and her partner in different decisions about labour, but it is necessary&#xD;
      to offer evidence-based, credible electronic and digital solutions for expectant parents. A&#xD;
      meta-synthesis from 2018 showed that women use the internet often and the information they&#xD;
      receive there has a great influence on their different choices in connection with childbirth.&#xD;
      Volume, accessibility, and convenience about digital solutions play a crucial role for women&#xD;
      and partners. The digital application Contraction Coper is designed and tested by the company&#xD;
      Birth By Heart © in order to facilitate in early labour for the pregnant woman and her&#xD;
      partner. The overall purpose of the project is to evaluate whether the application&#xD;
      Contraction Coper can contribute to reduced anxiety and stress during pregnancy and&#xD;
      childbirth and whether an additional support from a midwife can increase the application use&#xD;
      and satisfaction of women when using the application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial is planned where first-time mothers after pregnancy week 25 are&#xD;
      invited to participation via social platforms. Participating first-time mothers are randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three groups; experiment group one, which gets access to the application&#xD;
      Contraction Coper, experiment group two Contraction Coper Plus which gets access to both the&#xD;
      application and support of midwives, so-called &quot;blended&quot; care, or three, the control group&#xD;
      offered customary maternity care only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection is conducted using questionnaires, mobile application and activity bracelet.&#xD;

      The primary outcome is emotional stress in early labour measured with the dimension&#xD;
      &quot;Emotional Distress&quot; in the questionnaire Early Labour Experience Questionnaire (ELEQ)&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are Fear of Birth Scale(FOBS), Childbirth Experience Questionnaire (CEQ),&#xD;
      used pain relief methods during labour and birth, mode of birth, amount of time used in the&#xD;
      application as well as heart rate, sleep and activity for the experimental groups that had&#xD;
      activity bracelets in addition.&#xD;

    <time_frame>&quot;Group differences at 1 month after birth&quot;</time_frame>
    <description>The subscale Emotional distress from Early Labour Experience Questionnaire (ELEQ) will be used for measure. Emotional distress scale is assessed on a five point Likert scale 1-5. Minimum score 6 and maximum score is 30. A higher score represents more distress during early labour.</description>

    <time_frame>&quot;Assesed during pregnancy week 25 up till week 36 at consent to the study&quot;</time_frame>
    <description>Fear of forthcoming birth will be measured with Birth scale (FOBS) by a question 'How do you feel right now about the approaching birth?' by placing a mark on two different 10-cm lines, by using the anchors; (a)'calm' and 'worried' and (b) 'no fear' and 'strong fear' creating an average of minimum score is 0 and maximum score 100 with high scores indicating higher levels of childbirth fear. Cut off point is considered at 60.</description>
