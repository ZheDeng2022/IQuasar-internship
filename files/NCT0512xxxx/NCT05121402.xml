  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A study to investigate the safety and efficacy of TLL018 compared with placebo in subjects&#xD;
      with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel dose groups,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled dose ranging study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of&#xD;
      TLL018 as an induction therapy in subjects with moderate to severe UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive one of the following treatments: TLL018 low&#xD;
      dose, TLL018 middle dose, TLL018 high dose, or placebo. All subjects may remain on a stable&#xD;
      dose of conventional therapy used prior to enrollment. Subjects will be assessed for safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and response to treatment. Samples for pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) biomarker analyses will be collected throughout the study according to&#xD;
      the Schedule of Assessments (SoA) for potential correlation to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further participation may continue beyond the initial 8 weeks for another 5-week Extension&#xD;
      Period of therapy.&#xD;
