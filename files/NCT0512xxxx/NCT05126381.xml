      Purpose of study: Establishing population pharmacokinetic - pharmacodynamic models of chronic&#xD;
      disease therapeutics for smoking patients to investigate the effects of gender, age, body&#xD;
      weight, liver function, kidney function, nicotine, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon related&#xD;
      metabolic enzymes and drug related metabolic enzymes gene polymorphism on steady-state drug&#xD;
      concentration and efficacy in chronic smoking patients after taking drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Object of study: Smoking and non-smoking patients taking levamlodipine besylate tablets or&#xD;
      metformin sustained-release tablets.&#xD;

      Object of study: Smoking and non-smoking patients taking Levamlodipine besylate tablets or&#xD;
      metformin sustained-release tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parameters of study： PK parameters: drug plasma concentration. PD parameters: blood pressure&#xD;
      or blood sugar. covariates: Gender, age, height, weight, BMI, liver function (ALT, AST, TP,&#xD;
      TBIL), kidney function (Scr, UA, UREA), nicotine plasma concentration, cigarette related&#xD;
      metabolic enzyme gene (CYP1A1, CYP1A2) polymorphism and drug-related metabolic enzyme gene&#xD;
      (CYP3A4, CYP3A5, MATE1), MARE2, OCT2) polymorphism, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety : adverse events occurred during the test.&#xD;

             unit =350 mL beer or 44 mL 40% alcohol spirits or 150 mL wine) or have a history of&#xD;
             alcohol abuse and have been abstinent for less than 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has a history of pathophysiological conditions affecting drug absorption&#xD;
             (such as inability to swallow, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.) or gastrointestinal surgery&#xD;
             affecting drug absorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. HBsAg, HCV or syphilis antibody tested positive in the past.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The investigator considers that the subjects are not suitable to participate in this&#xD;
