             mellitus and pain lasting &gt;=3 months on the first day of the run-in period. The&#xD;
             patient should meet &gt;=2 of the following criteria or nerve conduction studies showing&#xD;
             abnormalities in at least one test item (Conduction velocity, amplitude, and latency)&#xD;
             for at least two nerves by the first day of run-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  1. Subjective symptoms* thought to be due to diabetic polyneuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  2. Decreased or eliminated bilateral Achilles tendon reflexes&#xD;

               -  3. Bilateral decreased vibratory sense of the medial malleolus (=&lt; 10 seconds&#xD;
                  with a C 128 tuning fork)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  *Subjective symptoms thought to be due to diabetic neuropathy meet the following&#xD;
                  3 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bilateral&#xD;

          5. Patients whose NRS during the run-in period is assessed for &gt;=4 days of the 7 days&#xD;
             immediately before the first day of the treatment period and whose baseline 24-hour&#xD;
             mean NRS score is &gt;=4 and =&lt;8.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patients whose rate of change in the 24-hour mean NRS score during the 7 days&#xD;
             immediately before the first day of the treatment period is &lt;30%.&#xD;

&#xD;
             For example, if other pain is in the same location as painful diabetic peripheral&#xD;
             neuropathy, or if the pain intensity of the other pain is greater than that of painful&#xD;
             diabetic peripheral neuropathy, which in the opinion of the investigator (or&#xD;
             sub-investigator) would impact the assessment of painful diabetic peripheral&#xD;
