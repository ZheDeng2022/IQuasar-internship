      Rationale. Facial synkinesis is one of the most common consequences after facial paralysis,&#xD;
      defined as the inability to move muscles due to nerve damage. Facial synkinesis arises during&#xD;
      recovery of nerve injury and is characterized by involuntary and synchronous contractions of&#xD;
      muscles during facial movements. Patients' quality of life is major influenced by the&#xD;
      disease. As patients experience problems with facial movements, this leads to difficulties in&#xD;
      expressing emotions, eating, and drinking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common type of facial synkinesis is oral-ocular synkinesis, defined as eye closure during&#xD;
      movement with the mouth. During movements of the mouth, the buccinator muscle plays an&#xD;
      essential role. Both the trigeminal and the facial nerve innervate the buccinator muscle,&#xD;
      resulting in a complex sensorimotor feedback system between the nerves. Dysregulation of this&#xD;
      feedback system is assumed to result in hyperexcitability of the trigeminal and facial nuclei&#xD;
      in the pons. In addition, this will lead to cortical plasticity of the sensory and motor&#xD;
      areas of the brain. Based on this, the investigators hypothesize dysregulation of the&#xD;
      sensorimotor feedback system in patients with facial synkinesis, resulting in differences in&#xD;
      the neuroplastic organization of the primary and secondary somatosensory cortexes, the&#xD;
      primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex, and the ventral lateral premotor cortex&#xD;
      compared to healthy control participants. In addition, the investigators expect&#xD;
      hyperexcitability of the trigeminal and facial nuclei. Therefore, this study aims to obtain a&#xD;
      more detailed understanding of the neural reorganization of the sensory and motor areas as a&#xD;
      consequence of facial synkinesis using 7T fMRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective. To study the neuroplasticity of the brain due to facial synkinesis by assessing&#xD;
      the somatotopy of the face on several cortexes of interest (primary and secondary&#xD;
      somatosensory cortexes, the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex, and the&#xD;
      ventral lateral premotor cortex) compared to healthy control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. A single center imaging study carried out in MUMC+. Study population. Two&#xD;
      patients with severe oral-ocular synkinesis will be included in this pilot study. In&#xD;
      addition, two age- and sex-matched healthy control participants will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention. Every subject will undergo a single functional MRI scan in the 7 Tesla MRI scan&#xD;
      of Scannexus. A scanning session takes approximately 1 hour. During the scan, participants&#xD;
      are asked to perform motor and sensory tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters. The main study parameter is the hemodynamic response after stimulation&#xD;
      of specific parts of the face. Within the areas of interest (primary motor cortex, the&#xD;
      ventral lateral premotor cortex, the supplementary motor cortex, the primary somatosensory&#xD;
      cortex (S1), and the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2)), the temporo-spatial brain activity&#xD;
      patterns after the different motor and sensory tasks are assessed, and the representation of&#xD;
      the face is mapped on the cortexes of interest.&#xD;
