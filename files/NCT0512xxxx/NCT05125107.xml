  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prognostic values of 2-dimensional residual&#xD;
      disease patterns determined by quantitative flow ratio (QFR) pullbacks after stent&#xD;
      implantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prognostic value of post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) physiology assessment has been confirmed. The rationale for measuring&#xD;
      post-PCI physiologic outcome is that it could implicate the residual risk of suboptimal&#xD;
      stenting in addition to residual diffuse coronary artery disease after PCI Nevertheless, it&#xD;
      should be noted that both post-PCI physiologic indices such as ,fractional flow reserve (FFR)&#xD;
      and QFR, are measured at the distal of the interrogated vessel and reflect the cumulative&#xD;
      residual disease burdens, defining the residual disease patterns might have additional role&#xD;
      in exploring the underlying mechanisms for suboptimal post-PCI physiologic results, thus&#xD;
      providing the opportunities for functional optimization with subsequent interventions&#xD;
      accordingly to improve immediate functional results, long-term outcomes may be positively&#xD;
      affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concept of physiologic 2-dimensional disease patterns according to both physiologic&#xD;
      distribution (predominant focal versus diffuse disease) and local severity (presence versus&#xD;
      absence of major gradient) of coronary atherosclerosis before PCI was proposed and could be&#xD;
      derived from virtual QFR pullback curve. Nevertheless, the prognostic value of the&#xD;
      2-dimensional residual disease patterns after PCI has not been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CHART-OPTIMIZE study aims to investigate the clinical implications of physiologic&#xD;
      2-dimensional residual disease patterns after stenting.&#xD;
