  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of remote ischemic conditioning on&#xD;
      dynamic cerebral autoregulation and related hematology indexes in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke receiving intravenous thrombolysis.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, cases of ischemic stroke who undergo intravenous thrombolysis within 4.5 hours&#xD;
      from onset are included. The experimental group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic&#xD;
      conditioning for 200mmHg, 2 times within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis. The control&#xD;
      group receive basic treatment and remote ischemic conditioning control for 60mmHg, 2 times&#xD;
      within 6 hours to 24 hours from thrombolysis . Both groups underwent dynamic cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation at days 1 to 2, 4 to 6, and 7 to 10 of onset, and recorded the relevant&#xD;
      indexes， we aimed to determine the impact of remote ischemic conditioning combined with&#xD;
      intravenous thrombolysis on dynamic cerebral autoregulation in acute ischemic stroke&#xD;
      patients. We hypothesized that remote ischemic conditioning would improve dynamic cerebral&#xD;
      autoregulation in patients with acute ischemic stroke receiving intravenous thrombolysis.&#xD;

    <description>A dynamic cerebral auto-regulation parameter derived from transfer function analysis.Continuous cerebral blood flow velocities of bilateral middle cerebral artery will be assessed noninvasively using transcranial Doppler. Spontaneous arterial blood pressure will be simultaneously recorded using a servo-controlled plethysmograph on the left or right middle finger with an appropriate finger cuff size. Transfer function analysis will be used to derive the autoregulatory parameters. The results of dynamic brain autoregulation were recorded 1-2 days, 4-6 days and 7-10 days after the onset of the disease.</description>

    <description>RIC+Standard medical treatment Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is induced by 4 cycles of 5 min of healthy upper limb ischemia followed by 5 min re-perfusion. Limb ischemia was induced by inflation of a blood pressure cuff to 200 mmHg. RIC will be conducted twice within 6 to 24 hours from thrombolysis. Additionally,the patients will be treated with standard medical treatment according to Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of acute ischemic stroke in China 2014. Within 24 hours after IVT, the patient was given nerve nutrition and lipid stabilization treatment. 24 hours after IVT, the patient was given the appropriate treatment, including anti-platelet aggregation and circulation improvement drugs, according to the results of the rechecked head CT.</description>
