  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, doctors want to find out more about why people who lose weight often regain&#xD;
      the weight that they have lost once they resume a regular diet and whether hormones might&#xD;
      play a role in weight regain. The study is divided into two parts, called the meal&#xD;
      replacement period and the follow-up period. The meal replacement period will consist of&#xD;
      drinking a shake for breakfast and lunch and eating a frozen meal for dinner that is calorie&#xD;
      controlled. Individuals will also be asked to eat two servings of fruit and three servings of&#xD;
      vegetables each day. The study will provides the shakes and the frozen entrees, participants&#xD;
      are asked to supply the fruits and vegetables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last for up to 35 weeks. There will be 10 in-person visits&#xD;
      and 13 visits by phone or over Zoom over the 35 weeks.&#xD;

      Individuals who are found to be eligible to participate will have two study interventions: An&#xD;
      8-week meal replacement therapy period in which they are asked to reduce their BMI by &gt;5%.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to strictly follow the individually-prescribed eating regimen&#xD;
      which will include meal replacement shakes and/or frozen meals to be used for breakfast and&#xD;
      lunch. For dinner, we will provide pre-packaged frozen entr√©e meals to be consumed with two&#xD;
      servings of fruit and three servings of vegetables per day. Meal replacement compliance will&#xD;
      be assessed by requiring participants to maintain a dietary log throughout the study. The&#xD;
      percentage of days for which the protocol was followed (no additional calories consumed) will&#xD;
      serve as the primary metric of compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also receive a standardized lifestyle/behavioral modification counseling&#xD;
      every 2 weeks throughout the entire study, which will be delivered at each in-person study&#xD;
      visit and via virtual platform of phone when there is no in-person study visit scheduled. The&#xD;
      lifestyle curriculum will incorporate evidence-based behavior change principles including&#xD;
      dietary modification, energy expenditure modification, behavior modification and family&#xD;
      involvement and support. To ensure fidelity and adherence to the delivery protocol, a manual&#xD;
      will be developed for each session that trained staff will follow when administering the&#xD;
      curriculum.&#xD;
