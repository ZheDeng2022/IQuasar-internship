  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traditional aerobic training and muscle resistance ('strength') training have been shown to&#xD;
      be effective for improving functional and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) outcomes in&#xD;
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). However, the transfer of the current resistance exercise&#xD;
      modes proposed to other activities of daily living (ADLs) is questionable. Moderate intensity&#xD;
      functional training (MIFT) has emerged with the aim of achieving cardiovascular and&#xD;
      neuromuscular adaptations simultaneously with functional exercises typical of ADLs. The&#xD;
      effect of MIFT in patients with PAD is not yet known. Our purpose is to verify the influence&#xD;
      of the combination of intermittent treadmill walking exercise with MIFT compared with&#xD;
      intermittent treadmill walking exercise on functional capacity, HRQoL, biochemical and&#xD;
      hemodynamic parameters in patients with PAD.&#xD;

    <description>Subjects will perform a 12-week supervised exercise therapy program based on intermittent treadmill walking exercise (15-30 min.) and moderate intensity functional training (MIFT) (15 min.). In intermittent treadmill walking exercise, the speed and incline of treadmill will be adjusted that patients achieve moderate claudication pain in the time interval between 3 and 5 min. In MIFT, subjects must complete in 15 min. the highest number of repetitions / rounds possible (AMRAP) to a circuit composed of 6 global functional exercises from which they performed 10 repetitions with a rating of perceived exertion (RPE) of 5-7 on a 1 to 10 scale in each exercise.</description>
