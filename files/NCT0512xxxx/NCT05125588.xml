  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to compare the bioavailability of two formulations of meloxicam&#xD;
      given to healthy volunteers and to demonstrate bioequivalence. The test product, Reumoxicam速&#xD;
      15 mg tablets (Farmak PJSC, Ukraine), given in a single dose was compared with a licensed&#xD;
      reference product Movalis 15 mg tablets (&quot;Boehringer Ingelheim Ellas A.E.&quot;, Greece), in a&#xD;
      randomized, laboratory-blind, single dose, two periods, crossover study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the trial was to investigate the safety of both preparations on&#xD;
      the basis of safety clinical and laboratory examinations (at the beginning and at the end of&#xD;
      the trial) and registration of adverse events and/ or adverse drug reactions.&#xD;

      Randomized, single-dose, crossover, two-period, two-sequence, laboratory-blinded, comparative&#xD;
      bioavailability study of test medicinal product Reumoxicam速 15 mg tablets (PJSC &quot;Farmak&quot;,&#xD;
      Ukraine) and reference medicinal product Movalis 15 mg tablets (&quot;Boehringer Ingelheim Ellas&#xD;
      A.E.&quot;, Greece) in healthy volunteers under fasting condition.&#xD;
