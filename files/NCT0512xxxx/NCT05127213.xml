      To compare the changes in brain function in obese patients after intragastric balloon and&#xD;
      sleeve gastrectomy. This clinical trial is a prospective, single-center, randomized,&#xD;
      open-label, parallel-controlled study. One group uses intragastric balloon system developed&#xD;
      by Changzhou Zhishan Medical Technology Co., Ltd, and the other groups underwent sleeve&#xD;
      gastric surgery. Before patients are enrolled in this clinical study, the researchers will do&#xD;
      a detailed screening of the subjects based on the inclusion criteria and the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria to determine if the patients are appropriate for the clinical study. Patients who&#xD;
      meet the conditions of the study will be required to sign an informed consent form. They are&#xD;
      divided into different groups according to their own wishes. To evaluate the primary outcome&#xD;
      measures and secondary outcome measures and to observe the changes in brain function.&#xD;
      Finally, investigators used functional MRI, questionnaire, and laboratory examination to&#xD;
      evaluate the weight loss effect and appetite change through the comparison of the data&#xD;
      obtained from the different groups during the treatment.&#xD;
