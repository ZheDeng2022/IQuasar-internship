      This project will provide new evidence on how to optimize medication use among older people&#xD;
      with limited life expectancy. This will be done by testing whether a patient-centered&#xD;
      deprescribing intervention, focused on aligning medical treatment with patients' preferences,&#xD;
      can improve quality of life among older people with limited life expectancy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In a pragmatic randomized controlled trial, this project will test whether a comprehensive&#xD;
      and patient-centered deprescribing intervention can improve quality of life among older&#xD;
      people with limited life expectancy. The intervention will comprise a series of consultations&#xD;
      between the patient and general practitioner (GP) (at least three) to continuously adjust the&#xD;
      patient's medication according to the patient's goals, needs, and preferences, thereby&#xD;
      ensuring alignment with the patient's priorities. Thus, the purpose of this intervention is&#xD;
      to initiate and facilitate a continued deprescribing process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The process can be summarized in eight steps: During an initial consultation (1: Consultation&#xD;
      0), the GP assesses patient eligibility. If the patient would like to participate, a project&#xD;
      nurse subsequently visits the patient at home (2: Home visit) for retrieval of informed&#xD;
      consent as well as baseline measurements. After retrieval of informed consent, patients are&#xD;
      randomized. Patients randomized to the control group continue with usual care (consultations&#xD;
      with their GP when needed). Patients in the intervention group receive the intervention,&#xD;
      comprising a series of consultations between the patient and GP (at least three). During the&#xD;
      first intervention consultation (3: Consultation 1), the patient and GP discuss how the&#xD;
      patient feels about their medical treatment, and the GP provides the patient with written&#xD;
      material for the patient to prepare prior to the next consultation. The patients prepare (4:&#xD;
      Preparation) by considering and verbalizing their goals of care and treatment preferences.&#xD;
      Simultaneously, a clinical pharmacist examines the patient's medication list and provides&#xD;
      suggestions to the GP on which drugs can be continued and deprescribed, respectively. During&#xD;
      the next intervention consultation (5: Consultation 2), the patient and GP discuss the&#xD;
      patient's preferences and initiate deprescribing initiatives aligned with the patient's&#xD;
      priorities. During a new intervention consultation (6: Consultation 3), the patient and GP&#xD;
      follow up on the changes initiated and initiate new deprescribing initiatives if such can be&#xD;
      identified. If needed, subsequent intervention consultations (7: Consultation X) are planned&#xD;
      until the patient and GP consider the patient's medical treatment optimal. A project nurse&#xD;
      visits all patients (both patients randomized to the control and intervention group,&#xD;
      respectively) at home 3 and 6 months after first home visit to retrieve follow-up&#xD;
      measurements (8: Follow-ups). A project nurse retrieves medication lists at 3 months, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months.&#xD;
