  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the probability of immune response for the&#xD;
      combination treatment of dendritic cell vaccine with oral cabozantinib and characterize the&#xD;
      safety profile of interventional therapy.&#xD;

      Participants with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic, histologically confirmed, clear cell renal&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who have elected to undergo surgical resection, will receive&#xD;
      neoadjuvant autologous Tumor Blood Vessel Antigen (TBVA)-Dendritic Cell Vaccine intradermally&#xD;
      every 2 weeks x 2 (days 7(+/-3) and 21(+/-3)) prior to surgery on day 31(+7) with oral&#xD;
      cabozantinib 20 mg daily for 10 days. We hypothesize that treated renal tumors will&#xD;
      demonstrate maturation and organization of the tumor endothelium with normalization of&#xD;
      endothelial markers and formation of tertiary lymphoid structure capable of promoting&#xD;
      specific T-cell induction.&#xD;
