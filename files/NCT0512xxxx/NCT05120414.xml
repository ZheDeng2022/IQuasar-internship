    <textblock>
      Stroke is a disorder in which the areas of the brain that control the sensory and motor&#xD;
      nerves are damaged due to poor blood supply to the brain. As a result of which oxygen and&#xD;
      nutrients supply to the brain tissues is interrupted. This is either caused by infarction or&#xD;
      a bleed in the blood arteries supplying the brain. A stroke occurs when the cerebral blood&#xD;
      supply is disrupted, resulting in a localized neurological deficiency. At least 80% of&#xD;
      strokes are ischemic, meaning they are caused by a blockage in blood flow, while 15-20% are&#xD;
      caused by bleeding into the brain, known as intracerebral hemorrhage. The occurrence of the&#xD;
      sudden neurological deficit caused by bleeding in the brain or ischemic damage gives rise to&#xD;
      the disturbances in motion, senses, perception, language, and other such functions on the&#xD;
      opposite side to the affected side of the brain. A randomized controlled trial was carried&#xD;
      out on 36 chronic stroke patients. By using the sealed envelope method, the sample was&#xD;
      divided into two groups, an experimental group and a control group. For a period of four&#xD;
      weeks, the control group only received traditional balancing exercises including standing&#xD;
      with feet together, standing with one foot directly in front of the other, standing eye open&#xD;
      to eye closed, standing multidirectional functional reach and March in place and walk&#xD;
      sideways. While the experimental group received ankle strategy exercises in addition to&#xD;
      balance exercises which included raising and lowering heels and forefeet, heel to toe&#xD;
      walking, stepping up and down and left right and diagonal inclination of the body during&#xD;
      standing. Interventions were given three days weekly for four consecutive weeks. Pre and&#xD;
      post-intervention assessment were done by using data collection tools which includes ABC&#xD;
      Scale of balance confidence, TUG scale and 10meter walk test.&#xD;

      Stroke was defined in 1970 by the World Health Organization as &quot;Rapidly acquired clinical&#xD;
      symptoms of focal (or global) impairment of brain function 24-48 hours or resulting in death,&#xD;
      with no evident cause other than a vascular origin.&quot; A stroke occurs when the cerebral&#xD;
      Epidemiology, Incidence and Prevalence Epidemiologic research on stroke aids in the knowledge&#xD;
      of the disease's natural history, the early diagnosis, and the prediction of prognosis, all&#xD;
      of which can lead to indicators for disease mechanisms. Women and men have differences&#xD;
      concerning stroke. As compared to men, women have an increased lifetime risk of stroke and&#xD;
      they have a higher prcentage of disability, dementia and depression. Stroke is a&#xD;
      non-communicable disease that is becoming more prevalent as the population ages. In many&#xD;
      nations, it is the prime cause of mortality and disability. America has seen a decrease in&#xD;
      stroke mortality in the last twenty years, but recent trends show that these decreases may&#xD;
      have leveled off. In 2013, there were around 25.7 million stroke survivors, 6.5 million&#xD;
      stroke fatalities, 113 million disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost due to stroke, and&#xD;
      up to 10.3 million incidences of new stroke. Stroke has become the biggest cause of&#xD;
      persistent impairment in the United States, as well as the second most leading cause of&#xD;
      dementia and the fourth most common cause of mortality. The is high morbidity associated with&#xD;
      stroke, with costs estimated at $34 billion annually for healthcare services, medications,&#xD;
      and missed workdays. In the United States, about 800,000 primary (first-time) or secondary&#xD;
      (recurrent) strokes happen annually, with primary strokes accounting for the majority&#xD;
      (roughly 600,000). Although the proportional burden of hemorrhagic vs ischemic stroke varies&#xD;
      among various populations, the majority of strokes (80% ) are ischemic . Stroke appears to&#xD;
      have an even greater global impact than it does in the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, impaired language, eye muscle weakness, and visual field cuts&#xD;
      are all symptoms of cerebral bleed and infarction, which cause sudden malfunctioning of&#xD;
      neurologic tissue. In contrast, cerebral hemorrhage causes blood to flow into the brain. This&#xD;
      causes squeezing of neighboring tissue and eventually increased intracranial pressure. As a&#xD;
      result due to this increased pressure and meningeal irritation, the patient presents with&#xD;
      severe headache, neck stiffness and vomiting and progressive deterioration due to continuous&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
