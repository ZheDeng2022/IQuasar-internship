  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed pilot study is to assess the feasibility and implementation of&#xD;
      the SMART-MR program, an integration of stress management, general resilience, and moral&#xD;
      resilience skills, with frontline staff who provide direct patient care at The Ottawa&#xD;
      Hospital (TOH).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many of the sources of stress facing healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic involve&#xD;
      difficult ethical trade-offs that give rise to moral distress. Moral distress has personal&#xD;
      consequences for healthcare workers, notably for their mental health, and wider consequences&#xD;
      for the organization and health system as a whole as it negatively affects quality of care,&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, and the recruitment, retention and satisfaction of staff. Moral&#xD;
      resilience refers to the capacity of an individual to sustain or restore their integrity in&#xD;
      response to moral adversity and has been raised as a potential way to mitigate moral&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Stress Management and Resilience Training (SMART) program is one of the few&#xD;
      evidence-based interventions designed to build resilience in healthcare workers. The SMART&#xD;
      program is a brief, neuroscience-based intervention, typically delivered in a single&#xD;
      90-minute session. The structured program teaches self-care skills by developing intentional&#xD;
      attention and the ability to reframe potentially stressful situations more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a modified version of the existing SMART program, SMART-Moral Resilience&#xD;
      (SMART-MR), has been developed with an additional focus on reducing moral distress and&#xD;
      building moral resilience for healthcare workers. The synergy of general resilience&#xD;
      strategies with focus on the moral/ethical dimensions of clinical practice offer clinicians&#xD;
      specific skills to address ethical challenges. We believe implementing the SMART-MR program&#xD;
      with frontline staff during the COVID-19 pandemic is warranted. Therefore, we plan to pilot&#xD;
      this innovative intervention at TOH to assess its feasibility and implementation.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Measure of Moral Distress-Health Professionals (MMD-HP)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>27-item scale that measures healthcare professionals' current levels of moral distress. Respondents rate each item on two Likert scales to indicate: how often a situation occurs during their practice (frequency: 0 = never, 4= very frequent) and how distressing it is when it occurs (distressing: 0= none, 4= very distressing). The frequency score (f) is multiplied by the distress score (d) to receive a composite score (&quot;fxd&quot;, range 0-16). These scores are summed to create the overall MMD-HP score (ranging from 0-432), with higher scores indicative of higher moral distress.</description>

    <measure>Change in the Rushton Moral Resilience Scale (RMRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>17-item scale assessing moral resilience in healthcare workers. Respondents rate their level of agreement with each item on a Likert scale from 1 (&quot;disagree&quot;) to 4 (&quot;agree&quot;). The items form 4 factors: 1) response to moral adversity; 2) personal integrity; 3) relational integrity; and 4) moral efficacy and a total summative score is calculated.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Maslach Burnout Inventory-2 item version (MBI-2 item)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>2 items that capture the emotional exhaustion (i.e., &quot;I feel burned out from my work&quot;) and depersonalization (i.e., &quot;I have become more callous toward people since I started this job&quot;) domains of burnout. Respondents rate their level of agreement with these items on a scale from 0 (never) to 6 (everyday). A score of &gt;3 on either item is considered indicative of burnout.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Perceived Stress Scale-10 item (PSS-10)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>10-item scale that provides a global measure of perceived stress. Responses range on a 5-point scale from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often.&quot; A higher score indicates greater stress.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>7-item questionnaire that assessed generalized anxiety. Response options are &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day,&quot; scored as 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Cut-off scores of 5, 10, and 15 delineate mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively; scores ≤4 correspond to minimal anxiety.</description>
