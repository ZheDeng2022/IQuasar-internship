  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In multiple sclerosis (MS), the presence of white matter lesions surrounded by a rim of iron&#xD;
      is suggested to signify a more severe disease course. Iron rim lesions can be detected&#xD;
      through their appearance on susceptibility-based brain MRI at either 3-Tesla or 7-Tesla&#xD;
      strength. We know that the formation of chronic active lesions is not uniform across MS&#xD;
      cohorts so identifying risk factors which predispose individuals to the formation of rim&#xD;
      lesions may provide a useful biomarker for clinical progression. One candidate set of risk&#xD;
      factors include genetic variants which prevent some MS patients from resolving acute&#xD;
      inflammation following their initial wave of inflammatory demyelination at lesion onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, only small longitudinal clinical cohorts have reported the evolution of iron&#xD;
      rim lesions many years after their initial formation, as well as their link to clinical&#xD;
      disability or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NUH hold 7T-MRI scans of over 100 patients who received a research MRI with iron-sensitive&#xD;
      sequences between 2008-2012. We will recruit 100 patients that received brain MRI several&#xD;
      years ago to provide blood samples. The blood samples along with the previously acquired MRI&#xD;
      scan will be sent to Johns Hopkins University in the US where genotyping studies will be&#xD;
      performed to explore whether this genetic variation contributes to the accrual of chronic&#xD;
      active rim lesions in MS. Patients who consent to provide blood samples will also have the&#xD;
      option to consent to receive an additional 7-Tesla MRI scan which will allow us to compare&#xD;
      how rim lesions evolve and whether their presence is correlated with disability. 30 MRI scans&#xD;
      will initially be performed as funding for this amount is already secured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following analysis of the pilot phase 1 data and securing additional funds, we will contact&#xD;
      more patients who have already consented to receive the additional MRI to receive the scan&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The presence of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions which are surrounded by a rim of iron (IRL)&#xD;
      is suggested to signify a more severe disease course. These IRLs can be detected on&#xD;
      ultra-high field strength brain MRI like 7-T or 3-T. Studies with large MS patient cohorts&#xD;
      have demonstrated that IRLs are particularly frequent in progressive MS subtypes. So far only&#xD;
      small longitudinal MRI and clinical cohorts have reported the evolution of IRLs many years&#xD;
      after their initial formation, as well as their link to clinical disability or disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formation of IRLs is not uniform across MS cohorts so identifying risk factors which&#xD;
      predispose individuals to them may provide a useful biomarker for clinical progression. One&#xD;
      set of risk factors include genetic variants which prevent some MS patients from resolving&#xD;
      the inflammation present at the start of their disease onset. Recent genetic studies of MS&#xD;
      are beginning to implicate microglia (inflammatory/immune cells) in MS pathogenesis. Certain&#xD;
      genetic variants change the activation states of certain cell populations like microglia and&#xD;
      astrocytes which governs their response to CNS damage. It is not known how this genetic&#xD;
      variation contributes to the formation, persistence and accrual of IRLs, warranting&#xD;
      genotyping studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study relies on the recruitment of participants who received a susceptibility-based&#xD;
      brain MRI between 2008-2012, this cohort of patients will be identified to the research team&#xD;
      by the clinical team. To minimise inconvenience these patients will be sent a patient&#xD;
      information sheet at least 2 weeks ahead of their scheduled annual appointment and will be&#xD;
      contacted 2 days before their appointment to confirm whether they are interested in&#xD;
      participating. If they agree, they will be asked to attend clinic 45 minutes before their&#xD;
      scheduled time so there is sufficient time to meet the research team, discuss any questions&#xD;
      and if willing, consent. As this study comprises a cross-sectional genetics component and a&#xD;
      longitudinal MRI cohort, patients are able to consent to either/both the provision of blood&#xD;
      samples and/or an additional susceptibility-based brain MRI. If the participant consents to&#xD;
      provide blood samples they will be taken on the same day and stored in a -80'C freezer. When&#xD;
      the total samples being stored reaches the target of 100 participant samples they will be&#xD;
      shipped for analysis at Johns Hopkins University in the United States where funding has been&#xD;
      secured to perform the genotyping studies. The research team will also collect additional&#xD;
      clinical and demographic data from the already available medical records which will be&#xD;
      anonymously shared with Johns Hopkins University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also consent to receive an MRI as part of the longitudinal MRI cohort&#xD;
      component. This will be split into two phases, the first phase has already secured funding&#xD;
      for 30 participants to receive an MRI. Of the participants who have consented to receive an&#xD;
      MRI, initially 30 will be invited to the Sir Peter Mansfield Imaging Center where they will&#xD;
      meet a member of the research team and undergo the scan. Additional clinical and demographic&#xD;
      information will also be collected at this visit. Following completion of phase 1 and after&#xD;
      securing additional funds, more patients who have consented to receive the MRI will be&#xD;
      invited to the SPMIC to receive the scan, the exact number of patients will be determined&#xD;
      from analysis of the pilot data.&#xD;

    <description>This will involve 1) single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from human MS lesions and, 2) genetics studies of microglia and other relevant cell types, to identify candidate transcriptional changes in key CNS cell types.We will leverage unique resources available from ongoing snRNA-seq studies (led by Dr. Absinta) that will allow us to correlate genetic risk variants or networks with activity of different cell types hypothesized to be relevant. Taken together, these analyses will integrate transcriptomic and epi-genomic information from studies of microglia and other relevant cell types to understand potential co-localizing biological signals contributing to rim lesions formation.</description>
