    <textblock>
      ARCoS is a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and preliminary effects of a method of&#xD;
      cognitive remediation by a Rhythmic, Vocal and Embodied Musical Learning for a population of&#xD;
      stabilized schizophrenic patients. 20 stabilized schizophrenics patients will participate in&#xD;
      the study for 9 months, i) 6 months of Musical learning (24 sessions over the 6 months) ; ii)&#xD;
      and 3 months of follow-up post cognitive remediation. Assessments of attention deficits,&#xD;
      inhibitory abilities, negative symptoms and anxiety, will carried out at baseline (V1, M0),&#xD;
      third month (M3), sixth month (M6) after the start of the intervention and third months after&#xD;
      the end of the intervention (M9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint will be the proportion of patients who have attended at least 80% of the&#xD;
      musical training sessions over the 6 months (participation in at least 19/24 sessions).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric condition affecting 1% of the population.&#xD;
      Antipsychotic medications are effective on positive symptoms (delusions, hallucinations).&#xD;
      However, they do not have a significant effect on negative symptoms (apragmatism, social&#xD;
      withdrawal, blunting of affect, etc.) and cognitive impairment. These last two dimensions are&#xD;
      the most impacting in terms of social functioning and quality of life, and antipsychotics can&#xD;
      potentially aggravate them. In addition to pharmacological treatments it is recommended to&#xD;
      combine non-pharmacological approaches including cognitive remediation and psychosocial&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The latter are best able to improve the personal and interpersonal&#xD;
      functioning of patients and improve their quality of life which makes a recovery trajectory&#xD;
      possible. Do date very few studies conduct cognitive remediation using musical learning. We&#xD;
      have created an original teaching method based on the embodied dimension of cognition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to conduct a first pilot study to validate the feasibility of this music&#xD;
      learning with schizophrenic patients. It will allow a preliminary evaluation of the effects&#xD;
      of this new approach on cognitive disorders and negative symptoms of stabilized schizophrenic&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 stabilized schizophrenics patients will participate in the study for 9 months, i)&#xD;
      Rhythmic, Vocal and Embodied Musical Learning to two groups of 10 patients during 6 months&#xD;
      each. (24 sessions over the 6 months) ; ii) and 3 months of follow-up post cognitive&#xD;
      remediation. Each patient will have 4 evaluation visits during the study.&#xD;

    <description>The musical learning method &quot;Diapason &amp; Metronome&quot; is unprecedented. It was specially created by Florent Cholat. It aims an apprenticeship of a musical practice adapted to subjects with schizophrenia. The method does not require the handling of a musical instrument; it is based on the voice and the body. It is built on the three essential dimensions of music, which are rhythm, single sound and harmony. &quot;Rhythm&quot; concerns the division and management of time. The &quot;single sound&quot; allows work on the representation of a sound object as a singularity. &quot;Harmony&quot; allows you to work on the positioning of a sound in the globality of the chord to which it belongs and in the collective polyphony exercises.</description>
