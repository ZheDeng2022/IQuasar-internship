  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rare epilepsies as a whole account for 20-30% of epilepsies, but knowledge about prognostic&#xD;
      factors is currently limited. This means that it is difficult to provide adequate information&#xD;
      to families at diagnosis and during follow-up. Prognostic factors are also important for&#xD;
      management as they can have an impact on the patient's outcome (time to intervention, choice&#xD;
      of one molecule over another, etc.). Finally, few treatments are currently available for&#xD;
      these epilepsies. One of the limitations to the development of treatments is the lack of real&#xD;
      life data as it is difficult to create reliable primary endpoints such as the rate of&#xD;
      patients becoming seizure free naturally compared to a therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this real-life study is to evaluate the response to treatment as well as to see&#xD;
      the evolution of cognitive and psychiatric comorbidities. As explained above, there are very&#xD;
      few randomised trials except for 3 rare epilepsies (infantile spasm syndrome, Dravet&#xD;
      syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome). This has led to the virtual absence of management&#xD;
      recommendations, including for the three syndromes mentioned above, where attempts at&#xD;
      treatment algorithms have been proposed, although these have not been able to be considered&#xD;
      as evidence-based recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a result, there is some diversity in the management of rare epilepsies from one centre to&#xD;
      another. However, this diversity in management can be an asset in a real-life study. This&#xD;
      will make it possible to compare different management methods, both in terms of seizure&#xD;
      control and medium-term outcome.&#xD;

        The population studied in this work will be a pediatric population: from birth to the end&#xD;
        of adolescence. There is no limitation in the epileptic syndromes provided that it is a&#xD;
        rare epilepsy according to the waxers with a prevalence of 1 in 2000. As mentioned here on&#xD;
        several occasions, there is little data on it. efficacy of treatments and the outcome of&#xD;
        rare epilepsies. A fairly wide opening on the syndromes to be included will make it&#xD;
        possible to collect data without being limited to those which are the subject of the most&#xD;
        frequent publications and therefore provide data not available to date.&#xD;
