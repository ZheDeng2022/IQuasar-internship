  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      68Ga-fibroblast activating protein inhibitors(FAPI) has been developed as a tumor-targeting&#xD;
      agent as fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in cancer-associated fibroblasts and&#xD;
      some inflammation,such as inflammatory bowel disease. And it might be more sensitive than FDG&#xD;
      in detecting a certain type of inflammations according to our preliminary research. Thus this&#xD;
      prospective study is going to investigate whether 68Ga-FAPI PET/CT may be superior for&#xD;
      diagnosis, therapy response assessment and follow-up of Pulmonary fibrosis than 18F-FDG&#xD;
      PET/CT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary fibrosis is a prototype of chronic, progressive, and fibrotic lung disease.Healthy&#xD;
      tissue is replaced by altered extracellular matrix and alveolar architecture is destroyed,&#xD;
      which leads to decreased lung compliance, disrupted gas exchange, and ultimately respiratory&#xD;
      failure and death.Pulmonary fibrosis is diagnosed by identification of a pattern of usual&#xD;
      interstitial pneumonia on the basis of radiological or histological criteria in patients&#xD;
      without evidence of an alternative cause. Activated fibroblasts are crucial for fibrotic&#xD;
      processes in Pulmonary fibrosis. 68Ga-FAPI has been developed as a tumortargeting agent as&#xD;
      fibroblast activation protein is overexpressed in cancerassociated fibroblasts and&#xD;
      inflammation. Recentlyï¼Œa study shows that FAPI-PET/CT imaging is a promising new imaging&#xD;
      modality for Pulmonary fibrosis.This head-to-head comparisons aims to evaluate the severity&#xD;
      of pulmonary fibrosis and the therapy response of 68Ga-FAPI-04 compared with 18F-FDG in the&#xD;
      same group of pulmonary fibrosis patients.&#xD;
