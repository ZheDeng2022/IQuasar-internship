    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study was to evaluate exercise capacity, respiratory muscle strength,&#xD;
      pulmonary function, dyspnea and physical activity levels in pediatric PAH patients and&#xD;
      compare them with healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of the study was; To investigate the relationship of dyspnea with exercise&#xD;
      capacity, respiratory muscle strength, respiratory functions, physical activity and blood&#xD;
      count parameters in pediatric PAH patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a mean pulmonary artery pressure of 25 mmHg or more&#xD;
      at rest. Since the diagnosis of PAH can be made mostly in the late phase of the disease,&#xD;
      severe functional and hemodynamic problems are prevalent in patients. In addition, patients&#xD;
      commonly present with dyspnea, fatigue, weakness, general exercise intolerance, chest pain,&#xD;
      syncope, and abdominal distension. These signs and symptoms are due to reduced oxygen&#xD;
      consumption and decreased cardiac output. Activity dyspnea is evident in patients in the&#xD;
      early stages of the disease. There is limited number of studies in pediatric PAH patients&#xD;
      investigating exercise intolerance. While the cardiopulmonary exercise test can be safely&#xD;
      performed in pediatric PAH patients, the six-minute walk test is both an independent&#xD;
      predictor of prognosis and reflects the severity of the disease in these patients. However,&#xD;
      there are no studies in the literature investigating and comparing exercise capacity,&#xD;
      respiratory muscle strength, respiratory functions, dyspnea, and physical activity levels in&#xD;
      pediatric PAH patients compared to age- and sex-matched healthy children. For this reason, in&#xD;
      this study, the level of physical impairments of children with pediatric PAH was investigated&#xD;
      for the first time compared to healthy children. In addition, there has been no study in the&#xD;
      literature investigated the relationship between dyspnea, which can be seen significantly&#xD;
      from the early stages of the disease in pediatric PAH patients, with exercise capacity,&#xD;
      respiratory function, respiratory muscle strength, physical activity levels and blood count&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a cross-sectional study. At least 15 PAH patients and 15 age-and sex-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls were aimed to include in the study. Individuals' exercise capacity using six minute&#xD;
      walk test, respiratory muscle strength using a mouth pressure device, pulmonary function&#xD;
      using spirometry, dyspnea using Modified Borg scale, physical activity using multi-sensory&#xD;
      activity monitor were evaluated. The assessments were completed in two days.&#xD;
