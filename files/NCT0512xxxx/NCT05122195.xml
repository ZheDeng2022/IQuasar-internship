      This study will be evaluate the clinical efficacy of using graduated compression hosiery for&#xD;
      venospecific symptoms, leg edema, and quality of life (QoL) in pregnant women with varicose&#xD;
      veins (VV's).&#xD;

      Each pregnant woman randomly receive an envelope. Those who received numbers 01 to 40&#xD;
      constitute the intervention group, and those with numbers 41 to 80 are in the control&#xD;
      group.The intervention group will use a thigh length stockings with a compression of 23-32&#xD;
      mmHg, at least 8 hours a day. Verbal and written instructions on the proper use of the&#xD;
      stockings will provide. During follow-up period, monitoring the regular use of compression&#xD;
      stockings are performed every week. The physical characteristics of the patients, including&#xD;
      the age, height, weight, and gestational week, are obtained and recorded. The clinical&#xD;
      evaluation are performed using clinical-etiological and anatomical-pathophysiological&#xD;
      assessment based on the CEAP classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examinations, QoL assessment and duplex-ultrasound will perform two qualified&#xD;
      physicians in the 160 lower limbs of the 80 pregnant women with VV's at three landmark&#xD;
      periods: between the 12th and 15th (initial examination), 20th and 28th (intermediate&#xD;
      examination), and between the 28th and 36rd (final examination) week of gestation. The study&#xD;
      protocol includes examination of the deep and superficial venous system with recording the&#xD;
      reflux time and great and small saphenous veins (GSV/SSV) diameters in seven preestablished&#xD;
      points, 5 points in the GSV and 2 points in the SSV. A reflux time in the superficial veins&#xD;
      above 0.5 s is considered pathological reflux.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ankle and lower leg circumference are measured using a measuring tape. Measurements are&#xD;
      carried out at the lateral and medial ankle and the middle of the lower leg. All measurements&#xD;
      are carried out at the same time of the respective days in the late afternoon or early&#xD;
      evening; before the measurements the patients underwent a 45-min temperature and&#xD;
      cardiovascular equilibrium period in a sitting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QoL and subjective symptoms: tired, heavy legs, sensation of tension, tingling, and pain&#xD;
      are assessed at each visit before the volume measurements and ultrasonographic evaluation.&#xD;
      The subjective symptoms are evaluated by use of a semiquantitative scale from 0 to 3: 0 = no&#xD;
      symptoms; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe. The QoL is investigated at each visit by a&#xD;
      Chronic Venous Insufficiency Questionnaire (CIVIQ).&#xD;
