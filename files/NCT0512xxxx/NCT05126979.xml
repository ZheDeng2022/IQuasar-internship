      All subjects will be followed up for 21 days post-randomization. The subjects will further be&#xD;
      assessed at 2 days, 7 days, 21 days following the booster vaccination. Blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected for reactogenicity and safety and immunogenicity assessments before injection and&#xD;
      21 days after vaccination.&#xD;
