  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mexican American families share similar elevated risks for obesity and obesity-related&#xD;
      conditions, such as type 2 diabetes. Because negative family interactions and relationships&#xD;
      (e.g., poor communication, high conflict, low emotional closeness) are associated with&#xD;
      obesity treatment outcomes, this study tests a behavioral weight management intervention that&#xD;
      provides relationship skills counseling to mothers and adult daughters. The goal is to&#xD;
      improve family interaction patterns to buffer challenges and strengthen collaboration for&#xD;
      eating and physical activity behaviors that support long-term weight management and thus&#xD;
      provide an effective obesity treatment approach to address a major public health concern.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mexican American women are disproportionately affected by obesity and obesity-related&#xD;
      conditions, such as type 2 diabetes. Obesity and diabetes are highly concordant in Mexican&#xD;
      American families. Given the younger age of onset of diabetes in women with familial history,&#xD;
      targeting mothers and their adult daughters for obesity treatment is warranted. From a family&#xD;
      systems perspective, family-level approaches to obesity treatment can improve the adoption&#xD;
      and maintenance of weight management behaviors. Including family members in treatment may&#xD;
      also serve as a culturally salient intervention strategy as Mexican Americans endorse high&#xD;
      level of familism. In contrast to traditional individual-level approaches to obesity&#xD;
      treatment, a family-level approach grounded in familism would promote shared goals,&#xD;
      collaborative problem solving, and communal coping when treating family members alongside&#xD;
      each other. An important construct to consider when working with intergenerational Mexican&#xD;
      American families is differences in acculturation, which may translate into differences in&#xD;
      attitudes and behaviors. A wider gap in acculturation between parent and child has previously&#xD;
      been associated with lower family functioning (e.g., poor communication, high conflict, low&#xD;
      cohesion). However, interventions that promote bicultural competence by changing&#xD;
      interactional patterns have been effective at improving family functioning. Hence, this study&#xD;
      will conduct a randomized control trial testing the efficacy of a behavioral weight&#xD;
      management intervention with brief and structured counseling on family functioning. Mexican&#xD;
      American mothers and adult daughters (n=118 dyads) will be randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      standard behavioral treatment (SBT) or standard behavioral treatment plus relationship skills&#xD;
      training (SBTR). Dyads participating in SBT or SBTR will attend 24 weekly sessions focused on&#xD;
      nutrition and physical activity education along with behavior modification techniques. Dyads&#xD;
      participating in SBTR will also receive experiential-based relationship skills training that&#xD;
      draws from both general family systems concepts and behavioral family/couples therapy&#xD;
      approaches to support familism, biculturalism, and communication competencies. The 12-month&#xD;
      trial will consist of an intervention phase (1-6 months) and a maintenance phase (7-12&#xD;
      months). Assessments will be conducted at baseline and at the end of the intervention and&#xD;
      maintenance phases. The primary outcome is weight loss. Secondary outcomes include treatment&#xD;
      adherence (session attendance and self-monitoring records), physiological indicators of&#xD;
      diabetes risk (hemoglobin A1c, waist circumference, and body fat percentage), health&#xD;
      behaviors (eating and physical activity), psychological well-being (depression and perceived&#xD;
      stress), and family functioning (subjective self-report and objective behavioral coding).&#xD;
      Dyads in the SBTR group are expected to achieve greater improvements in primary and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes than the STB group. Additionally, mediation by family functioning of intervention&#xD;
      effects on primary and secondary outcomes will be examined.&#xD;
