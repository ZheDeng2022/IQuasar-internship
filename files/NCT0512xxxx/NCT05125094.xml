  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interventional therapy is an effective alternative for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
      (HCC) who are not indicated for surgery. CT or MRI imaging findings are important diagnostic&#xD;
      and evaluation criteria for preoperative diagnosis and postoperative efficacy evaluation of&#xD;
      TACE. In addition, the recurrence rate of liver cancer is very high, even with radical&#xD;
      treatment, the 5-year recurrence rate is still as high as 70%. Therefore, postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up and early detection of recurrent lesions by imaging are beneficial to the prognosis&#xD;
      and survival benefit. Gadoxetic acid is a liver-specific MRI contrast agent for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of liver cancer, especially in early stage, or small liver cancer (&lt;2cm). Therefore,&#xD;
      gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI is very important for the decision making and prognosis of HCC&#xD;
      patients. TACE combined with ablative therapy has received clinical attention, which can&#xD;
      significantly improve the clinical efficacy and reduce liver function damage. The study&#xD;
      forces on evaluating the changes in survival in patients with liver cancer who were scheduled&#xD;
      to receive TACE combined with ablation and regularly followed up, compared with enhanced CT&#xD;
      or conventional MRI as imaging assessment (preoperative diagnosis and postoperative&#xD;
      follow-up).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      China is a country with a high incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and the number of&#xD;
      new cases of HCC every year accounts for more than 50% of the world, while the diagnosis rate&#xD;
      of very early and early HCC patients in China only accounts for about 25%, and most patients&#xD;
      cannot be operated on. Interventional therapy is an effective alternative for patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who are not indicated for surgery. CT or MRI imaging findings&#xD;
      are important diagnostic and evaluation criteria for preoperative diagnosis and postoperative&#xD;
      efficacy evaluation of TACE. In addition, the recurrence rate of liver cancer is very high,&#xD;
      even with radical treatment, the 5-year recurrence rate is still as high as 70%. Therefore,&#xD;
      postoperative follow-up and early detection of recurrent lesions by imaging are beneficial to&#xD;
      the prognosis and survival benefit. Currently, the main clinical follow-up methods are&#xD;
      enhanced CT and non-gadoxetic acid enhanced magnetic resonance examination. Gadoxetic acid is&#xD;
      a liver-specific MRI contrast agent for the diagnosis of liver cancer, especially in early&#xD;
      stage, or small liver cancer (&lt;2cm). Compared with enhanced CT alone, the combination of&#xD;
      Gadoxetic acid MRI for pre-treatment diagnosis of early-stage HCC significantly improved&#xD;
      4-year survival. Therefore, gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI is very important for the decision&#xD;
      making and prognosis of HCC patients. TACE combined with ablative therapy has received&#xD;
      clinical attention, which can significantly improve the clinical efficacy and reduce liver&#xD;
      function damage. Currently, there are few studies on the survival rate of liver cancer&#xD;
      patients receiving TACE combined with ablative therapy with gadoxetic acid enhanced MRI. The&#xD;
      study forces on evaluating the changes in survival in patients with liver cancer who were&#xD;
      scheduled to receive TACE combined with ablation and regularly followed up, compared with&#xD;
      enhanced CT or conventional MRI as imaging assessment (preoperative diagnosis and&#xD;
      postoperative follow-up).&#xD;
