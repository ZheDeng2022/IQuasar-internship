  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a behavioural and neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorder that can affect behavioural, emotional, academic, social, and cognitive functions&#xD;
      and is not age-appropriate. The prevalence of ADHD among school children is reported to be&#xD;
      3%-11%. Children with ADHD have difficulties paying attention to details, concentrating,&#xD;
      completing tasks and following instructions, among other social and academic challenges. In&#xD;
      children with ADHD, insufficient activity in the prefrontal regions of the brain has been&#xD;
      evidenced, which is linked to executive function skills. Such children have difficulties in&#xD;
      performing executive functions that require a high level of cognitive skills, such as&#xD;
      self-control and regulation, as well as sequencing and planning tasks. The Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) addresses executive dysfunction as a&#xD;
      characteristic of ADHD. At the same time, 45%-70% of these children show problems in motor&#xD;
      skills. Motor problems associated with ADHD, such as manual dexterity, bilateral&#xD;
      coordination, and postural balance, can lead to difficulty in everyday living tasks, such as&#xD;
      eating and writing, as well as social adaptability, academic skills, and peer interactions.&#xD;
      For this reason, motor skill problems along with symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and&#xD;
      impulsivity, should be addressed as part of the treatment strategy. ADHD has an impact on a&#xD;
      child's independence for daily activities. As a result, child-specific occupational therapy&#xD;
      approaches are critical for the sensory, motor, and cognitive areas that affect children's&#xD;
      occupational performance in basic and instrumental activities of daily living, participation,&#xD;
      rest and sleep, play, and leisure.&#xD;

      Afyonkarahisar University of Health Sciences Non-Invasive Clinical Research Ethics Committee&#xD;
      evaluated the study with the 2011-KAEK-2 ethics committee code. The study was planned to be&#xD;
      carried out in Afyonkarahisar State Hospital Occupational Therapy Unit. It was planned to&#xD;
      include 30 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who were diagnosed with ADHD according to&#xD;
      the DSM-5 criteria by a child psychiatrist. Children will be randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups: 15 in the intervention group and 15 in the control group. At the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, the purpose of the study will be explained to the family and the child and informed&#xD;
      consent forms will be signed. Standard tests will be applied after the sociodemographic&#xD;
      information of the child and his family is obtained. With the CO-OP approach, the&#xD;
      intervention group will receive two sessions of therapy per week, each for approximately one&#xD;
      hour, for a total of 6 weeks and 12 sessions. After 6 weeks, standard assessments will be&#xD;
      repeated. The control group will receive the same standardized assessments at baseline and 6&#xD;
      weeks later with no further intervention.&#xD;

    <measure>The Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is an client-centred semi-structured interview method in which individuals score their performance and satisfaction in the activities that they need, want, or are required to accomplish in the areas of self-care, productivity, and leisure (17, 18). On a 10-point scale (1=not able to do=not satisfied at all, 10=can be done=pleased), the individual ranks the activities that he or she considers significant for themselves separately in terms of performance and satisfaction</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to determine whether children have met their functional activity goals. It's critical that the objectives are clear, measurable, and well-timed (21, 22). The various achievable results for each aim are defined independently at five levels while scoring the GAS: -2, -1, 0, +1, and +2. The initial level is -2, and the child's level is re-evaluated after the application</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency and Performance-Short Form (BOTMP-SF)</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The BOTMP-SF which was modified from the long version and is used to assess children's motor abilities, has 14 items and a maximum score of 98. BOTMP-SF assesses upper extremity coordination, balance, visual-motor control, and other skills in three areas: gross motor, gross-fine motor, and fine motor</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Executive Functions and Occupational Routines Scale (EFORTS)</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This scale is used to assess executive function skills and activity routines of children aged 6-12 years, including impulsivity, verbal and nonverbal memory, self-regulation, planning, and problem-solving. It is divided into three sections: morning-evening routine, game-entertainment routines, and social routines</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>five weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The VAS is a scale for converting some values that are difficult to measure numerically into numerical data. The participant uses a vertical line on a 0-10 cm scale to denote his or her emotional state, and the distance is measured with a ruler. The VAS was used to measure the level of satisfaction of families with therapy in this study.</description>

    <intervention_name>COGNİTİVE ORİENTATİTON DAİLY OCCUPATİONAL PERFORMANCE APPROACH</intervention_name>
    <description>Polatajko et al. (2001) developed the CO-OP approach, which is an occupation-oriented problem-solving approach that combines cognitive strategies to help children acquire motor abilities throughout daily tasks (9, 29). The CO-OP approach of therapy focuses on the goal or task at hand rather than the acquisition of functions in occupational performance. CO-OP is a 'deductive' or 'occupational performance-oriented' approach that focuses on the activity target selected throughout the therapy, as opposed to 'inductive' or 'impairment-focused' alternatives (13). As a verbal approach, CO-OP focuses on skill acquisition at the activity level and strives to provide children with global problem-solving skills. Necessary performance strategies specific to the child and the activity are determined with a customised programme (12, 30). Skill acquisition, cognitive strategy development, and adapting and transferring these acquired skills to daily life are the three key goals of the approach.</description>
