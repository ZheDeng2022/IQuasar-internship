  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Covid-19 pandemic has led to the postponement and cancellation of elective orthopaedic&#xD;
      surgeries worldwide. These delays to elective procedures combined with ongoing demand have&#xD;
      led to increasingly longer waiting list times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cross-sectional pilot study aims to investigate the change in patients' perceptions of&#xD;
      knee pain and function since being waitlisted for surgery. A bespoke survey will be&#xD;
      administered to eligible patients over the phone from Trafford General Hospital, Manchester.&#xD;
      The survey will also investigate the coping mechanisms and the preventative measures patients&#xD;
      are taking to manage symptoms during the pandemic, and question what kinds of communication&#xD;
      and support patient would like to be offered whilst waiting for treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will improve clinicians' and researchers' understanding of how patients are coping&#xD;
      with symptoms during this pandemic, and provide information on how to better support patients&#xD;
      who are waiting for knee surgery. This information could be used to enhance orthopaedic care&#xD;
      during, and in the aftermath, of this pandemic. The information gathered in this study may&#xD;
      also be used to inform a larger multi-centre study.&#xD;
