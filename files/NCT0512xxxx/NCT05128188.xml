  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Haemodialysis (HD) sustains life in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) but is&#xD;
      associated with a marked increase in incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and high&#xD;
      annual mortality rates. The pathogenesis of CVD in patients on HD is multifactorial and&#xD;
      complex but hypertension is thought to be a major contributing factor. Sodium balance is&#xD;
      normally regulated by the kidneys in health but has to be achieved by sodium removal during&#xD;
      HD for those with ESKD. Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of sodium in the skin and&#xD;
      / or muscle may be a critical factor impacting the development of hypertension and CVD in&#xD;
      patients with ESKD and non-invasive methods are therefore required to study tissue sodium&#xD;
      accumulation in this context. This study aims to determine the change in skin and muscle&#xD;
      sodium content in patients undergoing haemodialysis. Participants will have a single&#xD;
      haemodialysis session, and undergo two MRI scans (one prior to and one following dialysis).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been proposed that tissue sodium accumulation in skin and/or muscle is a key factor in&#xD;
      hypertension. 23Na MRI allows the assessment of skin and muscle sodium storage and will&#xD;
      therefore be a valuable tool in elucidating the role of tissue sodium accumulation in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of salt-sensitive hypertension and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Moreover, if haemodialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) results in&#xD;
      changes in tissue sodium, the development of 23Na skin and muscle measures would allow for a&#xD;
      method to correlate skin tissue sodium content with detailed cardiovascular and functional&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a single haemodialysis session, and undergo two MRI scans (one prior&#xD;
      to and one following dialysis), in conjunction with clinical data collection (eg. blood&#xD;
      samples, bioimpedance analysis, skin autoflorescence).&#xD;
