      This study aims to verify the effectiveness of the mindfulness-based elder care (MBEC)&#xD;
      therapy developed by McBee (2008) in improving the psychological and spiritual well-being of&#xD;
      seniors with disabilities living in residential long-term care institutions in Taiwan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Existing literature indicates that seniors with disabilities living in long-term&#xD;
      care institutions are confronted with such issues as changes in their living environment,&#xD;
      institutionalized living schedules, and reduced social interaction, which may affect their&#xD;
      mental health and cause spiritual disturbances. In recent years, mindfulness therapy has been&#xD;
      increasingly proven to effectively improve individuals' mental health and spiritual&#xD;
      well-being. However, the effectiveness of the therapy for seniors with disabilities admitted&#xD;
      to residential institutions needs to be further verified by empirical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: This study aims to verify the effectiveness of the mindfulness-based elder care&#xD;
      (MBEC) therapy developed by McBee (2008) in improving the psychological and spiritual&#xD;
      well-being of seniors with disabilities living in residential long-term care institutions in&#xD;
      Taiwan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Cluster randomized control trials were used. The subjects enrolled in this study&#xD;
      were the seniors with disability in the residential long-term care institutions in the&#xD;
      northern and central part of Taiwan. The inclusion criteria were the seniors with&#xD;
      disabilities who (1) lived in a care institution for over 3 months; (2) were aged 65 years or&#xD;
      above; (3) failed to obtain a full score for Barthel Index; (4) were able to communicate in&#xD;
      Mandarin or Taiwanese; and (5) had no history of mental illness. According to the&#xD;
      intervention scheme, the experimental group was offered eight 50-minute courses once a week,&#xD;
      while the control group maintained routine activities. In terms of the evaluation of&#xD;
      intervention effectiveness, basic data collection tables, mini-mental status examination&#xD;
      (MMSE), and the Barthel Index were used to collect the information of the included seniors&#xD;
      with disabilities on basic demography, cognitive function, and ability to perform daily&#xD;
      activities. The Geriatric Depression Scale-Short-Short Form (GDS-SF), State Trait Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (STAI), Meaning in Life Scale Test (PIL), and Spiritual Well-Being Scale (SWBS)&#xD;
      were also adopted to understand the included seniors with disabilities depression, anxiety,&#xD;
      purpose of life, and spiritual well-being. The data were collected four times: before the&#xD;
      intervention, in the middle of the intervention (the fourth week), at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention (the eighth week), and the follow-up four weeks after the intervention (the&#xD;
      twelfth week). The collected data was analyzed by SPSS 22.0. Descriptive statistics and the&#xD;
      independent samples t-test were used to identify the homogeneity of the two groups, and the&#xD;
      linear mixed model was used to compare the improvement results of the experimental group&#xD;
      alone and the two groups at different time points.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in depression summary scores before intervention to 4-week post intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>The data were collected before the intervention to week 12: baseline, in the middle of the intervention (the fourth week), at the end of the intervention (the eighth week), and the follow-up four weeks after the intervention (the twelfth week).</time_frame>
    <description>Depression was measured using the Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale-Short-Short Form (GDS-SF). The Geriatric Depression Scale-Short-Short Form scores range from 0 to 15. Higher scores represent an increased level of depressive symptoms and a cut-off value of 5 is commonly indicative of depression.</description>

    <measure>Change in Anxiety summary scores before intervention to 4-week post intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>The data were collected before the intervention to week 12: baseline, in the middle of the intervention (the fourth week), at the end of the intervention (the eighth week), and the follow-up four weeks after the intervention (the twelfth week).</time_frame>
    <description>Anxiety was measured using the Chinese version of the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The State Trait Anxiety Inventory measures two types of anxiety - state anxiety, or anxiety about an event. The total scores range from 40-160 and higher scores are positively correlated with higher levels of anxiety.</description>
