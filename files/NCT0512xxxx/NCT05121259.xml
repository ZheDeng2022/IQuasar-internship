  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a life changing disease which can cause negative effects on an individual's&#xD;
      ability to perform daily tasks and their quality of life (QoL). Lung cancer is the third most&#xD;
      common cancer in the UK and is estimated affects approximately 33,000 individuals per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common side effects from lung cancer and treatments are breathlessness, fatigue,&#xD;
      nausea, diarrhoea, and depression. Those living beyond cancer often suffer from extreme&#xD;
      feelings of isolation and have increased chance of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity is a vital component of the prevention and management of cancer. Being&#xD;
      active can improve one's physical health (ability to carry out tasks of daily living and&#xD;
      breathlessness) and emotional wellbeing (feelings of depression and isolation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic platforms (websites and mobile applications) are increasingly popular within&#xD;
      developing nations, particularly with products that aim to increase and keep track of&#xD;
      physical activity. Though, literature suggests older adults prefer websites opposed to mobile&#xD;
      applications. Online delivery of physical activity could be highly beneficial for patients&#xD;
      living with and beyond cancer, reducing the location-based inequality of those who can not&#xD;
      attend face-to-face programmes, allowing individuals to carry out a session whenever they&#xD;
      can, in the comfort of their own home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring how those living with and beyond lung cancer use a website and investigating the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability on an online platform which aims to provide tailored physical&#xD;
      activity programs will provide fundamental data and possible supporting data for a randomised&#xD;
      controlled trail (RCT).&#xD;

    <measure>Participant Satisfaction (Acceptability)</measure>
    <time_frame>39 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The metric which will be assessed to explore acceptability will be satisfaction.&#xD;
Satisfaction will be explored in four approaches.&#xD;
Satisfaction via research team developed questionnaire.&#xD;
Real-time open-ended feedback will be collected upon the first completion of a module&#xD;
Systems Usability Scale (Brooke, 1986). The 10-item questionnaire will provide a five-point Likert scale reporting method from &quot;Strongly Agree&quot; to &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; in relation to their agreement to statements.&#xD;
a selection of participants based on recruitment will be asked to take part in an interview to further explore satisfaction and acceptability. An interview guide covering experience of using the website, concerns, and suggested revisions will be followed. The interviews will be transcribed verbatim and analysed.</description>
