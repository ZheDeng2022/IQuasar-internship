  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Composite of modified items 1 to 11 of the Tremor Research Group Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale - Activities of Daily Living (TETRAS-ADL) Subscale and modified items 6 and 7 of the TETRAS Performance Subscale (TETRAS-PS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TETRAS-ADL subscale is a patient-rated scale of the impact of tremor on day-to-day functioning administered by a trained interviewer. The TETRAS-ADL subscale directly measures how a patient functions by assessing activities impacted by tremor, such as eating and drinking, dressing and personal hygiene, carrying items, and fine motor skills. The TETRAS-PS is a clinical rating scale that quantifies tremor in the head, face, voice, limbs, and trunk. Items 6 (drawing an Archimedes spiral) and 7 (handwriting) of the TETRAS-PS evaluate the impact of upper limb tremor on performance. The TETRAS-PS is performed by a blinded rater at the site. Each item from the modified TETRAS-ADL and TETRAS-PS ranges from 0 to 3, with 0 representing normal or slightly abnormal and 3 representing severely abnormal. The sum of the individual scores provides the overall score, ranging from 0 to 42, with higher scores representing more severe ET.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the Clinical Global Impression - Severity scale CGI-S</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a 5-point Likert-type rating scale that a qualified medical personnel will use to rate the severity of the participants' ability to function due to their ET. The responses to this scale range from 1 (no limitations) to 5 (severe).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Reported as Much Improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGI-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-C is a 5-point Likert-type rating scale that a qualified medical personnel will use to rate the change in severity of the participants' ability to function due to their ET since baseline. The responses to this scale range from 1 (Much improved) to 5 (Much worse).</description>

    <description>The PGI-C is a 5-point Likert-type rating scale that participants use to rate the change in severity of their ability to function due to ET since baseline. The responses to this scale range from 1 (Much improved) to 5 (Much worse).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the TETRAS-ADL subscale as Summarized by Each Dose of JZP385 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TETRAS-ADL subscale is a patient-rated scale of the impact of tremor on day-to-day functioning administered by a trained interviewer. The TETRAS-ADL subscale directly measures how a patient functions by assessing activities impacted by tremor, such as eating and drinking, dressing and personal hygiene, carrying items, and fine motor skills. The TETRAS-ADL has 12 items and each item is rated on a 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) scale, with higher scores representing more severe ET.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the TETRAS-PS Subscale as Summarized by Each Dose of JZP385 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TETRAS-PS is a clinical rating scale performed by a blinded rater that quantifies tremor in the head, face, voice, limbs, and trunk. Each item will be rated on a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe). The sum of the individual scores provides the overall score, ranging from 0 to 64, with higher scores representing more severe ET.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the Upper Limb Score (item 4) of the TETRAS-PS as Summarized by Each Dose of JZP385 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Item 4 of the TETRAS-PS measures upper limb tremor, and includes 3 maneuvers for each arm that assess postural and kinetic tremor. Each item is rated on a scale of 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) in 0.5-point increments. The total score is the sum of each of the 6 items and ranges from 0 to 24, with higher scores representing more severe ET. The TETRAS-PS is performed by a blinded rater.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the TETRAS Total Score, as Summarized by Each Dose of JZP385 and Placebo.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The TETRAS total score is the sum of the scores of the full TETRAS-ADL and TETRAS-PS subscales. Each item is rated on a 0 (normal) to 4 (severe) scale, and total scores range from 0 to 112, with higher scores representing more severe ET. The TETRAS-PS is performed by a blinded rater.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) as Summarized by Each Dose of JZP385 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Quality of Life in Essential Tremor Questionnaire (QUEST) was developed to specifically assess the impact of ET on health-related quality of life. The QUEST is a 30-item questionnaire comprising 5 subscales (physical, psychosocial, communication, hobbies/leisure, and work/finance) and a total score, plus 3 additional items relating to sexual function and satisfaction with tremor control and medication side effects. Each item is rated by frequency on a scale from 0 (never) to 4 (always), with higher scores indicating greater dissatisfaction or disability due to ET.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Week 12 on the Essential Tremor Embarrassment Assessment (ETEA) as Summarized by Each Dose of JZP385 and Placebo</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>The Essential Tremor Embarrassment Assessment (ETEA) is a participant-rated questionnaire administered by a health care provider or researcher that contains 14-items assessing embarrassment related to tremor. Participants provide a simple response (disagree or agree) to each of the 14-items, the sum of which yields an initial score (Score A, range = 0 to 14). Participants then provide a more nuanced response to each question on a 0 to 5 point Likert scale ranging from disagree (0) to agree strongly (5). The sum of the nuanced responses yields a second score (Score B, range = 0 to 70). Higher scores on both the simple and nuanced responses indicate greater embarrassment.</description>
