    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Peer Intervention to Link Overdose Survivors to Treatment (PILOT) study is&#xD;
      to improve outcomes for individuals after surviving an overdose involving opioids. This study&#xD;
      will be comparing the enhanced peer intervention known as PILOT for overdose survivors with&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) provided in the Emergency Department.&#xD;
