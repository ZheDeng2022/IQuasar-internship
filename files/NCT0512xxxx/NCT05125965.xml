      Anti-cancer immunotherapy, one of the therapeutic revolutions of recent years. It is based on&#xD;
      the use of antibodies that block immune system checkpoints that have been hijacked by cancer&#xD;
      cells to benefit themselves. Blocking these checkpoints, such as PD-1, unleashes the action&#xD;
      of anti-cancer T cells that can then destroy the tumor. The efficacy of these targeted&#xD;
      therapies is significant, with an average 40% response rate in patients with metastatic&#xD;
      cancers.Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are becoming a 1st line therapy in many oncology&#xD;
      indications due to their therapeutic line in many oncology indications due to their favorable&#xD;
      effect on the prognosis of various prognosis of various cancers Since checkpoints play a key&#xD;
      role in controlling the intensity and duration of an immune response, their immune response,&#xD;
      therefore, their inhibition exposes to adverse inflammatory or autoimmune effects&#xD;
      inflammatory or autoimmune adverse effects that can be severe and sometimes lethal.Most side&#xD;
      effects of ICIs occur within the first few months after initiation of treatment. The toxicity&#xD;
      of immunotherapy is immunological, all organs including the heart can be including the heart,&#xD;
      can be affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac autoimmune involvement in ICIs can involve the myocardium, pericardium, and/or&#xD;
      vascular endothelium. These entities may be interrelated or, on the contrary, isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last 5 years, the number of described cases of myocarditis associated with&#xD;
      ICIstreatment has increased. Their incidence remains low, estimated between 0.5 and 2%. This&#xD;
      probably represents the most serious cardiovascular complication, as the mortality attributed&#xD;
      to it reaches almost 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years MRI has become very important in the noninvasive diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      myocarditis. The latest update of the Lake Louise criteria in 2018 has thus confirmed cardiac&#xD;
      MRI in its first place among noninvasive examinations for the diagnosis of myocarditis with a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 87.5%, a specificity of 96.2%, and a positive predictive value of 97.2%.&#xD;
