  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the primary pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of DRF&#xD;
      active metabolite monomethyl fumarate (MMF) following multiple doses of DRF in Chinese and&#xD;
      Caucasian adult healthy participants. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the secondary&#xD;
      PK parameters of DRF active metabolite MMF following multiple doses of DRF in Chinese and&#xD;
      Caucasian adult healthy participants, to evaluate the PK of DRF inactive major metabolite&#xD;
      2-hydroxyethyl succinimide (HES) following multiple doses of DRF in Chinese and Caucasian&#xD;
      adult healthy participants and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of multiple oral doses&#xD;
      of DRF in Chinese and Caucasian adult healthy participants.&#xD;

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants with Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>

    <description>A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>
