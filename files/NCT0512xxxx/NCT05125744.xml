  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators aim to assess the effects of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) on&#xD;
      diaphragmatic activity evaluated through ultrasound and electrical activity of the diaphragm&#xD;
      in patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) for acute respiratory failure (ARF)&#xD;
      assisted via invasive mechanical ventilation in assisted mode.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All adult critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) and undergoing&#xD;
      invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) for more than 24 hours with diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure (ARF) will be screened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria will be : pregnancy, neuromuscular diseases, wounds or incision at the&#xD;
      probe placement site, contraindications to diaphragmatic and abdominal wall unltrasound,&#xD;
      contraindications to the placement of a specific nasogastric feeding tube (Electrical&#xD;
      activity of the diaphragm catheter).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all enrolled patients ventilated in assisted mode, diaphragmatic activity will be&#xD;
      evaluated through ultrasound and electrical activity of the diaphragm (primary end point) at&#xD;
      stepwise decreasing of PEEP level. Also, the activity of remaining respiratory muscles will&#xD;
      be assessed through sonography at the same levels of PEEP (secondary end point) Across all&#xD;
      study phases, patients will be sedated to assure a Richmond sedation Agitation Scale (RASS)&#xD;
      score between 0 and -1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded for each positive end-expiratory pressure explored:&#xD;
      dosage of sedative drugs, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), inspired oxygen fraction&#xD;
      (FiO2), inpiratory and expiratory tidal volume, respiratory rate, electrical activity of the&#xD;
      diaphragm (Eadi), thickness of diaphragmatic, parasternal intercostal, external oblique,&#xD;
      internal oblique and transversus abdominis, combined with the lung ultrasound score.&#xD;
      Thickness is measured at both end-expiration and end-inspiration for each respiratory&#xD;
      muscles, as indirect estimation of respiratory muscles effort, and calculated according to&#xD;
      standard formula as follows: Thickening fraction (%) = (inspiratory thickness - expiratory&#xD;
      thickness) / expiratory thickness * 100. All ultrasonographic measurements will be performed&#xD;
      bedside with patients in semi-recument position, only on the right side , using a portable&#xD;
      ultrasound machine equipped with a linear (7.5 - 12.0 MHz) or convex (2.0 - 4.0 MHz) probe.&#xD;
      The same protocol will be carried out in case of non invasive ventilation application after&#xD;
      extubation, reducing PEEP and inspiratory support&#xD;
