  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcer is defined by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (EPUAP) and the&#xD;
      National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel (NPUAP) as &quot;localized skin and/or skin, usually&#xD;
      arising over bony prominences, caused by pressure alone, or by a combination of shear and&#xD;
      pressure. subcutaneous tissue damage. Pressure ulcer is a painful, costly and preventable&#xD;
      health problem that is frequently encountered especially in geriatrics group and in patients&#xD;
      with limited daily activities or bedridden. It is an undesirable health care problem that is&#xD;
      difficult to treat, but it is possible to prevent the development of pressure ulcers with the&#xD;
      measures to be taken from the beginning of the disease. In order for nurses to fulfill their&#xD;
      role in preventing pressure ulcers, the content of undergraduate education programs needs to&#xD;
      be arranged in a way that will provide them with knowledge and skills in the prevention of&#xD;
      pressure ulcers, diagnosis of risky patients and maintenance of care. In Northern Cyprus,&#xD;
      knowledge and skills related to pressure sores are provided to students in the basic nursing&#xD;
      education curriculum. However, the subject of pressure ulcer in the education programs of&#xD;
      nursing schools differs in terms of content and duration, and most of the hospitals do not&#xD;
      have a standard guide and training program for the prevention of pressure ulcers. In Northern&#xD;
      Cyprus, studies on the knowledge and practices of nursing students to prevent pressure ulcers&#xD;
      are limited. According to the results of a study conducted in Turkey, it has been reported&#xD;
      that a significant portion of nursing students have a positive attitude towards preventing&#xD;
      pressure ulcers, but their general knowledge about preventing pressure ulcers is&#xD;
      insufficient. In another study, it was reported that 70.7% of nursing students encountered&#xD;
      patients with pressure ulcers during hospital practices, but research findings and the&#xD;
      knowledge of nursing students to prevent the development of pressure ulcers were&#xD;
      insufficient. Similarly, in studies conducted with nursing students using different scales,&#xD;
      it has been reported that students' knowledge levels about preventing pressure ulcers are&#xD;
      low. This research was planned in accordance with the randomized controlled research method&#xD;
      in order to determine the knowledge levels and practices of firts year nursing students to&#xD;
      prevent pressure ulcers.&#xD;

      The population of the research will be 1st year (n=100) students studying at the Faculty of&#xD;
      Health Sciences Nursing Department in the 2021-2022 Academic Year Fall Semester. Since 1st&#xD;
      year students do not have any information about pressure ulcers yet and other classes (2nd,&#xD;
      3rd, 4th grade students) have received information about pressure ulcers before, they were&#xD;
      excluded from the study, as this would affect the average scores. The entire population that&#xD;
      meets the criteria for inclusion in the study will be included in the sample. Before starting&#xD;
      the research, the enclosed Informed Consent Form will be distributed to the students and&#xD;
      their consent will be obtained stating that they are willing to participate in the research.&#xD;
      &quot;Student Descriptive Characteristics Questionnaire and &quot;Pressure ulcer Knowledge Assessment&#xD;
      Tool&quot; updated version (PUKAT 2.0) all groups will be collected before and after the training&#xD;
      by face-to-face interview method. Students will be divided into two groups by simple&#xD;
      randomization method. Group distributions will be divided into group 1 and group 2 by drawing&#xD;
      lots. Students who are divided into groups will not know what the group they belong to means&#xD;
      In this case, group 1 students will be included in the research in accordance with the&#xD;
      flipped learning model, and group 2 students will be included in the research in accordance&#xD;
      with the traditional education method. Group 1 students and educational materials (lecture&#xD;
      presentation, video) will be uploaded through the system in accordance with the flipped&#xD;
      learning model, and students will be asked to come prepared to the planned lesson. No&#xD;
      classical presentations will be made to the students, but the education will be carried out&#xD;
      in the form of question and answer discussion, in line with the Flipped Learning model. The&#xD;
      training, consisting of Group 2 students and a Powerpoint presentation, will last 20-30 on&#xD;
      average, and will be given in accordance with the traditional education model. After the&#xD;
      lesson, the questions of the students who have questions will be answered. After obtaining&#xD;
      the necessary ethics committee approval, the data collection phase will begin.&#xD;
