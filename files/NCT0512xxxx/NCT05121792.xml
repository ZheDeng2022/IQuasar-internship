  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Death of a loved one is a difficult life experience. About 1 in 10 bereaved people are&#xD;
      strongly affected by the loss and grieve intensely for a long time. As a result of the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic, more people may struggle with grief. The investigators have developed and&#xD;
      tested a talk therapy for prolonged grief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed an online grief training for clinicians. The investigators&#xD;
      will test if clinicians benefit from the online training and if they find it helpful and&#xD;
      engaging. The investigators will recruit 30 mental health professionals as trainees to&#xD;
      undergo the training. The mental health professionals will complete questionnaires before and&#xD;
      after training to determine how much they learned and how much they liked the training.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators developed a short-term, manualized Prolonged Grief Disorder Therapy (PGDT),&#xD;
      originally known as Complicated Grief Treatment and found it efficacious in three large&#xD;
      National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored randomized controlled trials.&#xD;
      Facilitating access to training in Empirically Based Treatments has been identified as a&#xD;
      national priority by both mental health professional organizations and NIMH. One way to help&#xD;
      disseminate therapist training on EBT of Prolonged Grief Disorder (PGD) is through the use of&#xD;
      new technologies. The investigators recently developed an online therapist training program&#xD;
      in PGDT and a patient facing therapist-assisted web-based form of PGDT. The investigators are&#xD;
      now looking to evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of each of these online tools in&#xD;
      pilot studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tutorial contains 10 modules, each about 20-40 minutes long with information needed for&#xD;
      effective delivery of PGDT. Participants will be encouraged to space out the tutorial vs.&#xD;
      taking it in a few long sessions, to facilitate knowledge retention. A post-test will be&#xD;
      given immediately after completing each module, as testing done closer to when the material&#xD;
      was learned also improves retention. Participants will be encouraged to complete the tutorial&#xD;
      within 5 weeks (about one hour or two modules per week). Consistent with continuing education&#xD;
      guidelines, successful completion will require an overall score of 80% on post-tests.&#xD;
      Participants would need to retake the module until a passing score is obtained. Interactive&#xD;
      Patient Scenarios will be integrated into the tutorial at strategic points, in order to&#xD;
      integrate conceptual and applied knowledge. All participants will be asked to evaluate&#xD;
      whether the stated learning goals of each module were met and complete user satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaires on both the technical aspects of the on-line tutorial (using the System&#xD;
      Usability Scale), and the clinical content (using the User Satisfaction Questionnaire).&#xD;
      Participants will have access to the tutorial indefinitely, in order to provide a resource&#xD;
      that they can refer back to as they begin to use these skills with patients.&#xD;

    <measure>User Satisfaction Questionnaire (USQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 (after training completion)</time_frame>
    <description>The USQ evaluates participant satisfaction with the clinical content of web-based applications, and how effective the participant felt the learning was. The USQ contains 15 statements, each rated on a 4-point scale (strongly agree, agree, disagree, strongly disagree), and covers several dimensions of the user experience. It also solicits open-ended feedback. The scale ranges from 15 to 60, with a higher score indicating user satisfaction. The investigators will consider an overall mean score of 45 (i.e., an average score of 3 [&quot;agree&quot; on all items]) to demonstrate acceptable user satisfaction with the clinical content.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale (SUS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 5 (after training completion)</time_frame>
    <description>The SUS is a 10-item self-report scale designed to evaluate the usability and user satisfaction with web-based and other technologies. It obtains quantitative feedback on a 0-100 scale regarding the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction users experience while interacting with engineered systems. A mean SUS score significantly greater than 50.9 (mean rating for systems considered &quot;Okay&quot;) would be evidence of system user-friendliness; &quot;Good&quot; is considered a mean rating of 71.4 or better.</description>
