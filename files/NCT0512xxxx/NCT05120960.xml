  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, multi-arm, biomarker-driven phase 1 study to assess the RP2D, PK/PD,&#xD;
      safety, and activity of tepotinib in participants with MET alterations and brain tumors.&#xD;
      Eligible patients include those with brain metastases or glioblastoma, including patients who&#xD;
      are surgical candidates. In patients with EGFR+ NSCLC with EGFR-TKI resistance and MET&#xD;
      amplification, tepotinib will be given in combination with osimertinib. This phase 1 study&#xD;
      will be conducted in 2 parts, Phase 1a (dose exploration) and Phase 1b (dose expansion).&#xD;
      Phase 1a will include a surgical resection window of opportunity component. Phase 1b (dose&#xD;
      expansion) can open once the relevant RP2D has been estimated in Phase 1a (dose exploration).&#xD;
      Phase 1a (Dose Exploration): Patients will be assigned to dose levels within a Group as&#xD;
      outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. Group A will be comprised of patients who are&#xD;
      surgical resection candidates with newly-diagnosed or recurrent brain metastases and MET&#xD;
      alteration. Group B will be comprised of patients who are surgical resection candidates with&#xD;
      recurrent glioblastoma and MET alteration. Group C will be comprised of patients with&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed or recurrent brain metastases and epidermal growth factor receptor mutated&#xD;
      (EGFR+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase 1b (Dose Expansion): Upon completion of the&#xD;
      Phase 1a (dose exploration) component and estimation of a RP2D, dose expansion may proceed&#xD;
      within Group A (consisting of patients with brain metastasis and MET alteration) and Group C&#xD;
      (EGFR+ NSCLC brain metastasis, TKI resistance, and MET amplification). Dose expansion in&#xD;
      these 2 groups may be done concurrently, but enrollment in each group does not require&#xD;
      completion of the entire Phase 1a component of the study. There will not be a Group B&#xD;
      (glioblastoma) in Phase 1b. Patients in Phase 1b will not undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
