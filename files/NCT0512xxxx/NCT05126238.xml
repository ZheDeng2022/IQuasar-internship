  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are 10.3 million cases of stroke registered in the world every year; 63% of them lead&#xD;
      to death. According to World Health Organization, stroke is one of the most important risk&#xD;
      factors of death and early disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carotid artery surgery is a gold standard of hemodynamically significant carotid artery&#xD;
      disease treatment. According to some trials, carotid artery surgery decreases the 2-years&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important part of carotid artery surgery is a temporary absence of blood flow in the&#xD;
      carotid artery. The duration of this period is a crucial characteristic of this type of&#xD;
      surgery. The absence of blood flow leads to brain ischemia which is the risk factor of&#xD;
      postoperative neurocognitive disorders such as emergence delirium, postoperative delirium and&#xD;
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some surgical and non-surgical methods for brain protection were evaluated. According to&#xD;
      recent data, there is no evidence of effective pharmacological protective methods that can&#xD;
      decrease brain damage during carotid artery surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, some trials demonstrated that using lithium-based medications for patients with&#xD;
      a stroke can reduce the volume of the stroke. Therefore, the investigators want to check the&#xD;
      hypothesis that using lithium-based medication in the preoperative period can reduce brain&#xD;
      damage during carotid artery surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if Lithium carbonate is superior to placebo for the occurrence of emergence&#xD;
           delirium, agitation, postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if Lithium carbonate is non-inferior to placebo for the occurrence of a new&#xD;
           arrhythmia, leukocytosis, acute kidney injury, seizure disorders, diarrhea, nausea, and&#xD;
           vomit.&#xD;
