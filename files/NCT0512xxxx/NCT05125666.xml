  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of using a selected dual-task- training&#xD;
      program to improve postural stability in children with ataxia after medulloblastoma&#xD;
      resection. Thirty patients will participate in this study. Patients will be classified&#xD;
      randomly into two equal groups: study and control groups -Both groups will receive&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy treatment including mobility exercises, balance exercises, gait&#xD;
      training exercises, and exercises to improve physical conditioning. In addition, the study&#xD;
      group will receive a selected dual-task training program including balance and cognitive&#xD;
      activities. The treatment program will be conducted three days per week for eight successive&#xD;
      weeks. The patients will be assessed with the Scale of Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, Humac&#xD;
      Balance System, the Pediatric Balance Scale and Functional Independent Measurement. The&#xD;
      measures will be recorded two times: before the application of the treatment program (pre)&#xD;
      and after the end of the treatment program (post).&#xD;
