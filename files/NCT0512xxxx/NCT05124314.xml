  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of a combination of two drugs&#xD;
      (mifepristone and misoprostol) to only one of these drugs (misoprostol) in medical management&#xD;
      of missed miscarriage up to 13+6 weeks of pregnancy (early pregnancy loss).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to enroll 220 patients within two years which would be enough to&#xD;
      determine the difference between these two treatments with confidence.&#xD;

      Aim: To investigate the safety and efficacy of combination of mifepristone and misoprostol&#xD;
      versus misoprostol alone in medical management of early pregnancy loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To test the hypothesis that the sequential combination of mifepristone and&#xD;
      misoprostol is superior to misoprostol alone for the complete evacuation of uterus in&#xD;
      patients diagnosed with early pregnancy loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives: To test the hypothesis that the addition of mifepristone reduces the&#xD;
      need for further doses of misoprostol, duration of bleeding, complication rate and side&#xD;
      effect frequency. The investigators will also evaluate if the addition of mifepristone&#xD;
      improves patient satisfaction and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with a diagnosis of early pregnancy loss that opt for medical treatment and sign an&#xD;
      informed consent will be included. The participants will be randomized to two groups. First&#xD;
      group will receive oral mifepristone (600 mg) and the second group will not. The remaining&#xD;
      course of treatment will be the same for both groups including giving misoprostol (800 mcg&#xD;
      vaginally) 48 hours after receiving mifepristone for the first group or immediately for the&#xD;
      second group. 24 hours after receiving first dose of misoprostol, one more dose of&#xD;
      misoprostol (also 800 mcg vaginally) will be given if no pregnancy tissue is lost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three weeks after medical treatment, primary and secondary outcomes will be assessed. In case&#xD;
      of unsuccessful treatment (incomplete evacuation of uterus), surgical evacuation will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      220 women will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio.&#xD;
