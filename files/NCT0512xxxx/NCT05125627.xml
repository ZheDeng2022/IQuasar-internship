      An open-label, randomized, single dose, two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence, fully&#xD;
      replicated crossover bioequivalence study with a washout period of 7 days in healthy female&#xD;
      subjects under fasting conditions.Mode of administration:Intravaginally, the capsule&#xD;
      introduced deeply into the vagina while lying down.During each period 25 blood samples were&#xD;
      drawn 5 mL at (-1.00,-0.50,-0.137), before dosing and at 0.50, 1.00, 1.50, 2.00,2.50, 3.00,&#xD;
