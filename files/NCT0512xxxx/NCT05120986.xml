  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, descriptive, open-label, prospective, 6-month study including a&#xD;
      group of patients with a first prescription of IND/GLY/MF with sensor and a group with a&#xD;
      first prescription of IND/GLY/MF without sensor.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be invited prospectively and sequentially to participate in the study when&#xD;
      attending a participating community pharmacy with a first prescription of IND/GLY/MF with&#xD;
      sensor or IND/GLY/MF without sensor. Therefore, the invitation for the patient to participate&#xD;
      in the study will occur only after the therapeutic decision has taken place&#xD;
