      The primary purpose of this study is to determine the safe reduction of the treatment&#xD;
      fractions to 10, 8, or 5, that may be delivered safely in resected head and neck squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients with intermediate pathologic risk features.&#xD;

      RATIONALE: Postoperative hypofractionated radiation is well established in many malignancies,&#xD;
      yielding benefits in compliance, access to care, convenience, and cost savings. In several&#xD;
      solid tumor types, short-course high dose-per-fraction (hypofractionated) post-operative&#xD;
      radiation has shown excellent tolerability, reduced healthcare costs, improved compliance,&#xD;
      and at least equivalent cancer control compared to conventional post-operative radiation&#xD;
      (long course, low dose-per-fraction).(1-3) Despite advances in other malignancies,&#xD;
      hypofractionated post-operative radiation is not used in previously untreated mucosal HNSCCs,&#xD;
      for which an extended course of conventional post-operative radiation (usually 60 Gy in 2 Gy&#xD;
      fractions delivered over six weeks) remains the standard. Hypofractionation has been stymied&#xD;
      in the post-operative setting for HNSCCs primarily due to concerns of toxicity in treating a&#xD;
      large mucosal field and an inability to spare critical structures such as the brain and&#xD;
      spinal cord. These concerns were well-founded in the 1970s during the era of 2-dimensional&#xD;
      radiotherapy when conventional HNSCC radiotherapy regimens were developed.(4) But because&#xD;
      radiotherapy can be delivered far more precisely using intensity modulated radiation therapy&#xD;
      (IMRT), it is hypothesized that post-operative radiation for HNSCCs can now be delivered&#xD;
      safely in only five fractions delivered over one week.(3, 5, 6)&#xD;

             willing/able to use medically acceptable forms of contraception during treatment and&#xD;
