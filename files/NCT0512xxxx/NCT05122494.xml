  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, randomized, multicenter, 2-arm, open-label clinical trial designed to&#xD;
      compare the safety and efficacy of Hemay022+Aromatase inhibitor(AI) with that of capecitabine&#xD;
      + lapatinib in participants with ER+/HER2+ locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
      Participants will be treated until disease progression (PD), unmanageable toxicity, or study&#xD;
      termination. Once disease progression is reported, all participants will be followed for&#xD;
      survival every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up.&#xD;
