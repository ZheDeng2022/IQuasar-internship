    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating the effectiveness of escalating doses of Amitriptyline and&#xD;
      Duloxetine in reducing cough frequency in patients with interstitial lung disease&#xD;
      (ILD)-related cough.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, dose escalation study&#xD;
      of Duloxetine &amp; Amitriptyline in subjects with interstitial lung disease-related chronic&#xD;
      cough. Subjects will be screened during a period of up to 2 week and will undergo screening/&#xD;
      baseline cough monitoring. A total of 25 subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned in a 1: 1: 1: 1: 1 ratio to one of five treatment arms using stratified&#xD;
      randomization in blocks of 5. Each arm will have two successive 4-week treatment periods&#xD;
      (Blinded Period 1 &amp; 2). After this, patients will be unblinded and receive routine clinical&#xD;
      care. During the unblinded (routine clinical care) follow up phase; subjects will be&#xD;
      initially offered the option of continuing amitriptyline or duloxetine based on their initial&#xD;
      randomization arm. Subjects could also choose an alternative chronic cough therapy (e.g.&#xD;
      pregabalin, gabapentin, 1% tetracaine lollipop or nebulized lidocaine or combination&#xD;
      therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in treatment arm 5, who received placebo during the 8 weeks blinded period will have&#xD;
      a discussion regarding all available cough therapies. Patients will be offered the&#xD;
      flexibility of therapy options during the unblinded follow up as they would during routine&#xD;
      clinical care. Participation in the unblinded follow-up period will be optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arm 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded Period 1 (1st 4 weeks): 30mg of Duloxetine Blinded Period 2 (2nd 4 weeks): 30mg of&#xD;
      Duloxetine &amp; 30mg of Placebo Unblinded (routine clinical care) follow up period: (up to 52&#xD;
      weeks): Subjects will be offered routine clinical care management for their chronic cough&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Arm 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded Period 1 (1st 4 weeks): 30mg of Duloxetine Blinded Period 2 (2nd 4 weeks): 60mg of&#xD;

    <masking_description>During the initial 8- week period, this will be a double-blind study. Both subjects and all study personnel (except for the research pharmacist) will be blind to the treatment assignment. Unblinding for both subjects and study investigators will occur at the end of the 8-week blinded treatment period.&#xD;
The subjects and all personnel involved with the conduct and the interpretation of the study, including the Investigators and other study personnel (except the research pharmacist) will be blinded to the treatment codes. Randomization data will be kept strictly confidential by the study statistician, and accessible only to authorized persons until the time of unblinding.&#xD;
Only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the investigational product is essential for the welfare of a subject, the principal investigator may unblind a subject's treatment assignment during the 8-week blinded treatment period.</masking_description>

    <measure>Change in awake objective cough frequency (at 4 &amp; 8 weeks)</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate awake cough frequency at 4 and 8 weeks using the Leicester Cough Monitor. The acoustic cough monitor recordings will be analyzed using the Leicester Cough Monitor program V2.3-MB. This will also be performed at months 4, 6, 9 &amp; 12 for subjects who choose to continue with the optional unblinded continuation of the study after the initial 8 weeks.</description>

    <description>This will also be evaluated using using the Leicester Cough Monitor and recordings will be analyzed using the Leicester Cough Monitor program V2.3-MB. All recordings will be kept confidential on a secure encrypted device. This will also be performed at months 4, 6, 9 &amp; 12 for subjects who choose to continue with the optional unblinded continuation of the study after the initial 8 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Change in Cough Severity Diary score</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using self-reported Cough Severity Diary that patients will fill at baseline and on daily basis. Change in self-reported Cough Severity Diary score at 4 and 8 weeks will be evaluated.&#xD;
Patients will be asked a series of 6 questions including and will provide an answer using a 5-point Likert scale (never, rarely, sometimes, often, constantly). The following questions will be evaluated:&#xD;
In the past 24 hours, how often did you cough? In the past 24 hours, how often did you experience coughing fits? In the past 24 hours, how severe was your cough? In the past 24 hours, how often did you have an urge to cough? In the past 24 hours, how often could you control your cough? In the past 24 hours, how severe was your pain from coughing?&#xD;
This will also be performed at months 4, 6, 9 &amp; 12 for subjects who choose to continue with the optional unblinded continuation of the study after the initial 8 weeks</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ-acute) individual domain and total scores</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks, 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Leicester Cough Questionnaire (Acute) is a validated tool for the assessment of chronic cough. It evaluates physical, psychological and social domains and how they are impacted by chronic cough. The physical domain consists of 8 questions, the psychological domain consists of 7 questions, and the social domain consists of 4 questions. The domain score will be calculated as the total score from questions in the domain divided by the number of items in the domain (range 1-7). The total score is the sum of individual domain scores and ranges from 3-21. The individual domain as well as the total score will be reported on weeks 4 &amp; 8. This will also be performed at months 4, 6, 9 &amp; 12 for subjects who choose to continue with the optional unblinded continuation of the study after the initial 8 weeks.</description>

             -but are not limited to- corticosteroids, immunosuppressing agents such as&#xD;
             azathioprine and mycophenolate, as well as antifibrotic medications including&#xD;
             nintedanib and pirfenidone. Additional corticosteroids and adjustment of ILD-directed&#xD;
             therapy doses is permitted if deemed appropriate by the treating physician&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a score of ≥ 40mm on the Cough Severity VAS at Screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential must agree to use 2 forms of acceptable birth control&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male subjects and their partners of child-bearing potential must use 2 methods of&#xD;
             acceptable birth control, 1 of which must be a barrier method, and make no donation of&#xD;

             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

             regardless of previous response to therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently pregnant or breastfeeding female subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of any medical condition or disability that the investigators believe could&#xD;
