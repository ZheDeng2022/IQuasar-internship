  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medical imaging commonly involves the use of radiation, such as x-rays, that can give&#xD;
      detailed images of internal structures of the body but can carry a small risk of tissue&#xD;
      damage due to the radiation involved. As such, the number of x-rays and computed tomography&#xD;
      (CT) scans that an individual can have has to be minimised. Methods have recently been&#xD;
      developed that make use of electromagnetic radiation for imaging purposes at terahertz (THz)&#xD;
      frequencies, the region of the spectrum between millimetre wavelengths and infrared.&#xD;
      Terahertz spectroscopic imaging uses low power levels such that adverse effects on tissues&#xD;
      are insignificant and is safe for in vivo imaging of humans [1]. The terahertz region is&#xD;
      between the radio frequency region and the optical region generally associated with lasers.&#xD;
      Both the IEEE RF safety standard and the ANSI Laser safety standard have limits into the&#xD;
      terahertz region. The focus of this project is to investigate THz spectroscopic imaging as a&#xD;
      new and powerful tool for analysing skin properties, termed &quot;THz skinometry&quot;. The novelty in&#xD;
      this project lies in tailoring the instrumentation and algorithms of THz scanning to&#xD;
      accurately measure properties of human skin (e.g. hydration levels and skin thickness) in&#xD;
      vivo. The customised non-contact and pressure-controlled contact THz probes developed will be&#xD;
      able to do spectroscopic measurements of skin in vivo at the molecular level. This will be&#xD;
      the first demonstration of in vivo THz imaging of skin globally and will facilitate&#xD;
      quantitative characterisation of skin in a way that has hitherto not been possible and could&#xD;
      lead to a step change in THz technology usage (similar to that currently used in airport&#xD;
      security scanners).&#xD;

      The SINATRA study is pilot study with a primary aim to explore the feasibility of the trial&#xD;
      methodology. In addition, secondary objectives of the study will investigate if THz light is&#xD;
      able to detect subtle differences in skin hydration and their clinical relevance. Due to the&#xD;
      unprecedented sensitivity of THz light to skin hydration, the investigators will also&#xD;
      investigate if different skin types have a preferential uptake of certain emollients. This&#xD;
      would include dry skin conditions such as eczema, psoriasis and post-operative scars. This&#xD;
      will give us information on how to optimise the types of emollients used in future&#xD;
      development of new moisturisers and sunscreens. This is already under investigation in a&#xD;
      cohort of volunteers with unaffected skin (unpublished pilot study data, University of&#xD;
      Warwick). Additionally, as part of the SINATRA study, the investigators will investigate if&#xD;
      THz imaging is able to detect subclinical (invisible) skin cancer (residual basal cell&#xD;
      carcinoma (BCC)) and enhance the diagnosis of suspected skin cancer (malignant melanoma) in&#xD;
      vivo. Skin cancer is known to produce a localised inflammatory reaction and microscopic&#xD;
      swelling and so the changes in skin hydration may be able to be objectively measured by THz&#xD;
      skinometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Terahertz (1012 Hz) pulsed imaging is a new technique with high resolution and has only&#xD;
      emerged recently as a potential new clinical tool for medical imaging. It is a safe imaging&#xD;
      modality as the light is non-ionising - it has a million times lower energy than an x-ray and&#xD;
      thus doesn't have enough energy to cause ionisation. The power levels used in the THz systems&#xD;
      in this study are also very low such that there are no lasting effects. In particular, our in&#xD;
      vivo THz imaging systems have a peak power less than 40mW and average power intensity less&#xD;
      than 4 µW/cm2. Studies by Hough et al [2] have shown that even using peak power 50,000 times&#xD;
      higher and an average intensity 30 times higher does not cause any change in gene expression.&#xD;
      Therefore, power levels used in our THz in vivo imaging systems are safe and have no known&#xD;
      side effects or risks&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SINATRA study will collect preliminary pilot data from participants in a two-arm&#xD;
      feasibility observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. One arm will consist of 100 patients with known or suspected skin cancer (skin cancer&#xD;
           defined as: incompletely excised BCC with histologically proven radial margin&#xD;
           involvement; biopsy proven BCC, or pigmented lesions suspicious of malignant melanoma).&#xD;
           Images will be taken in the clinic prior to planned skin surgery and later compared to&#xD;
           the formal histology results after the primary (melanoma) or residual (BCC) tumour has&#xD;
           been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second arm will consist of 50 patients with benign dry skin conditions (eczema,&#xD;
           psoriasis, skin grafts, scars etc.) and will compare the water content of their skin&#xD;
           before and after application of a propriety emollients in common usage (e.g. E45®,&#xD;
           Aveeno®, Doublebase®). This will add to the existing dataset that has been recorded from&#xD;
           healthy non-patient volunteers (unpublished data, University of Warwick). This may help&#xD;
           to guide patient-specific emollient selection in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will add to the knowledge base to define the appearance of skin cancers under THz&#xD;
      skinometry. The spectroscopic findings will not influence the established management that&#xD;
      will have been planned in conjunction with a Consultant Dermatologist or Plastic Surgeon and&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 1: The study arm of 50 patients with benign dry skin conditions will undergo a scan&#xD;
      with the THz skinometer and will compare the water content of skin before and after&#xD;
      application of propriety emollients in common usage (e.g. E45®, Aveeno®, Doublebase®).&#xD;
      Participants will have a THz scan of the dry skin area and a control area. Then they will&#xD;
      apply their emollient and wait 10 minutes having another 2 scans of the control area and dry&#xD;
      skin area. Finally there will be another 10 minute wait before having a final scan of the&#xD;
      control area and dry skin area. There are 6 scans in total for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arm 2: The arm with 100 patients with known or suspected skin cancer will have a scan&#xD;
      with the THz skinometer in the clinic prior to their planned skin surgery. They will be&#xD;
      scanned on the cancerous area and a control area for a total of 2 scans. Later the results of&#xD;
      the THz scan will be compared to the formal histology results after the primary (melanoma) or&#xD;
      residual (BCC) tumour has been removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vivo THz images from a case study of patients with BCC in 2004 suggested that it should be&#xD;
      possible to detect skin cancer hidden beneath the skin using THz imaging. Spectroscopic&#xD;
      studies by Emma MacPherson and her colleagues in Cambridge in 2006 showed that the&#xD;
      fundamental THz properties of freshly removed (excised) skin cancer tumours are statistically&#xD;
      significantly different from healthy tissue and it is thought that the differences are&#xD;
      primarily due to changes in water content of the tissue. The high sensitivity of THz light to&#xD;
      water also means that the THz signal is strongly attenuated and has a very limited&#xD;
      penetration depth in tissue - thus THz scanning would experience great difficulty in&#xD;
      detecting deep tumours. The penetration depth depends on the signal-to-noise ratio of the THz&#xD;
      imaging system, therefore efforts to improve the signal processing and/or the THz&#xD;
      instrumentation have been made. Since then, EM has been investigating the underlying THz&#xD;
      image contrast mechanisms as well as developing new algorithms and approaches to improve the&#xD;
      accuracy of sample characterisation as well as accelerating THz image data acquisition. This&#xD;
      more recent work is pushing the state-of-the-art in THz in vivo imaging, both in accuracy and&#xD;
      speed. This, crucially, means the investigators are now better equipped to do THz imaging in&#xD;
      vivo studies and the investigators have even been able to account for the pores of skin being&#xD;
      blocked (occluded) by the imaging window for the duration of the THz measurement. This&#xD;
      'occlusion' process means the skin cannot breathe normally and water accumulates in the outer&#xD;
      most layer of skin, the stratum corneum (SC). EM has exploited this phenomenon to pioneer the&#xD;
      use of THz imaging to determine rate of water diffusion within the SC during occlusion. EM&#xD;
      has also been developing in vivo imaging instrumentation techniques and identifying the key&#xD;
      variables and parameters such as contact pressure and occlusion duration. EM's latest results&#xD;
      show that the refractive index of the skin increases both with increasing pressure and&#xD;
      increasing occlusion time. These results will be used to develop the THz skinometer and&#xD;
      accompanying characterization algorithms, within this study. EM's findings show how THz&#xD;
      imaging can be used to measure the hydration profile and water diffusivity of skin and this&#xD;
      is the basis of the theory that will be further developed in the SINATRA study to evaluate&#xD;
      the penetration and durability of emollients and sunscreens in different skin types. The&#xD;
      pilot data collected in the SINATRA trial will be valuable in developing a larger trial&#xD;
      leading to a transformative improvement in prevention and treatment of skin cancer and better&#xD;
      moisturisation strategies for other skin conditions.&#xD;
