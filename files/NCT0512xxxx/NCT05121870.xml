  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. There is a large unmet need for&#xD;
      safe and alternative therapeutic potions. This clinical trial is to inspect the efficiency&#xD;
      and safety of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy for decompensated cirrhosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decompensated cirrhosis has a high overall mortality rate. Liver transplantation is still the&#xD;
      most effective treatment for decompensated cirrhosis. However, the shortage of matched liver&#xD;
      sources, high costs, and rejection after liver transplantation restrict the development of&#xD;
      liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are a kind of pluripotent stem cells belonging to mesoderm,&#xD;
      which mainly exist in connective tissue and organ interstitium. At present, MSC can be&#xD;
      isolated and prepared from bone marrow, fat, synovium, bone, muscle, lung, liver, pancreas&#xD;
      and amniotic fluid and umbilical cord blood . Due to its wide range of sources and&#xD;
      self-proliferation and differentiation ability, MSCs have therapeutic potential for many&#xD;
      diseases, including acute and chronic liver diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, our team has carried out a series of clinical trials using umbilical&#xD;
      cord-derived MSCs to treat patients with end-stage liver disease, decompensated cirrhosis,&#xD;
      primary biliary cholangitis, and status after liver transplantation and found that MSCs&#xD;
      therapy can significantly improve patient liver function, reduce post-transplantation&#xD;
      rejection, reduce complications, improve quality of life, and improve survival. Other&#xD;
      investigators have also found in clinical trials with MSCs from different sources that&#xD;
      treatment with MSCs can improve MELD scores or liver function levels to varying degrees.&#xD;
      However, some studies have found no significant difference between the treatment group and&#xD;
      the control group, and MSCs may differentiate into hepatic stellate cells and have the risk&#xD;
      of promoting liver fibrosis, it is believed that MSCs do not favor the improvement of liver&#xD;
      function in these studies. Therefore, the therapeutic effects of MSCs need to be further&#xD;
      validated by larger multicenter randomized controlled clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will do a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to&#xD;
      assess treatment with three intravenous doses of MSCs compared with placebo. 240&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis patients will be recruited in China.120 patients will receive i.v.&#xD;
      transfusion 3 times of MSCs (6.0×10E7 cells per time) and the standard of care as the treated&#xD;
      group. In addition, the 120 patients will receive placebo and standard of care as control&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

    <description>The Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) is a scoring system that evaluates the liver function reserve and prognosis of patients with chronic liver disease by creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), and bilirubin-conjugated cirrhosis etiology.&#xD;
The MELD score is calculated by the formula: R = 9.6 × ln (creatinine mg/dl) + 3.8 × ln (bilirubin mg/dl) + 11.2 × ln (INR) + 6.4 × etiology, and the results are taken as integers. ( 0 for cholestatic and alcoholic cirrhosis and 1 for other causes of cirrhosis such as viruses).</description>
