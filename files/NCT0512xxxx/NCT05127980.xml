  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the occurrence of antibodies cross-reacting with&#xD;
      autoantigens that have been detected in the context of SLE in patients with primary EBV&#xD;
      infection over time compared to a control group. It is to establish a biobank of patients&#xD;
      with primary EBV infection allowing to longitudinally analyze the immune response and its&#xD;
      accompanying inflammatory processes with focus on the occurrence of antibodies cross-reacting&#xD;
      with autoantigens associated with SLE and other autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Substudies will analyze&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  characteristics of primary EBV infection patients treated with antibiotics in comparison&#xD;
           to patients treated without antibiotics and outcomes of these treatment regimens&#xD;
           (occurrence of acute complications such as peritonsillar abscess (PTA) or need for&#xD;
           tonsillectomy, frequency of fatigue or symptoms associated with chronic fatigue&#xD;
           syndrome).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations in primary EBV infection compared to control patients&#xD;
           with similar symptoms and its association with disease severity and local complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the occurrence of fatigue and symptoms associated with chronic fatigue syndrome 6 and 12&#xD;
           months after primary EBV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is a lymphotropic herpes virus and the causative agent of infectious&#xD;
      mononucleosis (IM). The course of EBV infection is determined by the virus load and an&#xD;
      individuals' immune system state, which in turn is determined by the person's gene&#xD;
      composition, other infection history and several environmental factors, which all may&#xD;
      influence the immune capacity of a person to various degrees. Many diseases are known to be&#xD;
      associated with EBV infection, among those diseases are systemic autoimmune diseases. With&#xD;
      regard to EBV, prior infection with the virus seems to be of crucial importance for the&#xD;
      development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Autoantibodies against complement C1q&#xD;
      (anti-C1q) can be induced in vivo by the Epstein-Barr virus-derived antigenic site 'EBNA348'&#xD;
      (also being part of the C-terminal EBNA-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to analyze whether the primary infection with EBV (leading to IM and antibodies&#xD;
      targeting EBV-derived antigens including antibodies against EBNA-1) leads to an at least&#xD;
      transient occurrence of antibodies against the virus that have the potential to cross-react&#xD;
      with autoantigens as described in patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (e.g. complement&#xD;
      C1q, dsDNA, Ro, Sm, MOG, NF186 and others). The advantage of an analysis of patients with&#xD;
      primary infection is that the de novo synthesis of antibodies against the virus will allow to&#xD;
      determine the time-dependent evolution of the antibody repertoire against the virus as well&#xD;
      as against a number of autoantigens.&#xD;

    <description>FACIT-F is a 13-item instrument designed to assess fatigue/ tiredness and its impact on daily activities and functioning in a number of chronic diseases. The instrument includes items such as tiredness, weakness, listlessness, lack of energy, and the impact of these feelings on daily functioning (e.g., sleeping, and social activities). Items are scored on a 0 - 4 response scale with anchors ranging from &quot;Not at all&quot; to &quot;Very much so&quot; (in which higher scores represent better functioning or less fatigue).</description>
