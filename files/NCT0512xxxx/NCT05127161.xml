      Reducing inappropriate antibiotic use is a key strategy to mitigate antibiotic resistance and&#xD;
      adverse health effects associated with antibiotic exposure. The Broad Implementation of&#xD;
      Outpatient Stewardship (BIOS) project focuses on broadly implementing an evidence-based&#xD;
      intervention to improve antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory tract infections in&#xD;
      pediatric outpatient settings. Primary aims include: (1) examining the acceptability,&#xD;
      feasibility and utility of a focused implementation strategy on improving intervention&#xD;
      adoption and impact and (2) measuring the effectiveness of the intervention to reduce&#xD;
      unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic prescription.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics are commonly prescribed for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in&#xD;
      pediatric outpatient settings, but up to half of antibiotic use is inappropriate. Prior work&#xD;
      demonstrated broad-spectrum antibiotics did not improve patient health outcomes compared to&#xD;
      narrow-spectrum antibiotics, but did increase harmful side effects. Overuse of broad-spectrum&#xD;
      antibiotics can exacerbate antibiotic resistance and drug-related adverse events. Certain&#xD;
      interventions have been effective in improving antibiotic prescribing, but none have been&#xD;
      implemented widely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BIOS project focuses on broadly implementing an evidence-based intervention to improve&#xD;
      how clinicians in outpatient settings prescribe antibiotics for ARTIs in children 6 months to&#xD;
      12 years old. The intervention consists of educational modules and prescribing audit and&#xD;
      feedback reports delivered to clinicians in a variety of outpatient settings across 5 health&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary aims include: (1) examining the acceptability, feasibility and utility of a focused&#xD;
      implementation strategy on improving intervention adoption and impact and (2) measuring the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention to reduce unnecessary broad-spectrum antibiotic&#xD;
      prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinicians will be randomized to one of two arms: an early intervention arm or a delayed&#xD;
      intervention (control) arm. The study will use a 4-period design, where the periods are as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 0: Baseline period that occurs prior to randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 1: clinicians in the early intervention arm receive the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 2: All clinicians (both arms) receive the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 3: Maintenance period, external support from the study team is removed&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinician inclusion criteria: Any non-trainee clinician who prescribes and provides&#xD;
             care for children aged 6 months to 12 years with ARTIs and who is practicing at an&#xD;
             included site. Clinicians will further be selected based on employment status at time&#xD;
             of randomization and volume of prescribing over the past 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visit inclusion criteria: visits made by patients of all participating practices aged&#xD;
             6 months through 12 years of age will be considered part of the project population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinician exclusion criteria: clinicians who are trainees, who do not prescribe (or&#xD;
             prescribe very infrequently) to the patient population of interest, or who do not&#xD;
             provide care for (or provide care very infrequently for) children aged 6 months to 12&#xD;
             years with ARTIs will be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Visit exclusion criteria: visit by children with complex chronic conditions, as well&#xD;
             as those treated with an antibiotic in the past 30 days, will have their data&#xD;
             extracted but will be excluded from analyses&#xD;
