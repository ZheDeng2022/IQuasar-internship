  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Video streaming as an additional tool to telephone was introduced in some Norwegian emergency&#xD;
      medical call centers during the spring of 2020. This allows the dispatchers to communicate&#xD;
      with the caller through video streaming during emergency calls. Some studies are conducted on&#xD;
      this use of video streaming, but further research is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators have chosen to focus on potential effect from video&#xD;
      streaming on bystander first aid for injured patients. The investigators have knowledge from&#xD;
      preliminary results that dispatchers often find video streaming useful in emergency calls&#xD;
      regarding injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate whether the use of video streaming might have an effect on the&#xD;
      recognition rate by dispatchers on the need for bystander first aid for injured patients. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators will investigate whether video-instructions from dispatcher can&#xD;
      improve bystander first aid quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will be using data collected by ambulance personnel including patients with&#xD;
      injuries, as well as data from EMCC journals and audio logs.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emergency Medical Communication Centres (EMCCs) in Norway receive more than 400 000 emergency&#xD;
      calls every year, resulting in more than 250 000 ambulance dispatches. Emergency calls are&#xD;
      answered by nurses or paramedics with special training, who by audio assesses the situation&#xD;
      and decides on a response. Video streaming as a supplement to telephone in EMCC was&#xD;
      introduced during springtime 2020 in Norway, and is independent of this study. The intended&#xD;
      effect was to improve shared situational awareness between caller and operator, and thus&#xD;
      improve the triage process. The video solution is live-only, and caller must give consent.&#xD;
      Limited scientific evidence for such use exists, and even if video calls seems commonplace in&#xD;
      society, the effects and acceptance in EMCCs has mainly been studied in simulated settings.&#xD;
      Preliminary results from the early launch of video streaming showed that injured patients was&#xD;
      one of the conditions where the dispatchers seemed to find video streaming useful. Previous&#xD;
      studies by Bakke et.al investigating bystander first aid for injured patients, showed a&#xD;
      potential for dispatchers in EMCCs to recognize more injured patients with the need for&#xD;
      bystander first aid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study focuses on the effect of video streaming in EMCCs on bystander first aid. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to investigate whether dispatchers identifies the need for relevant first&#xD;
      aid measures more frequently when using video streaming. The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      several health trusts in Norway. In health trusts where video streaming not yet has been&#xD;
      implemented in the EMCC, the investigators will collect data from period before video&#xD;
      streaming is implemented, and after video streaming is implemented. From some health trusts&#xD;
      in the study, video streaming already been implemented, and data collection will hence only&#xD;
      be conducted for an after-period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and population size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number needed to treat is based on the studies by Bakke et al, as well it is based on one&#xD;
      of our outcome goals: an aim for improvement of correctly identification of need for first&#xD;
      aid by EMCC operator from 35% to 50%. Bakke et al included 355 cases during 18 months, which&#xD;
      was done in a study area with approximately 270.500 inhabitants. For achievement of power of&#xD;
      0,80 and p-value &lt;0,05 we need each study group to be 169, with the aimed improvement of 15%.&#xD;
      Adding an estimate of missing cases of 10%, our study sample size for each group for this&#xD;
      outcome measure is estimated to approximately 200 cases. For the outcome goal on quality&#xD;
      improvement on first aid, which we aim the effect to be a raise in 20%, there is no&#xD;
      aggregated outcome from previous studies to base an improvement on. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore base our study sample size on number of cases included in Bakke's study. For this&#xD;
      study to reach inclusion of 355 cases and with a study area with 1.150.000 inhabitants, the&#xD;
      investigators need four months for each period. In Bakke's study, inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      based on ICD-10 from hospital admissions. The investigators are therefore confident that the&#xD;
      study will reach a minimum of 355 cases including patients not admitted to hospital as well.&#xD;
      Based on these calculations on study sample sizes, the investigators estimate each of the&#xD;
      before- and after periods to last 4 months, where cases before video implementation will be&#xD;
      compared to calls after, separated by a wash-in period of 1-2 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and analyzes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included by ambulance personnel after the study's inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Ambulance personnel on scene will collect data through an internet-based questionnaire on&#xD;
      need for first aid measures and quality of bystander first aid. In addition, data will be&#xD;
      collected from EMCC journals and audio logs. This data will contain information on&#xD;
      dispatchers recognition of first aid measures, as well as information on prehospital&#xD;
      resources and time data. The investigators will also apply for data from the National Trauma&#xD;
      Registry. Ambulance personnel participating in the data collection will complete an&#xD;
      educational course about the questionnaire. The questionnaire used will be validated in a&#xD;
      separate study. Analyzes of primary and secondary outcomes will be executed according to the&#xD;
      ITT-principle. Uni- and multivariate regression analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is assessed by the Regional ethics committee in Norway as outside area of&#xD;
      jurisdiction. It is approved by the Norwegian Center for Research Data and the Norwegian&#xD;
      Health Directorate.&#xD;
