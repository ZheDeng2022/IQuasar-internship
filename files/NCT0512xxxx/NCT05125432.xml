      Purpose:Acupuncture for arthralgia induced by aromatase inhibitors in patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer associated with screening of SNPs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Aromatase inhibitor-induced arthralgia (AIA) is the most common side effect of aromatase&#xD;
      inhibitors (AIs) used in breast cancer , may cause poor adherence to AIs. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that acupuncture has a certain therapeutic effect on AIA in breast cancer. In this study,&#xD;
      acupuncture was used to relieve the symptoms of arthralgia in patients, and the efficacy of&#xD;
      acupuncture was observed by using relevant scales. Currently, studies have shown that AIA in&#xD;
      breast cancer patients is related to some biological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, we collected peripheral blood samples of patients, combined with the&#xD;
      reported relevant literature, screened out the single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNP) related&#xD;
      to AIA and to guide acupuncture treatment of aromatase Inhibitors induced arthralgia, balance&#xD;
      the toxicity of endocrine therapy, and improve compliance and effectiveness.&#xD;

    <description>Acupuncture group Patients with breast cancer who experienced AIA were assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI)scale and McMasters College Osteoarthritis Index Score (WOMAC). Patients who met the criteria for inclusion would receive regular acupuncture treatment. The location of acupuncture is based on the principles of acupuncture treatment in Traditional Chinese medicine. Patients with high scores and obvious pain received standardized acupuncture treatment, and standard acupuncture points and most painful joint (up to 3) specific point. Meanwhile, blood samples of patients were collected, and SNP related to AIA was screened through SNP typing technology.</description>
