      This study was conducted to evaluate and compare the efficacy of Olinanoseal and Curodont&#xD;
      D'Senz in treatment of dentin hypersensitivity.&#xD;

      Materials and Methods:- A total of ninety (90) samples were used in the study, for dentin&#xD;
      permeability test (dye penetration test) and Scanning Electron Microscopic examination (SEM)&#xD;
      which were randomly divided into two main groups; group A1, completely removed smear layer,&#xD;
      group A2, partially removed smear layer. Each group was subdivided into three subgroups&#xD;
      according to the desensitizing agent applied: OliNano SEAL, Curodont D'Senz and the control&#xD;
      group that were left untreated. Seventy (70) hypersensitive teeth in ten patients were&#xD;
      enrolled for the current study. The subjective assessment of dentin hypersensitivity was done&#xD;
      prior to the application of the desensitizing agent (baseline) then immediately, 2 weeks, 4&#xD;
      weeks and 3 months after application of the tested materials. Patients were informed to rate&#xD;
      their perception to tactile, air and cold stimuli by using Verbal Rating Score (VRS) and&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
