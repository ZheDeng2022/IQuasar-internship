             confirmed by follow-up hormone level assessment ;&#xD;

             symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy)&#xD;
             or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago. In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when&#xD;
             the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level&#xD;
             assessment, is she considered not of child bearing potential;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Sexually active males that do not to use a condom during intercourse while taking the&#xD;
             drug and for 3 months after stopping GT0918 treatment and should not father a child in&#xD;
             this period. A condom is required to be used also by vasectomized men in order to&#xD;
             prevent delivery of the drug via seminal fluid.&#xD;
