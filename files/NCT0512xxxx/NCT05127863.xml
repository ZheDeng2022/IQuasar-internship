  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Developmental Language Disorder (DLD) or Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have&#xD;
      communicational difficulties to adapt their language to context and to interlocutors. These&#xD;
      difficulties have long term impacts on education and social life of these patients&#xD;
      (Whitehouse, Line, Watt, &amp; Bishop, 2009). Speech language therapists (SLT) helps child and&#xD;
      teenagers with pragmatic and communicational disorders. Nevertheless, few research evaluated&#xD;
      the efficacy of such interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present research, the students will do a literature review to identify efficacy&#xD;
      intervention's strategies of pragmatic disorders. Then, 2 to 5 patients, aged from 8 to 14&#xD;
      years old, with ASD or DLD and pragmatic disorders, and who haven't intellectual disorder&#xD;
      will be recruited. They will come to the faculty of psychology of UCLouvain before the&#xD;
      beginning of the intervention. In this pretest session, parents will answer questionnaires et&#xD;
      children will have tests in order to evaluate their pragmatic abilities (during 30 minutes),&#xD;
      like conversations, role plays, communication referential tasks, etc. This evaluation will be&#xD;
      video recorded to code pragmatic abilities. Then, a group intervention of ten sessions will&#xD;
      be proposed (1 session per week, 10 weeks). Activities will include role plays,&#xD;
      conversations, etc. At the end of the intervention period, a post test session, like the&#xD;
      pretest session, will be proposed to evaluate intervention efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design is multiple study cases. This is the best design to control efficacy of these kind&#xD;
      of interventions considering the inter-individual variability of DLD and ASD patients. This&#xD;
      study is original since few research evaluated the efficiency of pragmatic intervention. Some&#xD;
      studies demonstrated the efficacy of pragmatic intervention in DLD and ASD patients but&#xD;
      theses researches were conducted in English-speaking countries. Furthermore, the present&#xD;
      research will propose a group intervention, which weren't proposed in the literature to our&#xD;
      knowledge (individual intervention). If the group intervention is efficacy, the cost-benefice&#xD;
      ratio would be interested.&#xD;
