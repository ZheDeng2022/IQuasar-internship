    <textblock>
      The passive Talaris Demonstrator (TD) is developed in continuation of previous prototypes.&#xD;
      The main goal of the experiment is to evaluate the effectiveness of TD during daily&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Twenty-eight healthy active participants with an unilateral transtibial amputation will&#xD;
      conduct 2 experimental trials (EXP1 &amp; EXP2) on the same day in a randomized order, i.e. EXP1&#xD;
      with the currently used prosthesis and EXP2 with the passive Talaris Demonstrator. Each&#xD;
      experimental trial will include 6 minutes of treadmill walking at 3 different speeds in&#xD;
      consecutive blocks of 2 minutes, a slope walking test, a stair climbing test, a L-test and an&#xD;
      outdoor walking task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The six minutes walk test (6MWT) has become one of the most widely used performance-based&#xD;
      outcome measures of functional mobility and exercise capacity. Recently, the 6MWT has been&#xD;
      found to correlate with single-limb balance time and symmetry of step length in people with&#xD;
      amputation. Additionally, the 6MWT distance has been shown to be responsive to functional&#xD;
      training interventions in people with lower-limb amputation. Six minutes of treadmill walking&#xD;
      at 3 different speeds will be performed. This test will be performed in consecutive blocks of&#xD;
      2 minutes. These consecutive blocks will be walking 2 minutes at self-selected (SS) speed, 2&#xD;
      minutes at 75% of the SS speed and 2 minutes at 125% of the SS speed. These different walking&#xD;
      speeds elicit different angular positions of the ankle and activation levels of muscles, and&#xD;
      thus might alter the effectiveness of the novel device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The slope walking test assesses the participants' ability to ascend and descend a 6 m long&#xD;
      ramp of 10% inclination as fast as possible. For safety reasons bilateral handrails are&#xD;
      warranted. Participants start the test in an upright position in front of the ramp and are&#xD;
      asked to ascend the ramp, turn around on the platform, descend the ramp and return to the&#xD;
      starting position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The stair climbing test assesses the participants' ability to ascend and descend a staircase&#xD;
      (84 cm total height, 3-step staircase with an average rise of 28 cm and run of 18 cm).&#xD;
      Participants start in front of the staircase and are asked to ascend and descend as fast as&#xD;
      possible. Again, bilateral handrails are required to allow support when needed. The ascending&#xD;
      phase is initiated with the prosthetic side, while the first step of the descending phase is&#xD;
      performed with the non-involved leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The L-test, requires higher physical activity of the user. During the L-test, participants&#xD;
      are asked to rise from a chair, walk 7 meters, turn 90 degrees, walk 3 meters, turn 180&#xD;
      degrees and then return in the same way to the seated position. A total distance of 20 meter&#xD;
      is covered.&#xD;
