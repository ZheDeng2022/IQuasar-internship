  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the pandemic COVID-19, which has resulted in nearly&#xD;
      five million deaths worldwide since its spread in the beginning of 2020. In the United&#xD;
      States, there are now two emergency use authorized vaccines that make use of messenger&#xD;
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) based technology that are highly effective for preventing COVID.&#xD;
      However, because multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune condition, many individuals with&#xD;
      multiple sclerosis take medicines that affect the immune system. The investigators are not&#xD;
      sure whether individuals on certain MS medications, including medications that lower a type&#xD;
      of immune cell called B lymphocytes, will form as robust of a response to the vaccines. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will be gathering more information about effectiveness of these&#xD;
      vaccines and bloodwork that looks at antibodies and other markers of vaccine response and by&#xD;
      asking patients about COVID-19 infections.&#xD;

      SARS CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the pandemic COVID-19, which has resulted in nearly&#xD;
      five million deaths worldwide since its spread in the beginning of 2020. In the United&#xD;
      States, there are currently two emergency use authorized mRNA based vaccines against severe&#xD;
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a&#xD;
      neurological autoimmune disease involving the central nervous system and requiring long-term&#xD;
      immunomodulating therapy to control relapse and progression. While there are many approved&#xD;
      medications for the treatment of MS, agents that work through B-lymphocyte depletion or&#xD;
      sequestration are among the commonly used treatments. There is concern that individuals with&#xD;
      low levels of circulating B-cells might not mount an effective humoral or cellular immune&#xD;
      response after vaccination. Moreover, it remains to be understood whether, at certain&#xD;
      timepoints within the treatment cycle, there is a greater immune response mounted while on&#xD;
      B-cell depleting medication. Availability of such knowledge could guide counseling and&#xD;
      management of patients on immunomodulatory therapy. Aim: To ascertain efficacy of mRNA based&#xD;
      SARS CoV-2 vaccines in individuals with MS across the immunotherapy spectrum, via biomarker&#xD;
      data of humoral and cellular immunity and via clinical data. Blood will be drawn for markers&#xD;
      of immunity and sequence-based analysis before and after vaccination at predetermined time&#xD;
      points. The investigators will document the type of immunotherapy being used at the time of&#xD;
      vaccination. Clinical data on diagnosis of SARS-CoV2 infection will be collected at each of&#xD;
      the prespecified timepoints.&#xD;
