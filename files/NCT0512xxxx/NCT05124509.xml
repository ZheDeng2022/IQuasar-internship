  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed over 5 million lives globally.&#xD;
      Fortunately, a substantial and growing number of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines with very high efficacy&#xD;
      have been developed, manufactured, and rapidly approved. Novel mRNA vaccines such as the&#xD;
      BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna) have reported a stunning &gt;94% efficacy&#xD;
      against COVID-19. However, global access has not been equitable, with many low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries having no vaccine access or access under emergency use mainly to&#xD;
      traditional inactivated SARS-CoV2-2 vaccines such as BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm Beijing),&#xD;
      CoronaVac (Sinovac) and BBV152 (Bharat Biotech). Emerging studies have shown that lower&#xD;
      concentrations of neutralizing antibodies (Nab) are attained after CoronaVac than after an&#xD;
      mRNA-based vaccine in healthy individuals. This difference seems to be more pronounced in&#xD;
      immunocompromised patients who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and death from COVID-19.&#xD;
      As such, several countries including the United States, Israel and Chile have recommended a&#xD;
      third vaccine dose for high-risk populations. However, it is not currently known which is the&#xD;
      best vaccine combination regarding immunogenicity, particularly in these vulnerable patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will explore the humoral and cellular response to a SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      BNT162b2 vaccine booster in solid organ transplant patients who received two previous doses&#xD;
      of the inactivated Coronavac or two doses of BNT162b2 vaccines.&#xD;
