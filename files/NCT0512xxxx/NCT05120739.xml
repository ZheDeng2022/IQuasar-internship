  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgical site infections (SSI) in orthopedic surgery are rare events but associated with&#xD;
      great morbidity as well as a significant additional cost. The World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      recently carried out meta-analyzes on all the existing prophylactic measures and could not&#xD;
      rule on the use of chlorhexidine (CHX) cloths due to the low number of studies available. CHX&#xD;
      cloths could actually benefit patients for whom preoperative showering is not possible,&#xD;
      whether in emergency or trauma settings due to pain-induced functional impotence. A&#xD;
      randomized controlled clinical study aimed at evaluating the in vivo microbiological efficacy&#xD;
      of CHX cloths in a population of orthopedic surgery patients while evaluating the&#xD;
      psycho-social determinants of adherence to a new preoperative preparation technique seems&#xD;
      essential.&#xD;
