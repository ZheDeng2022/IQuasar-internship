    <textblock>
      From May 2020 to May 2021, we retrospectively evaluated clinical cardiac magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (CMR) examinations performed in patients with suspected cardiac involvement post COVID-19.&#xD;
      Between May 2021 and August 2021, we evaluated patients with suspected cardiac disease after&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We searched our hospital database for patients that underwent a clinical CMR examination&#xD;
      between May 2020 and May 2021 for suspected cardiac pathology post COVID-19. For comparison,&#xD;
      CMR examinations from January until August 2021 were searched for suspected cardiac pathology&#xD;
      post COVID-19 vaccination. The study complies with the declaration of Helsinki and was&#xD;
      approved by the ethics committee of the Charité-Universitätsmedizin Berlin (EA2/020/21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR Imaging All scans were performed for clinical indications on either a Philips Ingenia 3.0&#xD;
      T scanner or a Philips Ambition 1.5 T scanner according to recent recommendations for CMR in&#xD;
      patients post COVID-19. Protocols were adjusted to the clinical scenario but generally&#xD;
      included standard CINE imaging, T2 STIR edema imaging, basal and medial short axis T2 mapping&#xD;
      (T2-GraSE) and pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping (MOLLI), and Late-Enhancement-Imaging&#xD;
      (mDIXON). Vasodilator stress with Regadenosone or Adenosine was performed in patients with&#xD;
      clinically suspected myocardial ischemia. The Adenosine dose was 0.140 µg/kg/min, with an&#xD;
      increase to 0.210 µg/kg/min in case of insufficient response. The Regadenosone dose was 200µg&#xD;
      irrespective of weight, followed by Theophyllin reversal as needed (max. 200mg). The contrast&#xD;
      agent was 0.1 mmol/kg Gadobutrol (Gadovist®, Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CMR image analysis Image post-processing and measurements were performed according to recent&#xD;
      recommendations using dedicated CMR post-processing software (IntelliSpace Portal V11.1,&#xD;
      Philips, Best, The Netherlands). The diagnosis of 'probable myocarditis' was based on the&#xD;
      updated Lake Louise Criteria requiring findings of myocardial damage (LGE) and edema (T2 STIR&#xD;
      or T2 mapping) in a non-ischemic pattern (intramyocardial or subepicardial). Evidence of&#xD;
      edema without myocardial damage was considered 'possible myocarditis' whereas myocardial&#xD;
      damage without edema was considered 'subsided myocarditis.&#xD;

    <description>From May 2020 to May 2021, we retrospectively examined 104 clinical cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) examinations performed in patients with suspected cardiac involvement post COVID-19. The mean time from first positive PCR to CMR was 112 +- 76 days. During their COVID-19 disease, 21% of patients required hospitalization, 17% supplemental oxygen and 7% mechanical ventilation.</description>
