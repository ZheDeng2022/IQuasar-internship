  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental extraction is the most common procedure undertaken in the department of Oral Surgery,&#xD;
      inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB), till today, is the most commonly used local anaesthesia&#xD;
      technique for extraction of lower posterior teeth. The anatomical complexity of this&#xD;
      technique carries the risk of anaesthetic failures necessitating repeated needle penetrations&#xD;
      and hence a painful experience for the patient. In addition, IANB technique, many times,&#xD;
      becomes impossible to perform in fearful adult and paediatric patients, those with restricted&#xD;
      mouth opening or intellectual disability. Certain coagulation defects are a contraindication&#xD;
      to administration of IANB due to its depth of penetration into the tissues that may lead to&#xD;
      fatal consequences in case of uncontrolled bleeding. Because of these shortcomings of IANB,&#xD;
      there is always a need for alternative anaesthesia techniques that are less painful and carry&#xD;
      lesser risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthetic injection into the Periodontal ligament space (space between tooth root surface&#xD;
      and the bone forming the socket wall) as an alternative to IANB have been tested by many&#xD;
      researchers with varying results. The expected advantages of this technique are reduced pain&#xD;
      on injection, shorter duration of anaesthesia that prevents inadvertent lips and cheek biting&#xD;
      after completion of the procedure. It is expected to be easier to perform in cases of&#xD;
      restricted mouth opening and uncooperative patients due to any reason and carry lesser risk&#xD;
      of bleeding within tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of our study is to evaluate the efficacy of Intra-ligamentary injection for&#xD;
      posterior mandibular molar extraction as an alternative to inferior alveolar nerve block&#xD;
      (IANB) so that it can be used in cases where IANB is either difficult to perform or not&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;

    <description>Completion of extraction within 45 minutes, without changing the intervention.&#xD;
It will be measured on the following parameters:&#xD;
Local anesthesia success by NPRS after first administration of Intraligamentary injection (first primary outcome measure mentioned above).&#xD;
Local anesthesia success by NPRS after second administration of intraligamentary injection (need to repeat the same technique).&#xD;
Local anesthesia failure by Intraligamentary injection administered twice (as mentioned above) and need to change the technique to conventional Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block (IANB).</description>
