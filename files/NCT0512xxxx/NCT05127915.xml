  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Adient absorbable&#xD;
      filter for the prevention of pulmonary embolism (PE: blood clot in the lungs). PE claims the&#xD;
      lives of over 100,000 Americans each year, more than breast cancer, traffic fatalities and&#xD;
      HIV combined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical anticoagulation (blood thinners) that reduce blood clot formation represent&#xD;
      the standard of care for treating patients at risk for PE. However, for people who are&#xD;
      temporarily unable to use anticoagulants, such as those who have suffered major trauma or&#xD;
      those who are scheduled for surgical procedures, inferior vena cava (IVC) filters are used to&#xD;
      help protect against PE. These blood filters prevent large blood clots that originate in the&#xD;
      deep veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis (DVT)) from reaching your lungs causing a&#xD;
      potentially life-threating PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional metal IVC filters have been proven effective at reducing the incidence of PE,&#xD;
      however, most require retrieval. If not retrieved within a timely manner (months), they can&#xD;
      perforate the IVC, impale nearby organs with their barbed struts, and cause blood clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, the Adient absorbable filter traps blood clots similar to conventional metal IVC&#xD;
      filters, but following the 8 week protection period, the filter itself breaks down into&#xD;
      carbon dioxide and water. Hence no filter retrieval is required and complications are less&#xD;
      likely due to the shortened indwell time. Once blood clots are trapped in the absorbable&#xD;
      filter, the body's thrombolytic enzymes dissolve the clots within weeks while the filter&#xD;
      itself resorbs in 6 to 8 months. The absorbable filter is braided from absorbable suture that&#xD;
      has been proven safe over 4 decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question being addressed with the randomized controlled trial portion is whether the&#xD;
      placement of the absorbable filter in addition to current best practice PE prevention&#xD;
      (sequential compression machines, compression stockings, and anticoagulants when indicated)&#xD;
      significantly reduces the incidence of clinically significant PE in high risk subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absorbable filter will be indicated for the temporary prevention of PE in patients with&#xD;
      transient high risk for venous thromboembolism (DVT and/or PE) with or without venous&#xD;
      thromboembolic disease and as an enhancement to pharmaceutical anticoagulation and mechanical&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;
