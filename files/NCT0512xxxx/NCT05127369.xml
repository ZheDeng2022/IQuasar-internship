      This is a single center phase I / II clinical trial. Randomized, blind and positive drug&#xD;
      parallel control were used to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of dental pulp&#xD;
      mesenchymal cell injection in the treatment of depression 8 weeks after administration. The&#xD;
      positive control drug was fluoxetine hydrochloride capsule with a dose of 40mg / day.The&#xD;
      study included screening period (no more than 4 weeks), treatment period (8 weeks), and&#xD;
      follow-up period (12 months).Subjects who met the inclusion criteria and did not meet the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group in&#xD;
      the ratio of 1:1.During 8 weeks of treatment, subjects in the experimental group were given&#xD;
      dental pulp mesenchymal cell injection + fluoxetine hydrochloride capsule simulant; The&#xD;
      subjects in the control group were given dental pulp mesenchymal cell injection vehicle +&#xD;
      fluoxetine hydrochloride capsule. During the treatment period, dental pulp mesenchymal cell&#xD;
      injection / vehicle was injected intravenously for 4 times at an interval of 2 weeks (once at&#xD;
      0, 2, 4 and 6 weeks respectively); At the same time, fluoxetine hydrochloride capsule /&#xD;
      simulant was taken orally every day during the treatment period.The efficacy and safety were&#xD;
      evaluated 2 weeks after intravenous administration (visit and evaluation at 2, 4, 6 and 8&#xD;
      weeks respectively). Safety telephone follow-up was conducted 4 weeks (10th week), 6 months&#xD;
      and 12 months after the last intravenous administration.&#xD;
