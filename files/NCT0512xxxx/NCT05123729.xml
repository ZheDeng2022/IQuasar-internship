      This study evaluates the impact of an intervention to increase COVID-19 prevention behaviors,&#xD;
      including COVID-19 testing. The intervention will be developed through a crowdsourcing&#xD;
      contest.&#xD;

      a. The surge of COVID-19 cases has been accompanied by glaring racial disparities in&#xD;
      COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality; disparities in outcomes have been most pronounced&#xD;
      for African Americans who, despite comprising only 13% of the US population account for about&#xD;
      30% of all COVID-19 cases in states for which race-related data are reported. Infectious&#xD;
      disease modelers, epidemiologists, and other public health experts believe that COVID-19 is&#xD;
      here to stay and suggest that annual surges may persist through 2025 and beyond. With vaccine&#xD;
      hesitancy and delay compromising our ability to attain herd immunity, the best means for&#xD;
      controlling the spread of COVID-19 according to public health experts is mass adoption of the&#xD;
      3 Ws (Wear a mask, Wait 6 feet apart, and Wash your hands) and increasing awareness of one's&#xD;
      status through testing. As such, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are currently our&#xD;
      best options for viral control and containment. NPIs that are community-driven and developed&#xD;
      in collaboration with diverse partners, including community members, public health agencies,&#xD;
      and researchers may offer an acceptable and effective approach to reducing COVID-19&#xD;
      transmission and addressing individual and socio-structural barriers that lead to worse&#xD;
      COVID-19-related outcomes among African Americans. Our study goals are to use a crowdsourcing&#xD;
      open call to identify exceptional ideas (e.g., messages, videos, communication and&#xD;
      dissemination strategies) that promote COVID-19 testing and encourage the public to practice&#xD;
      the 3 Ws, referred to as health-promotive behaviors.&#xD;
