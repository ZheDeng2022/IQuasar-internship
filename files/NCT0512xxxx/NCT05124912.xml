        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In order to be eligible to participate in this study, an individual must meet all of the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with radiographically proven (by gadolinium-enhanced [Gd-] MRI) parenchymal&#xD;
             brain metastases from histologically confirmed non-central nervous system (CNS)&#xD;
             cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with a &quot;targetable&quot;, bidimensionally-measurable, intracranial lesion of&#xD;
             minimum 1.5 cm (1.5 cm being the product of the largest perpendicular diameters as&#xD;
             defined by Gd-MRI) that is radiographically recurrent after previous treatment with&#xD;
             SRS +/- surgery. To classify a lesion as radiographically progressive, the lesion must&#xD;
             demonstrate a ≥ 25% increase in size following treatment based on the Neuro-Oncology&#xD;
             Criteria of Tumor Response for CNS Tumors, with a lesion size of ≥ 1.5cm (1.5cm being&#xD;
             the product of the largest perpendicular diameters). To be &quot;targetable&quot; for this&#xD;
             study, the lesion should be coverable through a single LITT trajectory and thus have a&#xD;
             maximum perpendicular diameter (perpendicular to the laser trajectory) of 3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient must be at least 3 months post initial SRS treatment for the target lesion&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Target lesion must be amenable to undergo surgical biopsy and LITT treatment as&#xD;
             determined by the treating neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Frozen pathology diagnosis must be attainable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient must be symptomatically stable on a max steroid dose of 2 mg twice daily for a&#xD;
             minimum of 3 days prior to procedure date.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. ≥18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. KPS ≥70&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient is able and willing to complete study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients with adequate hematologic parameters (all tests to be performed within &lt;4&#xD;
             weeks of biopsy):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ANC ≥ 1.5 X 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Blood chemistry laboratory value for serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x ULN (test to be&#xD;
             performed within &lt;4 weeks of biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female patients must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening. (Not&#xD;
             applicable to patients with bilateral oophorectomy and/or hysterectomy or to those&#xD;
             patients who are postmenopausal)&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. All patients of reproductive potential must agree to use an effective method of&#xD;
             contraception during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients must be accessible for follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who meets any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation&#xD;
        in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with greater than 3 progressing lesions at time of enrollment. To classify as&#xD;
             a radiographically progressive, lesion must demonstrate a ≥ 25% increase in size&#xD;
             following treatment based on the Neuro-Oncology Criteria of Tumor Response for CNS&#xD;
             Tumors, with a lesion size of ≥ 1cm (1cm being the product of the largest&#xD;
             perpendicular diameters). Of note, there is no exclusion for total number of&#xD;
             metastases. However, only one lesion can be selected to be the indexed lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with concomitant newly diagnosed intracranial metastases (concurrent with the&#xD;
             targetable radiographically progressive lesion), as these will require prioritized and&#xD;
             different treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Prior bevacizumab use within 4 weeks of study initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with concurrent malignancies requiring active treatment, except non-melanoma&#xD;
             skin cancer, or in-situ cancer of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with a serious active infection or other serious underlying medical&#xD;
             conditions that would impair the ability of the patient to complete the protocol&#xD;
             related QOL questionnaires and cognition assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability to tolerate or contraindication to steroid therapy (i.e., dexamethasone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Deemed ineligible or unable to tolerate SRS therapy by treating neurosurgeon and/or&#xD;
             radiation oncologist&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with any condition that would prohibit them from undergoing a surgical&#xD;
             procedure, at the discretion of the treating physician team&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patients unwilling or unable to give consent for participation&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients unable to comply with study requirements&#xD;
