    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the topical safety (tolerability/acceptability) of a&#xD;
      kit of cosmetic products (shampoo, conditioner, and combing cream), the presence of residues&#xD;
      on the scalp through visual assessment and image capture, the skin barrier, pH, and sebum&#xD;
      level. All these evaluations will be performed before and after 28 plus minus (+-) 2 days of&#xD;
      use under normal conditions, under the supervision of dermatologist and pediatrician.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Score of Topical Tolerability of the Participant's Scalp</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 28 +- 2 days in score of topical tolerability of the participant's scalp will be reported. Topical tolerability of investigational products (shampoo, conditioner and combining cream) will be assessed by clinical assessment of the initial condition of the participant's scalp assessed by the dermatologist based on attributes such as: itching, stinging, burning, irritation, dryness, desquamation, and erythema. The attributes will be evaluated using a 5-point scale (0=none, 1=very mild, 2=mild, 3=moderate, 4=intense).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Score of Scalp Residue Through use of Affected Area Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 28 +- 2 days in score of scalp residues through use of affected area criteria will be reported. Scalp residue assessment will be performed by a trained technician using the scalp dandruff counting methodology, using a pre-defined seborrheic dermatitis severity scale, in which the amount of residue will be calculated for the four quadrants of the scalp, through the rating scale for the area affected by the residue (where score of 0=less than 10 percent [%] affected area; 1=10-30% affected area; 2=30-50% affected area; 3=50-70% affected area and 4= more than 70% affected area).</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Score of Scalp Residue Through use of Severity Criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline to 28 +- 2 days in score of scalp residues will be reported. Scalp residue assessment will be performed by a trained technician using the scalp dandruff counting methodology, using a pre-defined seborrheic dermatitis severity scale, in which the amount of residue will be calculated for the four quadrants of the scalp, through the rating scale for residual severity (where score of 1=small flakes reminding of a white powder; 2=intermediate; 3=large flakes adhering to the scalp, appearing as an irregular surface; 4=intermediate; 5=apparently frozen flakes in the form of yellowish plaques attached to the scalp, some with evidence of exudation or erythema).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Scalp Skin Barrier Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Scalp skin barrier assessment will be performed by a trained technician through instrumental measurements with the Tewameter TM Nano equipment (Courage-Khazaka Electronic GmbH). The Tewameter TM probe measures the rate of water evaporation from the skin's surface. A decrease in transepidermal water loss (TEWL) values indicates an improvement in the scalp skin barrier.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Scalp Sebumetry Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The evaluation of scalp sebumetry will be performed by a trained technician through instrumental measurements with the Sebumeter SM 815 (Courage + Khazaka Electronic GmbH) equipment. The equipment principle is based on the change of a translucent membrane that becomes progressively more transparent as it absorbs substances of a lipidic nature.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +-2 days in Scalp Skin pH Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 28 +-2 days</time_frame>
    <description>Scalp pHmetry evaluation will be performed by a trained technician through instrumental measurements with the Mettler Toledo S8 Seven 2 Go Portable pH equipment. As the skin, with its excretions, is almost an aqueous solution, the pH measurement evaluates an important characteristic of any aqueous solution: acidity or alkalinity. The pH value lies on a point on the scale from 0 (strongly acidic) to 14 (strongly alkaline), with the value 7 representing neutrality.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Scalp Image Capture</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) to Day 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The scalp image will be captured by a trained technician, through the Fotofinder equipment, for registering the possible residues found on the scalp and evaluated by a trained technician.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Scalp Microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The scalp microbiome is composed of a group of microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, that play an important role on the scalp. To evaluate the type and number of bacteria and fungi present on the surface of the scalp, a sample will be collected on this area using a swab. We will analyze the type and number of microorganisms before and after the investigational products (IPs) regimen. This evaluation will be done through metagenomics, a technique that allow the determination of the different types and quantity of microorganisms present in a specific area. The microbiota reads generated from each participating individual are compared against existing public databases to classify the species present and the number of times each appears in the individual's microbiome in the collected area.</description>

    <measure>Change from Baseline to 28 +- 2 days in Scalp Hydration Evaluation</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) and Day 28 +- 2 days</time_frame>
    <description>The scalp hydration evaluation will be performed by a trained technician through instrumental measurements with the DermaLab USB Moisture Module equipment (Cortex Technology). The equipment is based on conductance principle. The higher the conductance, more amount of water, an increase in free electrons happens, therefore, the higher the hydration of the skin. An increase in conductance values indicates an improvement in hydration.</description>
