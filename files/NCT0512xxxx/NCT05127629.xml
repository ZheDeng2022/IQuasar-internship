  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Implant-supported restorations have become one of the best treatment options for patients&#xD;
      with tooth loss, with predictable long-term success rates and clinical outcomes. Immediate&#xD;
      implant placement means the implant is placed immediately after tooth extraction. It can&#xD;
      significantly reduce treatment time because extraction socket healing and implant&#xD;
      osseointegration occur simultaneously. Immediate implant placement has many benefits,&#xD;
      reducing the overall treatment time, reducing the patient's surgical procedures, and reducing&#xD;
      surgical trauma (no flap reversal). However, the treatment also has significant limitations,&#xD;
      including the inability to predict the possibility of bone and soft tissue healing, and the&#xD;
      possibility of subsequent unfavorable esthetic outcomes. However, the evidence regarding soft&#xD;
      and hard tissue and aesthetic outcomes in patients treated with immediate implants in the&#xD;
      aesthetic area remains inconclusive. As the aesthetic success of implant restorations is&#xD;
      increasingly valued over implant survival, there are significant clinical benefits to&#xD;
      addressing immediate implant bone tissue resorption and soft tissue deficiencies and&#xD;
      improving the aesthetic outcome of immediate implant restorations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the potential health and aesthetic problems associated with soft and hard tissue&#xD;
      deficiencies around dental implants, bone grafting in the jumping gap and soft tissue&#xD;
      grafting procedures are often performed. According to literature, autologous soft tissue&#xD;
      grafts have shown the best clinical and histological results in soft tissue regeneration&#xD;
      techniques. However, it requires removal of tissue from the patient's donor area, which can&#xD;
      add additional trauma. In contrast, gelatin sponges, currently commonly used as wound closure&#xD;
      materials, are only hemostatic and rapidly absorbed postoperatively, and do not provide&#xD;
      protection of hard and soft tissue augmentation. Collagen matrix has recently been introduced&#xD;
      for keratinized gingival augmentation and has shown encouraging results in preclinical and&#xD;
      clinical studies, but more information is needed to confirm its clinical efficacy. Mucograft®&#xD;
      Seal is a porcine collagen matrix with a bilayer structure, a dense and slowly absorbing&#xD;
      layer and a spongy layer that stabilizes blood clots and allows soft tissue cells to&#xD;
      penetrate. Human gingival fibroblasts cultured on Mucograft® were demonstrated to have good&#xD;
      proliferative properties and cell viability as scaffold material. In dog extraction sites,&#xD;
      preliminary results suggest that the combination of Mucograft® and Bio-Oss Collagen may be an&#xD;
      effective method for alveolar ridge preservation. Mucograft® Seal can be used in combination&#xD;
      with Bio-Oss Collagen® for alveolar ridge preservation after tooth extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research hypothesis is that the use of a collagen matrix to seal the wound in immediate&#xD;
      implant placement in aesthetic area will reduce buccal bone resorption and increase the width&#xD;
      and thickness of the soft tissue at the implant site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, we designed this comparative clinical trial in which patients accept immediate&#xD;
      implant placement in aesthetic area. The implant is placed after tooth extraction, and bone&#xD;
      graft material Bio-Oss Collagen® is placed in the jump gap, and the wound was closed by&#xD;
      different means (collagen matrix or gelatin sponge randomly). The clinical examination, CBCT&#xD;
      imaging and histological evaluations were performed to compare the differences in clinical&#xD;
      efficacy of the two wound closure methods. The primary outcome is the buccal bone thickness&#xD;
      change at the immediate implant site 4 months after surgery.&#xD;
