  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primiparous mothers after cesarean section often encounter insufficient milk production&#xD;
      during breastfeeding. This study was planned as a randomized controlled study to examine the&#xD;
      effect of acupressure and back massage on lactation in cesarean deliveries. The research will&#xD;
      be carried out between July 2021 and July 2023 with mothers who had a cesarean section at&#xD;
      Kocaeli University Research and Application Hospital and Health Sciences University Derince&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital. The research will be carried out with three groups as&#xD;
      acupressure, back massage and control group. The sample number was calculated using the&#xD;
      G*Power 3.1.9.2 program and the acupressure group: 24, the back massage group: 24, and the&#xD;
      control group: 24. In order to increase the analysis power, the number of samples was&#xD;
      increased by 25% and n=30 for each group (acupressure group: 30, back massage group: 30, and&#xD;
      control group: 30). It is planned to collect the data with the Introductory Information Form,&#xD;
      the Newborn Follow-up Form, the Mother's Follow-up Form, and the Visual Analogue Scale by&#xD;
      which the Mothers Evaluate Lactation Onset Symptoms. The mothers will be given acupressure 4&#xD;
      minutes acupressure group, back massage group 3 minutes back massage, and no application will&#xD;
      be made to the control group, once in the post-op 0th day, 2 times in the post-op 1st day and&#xD;
      once in the post-op 2nd day. 15 minutes after the applications, the baby will be weighed&#xD;
      while hungry and will be breastfed under the control of the researcher. Babies will be&#xD;
      weighed again after breastfeeding. The data of the research will be evaluated using the&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 20.0 program. In the evaluation of the data;&#xD;
      descriptive statistics will be given as percentage, arithmetic mean±standard deviation,&#xD;
      median and minimum-maximum values, independent two-sample t-test for normally distributed&#xD;
      variables and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables. Repeated measure&#xD;
      covariance analysis will be applied to reveal the difference between the milk amounts of the&#xD;
      mothers between the groups. Statistical significance level will be accepted as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the effects of acupressure and back massage on&#xD;
      lactation in cesarean deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H01: There is no difference in the amount of breast milk between the acupressure, back&#xD;
      massage group and the control group in cesarean deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H02: There is no difference between the acupressure, back massage group and the control group&#xD;
      in terms of lactation onset symptoms in cesarean deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study. The study was carried&#xD;
      out in Kocaeli University Research and Application Hospital and Health Sciences University&#xD;
      Derince Training and Research Hospital obstetrics service between July 2021 and July 2023.&#xD;
      planned to be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primiparous mothers who performed cesarean section at Kocaeli University Research and&#xD;
      Application Hospital and Health Sciences University Derince Training and Research Hospital&#xD;
      will constitute the research population. The sample size was calculated based on the research&#xD;
      conducted by Arumsari et al. 2018 to examine the effect of acupressure and relaxation&#xD;
      exercise combination on breast milk production and breastfeeding self-efficacy. The sample&#xD;
      size of the study was calculated using the G*Power 3.1.9.2 program and the mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation and sample size values of the breast milk variable included in the related article&#xD;
      were taken into account in calculating the effect size. The mean and standard deviation&#xD;
      values of the breast milk variable in the experimental group were 30.1±16.9 and n=12. In the&#xD;
      control group, the mean and standard deviation values of the breast milk variable were&#xD;
      17.6±7.4 and n=12. The effect size was calculated as 0.47 by using the mean, standard&#xD;
      deviation and sample number values of the related article. The minimum number of individuals&#xD;
      to be included in the sample of this study was calculated by taking G*Power 3.1.9.2 and&#xD;
      effect size: 0.47, α= 0.05, power: 0.95, and the sample size was at least 72 mothers (n= 24&#xD;
      for each group). ) was determined. In order to increase the analysis power, the number of&#xD;
      samples was increased by 25% and n=30 for each group (acupressure group: 30, back massage&#xD;
      group: 30, and control group: 30). The random number generation program in which group the&#xD;
      mothers included in the study would be in was determined from the website called &quot;Research&#xD;
      Team Generator&quot; and divided into three groups. Thus, each mother's group number was&#xD;
      determined and recorded. Thus, each mother's number and group number would be determined and&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools Introductory Information Form: This form was prepared by the researcher&#xD;
      in line with the literature. The form includes 38 questions including socio-demographic,&#xD;
      obstetric characteristics, information about general health, and characteristics related to&#xD;
      breast milk and breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Newborn Follow-up Form: It contains introductory information about the newborn, weight&#xD;
      follow-up, feeding frequency and number of stools, and bilirubin values. Within the scope of&#xD;
      the study, blood will not be taken from the newborn, and the existing bilirubin values will&#xD;
      be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mother Follow-up Form: This form, prepared by the researcher, contains the estimated amount&#xD;
      of milk according to the difference in weight of the baby in the morning and evening, the&#xD;
      average daily sleep duration of the mother and the amount of fluid consumed by the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Visual Analog Scale by which the Mothers Evaluate Lactation Onset Symptoms: The Visual&#xD;
      Analog Scale used in the study of Mauri et al. 2015 will be used in the assessment. Tension,&#xD;
      temperature increase and pain in the breasts, which are the signs of starting lactation, will&#xD;
      be scored between 0-10. 0 &quot;None&quot;, 1-2 &quot;Too little&quot;, 3-4 &quot;A little too much&quot;, 5-6 &quot;Too much&quot;,&#xD;
      7-8 &quot;Too much&quot; and 9-10 &quot;Too much, unbearable&quot; and what is the total score? it will be&#xD;
      understood that the higher the lactation initiation symptoms, the more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Application In order to assess whether the questions have been understood, a preliminary&#xD;
      study will be conducted with five mothers before starting the study. As a result of the&#xD;
      evaluation, it will be evaluated whether there is a need for editing in the data forms and&#xD;
      adjustments will be made. Those included in the preliminary study will not be included in the&#xD;
      sample group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection After obtaining the permissions of the ethics committee and the institution,&#xD;
      the study can be performed by going to the institutions and performing a cesarean section&#xD;
      between the first 8-12 hours on the 0th postoperative day. Mothers who are between working&#xD;
      hours will be welcomed. Mothers who meet the research criteria will be informed about the&#xD;
      purpose, content and method of the research and those who want to participate in the research&#xD;
      will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mothers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 time on post-op day 0,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-op 1st day 2 times,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acupressure and back massage will be applied 4 times in total, once on the 2nd post-op&#xD;
           day. No application will be made to the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the baby weighing process;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-op 2 times on day 0,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-op 1st day 4 times,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-op will be done 2 times on the 2nd day, 8 times in total. After 15 minutes (min) of&#xD;
           the applications, the baby will be weighed and breastfed while hungry (before&#xD;
           breastfeeding). It will be weighed again to measure the average value of the amount of&#xD;
           breast milk taken immediately after breastfeeding. The scale will have a sensitivity of&#xD;
           5 grams and will be provided by the researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupressure Application Technique A suitable environment will be prepared for mothers in&#xD;
      terms of warmth and light, where privacy can be protected. The application points will be&#xD;
      determined with the acu-point device by choosing the most comfortable position for the&#xD;
      mother, leaving the application points exposed. The most preferred points ST36 and CV17 were&#xD;
      selected from the points reported to affect lactation by examining the literature on the&#xD;
      points to be applied. Acupressure will be applied to CV17 point (single point) and ST36 point&#xD;
      (bidirectional, right and left) for 2 minutes for a total of 6 minutes. Light pressure will&#xD;
      be applied with the thumb of the practitioner's hand. Immediately after applying pressure for&#xD;
      2 minutes for each point, it will be moved to the other point in the symmetrical region and&#xD;
      the application will be made without interruption. While practicing, the researcher will&#xD;
      control the time using a digital wrist watch with a stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assistant researcher received acupressure training on 13.05.2021 and the principal&#xD;
      researcher also has acupressure training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acupressure Application Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ST 36 point: The Stomach Meridian 36 point is located on the front of the leg and above the&#xD;
      tibialis anterior muscle. It increases blood flow and plays a role in milk production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CV17: Conception Vessel 17 point is located between the nipples, in the midline of the&#xD;
      sternum, in the 4th intercostal space. This point stimulates blood circulation and stimulates&#xD;
      milk production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Back Massage Application Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mother sits in the chair and, leaning forward, puts her arms on the table at her level&#xD;
      and rests her head on her arms. The mother's breasts are naked and freely released. The&#xD;
      researcher massages the mother from top to bottom on both sides of the spine between the&#xD;
      scapula bones. At this time, his fists are clenched and the thumb is open. While pressing&#xD;
      firmly with his fists, small circular friction movements are made with his thumb. From the&#xD;
      neck to the scapula, both sides of the spine are rubbed at the same time for 3 minutes. While&#xD;
      practicing, the researcher will control the time using a digital wrist watch with a&#xD;
      stopwatch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of Data The data of the study will be evaluated using the Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 program. All data will first be evaluated with&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov for conformity to normal distribution and then analyzed according to&#xD;
      fitness for normal distribution. For descriptive statistics, percentages will be used in&#xD;
      general, arithmetic mean±standard deviation for those that are suitable for normal&#xD;
      distribution, median and minimum-maximum values for those that are unsuitable. Comparisons&#xD;
      between groups for numerical variables of sociodemographic and clinical characteristics will&#xD;
      be made with an independent two-sample t-test for normally distributed variables, and&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables. Repeated measure covariance&#xD;
      analysis will be applied to reveal the difference between the milk amounts of the mothers&#xD;
      between the groups. Statistical significance level will be accepted as p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
