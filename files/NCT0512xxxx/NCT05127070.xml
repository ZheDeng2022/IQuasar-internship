  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal mortality remains unacceptably high. Globally, the majority of mothers now deliver&#xD;
      in health facilities in low resource settings where quality of newborn care is poor. Health&#xD;
      systems strengthening through digitial quality improvement systems, such as the Neotree, are&#xD;
      a potential solution. The overarching aim of this study is to complete the co-development of&#xD;
      NeoTree-gamma with key functionalities configured, operationalised, tested and ready for&#xD;
      large scale roll out across low resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To further develop and test the NeoTree at tertiary facilities in Malawi and Zimbabwe&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate HCPs and parent/carer view of the NeoTree, including how acceptable and&#xD;
           usable HCWs find the app, and potential barriers and enablers to implementing/using it&#xD;
           in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To collect outcome data for newborns from representative sites where NeoTree is not&#xD;
           implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test the clinical validity of key NeoTree diagnostic algorithms, e.g. neonatal sepsis&#xD;
           and hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) against gold standard or best available&#xD;
           standard diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To add dashboards and data linkage to the functionality of the NeoTree&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To develop and test proof of concept for communicating daily electronic medical records&#xD;
           (EMR) using NeoTree&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To initiate a multi-country network of newborn health care workers, policy makers and&#xD;
           academics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. To estimate cost of implementing NeoTree at all sites and potential costs at scale&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Every year 2.4 million newborn deaths occur worldwide. Up to 70% of newborn deaths are&#xD;
      avoidable with implementation of standard-technology, evidence-based interventions. Health&#xD;
      systems strengthening and education and training in newborn care are key to saving newborn&#xD;
      lives. Implementation of evidence based interventions and guidelines can be supported through&#xD;
      provision of reliable data systems, clinical decision support tools and education. Using&#xD;
      open-source code and maintaining local data ownership the investigators have used iterative,&#xD;
      human- and user-centered design methods and agile processes in software and data management&#xD;
      development and design to develop the Neotree: a digital quality improvement system for&#xD;
      postnatal facility-based care in low resource settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Neotree aims to improve quality of care and newborn survival through combining&#xD;
      data-capture, clinical decision-support, education in newborn care, and feedback of data to&#xD;
      dashboards and national aggregate data systems. The investigators found the concept of&#xD;
      device-enabled decision support to improve newborn care to be acceptable during workshops&#xD;
      with healthcare professionals in Bangladesh (n~15; 2014) and developed and delivered a&#xD;
      prototype of the app. Following this, the investigators co-developed and piloted an early&#xD;
      version of the NeoTree with Malawian Healthcare Professionals (HCPs) (n=46; 2016-2017), who&#xD;
      reported it was easy to use and helped them deliver quality care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project described in this protocol will enable the investigators to complete the&#xD;
      co-development of the Neotree in Zimbabwe and Malawi and generate evidence for how to test it&#xD;
      at scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Mixed methods (i) intervention co-development and optimisation, (ii)&#xD;
      pilot implementation evaluation and (iii) economic evaluation study. The Neotree will be&#xD;
      implemented in two hospitals in Zimbabwe, and one in Malawi. Clinical and demographic newborn&#xD;
      data will be collected via the Neotree, in addition to behavioural science informed&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative implementation evaluation data, cost data, measures of quality&#xD;
      newborn care and usability data over the 2-year study period. Six-months of newborn outcome&#xD;
      data and cost data will be collected from 2 hospitals receiving usual care for comparison.&#xD;
      Case-fatality rate data will inform sample size calculations and study design for a large&#xD;
      scale roll out. Training manuals will be refined. Neotree clinical decision support&#xD;
      algorithms will be optimised according to best available evidence and clinical validation&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall vision is to use best practice and information technology to improve clinical&#xD;
      decisions for newborn care and increase rates of newborn survival in under-resourced health&#xD;
      care settings. In this study, the care for an estimated 15,000 babies across the three test&#xD;
      sites will be impacted by the Neotree. Through successful rollout across Zimbabwe and Malawi&#xD;
      - the care for nearly 300,000 babies could be improved annually.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators will recruit adult health care professionals, senior hospital managers and parents/carers of neonates. Approximate sample sizes in each country are as follows:&#xD;
Zimbabwe: ~80 Healthcare Professionals ; ~20 Carers/ parents of newborn babies and ~10 Hospital administrators/ managers.&#xD;
Malawi: ~40 Healthcare Professionals (~10 HCPs per focus group discussion); ~10 Carers/ parents of newborn babies and ~10 Hospital administrators/ managers.&#xD;
Total participants for new data collection: 180 (this number is likely to be much lower if there is limited staff turnover at neonatal units and if HCPs agree to participate in multiple research activities).</description>

    <description>The investigators will record routine clinical admission, discharge and microbiological data for all newborns admitted to the newborn care units using the NeoTree as a replacement to paper-based forms. Individual-level patient data will be collected on all neonates admitted for care at Sally Mugabe Central (Oct 2019 to April 2022) and Chinhoyi Provincial Hospitals (Oct 2020 to April 2022) Zimbabwe, and Kamuzu Central Hospital (Oct 2019 to April 2022), Malawi. Given typical admission rates, this equates to a sample size ~12,000 babies in Zimbabwe and ~ 4000 babies in Malawi.&#xD;
Data will be collected from February 2019 to the end of the study, to explore trends over time and also include measures of quality newborn care.</description>

    <description>The sample size for our diagnostic sub-study has been calculated using sepsis as the index diagnosis. Assuming sensitivity and specificity of 92% (lower 95% CI: 84%) &gt;222 babies would need to be diagnosed with sepsis over five months, during which ~&gt;2000 babies will be admitted with sepsis across sites (Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, Zimbabwe and Kamuzu Central Hospital, Malawi). If necessary, the investigators will continue to collect data throughout the duration of the study until our sample size is achieved. These data will be collected as part of the routine Neotree data collection.</description>
