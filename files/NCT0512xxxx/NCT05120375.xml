    <textblock>
      This study design for center, openness, dose escalation, and expand the research of phase I&#xD;
      clinical trials, research the main evaluation BAT6021 injection for single or combined&#xD;
      Tislelizumab in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors in the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      PK characteristics, to explore the maximum tolerated dose and preliminary antitumor efficacy,&#xD;
      provide the basis for subsequent clinical trials recommended dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: single drug dose escalation study. Accelerated titration and &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation&#xD;
      rule were used to explore the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of&#xD;
      BAT6021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the clinical benefit of a single agent may be limited, the study used accelerated&#xD;
      titration and the &quot;3+3&quot; dose-escalation rule to explore the safe dose range from the ethical&#xD;
      point of view of exposing fewer subjects to ineffective doses. A total of 8 dose groups were&#xD;
      set up, including 1mg (initial dose) group, 3mg group, 10mg group, 30mg group, 100mg group,&#xD;
      300mg group, 600mg group and 900mg group, respectively. The whole is divided into two phases.&#xD;
      The first stage: 1mg group, 3mg group, 10mg group using accelerated titration method dose&#xD;
      increase. The second stage: 30mg group, 100mg group, 300mg group, 600mg group, 900mg group&#xD;
      according to the standard &quot;3+3&quot; rule for dose increase study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If MTD is found, the sponsor may select a dose of MTD or lower as the recommended dose for&#xD;
      phase II clinical studies after discussion with the investigator based on the specific&#xD;
      situation. If MTD is not reached, the sponsor may select a dose of MAD or one of the&#xD;
      following dose groups as the recommended dose for phase II clinical studies, depending on the&#xD;
      specific situation and discussion with the investigator. As the study progresses, protocols&#xD;
      may be allowed to revise the definition of DLT as appropriate in light of new clinical&#xD;
      findings. Adverse events that meet DLT criteria occurring outside the DLT evaluation period&#xD;
      or other adverse safety information that the investigator considers meaningful do not&#xD;
      directly influence dose-escalation decisions, but should be taken into account in the final&#xD;
      determination of THE RP2D. Prior to each dose increase, the sponsor and investigator will&#xD;
      discuss and comprehensively evaluate the decision to increase or decrease the dose, using&#xD;
      available information on safety, PK (if any), and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to inclusion in the next dose team, all subjects in the previous dose group must&#xD;
      complete 21 days of DLT observation before toleration is explored according to the standard&#xD;
      &quot;3+3&quot; dose escalation rule. In dose-escalation studies, the first subject in the same dose&#xD;
      group may be included in the next subject 1 week after the first dose observation. Within&#xD;
      each dose group, a minimum of 24 hours should be allowed between the administration of the&#xD;
      prior subject and the administration of subsequent subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reduction adjustments are not allowed. The dose of BAT6021 should be upregulated as&#xD;
      appropriate, but with extreme caution, at least simultaneously: (1) Subjects have received at&#xD;
      least 4 cycles of study medication; (2) After discussion between the sponsor and the study,&#xD;
      it was concluded that the subjects receiving the higher primary dose group might bring more&#xD;
      clinical benefits than the current dose group; (3) The higher dose group has been shown to&#xD;
      fail to reach MTD by subsequent dose escalation studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part TWO: the study of dose escalation for combined administration. In BAT6021 combined with&#xD;
      Tislelizumab of dose escalation study, before start the combination therapy, sponsor should&#xD;
      communicate with CDE and ethics committee, submit BAT6021 single drug dose escalation stage&#xD;
      research data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose extension study, according to the preliminary safety and efficacy data of the&#xD;
      dose escalation study, the investigator discussed with the sponsor to select the appropriate&#xD;
      dose and tumor species for the extension study, so as to further study the safety and&#xD;
      clinical efficacy of BAT6021 single drug or combined tislelizumab, providing a basis for&#xD;
      subsequent clinical studies. In the monotherapy group, 1 to 2 dose cohorts were studied, with&#xD;
      no less than 6 patients in each dose cohorts, and PK study was conducted for all patients. In&#xD;
      the combined treatment group, 4-5 cohorts of different tumor types will be selected, with no&#xD;
      less than 20 patients in each cohort. In some cohorts for PK studies, no less than 6 subjects&#xD;
      were included in PK studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study period can be roughly divided into screening period, treatment period and&#xD;
      follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period: -28d~0d, that is, after the informed consent is signed, the screening&#xD;
      evaluation can be completed within 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment period: There will be one administration cycle every 3 weeks, and the study drug&#xD;
      will be given on the first day of each cycle. Starting from the second cycle, the time window&#xD;
      of administration can be ±3 days. However, in addition to imaging examination, subjects must&#xD;
      complete all tests including vital signs, laboratory examination, and physical status score&#xD;
      within 72 hours before each administration. Subjects were also required to complete clinical&#xD;
      tumor radiographic evaluations (consistent, CT or MRI) at a frequency of once every 6 weeks&#xD;
      (±7 days) within 24 weeks of initial dosing and once every 9 weeks (±7 days) thereafter.&#xD;
      Study drug therapy should continue until withdrawal due to disease progression, or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity, or new antitumor therapy due to no therapeutic benefit, or withdrawal&#xD;
      of informed consent and other reasons, or study termination, whichever comes first. The study&#xD;
      termination time shall be 1 year after the last subject receives study medication or all&#xD;
      subjects leave the study, whichever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DLT evaluation period was defined as the first treatment cycle, from initial dosing to 21&#xD;
      days after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up period: If the investigator decides to discontinue study drug Therapy, the EOT will&#xD;
      be considered as the End of Therapy. EOT visits will be scheduled for all subjects, including&#xD;
      those who have discontinued treatment for any reason other than loss of follow-up, death, or&#xD;
      withdrawal of informed consent, within 21+7 days of the investigator's decision to&#xD;
      discontinue the subject's study medication and prior to the subject receiving subsequent new&#xD;
      antitumor therapy. EOT visits should include vital signs, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      examination, and clinical tumor imaging evaluation (CT or MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety follow-up: After receiving the last dose of study drug, the subjects were required to&#xD;
      undergo safety visits at 21 (+7), 60 (±7), and 90 (±7) days, including immune-related adverse&#xD;
      events (irAE). Until 90 days or subjects receive new antitumor therapy. Safety visits should&#xD;
      be conducted at the study center, where vital signs, physical examination, laboratory&#xD;
      examination and other examinations should be performed to evaluate AE, concomitant medication&#xD;
      and concomitant treatment. Disappear until related to study drug adverse reaction (or fell to&#xD;
      a level 1 or less), the subjects after stop treatment if adverse reaction still exists, the&#xD;
      researchers have discretion, in combination with the practical situation of clinical decision&#xD;
      follow-up frequency until researchers believe that the outcome of adverse reactions to&#xD;
      restore normal, stable at an acceptable level, or there will be no further improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up for survival: After the safe follow-up, the subjects were followed up once every 12&#xD;
      weeks (±14 days) by telephone until death, loss of follow-up, withdrawal of informed consent&#xD;
      or termination of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longest treatment time of the drugs studied in this project is about 1 year. In the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or intolerance of toxicity 1 year after initial study use,&#xD;
      subjects may return to the study facility and be continued by the investigator until disease&#xD;
      progression occurs.&#xD;
