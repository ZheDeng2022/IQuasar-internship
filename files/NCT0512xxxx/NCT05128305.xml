    <textblock>
      Hepatic encephalopathy is the most common complication after TIPS, and hepatic encephalopathy&#xD;
      occurs in almost all portosystemic shunts. For patients with severe upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding or refractory ascites in the decompensated chronic hepatitis B, transjugular&#xD;
      intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a very effective treatment. However, due to the&#xD;
      severe complications such as hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS, the clinical application of&#xD;
      TIPS is limited. Literature studies have shown that the incidence of encephalopathy after&#xD;
      TIPS is about 35%. TIPS reduces the portal vena blood flow into the liver by establishing a&#xD;
      new channel. But at the same time, the toxic substances from the gastrointestinal tract and&#xD;
      other organs do not enter the liver to detoxify, and are more likely to enter the brain,&#xD;
      leading to hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, studies have found that the liver and the intestine originate from the same germ&#xD;
      layer and are closely related to each other in anatomy and function. There are a large number&#xD;
      of microorganisms living in the intestinal tract. Normally, the intestinal tract, as the&#xD;
      first defense of the human body, can effectively prevent bacteria and their products from&#xD;
      entering the bloodstream. In cirrhosis and portal hypertension, blood return disorder causes&#xD;
      intestinal damage. A series of microbes and product endotoxins such as gram-negative bacteria&#xD;
      will enter the blood through the injury, and the toxins in the peripheral blood will enter&#xD;
      the brain and cause hepatic encephalopathy happened.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team's early treatment plan with integrated traditional Chinese and Western&#xD;
      medicine proved that it greatly reduced the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy after TIPS.&#xD;
      And improve the clinical symptoms and signs of patients with liver cirrhosis, and improve the&#xD;
      quality of life and survival of patients.&#xD;
