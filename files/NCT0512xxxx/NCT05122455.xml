      Rationale: The interaction between nonvitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) and platelet&#xD;
      aggregation is complex. The direct activated factor X inhibitors (factor Xa inhibitors) an&#xD;
      NOAC antagonizes thrombin generation, one of most important platelet agonist, so that, factor&#xD;
      Xa inhibitors has a potential effect in decreasing thrombin-mediated platelet aggregation. On&#xD;
      the other hand, patients who experience ACS continue to have a hypercoagulable state for long&#xD;
      periods after the index event. The COMPASS trial showed that, in patients with stable&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (SCAD), Rivaroxaban (a direct anti-Xa inhibitor) in addition to&#xD;
      antiplatelet agent, compared to antiplatelet therapy alone, reduced the composite endpoint of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, stroke and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Analyze the role of edoxaban on platelet aggregation in SCAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Results: This is a prospective, non-randomized, interventional study of SCAD&#xD;
      patients taking low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Subjects initially will receive in the&#xD;
      following sequence: ASA 100 mg once daily (QD) plus edoxaban 60 mg QD, clopidogrel 75 mg QD&#xD;
      alone, clopidogrel 75 mg QD plus edoxaban 60 mg QD, and edoxaban 60 mg QD alone. Platelet&#xD;
      function will be assessed by standard of care technology, at baseline and after each&#xD;
      intervention phase, by Multiplate-ADP® (primary endpoint), Multiplate-Aspi® and&#xD;
      Multiplate-TRAP®. In addition to immature platelets fraction (% IPF) and count (IPC).&#xD;
      Coagulability will be assessed, at baseline and after each intervention phase, by&#xD;
      thromboelastogram (TEG) assessment. Specifically, after the phases in which edoxaban will be&#xD;
      administered activated factor X (FXa) level and Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1)&#xD;
      will be evaluated in addition to previous. Finally, inflammatory markers will be, at same&#xD;
      way, assessed at baseline and after intervention each phase: ultrasensitive C-reactive&#xD;
      protein (us-PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keywords: edoxaban, direct factor Xa inhibitor, stable coronary artery disease, aspirin,&#xD;
      clopidogrel, platelet aggregation.&#xD;

      1. Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable coronary artery disease (SCAD) is the leading cause of deaths attributable to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in the United States. 720,000 new coronary events are expected -&#xD;
      defined as the first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) hospitalized or death from SCAD - and&#xD;
      approximately 335,000 recurring events per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who survive the initial phase of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remain at risk of&#xD;
      cardiac complications: sudden death, (re) infarction or recurrent rest angina, complications&#xD;
      related to the development of coronary thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common cause of coronary thrombosis is plaque rupture followed by plaque erosion.&#xD;
      The plaque rupture represents a stimulus for both thrombosis and coagulation, because&#xD;
      thrombin activates platelets and converts fibrinogen into fibrin, characteristic of the&#xD;
      &quot;white&quot; arterial thrombus. Therefore, the process of arterial thrombus generation involves&#xD;
      both platelet aggregation and blood coagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of the coagulation system underlying plaque complications was addressed by&#xD;
      Ardissino et al. in the Global Use of Strategies To Open ocluded coronary artteries (GUSTO)&#xD;
      IIb, a prospective multicenter cohort study that evaluated the importance of persistently&#xD;
      elevated thrombin generation for outcome in 319 consecutive patients with ACS. In this study,&#xD;
      the authors concluded that after an episode of ACS, thrombin generation levels were&#xD;
      significantly correlated with a worse U-shaped result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orbe et al. showed that patients with a previous history of ACS being treated with platelet&#xD;
      antiaggregants generated a higher amount of thrombin, earlier and faster, when compared to&#xD;
      stable patients. Their results suggest that these patients could benefit from more potent&#xD;
      antithrombotic/anticoagulant agents to prevent thrombin activation and generation. Different&#xD;
      anticoagulant drugs have been studied for secondary prevention after ACS to reduce mortality&#xD;
      and recurrence of ischemic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Directly activated X factor inhibitors (factor Xa inhibitors) antagonize thrombin generation.&#xD;
      Two representatives of this class (rivaroxaban and apixaban) were evaluated in the context of&#xD;
      ACS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atlas ACS-2, a phase III trial, was designed to evaluate the effect of low-dose rivaroxaban&#xD;
      (2.5-5 mg twice daily), versus placebo in 15,526 patients with recent ACS. The primary&#xD;
      outcome composed of cardiovascular death, AMI or stroke was significantly reduced with both&#xD;
      doses compared to placebo (8.9% vs. 10.7%, HR 0.84 P = 0.008). Major hemorrhagic events were&#xD;
      higher with rivaroxaban in both doses when compared with placebo (2.1% vs. 0.6%, P &lt;0.001);&#xD;
      there were fewer fatal hemorrhagic events with the lowest dose of rivaroxaban compared to the&#xD;
      highest dose (0.1% vs. 0.4%, respectively, P = 0.04).&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPRAISE-2 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase III study that compared&#xD;
      apixaban (5 mg twice daily) with placebo, in addition to standard antiplatelet therapy, in&#xD;
      patients with recent ACS. It was discontinued prematurely after recruiting 7,392 patients&#xD;
      because major bleeding events were significantly greater in the apixaban group (1.3% apixaban&#xD;
      vs. 0.5% control, HR 2.59; P = 0.001) in the absence of a counterbalance reduction in&#xD;
      recurrent ischemic events: primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, AMI, or ischemic stroke)&#xD;
      7.5% event rate in the apixaban v group. 7.9% in the placebo group, HR 0.95; P = 0.51.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with SCAD, the phase III COMPASS study involved 27,395 subjects randomized to&#xD;
      receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily plus aspirin (ASA) 100 mg once daily, rivaroxaban 5 mg&#xD;
      twice daily, or ASA 100 mg once a day. The incidence of the primary composite endpoint of&#xD;
      cardiac death, stroke, or AMI was significantly lower in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group&#xD;
      compared to the aspirin-only group (4.1 versus 5.4%; HR = 0.76; P &lt;0.001). On the other hand,&#xD;
      major bleeding events were significantly higher in the rivaroxaban plus aspirin group&#xD;
      compared to the aspirin only group (HR 1.7; P &lt; 0.001), but intracranial and fatal bleeding&#xD;
      events were similar in both groups. In patients with an indication for anticoagulation after&#xD;
      an ACS episode (e.g. patients with atrial fibrillation), guidelines recommend the use of&#xD;
      triple antithrombotic therapy (double antiplatelet in addition to anticoagulant) initially,&#xD;
      followed by dual antithrombotic therapy for 1 month to one year, and after 1 year only keep&#xD;
      the anticoagulant. However, in cases of very high ischemic risk, especially if there is a low&#xD;
      hemorrhagic risk, some choose to keep the antiplatelet drug at the same time and the&#xD;
      antiplatelet drug can be maintain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the demonstration of antiplatelet activity in a factor Xa inhibitor would be&#xD;
      useful, in order to reinforce its use in isolation after the first year of the acute episode,&#xD;
      even in patients with high ischemic risk. It has been shown in vitro that edoxaban, a direct&#xD;
      factor Xa inhibitor, is a potent inhibitor of tissue factor-induced platelet aggregation, and&#xD;
      its use has increased the antiplatelet effects of clopidogrel and aspirin. Despite this in&#xD;
      vitro demonstration, there are no in vivo studies analyzing the action of this drug on&#xD;
      platelet reactivity. The present project was designed to provide information on this&#xD;
      important issue, analyzing the role of edoxaban on platelet aggregation in patients with SCAD&#xD;
      or a history of AMI for more than 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Primary objective: To compare platelet aggregability in patients with SCAD using the&#xD;
      Multiplate-TRAP® method at the start of ASA use and after 10 ± 2 days of the association of&#xD;
      edoxaban and ASA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of platelet aggregability in different scenarios:&#xD;
&#xD;

      Multiplate-ADP®, Multiplate-Aspi® and Multiplate-TRAP® before and after 10 ± 2 days of&#xD;
      edoxaban only compared to AAS only; 1.1.4 Measured by Multiplate-ADP®, Multiplate-Aspi® and&#xD;
      Multiplate-TRAP® before and after 10 ± 2 days of edoxaban only compared to clopidogrel alone;&#xD;
      1.1.5 Measured by Multiplate-ADP®, Multiplate-Aspi® and Multiplate-TRAP® before and after 10&#xD;
      ± 2 days of edoxaban plus clopidogrel compared to 10 ± 2 days of edoxaban and AAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Other secondary goals: 1.1.6 Dosage of the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Total immature platelets (IPC) and fractions (%IPF), and inflammatory markers:&#xD;
           ultrasensitive CRP after each intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Thromboelastography (TEG) after each intervention phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dosing of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and factor Xa activity after&#xD;
           each intervention phase in which edoxaban is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analyze the primary objective of the study in the following subgroups:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gender (male/female);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetes (presence or not);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Current or not smoking;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Elderly (≥ 65 years old) and non-elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
                3. Methods: 3.1. Study design: Prospective, open, intervention, non-randomized&#xD;
                study that will be conducted at Heart Institute (InCor) HCFMUSP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing the free and informed consent form , the patient will undergo a physical&#xD;
      examination and be classified by the HAS-BLED according to the risk of bleeding; then, blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for safety assessment (complete blood count, coagulation, kidney&#xD;
      and liver function tests).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients for the study will be evaluated at five more visits in addition to the&#xD;
      screening visit. In four of the remaining visits there will be different interventions (first&#xD;
      visit, second visit, third visit and fourth visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following laboratory tests will be performed at the beginning and after each intervention&#xD;
      phase: Multiplate-ADP®, Multiplate-Aspi®, Multiplate-TRAP®, IPF and IPC; Ultrasensitive PCR&#xD;
      and TEG. Specifically, after the phases in which edoxaban will be administered, FXa and PAI-1&#xD;
      level activity will be further evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the intervention phases, eligible patients will sequentially receive ASA 100 mg 1x/day&#xD;
      + edoxaban 60 mg 1x/day for a period of 10 ± 2 days. Subsequently, ASA and edoxaban will be&#xD;
      suspended and clopidogrel 75 mg once a day will be administered for 10 ± 2 days (washout&#xD;
      period of the ASA). Subsequently, it will be associated with edoxaban 60 mg once a day to&#xD;
      clopidogrel 75 mg once a day for 10 ± 2 days and, finally, only edoxaban 60 mg once a day for&#xD;
      10 ± 2 days will be administered. After the end of the interventions, the ASA 100 mg once a&#xD;
      day will be restarted. All study medications and procedures will be fully paid for by those&#xD;
      responsible for the study, without any burden to the Unified Health System or to&#xD;
      Supplementary Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for stopping current medication:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug should be discontinued in the event of major bleeding, defined by the presence&#xD;

&#xD;
      3.6. Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blood samples will be collected between 8:00 am and 12:00 pm (2 to 4 hours after the last&#xD;
      drug ingestion), after 30 minutes of rest, by antecubital venipuncture with a 21-gauge&#xD;
      needle. Within 2 hours after collection, platelet function tests (Multiplate®) will be&#xD;
      performed. The other samples will be centrifuged at 3,000 rpm, stored in aliquots and&#xD;
      subsequently frozen at -80 degrees Celsius for further analysis by enzyme immunoassay&#xD;
      (ELISA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of laboratory tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Multiple electrode aggregometry - MEA (Multiplate® from Roche): a volume of 3.0 ml of&#xD;
           blood will be collected in a hirudin tube, 300 µL of this sample is diluted with 300 µL&#xD;
           of 0.9% NaCl and incubated in a test cuvette at 37°C for 3 minutes. Then, as recommended&#xD;
           by the manufacturer, platelet aggregation will be induced by the addition of arachidonic&#xD;
           acid (ASPItest), ADP (ADPtest) or TRAP-6 (TRAPtest). The platelet aggregation response&#xD;
           will be continuously recorded for 6 minutes. The increase in impedance due to the&#xD;
           fixation of platelets to the electrodes is detected for each sensor unit separately and&#xD;
           transformed into aggregation units (AU) which are plotted. Approximately 8 AU&#xD;
           corresponds to 1 Ohm. Aggregation measured with Multiplate® is quantified as AU and area&#xD;
           under the curve (AUC) of aggregation units (AU * min). Multiplate® displays and&#xD;
           documents aggregation tracings providing a qualitative assessment of platelet function;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PCRus: will be determined by the IMMULITE automated analyzer (Immulite, DPC medLAB, Los&#xD;
           Angeles, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PAI-1 inhibits the serine protease urokinase (uPA) and tissue plasminogen activator&#xD;
           (tPA), resulting in the inhibition of fibrinolysis. The elevation of plasma PAI-1 has&#xD;
           been described as a prothrombotic factor in arterial and venous thromboembolic&#xD;
           disorders. Furthermore, high levels of PAI-1 are associated with an increased incidence&#xD;
           of acute coronary syndromes. The determination of plasma PAI-1 will be performed by&#xD;
           ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ROTEM: The viscoelastic properties of the clot, such as clot formation (clotting time&#xD;
           and clot formation time), clot strength (maximum clot firmness), alpha angle and clot&#xD;
           lysis, will be determined using the ROTEM delta device (Instrumentation Laboratory,&#xD;
           Bedford, MA, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Anti-XA: The Liquid Anti-Xa chromogenic method will be performed with specific&#xD;
           calibrators and controls for edoxaban, manufacturer Stago (Diagnostica Stago, France) in&#xD;
           automated coagulation equipment STA-R® and STA Compact® (Diagnostica Stago, France).&#xD;
           STA® Liquid Anti-Xa are intended for the quantitative determination in plasma of&#xD;
           edoxaban, measuring its direct anti-Xa activity in a competitiveness study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Edoxaban levels are given in ng/mL. The detection limit on the STA-R® and STA Compact®&#xD;
           is 20 ng/mL and the linearity range extends up to 400 ng/mL. The test will be performed&#xD;
           on platelet poor plasma (PPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           4. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
           Previous publications analyzing platelet aggregation in patients with CAD by&#xD;
           Multiplate-TRAP® (Roche) showed a mean platelet reactivity of 102 ± 26 AUC. Assuming&#xD;
           that the standard deviation of the difference is the same standard deviation as the&#xD;
           mean, and a 20% decrease in platelet aggregability after the use of edoxaban, an alpha&#xD;
           error of 0.01 two-tailed (considering the multiplicity adjustment by Bonferroni - see&#xD;
           below) and a power of 95%, a sample size of 57 patients was obtained. Based on these&#xD;
           calculations and considering possible losses to follow-up (approximately 20%), we&#xD;
           propose a sample of 70 patients to be analyzed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           5. Statistical analysis The results will be presented as number and percentage&#xD;
           (categorical variables); continuous variables will be presented as means ± SD (Gaussian&#xD;
           distribution) or medians and interquartile values (non-Gaussian distribution). Due to&#xD;
           the paired design, the interest groups will not be independent from each other. Because&#xD;
           of this, comparisons between them in relation to continuous variables will be made using&#xD;
           the Student t test for paired samples, for variables with normal distribution, or the&#xD;
           Wilcoxon signed rank test, for non-Gaussian distribution variables. Due to the&#xD;
           multiplicity of hypotheses (5 in total), the sample size calculation has already been&#xD;
           adjusted by Bonferroni, leading to an overall type 1 error of 5%. Therefore, for each&#xD;
           individual comparison (edoxaban + aspirin versus aspirin, edoxaban + clopidogrel versus&#xD;
           clopidogrel, etc.), a p&lt;0.01 will be considered statistically significant. Regarding the&#xD;
           tests, the multiplicity adjustment will take into account the Multiplate-TRAP®, while&#xD;
           Multiplate-ADP® and Multiplate-Aspi® will be considered exploratory.&#xD;
