  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In breast cancer, a sentinel node procedure is performed to investigate whether malignant&#xD;
      cells have spread to the axillary lymph nodes. This is an important part of determining the&#xD;
      stage of breast cancer and the final treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A disadvantage of the sentinel node procedure is that it is performed using radioactive&#xD;
      tracing with concomitant radiation exposure for the patients and involved health care&#xD;
      personnel. In addition, the use of radioactive tracing puts high demands on the logistics in&#xD;
      the operation theatre: the capacity of patients that can be treated in one day is limited and&#xD;
      the radio-active tracing leads to many time-consuming precautionary measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radiation free alternative would therefore have multiple advantages. Not only with respect&#xD;
      to radiation exposure for the patients and health care workers, but also by reducing the&#xD;
      waiting time for operation for the patients as it will make the planning of patients for&#xD;
      surgery more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a radiation free tracer for the sentinel node procedure has become available&#xD;
      (Magtrace). This tracer has been tested in small-case studies and is currently used as&#xD;
      standard care in several hospitals around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of Magtrace in the&#xD;
      sentinel node procedure in breast cancer in the Breast Care Centre in Zuyderland Medical&#xD;
      Centre; with the ultimate goal to make the sentinel node procedure a radiation free process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective cohort of forty patients with breast cancer and an indication for a sentinel&#xD;
      node procedure will be injected with both Technetium (radioisotope) and Magtrace (magnetic).&#xD;
      All patients in this study will receive both tracers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients of 18 years or older with breast cancer and an indication for a sentinel node&#xD;
      procedure will be included. These patients will be recruited by their breast surgeon in the&#xD;
      outpatient department of the Breast Care Centre in Zuyderland Medical Centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel node procedure using a magnetic tracer next to Technetium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concordance in detection of sentinel nodes by Magtrace and the Technetium tracer,&#xD;
      measured by the sensitivity and specificity of Magtrace in detecting sentinel nodes with&#xD;
      Technetium tracer as gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of Magtrace in the sentinel&#xD;
      node procedure. To establish that Magtrace is a non-inferior and a non-radioactive&#xD;
      alternative for Technetium with respect to reliability in detecting metastases. The ultimate&#xD;
      goal is to make the sentinel node procedure a radiation free process.&#xD;
