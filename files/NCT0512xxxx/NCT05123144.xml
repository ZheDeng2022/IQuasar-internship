  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among people living with HIV (PLWH), positive affect is uniquely associated with lower levels&#xD;
      of depression, slower disease progression, better adherence to medication, and higher&#xD;
      likelihood of achieving suppressed viral load, independent of negative affect. In two&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials with PLWH (R01 MH084723; R01 DA033854), the investigators have&#xD;
      shown significant beneficial effects of an intervention that aims to increase positive affect&#xD;
      on viral suppression and psychological well being. The investigators also have demonstrated&#xD;
      feasibility, acceptability, and early efficacy of a self-guided, online-delivered, positive&#xD;
      affect skills intervention for PLWH (R34 MH101265). Now, in collaboration with the AIDS&#xD;
      Foundation of Chicago (AFC), the investigators propose to conduct a Hybrid Type II&#xD;
      effectiveness-implementations study of a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) of&#xD;
      mental health screening and referral to ORCHID (Optimizing Resilience and Coping with HIV&#xD;
      through Internet Delivery). The proposed study was initiated by AFC, which developed the&#xD;
      mental health screening and selected the SW-CRT design as an ethical way to study&#xD;
      implementation while ensuring that all clients with elevated depression receive the&#xD;
      intervention. Mental health screening + ORCHID will be implemented through all medical case&#xD;
      managers (MCMs) at 17 Ryan White-funded clinics in Chicago. The investigators will use the&#xD;
      RE-AIM framework to structure the effectiveness and implementation outcomes and the&#xD;
      Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to understand the implementation&#xD;
      outcomes at the patient and clinic levels. The specific aims are to: (1) Operationalize an&#xD;
      implementation facilitation strategy to link mental health screening with referral to ORCHID&#xD;
      through MCMs at Ryan White-funded clinics in Chicago; (2) Determine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      screening + ORCHID for improving depression, retention in care, and viral suppression, among&#xD;
      300 PLWH receiving care at 17 Ryan White clinical sites, using a stepped wedge cluster&#xD;
      randomized design. Depression is the primary outcome and retention in care and viral&#xD;
      suppression at both the individual and clinic level are the secondary outcomes; and (3)&#xD;
      Evaluate the implementation of screening + ORCHID and iteratively refine the strategy for&#xD;
      subsequent steps. The proposed research holds significant promise for advancing current&#xD;
      knowledge on how best to integrate and respond to mental health screening in Ryan White&#xD;
      clinics. Data from the hybrid trial will result in a sustainable, scalable program that can&#xD;
      be disseminated in Ryan White clinics nationwide, thus holding significant promise for&#xD;
      advancing Chicago toward goals in the National Ending the HIV Epidemic Plan.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Current HIV prevention strategies for PLWH emphasize engagement across the HIV Continuum of&#xD;
      Care: linkage to and retention in care, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and maintenance&#xD;
      of suppressed viral load. The National HIV/AIDS Strategy goals for engagement in each phase&#xD;
      of the continuum include: 85% of those diagnosed with HIV linked to care within 1 month, 90%&#xD;
      of those living with HIV retained in care, and 80% achieving suppressed viral load.23 As with&#xD;
      many other cities, Chicago falls far below these targets: in 2018, only 41.1% of PLWH were&#xD;
      retained in care, as measured by having at least 2 visits during which CD4 or viral load&#xD;
      count were obtained 3 months apart, and 52% were virally suppressed (i.e., &lt;200 copies/mL at&#xD;
      their last viral load test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression, highly prevalent in PLWH, predicts HIV progression and is associated with lack of&#xD;
      engagement in Continuum of Care. Screening for depression is a first step to addressing the&#xD;
      significant barrier to engaging in care and improving the health and well-being of PLWH.&#xD;
      However, even if clients are routinely screened, there are few models of effective,&#xD;
      sustainable, and cost-effective mental health care that are easily integrated into clinic&#xD;
      workflow. In many places, there is a dearth of mental health providers and services able to&#xD;
      address the needs of PLWH and depression. The investigators propose to address this gap with&#xD;
      ORCHID (Optimizing Resilience and Coping with HIV through Internet Delivery), a self-guided&#xD;
      online-delivered intervention that specifically targets positive affect. The theory and&#xD;
      empirically-based program includes eight skills (noticing and capitalizing on positive&#xD;
      events, gratitude, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals,&#xD;
      and self-compassion), delivered in a self-guided online format. Across delivery modes and&#xD;
      type of participant stress, the intervention has shown good feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is based on revised Stress and Coping Theory and the Broaden-and-Build&#xD;
      Theory of positive emotion. The preliminary data for the proposed study consists of 1) two&#xD;
      randomized trials of an in-person positive affect intervention for PLWH who are newly&#xD;
      diagnosed (n=159) or are sexual minority men who use methamphetamines (n=110); 2) an online&#xD;
      adaptation of the positive affect intervention for people with elevated depression&#xD;
      demonstrates feasibility, acceptability and efficacy (n=539); and 3) a pilot RCT of the&#xD;
      online version of this intervention conducted with 21 PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the proposed study is to examine whether those who complete ORCHID, as&#xD;
      implemented through Ryan White clinics, will experience improvements to depression and&#xD;
      engagement in care. At the clinic level, we will examine whether clinics that are&#xD;
      implementing the screening and referral to ORCHID have overall lower depression and higher&#xD;
      engagement in care, compared to those clinics not yet implementing the screening and ORCHID&#xD;
      referral. If effective, the ORCHID program can be disseminated to other geographical&#xD;
      locations facing a high burden of HIV.&#xD;
