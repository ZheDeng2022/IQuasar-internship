  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The administration of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors as well as biological disease-modifying&#xD;
      anti-rheumatic drugs has dramatically improved even the clinical outcomes in rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis (RA) patients with inadequate response to methotrexate (MTX). Upadacitinib is a&#xD;
      selective JAK1 inhibitor to be approved for use in RA. Nearly half of patients added JAK&#xD;
      inhibitors including upadacitinib can achieve clinical remission in RA patients with&#xD;
      inadequate response to MTX. As the next step, it is the great issue whether disease activity&#xD;
      can be maintained in good condition even if MTX is discontinued after achieving clinical&#xD;
      remission in patients treated with the combination of JAK inhibitors and MTX. Thus, it is&#xD;
      desirable to investigate the maintenance of clinical non-relapse after discontinuation of MTX&#xD;
      in RA patients with clinical remission during treatment with upadacitinib plus MTX. In this&#xD;
      study, we will evaluate the proportion of patients who maintained nonclinical relapse after&#xD;
      discontinuation of MTX in patients with RA who achieved clinical remission after treatment&#xD;
      with upadacitinib plus MTX. We will also use musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSUS) assessments to&#xD;
      determine whether discontinuation of MTX can be maintained nonclinical relapse in RA patients&#xD;
      achieving clinical remission.&#xD;
