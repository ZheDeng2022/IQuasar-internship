  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of exposure to stigma reduction message&#xD;
      frames communicated by visual campaigns and narrative vignettes among a national sample of&#xD;
      health professionals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This randomized experiment evaluated the impact of exposure to message frames communicating&#xD;
      the importance of non-stigmatizing language regarding addiction and the effectiveness of&#xD;
      medication treatment for opioid use disorder delivered through a visual campaign alone or&#xD;
      through a visual campaign in addition to a narrative vignette from the perspective of one of&#xD;
      three messengers (a person with opioid use disorder, a clinician, or a health system leader)&#xD;
      on attitudes toward people with opioid use disorder and medications for treating opioid use&#xD;
      disorder among a national sample of health professionals.&#xD;
