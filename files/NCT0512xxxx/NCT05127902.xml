  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common type of three-dimensional deformity&#xD;
      of the spine in adolescence with a clear female predominance at a prevalence rate of 3.5% in&#xD;
      Hong Kong. AIS increases the risk of spinal degeneration, back pain, and cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      dysfunction. These impairments caused by AIS can be related to the abnormal lateral&#xD;
      deviation, axial rotation, and reduction of sagittal curves of the spine. AIS has been&#xD;
      associated with asymmetrical muscle activity and impaired postural balance performance. AIS&#xD;
      who had convex side of the major curves to the right demonstrated an increase in right side&#xD;
      thoracic and lumbar erector spinae muscle activity during pelvic anterior, posterior, and&#xD;
      left tilting on an unstable sitting board as measured by electromyography (EMG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postural balance is defined as the act of maintaining, achieving and restoring a state of&#xD;
      balance during any posture or activity. The ability of maintaining postural balance in AIS is&#xD;
      influenced by multiple factors including spinal deformities, asymmetrical muscle activities,&#xD;
      alteration in sensory input, central integration or motor response. Previous studies have&#xD;
      investigated the motor response in young adults. They were found to depend more on ankle&#xD;
      strategy than hip strategy during a balance perturbation on a movable platform. Increased&#xD;
      lateral gastrocnemius muscle activity was also observed when centre of gravity falls forward&#xD;
      during an EMG measurement in quiet stance. In a study of low back pain patients, training&#xD;
      regime involving single rapid arm movement in flexion and extension was found to promote the&#xD;
      activation of the transversus abdominis muscle and improved the feedforward postural&#xD;
      adjustment. There are limited studies to investigate the association between somatosensory&#xD;
      input and motor response particularly lower limb muscle activity and upper limb movement on&#xD;
      balance control in AIS. Recent evidence also suggested that AIS tend to overestimate the&#xD;
      severity of their spinal deformity but their perception of their body schema and spinal&#xD;
      curvature can be improved by enhancing motor skills. Therefore, training of postural balance&#xD;
      that involved enhancing motor skills and stimulating somatosensory system will have the&#xD;
      potential to improve motor response as well as improve self-perceived body schema in AIS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Ten female subjects aged 10 to 16 will be recruited if they are diagnosed with AIS by&#xD;
      standard standing long X-ray examinations, with Cobb angle larger or equal to 15°, without&#xD;
      prior treatment for their AIS and been cleared for physical activity by their doctors.&#xD;
      Subjects were excluded if they had (i) Cobb angle larger or equal to 40°, (ii) scoliosis with&#xD;
      any known aetiologies such as congenital, neuromuscular, metabolic, and skeletal dysplasia,&#xD;
      (iii) known endocrine and connective tissue abnormalities, (iv) known heart condition or&#xD;
      other diseases that could affect the safety of exercise, (v) eating disorders or&#xD;
      gastrointestinal malabsorption disorders, and (vi) currently taking medications that&#xD;
      affecting their bone or muscle metabolism. Ten healthy female subjects with matched for age,&#xD;
      height and weight will be recruited as control. All subjects will be recruited in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will participate voluntarily in this study. Informed consent will be signed by&#xD;
      subject in the presence of their parents after thorough explanation by research personnel&#xD;
      before data collection. This study will be carried out with Low/Negligible Risk Human&#xD;
      Research Ethics Approval issued by TWC Research Ethics Committee (REC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures This cross-sectional study will be carried out at Physiotherapy laboratory,&#xD;
      School of Medical and Health Sciences, Tung Wah College between October 2021 and May 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experiment environment will be maintained at 25 degrees Celsius. Subjects should not&#xD;
      perform any vigorous exercise before testing time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to complete 3 questionnaires: The Chinese University of Hong Kong:&#xD;
      Physical Activity Rating for Children and Youth (CUHK-PARCY), Tanner Scale and Trunk&#xD;
      Appearance Perception Scale (TAPS) prior to the experiment for determining their physical&#xD;
      activity level, sexual maturity and self-perception of spinal deformity respectively.&#xD;
      Bioelectric Impedance Analysis (BIA) will be done to collect body composition data.&#xD;
      Anthropometric parameters and spinal deformity data will be collected by female student&#xD;
      investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface EMG (sEMG) electrodes will be used for detection of muscle activity during balance&#xD;
      tasks. According to the Surface EMG for Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles (SENIAM)&#xD;
      guidelines, skin preparation with hair removal by single-use razor and alcohol swab will be&#xD;
      done before applying electrodes to reduce the skin impedance below 5k Ohm. sEMG electrodes&#xD;
      will be positioned on muscle bellies of erector spinae (ES) at lumbar level (largest muscle&#xD;
      mass lateral to L3 spinous process). For gluteus medius (GM), electrodes will be placed at&#xD;
      proximal 1/3 of the distance between iliac crest and the greater trochanter. For lateral&#xD;
      gastrocnemius (LG), electrodes will be placed at most prominent part of muscle belly during&#xD;
      resisted plantar flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placing the sEMG for muscle activity measurement, balance performance of subjects will&#xD;
      be tested on a proprioceptive-stabilometric assessment machine. Four tasks will be carried&#xD;
      out, including: 1) open eyes fixing at a set point (170 cm height and 200 cm away) on a wall&#xD;
      with relaxed arm aside; 2) eyes closed with relaxed arm aside; 3) eyes open with arm&#xD;
      movements and 4) eye closed with arm movements. The arm movements are unilateral shoulder&#xD;
      flexion and and extension of both arms with two frequencies (40 bpm and 120 bpm). The tempo&#xD;
      will be given using a metronome. Each task will be tested twice with at least fifteen seconds&#xD;
      rest between trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance Functions Performance for each balance test will be recorded by&#xD;
      proprioceptive-stabilometric assessment machine (ProKin 252, TecnoBody®, Italy). The outcome&#xD;
      will be analysed in terms of Ellipse area (mm2), Perimeter (mm), Forward-backward standard&#xD;
      deviation (mm), Medial-lateral standard deviation, Average center of pressure in the&#xD;
      medial-lateral direction on X-axis projection (mm), Average center of pressure in the&#xD;
      anterior-posterior direction on Y-axis projection (mm), Standard deviation of&#xD;
      forward-backward displacement (mm), Standard deviation of medial-lateral displacement (mm),&#xD;
      Average velocity for forward-backward displacement (mm/s), Average velocity for&#xD;
      medial-lateral displacement (mm/s) and Standard deviation of Trunk sway (o).&#xD;
&#xD;
      sEMG Muscle Activity The muscle activity will be measured by surface electromyography and&#xD;
      recorded by the Noraxon wireless TELEmyo Direct Transmission System (TELEmyo DTS) with&#xD;
      product code of 580 (Noraxon, USA Inc., USA). The sampling frequency will be of 1000Hz and&#xD;
      bandwidth of 10-500Hz. Bipolar silver chloride electrodes of 15mm diameter will be used for&#xD;
      EMG signals collection, the interelectrode distance will be fixed at 20mm. Electrodes will be&#xD;
      attached to surface of 3 groups of muscles bilaterally, namely the lumbar erector spinae&#xD;
      (LES), gluteus medius (GM) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG). Placement of electrodes will be&#xD;
      based on previous studies to reduce inconsistency and inter-subject variability in&#xD;
      normalizing the sEMG signal [21]. Normalization procedure will be done by asking subjects to&#xD;
      perform isometric maximum voluntary contractions (MVC). The MVC will be measured by Lafayette&#xD;
      hand-held dynamometer connected to flat stirrup. MVC will be tested as listed below. For LES,&#xD;
      resisted lumbar extension against belt on lower thoracic area (T12) in prone lying. For GM,&#xD;
      resisted hip abduction against belt in side-lying. For LG, resisted ankle plantarflexion in&#xD;
      sitting position against belt in 90º dorsiflexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sEMG signals during each experiment will be normalized to the sEMG at isometric MVC and&#xD;
      expressed as percentages of the maximum sEMG activity (%EMG_max) for comparison with&#xD;
      normalization signal processing program in Noraxon System.&#xD;
