  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Childhood experiences affect psychosocial well-being and mental health across the life course&#xD;
      for better or worse. The aim of the present study is to investigate how adverse childhood&#xD;
      experiences before the age of 18 impact psychological functioning in young adulthood, and&#xD;
      whether social information processing and emotion regulation may mediate these associations.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study plans to recruit 5000 young adults aged 18 to 21 representative of the German&#xD;
      speaking Swiss population. Participant will be invited to the study by mail. Addresses stem&#xD;
      from a Swiss sampling registry (&quot;Stichprobenregister SRPH&quot;) and are provided by the Swiss&#xD;
      Statistical Office. Access to this address lists is reserved to studies of national interest&#xD;
      that are funded by the Swiss National Science foundation. Data collection will be conducted&#xD;
      online with a REDCap survey following an accelerated cohort design. After the baseline&#xD;
      measurement (w1), three follow ups are planned after 1 year (w2), 2 years (w3) and 3 years&#xD;
      (w4), resulting in ages 18 to 24 being covered. The primary outcome will be psychosocial&#xD;
      functioning across the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary objective of the study is to analyse the longitudinal associations between&#xD;
           childhood experiences, emotion regulation, social information processing, social support&#xD;
           and psychosocial functioning in young adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypothese 1 is that adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with a&#xD;
                higher risk for lower psychosocial functioning in young adulthood and 2) that this&#xD;
                association is mediated by deficits in emotion regulation, social information&#xD;
                processing and lower social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypothese 2 is that positive childhood experiences are associated with higher&#xD;
                social support, adaptive emotion regulation and high well-being in young adulthood&#xD;
                and that good relationships with parents and high social support are a protective&#xD;
                factor in the presence of adversities.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypothese 3 is that among young adults with ACE, higher social support, seeking&#xD;
                professional help and more adaptive coping strategies are associated with a more&#xD;
                adaptive psychosocial functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Secondary objectives are&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to examine the effect of childhood experiences on emotion regulation and social&#xD;
           information processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to investigate the effects of emotion regulation and social information processing on&#xD;
           the quality of friendships and social support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to analyse the longitudinal associations of childhood experiences, emotion regulation,&#xD;
           social information processing, social support and the single variables that constitute&#xD;
           the composite score of psychosocial functioning, e.g. well-being, psychosocial distress,&#xD;
           risk behaviours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to investigate the associations between ACE, emotion regulation and social information&#xD;
           processing and seeking professional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Further exploratory hypotheses investigate whether there are patterns of ACE which show&#xD;
           differential associations with emotion regulation, social information processing,&#xD;
           support and psychosocial functioning or single variables of psychosocial functioning.&#xD;
