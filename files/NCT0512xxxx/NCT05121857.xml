  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is thought to have two main roles within the body: (1)&#xD;
      providing a physical restraint to excessive rotation and forwards translation within the knee&#xD;
      and (2) providing sensory information to the sensorimotor cortex (contributes to motor&#xD;
      planning and motor task execution). Therefore, an ACL injury is thought to be not just a&#xD;
      physical injury but also one which affects an individual's ability to plan and execute motor&#xD;
      tasks. It has been suggested in previous research that following an ACL injury and even&#xD;
      post-ACL reconstruction, indiivdual's may become reliant on the visual-motor system when&#xD;
      planning and executing movements. Therefore, this study aims to compare an ACLR population&#xD;
      against healthy controls to see if it is possible to identify those who may be visually-motor&#xD;
      reliant by accessing movement control in the absence of vision&#xD;

      This study will compare a male ACLR cohort against matched healthy controls. The study&#xD;
      population will be between 18-35 year old males who are competing multi-directional field&#xD;
      sport. The ACLR cohort will be 7 months post-surgery. The main outcome measure will be time&#xD;
      to stability during the stepdown task (from a 20cm step). The stepdown task will be completed&#xD;
      first with their eyes open and then with their eyes closed, thereby allowing for the creation&#xD;
      of an index reporting how time to stability changes following the obstruction of vision.&#xD;
      Strength and lower limb power measures will be collected as potential confounding factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing battery that participants complete are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  visual processing ability via a sensory station which contains neurocognitive and visual&#xD;
           acuity testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3D biomechanical tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. double leg countermovement jump&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. single leg countermovement jump&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. double leg drop jump&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. single leg drop jump&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. stepdown test (eyes open and eyes closed)&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. joint position sense test&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. single leg balance (eyes open and eyes closed)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  isokinetic strength testing of quadriceps and hamstrings at 60deg/sec. 3 sets of 5&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. internation knee documentation committee&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. tampa scale of kinesiophobia&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. ACL- return to sport index&#xD;

    <measure>Time to stability during stepdown task (eyes open versus eyes closed)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 7 months post-ACLR</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will stepdown from a 20cm box and land on one leg. Participants will be advised to achiveve stability as quickly as possible and then to remain in that position for 20 seconds. Participants will complete 3 trials on each leg first with their eyes open and then a further 3 trials on each leg whilst blindfolded. Participants will perform this test in the 3D lab utilising using an eight-camera motion analysis system (200Hz: Bonita-B10, Vicon, UK)</description>

    <description>Participants will be seated and blindfolded. Participants will perform this test in the 3D lab utilising using an eight-camera motion analysis system (200Hz: Bonita-B10, Vicon, UK). The assessor will active extend the participant's knee to between 0-30 degrees and hold it there. The participant will then be asked to replicate that angle 5 times for each leg</description>
