      This study assesses the potential of lung ultrasonography to diagnose heart failure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dyspnea is one of the most distressing situations for the patient . Emergency cases do not&#xD;
      always present in conditions that are ideal for immediate diagnosis, which sometimes&#xD;
      compromises outcome. Physical examination, laboratory findings and radiography are imperfect,&#xD;
      resulting in a need for sophisticated test results that delay management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung ultrasonography is becoming a standard tool in critical cases in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the investigators aim to perform ultrasonography on consecutive patients admitted to the ICU&#xD;
      with dyspnea, comparing lung ultrasonography results on initial presentation with the final&#xD;
      diagnosis by the nurses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three items were assessed: artifacts (horizontal A lines or vertical B lines indicating&#xD;
      interstitial syndrome), lung sliding, and alveolar consolidation and/or pleural effusion,&#xD;
      these items were grouped to assess ultrasound profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of B-lines testing assessed by&#xD;
      emergency nurses after 12-h training in the diagnosis of HF in patients admitted to the&#xD;
      emergency department with acute dyspnea.&#xD;
