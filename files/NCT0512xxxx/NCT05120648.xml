  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Biofeedback is a therapeutic paradigm that teaches patients how to gain awareness and control&#xD;
      over previously unrecognized sympathetic changes such as body temperature, blood pressure,&#xD;
      and heart rate. We propose to use a six session biofeedback protocol that includes heart-rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV) biofeedback, respiration/relaxation training, and body temperature control&#xD;
      to treat UCLA patients with chronic medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary, neurology) and&#xD;
      somatic symptoms (pain, psychosomatic non-epileptic seizures, panic attacks, long-COVID&#xD;
      symptoms). The aim of the study is to determine whether patients who complete a six-session&#xD;
      biofeedback protocol report a decrease in somatic symptoms, and improvements in self-rated&#xD;
      mental health (depression, anxiety, quality of life) after the program and at three-months&#xD;
      follow-up. The investigators will also study whether these improvements are also related to&#xD;
      reduced healthcare utilization.&#xD;

      Biofeedback is a therapeutic paradigm that teaches patients how to gain awareness and control&#xD;
      over previously unrecognized sympathetic changes such as body temperature, blood pressure,&#xD;
      and heart rate. Through a series of mind-body techniques, patients are taught to reduce&#xD;
      sympathetic responses, leading to self-regulation over physiological responses that affect&#xD;
      somatic sensitivity. The investigators propose to use a six session biofeedback protocol that&#xD;
      includes heart-rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, respiration/relaxation training, and body&#xD;
      temperature control to treat UCLA patients with chronic medical conditions (e.g. pulmonary,&#xD;
      neurology) and somatic symptoms (pain, psychosomatic non-epileptic seizures, panic attacks,&#xD;
      long-COVID symptoms). The aim of the study is to determine whether patients who complete a&#xD;
      six-session biofeedback protocol report a decrease in somatic symptoms, and improvements in&#xD;
      self-rated mental health (depression, anxiety, quality of life) after the program and at&#xD;
      three-months follow-up. The investigators will also study whether these improvements are also&#xD;
      related to reduced healthcare utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit up to 100 participants in the study. Participants who are&#xD;
      screened as eligible for biofeedback for their physical ailments or psychological complaints&#xD;
      will be asked complete a set of questionnaires before, after, and three months'&#xD;
      post-treatment to evaluate the utility of the biofeedback treatment protocol. These&#xD;
      questionnaires will be available online and will be completed from home. Participants who are&#xD;
      eligible to participate but cannot complete questionnaires from home will be given the option&#xD;
      of completing the questionnaires in the office before the first biofeedback session.&#xD;
      Participants that cannot be immediately enrolled in the protocol due to scheduling reasons&#xD;
      will be asked to complete the questionnaires at recruitment to serve as wait-list controls.&#xD;
      They will complete the same consent as other participants. The investigators anticipate that&#xD;
      questionnaires will take 30 minutes to complete, totaling about 90 minutes for participants&#xD;
      immediately enrolled and 120 minutes for wait-list controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each biofeedback session will take 1 hour each. Session 1 of biofeedback will present the&#xD;
      rationale and evidence for the treatment, teach breathing techniques, and introduce the&#xD;
      biofeedback sensors for respiration, heart rate and temperature using the Biotrace software.&#xD;
      The session will focus on breathing rate practice. Session 2 will introduce heart rate&#xD;
      variability (HRV), cover breathing rhythm, and focus on the completion Resonance Frequency&#xD;
      Assessment, an exercise to identify a participant's ideal breath rate for sustaining HRV.&#xD;
      Session 3 will continue HRV practice using a separate software with video games, Alive.&#xD;
      Session 4 will repeat session 3 but with more challenging practice of HRV video games.&#xD;
      Session 5 will continue HRV practice in the first software (Biotrace) then will introduce&#xD;
      participants to temperature control. Session 6 will repeat Session 5 but with more&#xD;
      challenging practice for temperature control. Total time for participation will be&#xD;
      approximately seven hours across three to six months.&#xD;
