  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to investigate the effect of hydroxychloroquine in patients with mild and&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe Graves' orbitopathy (GO).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Graves' orbitopathy (GO) is one of the common manifestations of Graves' disease (GD), which&#xD;
      results in proptosis, eyelid retraction, soft tissue swelling, diplopia or even visual acuity&#xD;
      impairment. In addition, mental health and quality of life are often affected. In current&#xD;
      guidelines, limited treatment options are suggested for patients with mild GO. For those with&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe GO, corticosteroid is indicated only for patients with active GO. However,&#xD;
      alternative treatments other than corticosteroid are under debate if patients are not&#xD;
      suitable for corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, cell study revealed that there are multiple effects of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on&#xD;
      orbital fibroblasts in patients with mild GO, including suppression of cell proliferation,&#xD;
      adipogenesis and production of hyaluronic acid, which poses a great potential in the&#xD;
      treatment of mild GO clinically. This randomized controlled trial is aimed to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of HCQ in patients with mild GO or corticosteroid-contraindicated moderate-to-severe&#xD;
      GO on the effects of ophthalmic outcomes, quality of life, orbital volumetry on orbital&#xD;
      computed tomography, serum inflammatory and fibrosis markers.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of ophthalmic outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>at 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The ophthalmic outcome is a composite outcome which includes three components: eyelid aperture, soft tissue involvement and exophthalmos.&#xD;
The outcome is defined as &quot;improvement&quot; if any of the three components improves without deterioration of any other components. The outcome of &quot;deterioration&quot; is defined if upgrading of soft tissue involvement or evidence of worsening sight or optic nerve compression. The outcome of &quot;stable&quot; is defined if the ophthalmic outcome does not fit the definition of &quot;improvement&quot; or &quot;deterioration&quot;.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The change of quality of life (GO-QoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>at 24 weeks and 48 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The outcome is grading as improvement, stable and deterioration. Improvement is defined if there are more than 6 points increase in any of the category in GO-QoL. Deterioration is defined if there are more than 6 points decrease in any of the category in GO-QoL. Stable is defined if none of above criteria is achieved.</description>

    <measure>The change of clinical activity score (CAS)</measure>

    <description>Clinical activity score (CAS) is a 7-point scale using to evaluate the activity of GO in each eye. It includes 7 items to be scored respectively in each eye with minimum 0 point and maximum 7 points. More points indicate that GO in the eye is more active. The 7 items are listed as below:&#xD;
Spontaneous orbital pain&#xD;
Gaze evoked orbital pain&#xD;
Eyelid swelling that is considered to be due to active GO&#xD;
Eyelid erythema&#xD;
Conjunctival redness that is considered to be due to active GO&#xD;
