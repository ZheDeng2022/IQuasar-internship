  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment for unresectable locally advanced head and neck&#xD;
      cancer (HNC). However, malnutrition is present in 44-88% HNC patients during&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy, which leads to loss of skeletal muscle mass (SMM) and poor clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Timely assessment of SMM and early intervention of malnutrition are particularly&#xD;
      important for HNC patients undergoing radiotherapy. However, body composition and skeletal&#xD;
      muscle loss are not accurately reflected by the current assessment tools of malnutrition,&#xD;
      which only measure body mass index and body weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam CT (CBCT), a variation of traditional CT, is widely performed to ensure the&#xD;
      appropriate position of the patients during radiotherapy. The previous study showed that&#xD;
      measuring skeletal muscle areas and its changes using CBCT during radiotherapy is feasible.&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is loss of SMM is associated with severe adverse effects in HNC&#xD;
      patients during radiotherapy compared with body weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational phase II study. Patients with locally advanced HNC&#xD;
      scheduled to receive radical radiotherapy are prospectively enrolled in this study. CBCT and&#xD;
      body weight are obtained before radiotherapy and once a week during radiotherapy. Severe&#xD;
      adverse effects including grade 3-4 mucositis, dermatitis, haematological toxicity,&#xD;
      interruption of radiotherapy, delayed chemotherapy, and unplanned admission are recorded&#xD;
      during radiotherapy.&#xD;
