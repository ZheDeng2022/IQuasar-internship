  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine access to dermatology care. The operational partner will implement a&#xD;
      direct-to-new patient teledermatology clinical care pathway while the research will study the&#xD;
      effects of that implementation, use data associated with deployment to develop and test an&#xD;
      Artificial Intelligence system, and understand key stakeholders' attitudes regarding and&#xD;
      readiness for remote dermatology care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VA is uniquely positioned to develop and study direct-to-patient teledermatology in parallel&#xD;
      with computer vision for skin disease. The following aims will assess the performance of&#xD;
      these emerging patient-facing dermatology innovations and assess their ability to improve&#xD;
      access to quality skin care VA-wide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the impact of direct-to-patient teledermatology on access and health system&#xD;
           utilization. In collaboration with the VA operational partner, Office of Connected Care,&#xD;
           the My VA Images app will be deployed to three VA facilities where the app will be&#xD;
           introduced as an option to refer eligible new patients for dermatology consultation.&#xD;
           Multiple access metrics, including time to consult completion and geographic distance&#xD;
           traveled. will be measured in exposed patients and compared with patients referred to&#xD;
           usual in-person and consultative teledermatology pathways. Facility-centric measures of&#xD;
           access such as clinic appointment wait times and in-person dermatology clinic and&#xD;
           community care utilization will also be measured. To better understand end-user&#xD;
           experiences, the investigators will survey patients and staff at each study site to&#xD;
           evaluate their satisfaction with My VA Images as well as the overall process.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess, refine and augment computer-assisted evaluation of patient-submitted images. An&#xD;
           artificial intelligence-powered computer vision model, trained and validated on&#xD;
           clinic-captured images of melanoma and nevi, will be tested and refined on&#xD;
           patient-submitted teledermatology images from the My VA images app. The investigators&#xD;
           will also extend the computer vision model by using all patient submissions to train and&#xD;
           validate the model on a wider variety of skin diagnoses. Patient-submitted&#xD;
           teledermatology images at study sites will be prospectively evaluated by the&#xD;
           investigators' own computer vision model as well as by a commercial system currently&#xD;
           available to VA clinicians and patients, and results will be compared with benchmark&#xD;
           diagnoses to measure concordance across a range of diagnostic categories.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess readiness of VA and Veterans' acceptance to implement direct-to-patient care. The&#xD;
           investigators will survey Veterans and key VA leadership and staff at three selected VA&#xD;
           facilities, supplemented by interviews of key VA stakeholders, to understand patients'&#xD;
           and organizational readiness, including facilitators and barriers, for transitioning to&#xD;
           patient-facing technologies in general, and direct-to-patient dermatologic care in&#xD;
           particular. National Veteran surveys, and VA Mobile Health user satisfaction data will&#xD;
           help place local observations in perspective. Implementation and sustainability of the&#xD;
           patient-facing teledermatology app technology will also be measured.&#xD;
