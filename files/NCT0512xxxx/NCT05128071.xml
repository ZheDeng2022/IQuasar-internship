    <textblock>
      The PRevention Of Methamphetamine Use among Postpartum Women Trial (PROMPT) is randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of postpartum individuals with methamphetamine use disorder to 12 weeks of&#xD;
      200 mg oral micronized progesterone twice daily or placebo. The aims of this study are to&#xD;
      assess the feasibility, safety and preliminary efficacy of micronized progesterone for the&#xD;
      prevention of return to methamphetamine use. A secondary aim is to assess participant's&#xD;
      salivary levels of allopregnanolone with methamphetamine cravings. This study has the&#xD;
      potential to provide effective interventions to prevent methamphetamine use among postpartum&#xD;
      women.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While substantial attention and resources have been directed at the opioid epidemic in the&#xD;
      US, another deadly drug epidemic - methamphetamine use (MU) - has been evolving. While most&#xD;
      pregnant women achieve abstinence by late pregnancy, the postpartum period is a particularly&#xD;
      vulnerable time. Postpartum return to use is high and potentially deadly. Data from the Utah&#xD;
      Maternal Mortality Review Committee indicate that from 2005-2016 (n=176), MU contributed to&#xD;
      one out of every five deaths of pregnant and postpartum women; 85% of these deaths occurred&#xD;
      in the postpartum period and, 70% of methamphetamine-related deaths also involved opioids.&#xD;
      While medications for OUD reduce return to opioid use among postpartum women, similar&#xD;
      interventions to reduce return to MU are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In developing novel interventions to address MU in this vulnerable population, it is critical&#xD;
      to consider important hormonal changes that mediate drug cravings and place postpartum women&#xD;
      at particular risk of return to MU. Among women, higher systemic levels of progesterone and&#xD;
      its active metabolite allopregnanolone appear to attenuate drug craving, urges, and return to&#xD;
      use. Postpartum women may be particularly sensitive to increased craving and urges given the&#xD;
      precipitous post-delivery drop in endogenous progesterone and allopregnanolone levels.&#xD;
      Supplementation of exogenous progesterone is a novel therapy that has shown promising results&#xD;
      in decreasing return to use among women using cocaine, tobacco, and benzodiazepines. Among&#xD;
      postpartum women who used cocaine in pregnancy, micronized progesterone (which metabolizes to&#xD;
      allopregnanolone) was associated with a reduction in cocaine use in the first 12 weeks&#xD;
      postpartum in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's long-term goal is to advance the understanding of how pregnant and&#xD;
      postpartum women's unique physiology impacts the trajectory of MUD and to apply this&#xD;
      knowledge to developing novel interventions aimed at reducing MU in this population. The&#xD;
      objectives of the PROMPT study is to determine: 1) the effect of micronized progesterone on&#xD;
      return to MU among postpartum women with MUD, and, 2) determine the association between&#xD;
      allopregnanolone levels and methamphetamine craving in this population. The central&#xD;
      hypothesis is that micronized progesterone is a feasible, safe, and effective intervention&#xD;
      that reduces the risk of return to MU among postpartum women with methamphetamine use&#xD;
      disorder&#xD;
