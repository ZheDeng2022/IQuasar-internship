    <textblock>
      Drug abusers and addicts form a challenge to the anesthetist because of the added potential&#xD;
      risks involved in the administration of anesthesia to this subset of patients, including&#xD;
      potential unforeseen drug-drug interactions. In this study, we aimed at screening all&#xD;
      patients scheduled for elective orthopedic or general surgeries at the Cairo University&#xD;
      Teaching Hospital during a set period of time for the most commonly abused drugs in Egypt.&#xD;

      All patients included in the study consented to take part in this study. Each patient was&#xD;
      asked to answer a questionnaire and submit a urine sample in order to be screened for the&#xD;
      most commonly abused drugs in Egypt (hashish, tramadol, benzodiazepine, and morphine).&#xD;
      Patients were then followed up both intra and post-operatively. Values of patient vital&#xD;
      signs, Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) scores as well as clinical recovery scores&#xD;
      (CRS) were all diligently recorded and analyzed.&#xD;

    <description>Urine was then tested for evidence of substance abuse using the multi-drug screen panel dip steak ABONtm (Abon Biopharm (Hangzhou) CO., Ltd) which is a lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay . It allowed for qualitative detection of multiple drugs in a single run. This kit was chosen for its ability to detect the most commonly abused substances in Egypt, namely: opioids, benzodiazepines, hashish, and tramadol. A single coloured line at region C for of a specific drug indicated a positive result, whilst two coloured lines at both regions C and T indicated a negative result. The absence of coloured lines was an indication of the invalidity of the particular kit, and the kit was discarded.</description>
