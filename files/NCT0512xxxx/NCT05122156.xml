      This study will find a correlation Between Berg Balance scale, Time up and Go and Dynamic&#xD;
      Gait Index Scale in community Dwelling Ambulatory Elderly. It will be comparative cross&#xD;
      sectional survey that will be evaluate which scale is best one for quick screening of&#xD;
      elderly. This study will be completed within the time duration of 6 month. Convenient&#xD;
      sampling technique will be used to collect the data. 125 sample size will be taken, in this&#xD;
      study to find the correlation between Berg Balance scales. Time up and Go and Dynamic Gait&#xD;
      index scale in community dwelling ambulatory elderly. In this study all subjects perform&#xD;
      Mini-mental state examination test to meet the inclusion criteria of the study it will be&#xD;
      above than 25 than all subjects perform Berg Balance test, Time up and Go test and Dynamic&#xD;
      Gait Index test then interpret their values to find the best one scale for screening of&#xD;
      elderly. . In this study subjects included will be living independently in the community and&#xD;
      also those who walk without any aid. Those subjects who are diagnosed with neuromuscular&#xD;
      condition, cardiorespiratory condition, cognitive impairment and having uncorrected auditory&#xD;
      and visual deficit will be excluded from this study. In this study we will check the static,&#xD;
      proactive part of the dynamic balance, their gait impairments and also the risk of fall of&#xD;
      elder population. Pearson correlation Data will be analyzed on SPSS 25.&#xD;

    <measure>Mini-Mental State Examination test</measure>
    <time_frame>Single reading</time_frame>
    <description>n 1975(Folstein and McHugh) the mini-mental state test was developed and has since widely been used in clinical and research settings. This scale will be used to assess the cognition of the subjects.it is a screening tool of 30 component.&#xD;
A qualified person takes 10 minutes to complete. A score of moderate (10-20 points) and mild(21-24 points) and less than 9 score indicate significant cognitive impairment. Normal cognition is demonstrated by a score of 25 and above</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Berg Balance Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Single reading</time_frame>
    <description>Berg Balance scale is a performance-based balance test scale of 14 items. on an ordinal scale each subject is scored (0-4).Total test score range from 0(lowest ability to balance) to 56(highest balance ability.The items analyses the ability of the subject to sustain increasingly challenging positions or movements by decreasing the base of support from sitting and standing to single-leg-position</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time Up and Go test</measure>
    <time_frame>Single reading</time_frame>
    <description>Time up and go test is a successful screening method to evaluate the chance of falling. The American and British Recommendations on clinical practice Geriatric societies suggest that the TUG test be used as a primary indicator of functional assessment. Walking pace, muscle strength and balance, sit-to-walk transition time, turning, walking and walk-to-sit transition are expressed in Time Up and Go test. Participants take greater than 12 seconds to complete TUG will be at greater risk of fall</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Dynamic Gait index (DGI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Single reading</time_frame>
    <description>The Dynamic Gait index (DGI) is a method for clinical evaluation that uses a variety of gait related activities to determine the dynamic balance and risk of falling in older adults. Subjects score less than 19/24 will be at risk of falling. This scale will also be use to check the gait impairment of the elderly.</description>
