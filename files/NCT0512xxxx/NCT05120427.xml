  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the latest estimates, 144 million children under age five experience growth&#xD;
      faltering. Early life growth faltering or stunting is predictive of a wide array of negative&#xD;
      long-term outcomes, including reduced adult height and productivity, diminished health and&#xD;
      reduced lifetime incomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study builds on a previous pilot study, which suggests that providing parents with tools&#xD;
      to measure children's growth at home may be an effective way to prevent early life growth&#xD;
      faltering. The objectives of this study are to assess 1) the impact of growth charts on early&#xD;
      childhood linear growth; and 2) whether the impact of growth charts can be increased with the&#xD;
      provision of food supplements to parents.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      More than 250 million children under the age of five are currently estimated to not reach&#xD;
      their developmental potential due to poverty, malnutrition and infectious diseases [1].&#xD;
      According to the latest estimates, 21% of children under age 5 in LMICs [2] are more than two&#xD;
      standard deviations shorter than the global reference median and thus considered stunted&#xD;
      according to WHO guidelines [3]. Early life growth faltering interferes with children's&#xD;
      ability to learn [4] and has been associated with reduced subsequent development and physical&#xD;
      growth [5, 6]. Stunting has also been linked to delayed school enrolment [7], reduced&#xD;
      educational attainment [7-10], poor health [11] , and decreased well-being [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a growing consensus among scientists, the global public health and development&#xD;
      community as well as among governments that addressing stunting is a top priority for&#xD;
      promoting children's development and wellbeing, and for increasing children's future economic&#xD;
      potential [13]. While a large literature has highlighted the importance of favourable&#xD;
      environmental and socioeconomic factors for the prevention of early growth faltering [2, 14,&#xD;
      15], effective interventions to reduce growth faltering in low income settings remain scarce.&#xD;
      Among families of affected children, stunting often goes unrecognized in communities where&#xD;
      growth faltering is common [13]. Even children with substantial delays in their physical&#xD;
      development may be perceived as of normal size in comparison to peer children in their&#xD;
      community. In many LMICs, height measurements are not routinely conducted as part of child&#xD;
      health checkups [16]. In Zambia, many parents were found to be unaware of their child's&#xD;
      growth deficits, which makes it difficult for them to act to combat chronic malnutrition and&#xD;
      stunting [17].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous pilot study [17], we found that simple growth charts installed at children's&#xD;
      homes can be an effective tool for increasing parental awareness of children's nutritional&#xD;
      need and growth trajectories. We now wish to rigorously assess these growth charts through a&#xD;
      cluster-randomized controlled trial to be conducted in three districts of Zambia. Given that&#xD;
      larger improvements in height may only be possible with additional nutritional input in this&#xD;
      setting, we also wish to assess the extent to which early life growth can be improved through&#xD;
      the provision of lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this project is to assess the impact of growth charts as well as&#xD;
      nutritional supplements on children's physical growth in a representative sample of Zambia&#xD;
      communities. This larger objective can be divided into three specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Assess the impact of growth charts installed in children's homes on&#xD;
      children's physical growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Assess the extent to which growth trajectories can be modified through the&#xD;
      provision of LNS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Assess the extent to which growth trajectories can be modified through the&#xD;
      joint provision of LNS and home-installed growth charts&#xD;

    <description>Children in this arm will receive lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) for 12-18 months. LNS are 20 g/~110 calorie nutrient supplements that provide energy, protein, essential fatty acids and a wide range of micronutrients critical for children ages 6 to 24 months of age. They are designed to complement diets without displacing breastmilk and local dietary preferences and can be mixed into the child's meal or eaten directly from the sachet. The LNS used in this study will be Nutributter plus.</description>

    <description>Children in this arm will receive a growth chart that can be installed at children's homes. Growth charts have been locally developed to allow parents an easy assessment of their children's height at their home. Charts will be placed on walls inside homes and will provide parents the opportunity to measure their child whenever they want, and will also contain information on the most suitable local foods as well as the importance of diverse diets and frequent feeding. After the home installation of growth charts, caregivers will be given a short introduction on how to use them and on how to interpret the measurements by study staff.</description>
