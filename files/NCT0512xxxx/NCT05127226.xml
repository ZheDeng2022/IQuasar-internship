  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ascending doses of&#xD;
      ION582 administered intrathecally in participants with Angelman syndrome.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1-2a, open-label dose-escalation study of ION582 enrolling up to&#xD;
      approximately 44 participants. Following a screening period of up to 4 weeks, eligible&#xD;
      participants will receive intrathecal (IT) injections of ION582. Participants will be&#xD;
      followed for up to 32 weeks after dosing.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant has a documented and certified diagnosis of Angelman syndrome (AS)&#xD;
             (ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A [UBE3A] deletion or UBE3A mutation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female between the ages of 2-50 years of age, with signed informed consent&#xD;
             from parent(s) or legal guardian(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Currently receiving stable standard of care treatments such as, stable doses of&#xD;
             anti-epileptic medication, behavioral management medications, sleep medications,&#xD;
             gabapentin, cannabidiol, and including special diets, supplements or nutritional&#xD;
             support for at least 3 months prior to first dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Follow good study practice and not participate in the sharing of personal or study&#xD;
             information on social media platforms, such as any website or social media site (e.g.,&#xD;
             Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, etc.) until notified that the study is&#xD;
             completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has documented molecular AS confirmation of paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) or&#xD;
             imprinting defect (ID).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Any clinically significant (CS) cardiovascular, endocrine, hepatic, renal, pulmonary,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, neurologic, malignant, metabolic, psychiatric, or other condition&#xD;
             that, in the judgment of the Investigator, will pose a safety risk, will make the&#xD;
             patient unsuitable for participation in, and/or unable to complete the study&#xD;
             procedures. Has poorly controlled seizures as determined by the Investigator or has&#xD;
             documented Status Epilepticus in the past 6 months that could pose a safety risk while&#xD;
             on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known bone, spine, bleeding, or other disorder that exposes the patient to risk of&#xD;
             injury or unsuccessful lumbar puncture. Previous treatment with an oligonucleotide&#xD;
             (including small interfering ribonucleic acid, antisense oligonucleotide [ASOs]).&#xD;
             COVID-19 vaccinations are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any prior use of gene therapy. Have any other conditions, which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator would make the participant unsuitable for inclusion or could interfere&#xD;
             with the participant taking part in or completing the study.&#xD;
