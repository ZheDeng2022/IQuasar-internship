&#xD;
        PAD Cohort Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient was treated for peripheral arterial disease or&#xD;
        peripheral arterial aneurysm requiring bypass treated with GORE-TEX® Vascular Graft, GORE®&#xD;
        INTERING® Vascular Graft, GORE-TEX® Stretch Vascular Graft or GORE® PROPATEN® Vascular&#xD;
        Graft at least 5 years before site initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Aortic Aneurysm Cohort Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient underwent simultaneous or staged aortic aneurysm repair (open surgical AAA or&#xD;
        TAAA) involving a GORE-TEX® Vascular Graft, GORE® INTERING® Vascular Graft, GORE-TEX®&#xD;
        Stretch Vascular Graft at least 5 years before site initiation. Research device could have&#xD;
        been used to replace or bypass either a diseased visceral branch or the aorta itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Dialysis Access Cohort Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient required the creation of a vascular&#xD;
        access graft for hemodialysis secondary to a diagnosis of End-Stage Renal Disease using a&#xD;

             venous stenosis via imaging technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The patient was taking maintenance immunosuppressant medication at the time of implant&#xD;
             such as rapamycin, mycophenolate or mycophenolic acid, prednisone (&gt; 10 mg),&#xD;
             cyclosporine, tacrolimus, or cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The patient has had a previous instance of Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia type 2&#xD;
