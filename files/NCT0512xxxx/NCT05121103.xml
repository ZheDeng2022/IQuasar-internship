  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), 2-part, open-label, multi-center, Phase 1/1b safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and efficacy study of oral SETD2 inhibitor, EZM0414, in&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Multiple Myeloma (MM) and R/R Diffuse Large B-Cell&#xD;
      Lymphoma (DLBCL).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first part of the study will be a Phase 1 dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and PK of EZM0414 in subjects with R/R MM and R/R DLBCL. Six dose&#xD;
      levels of 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, 400 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg will be tested. The second part&#xD;
      of the study is the Phase 1b dose expansion at the MTD designed to evaluate safety and&#xD;
      efficacy in subjects with R/R DLBCL and R/R MM with or without select genetic translocation.&#xD;
      Dose expansion will enroll subjects in 3 cohorts: Cohort 1 for R/R MM subjects with t(4;14),&#xD;
      cohort 2 for R/R MM subjects without t(4;14), and Cohort 3 for subjects with R/R DLBCL.&#xD;
