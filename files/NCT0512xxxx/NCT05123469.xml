      The purpose of this study is to compare the standard clinical electroencephalography (EEG)&#xD;
      device with a new portable wireless EEG device, further referred to as zEEG, made by ZETO®.&#xD;
      zEEG was designed to make EEG studies simpler, safer, more comfortable, faster, and less&#xD;
      obstructive for the patient, also easier to set up for technicians. Wireless and battery&#xD;
      powered, it uses the latest mobile technology. Contrary to the clinical EEG, this headset&#xD;
      does not use any glue between the skin and the electrodes. Minor skin irritation may still&#xD;
      occur but much less likely than from the collodion glue used in the clinical electrodes. In&#xD;
      addition, the zEEG system does not need any gel to be applied to the skin. The zEEG&#xD;
      electrodes are dry and disposable. They have never been used on any other head before. No&#xD;
      additional risk is involved with setting it up. In addition to the clinically necessary EEG&#xD;
      electrodes or intracranial electrodes for long term monitoring, we will place zEEG on the&#xD;
      head to compare the sensitivity of the new device to the traditional device. zEEG is proven&#xD;
      to meet the standard of clinical system and received an FDA clearance in 2018. If further&#xD;
      clinical tests validate its technical parameters and comfort, it may replace traditional&#xD;
      clinical EEG systems.&#xD;

      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that signals recorded by zEEG do not differ significantly from signals&#xD;
      recorded by a standard clinical EEG system (clinical EEG). In this study we will use the&#xD;
      Xltek® (Natus, Inc.) clinical-grade FDA-approved long-term video monitoring EEG system and&#xD;
      the Nicolet ® (Natus, Inc.) clinical-grade FDA approved ambulatory EEG system. zEEG will be&#xD;
      compared against both systems. Minor difference in signal is expected due to the&#xD;
      non-overlapping positions of the 6 electrodes. The 1-2 cm position difference between the&#xD;
      electrodes is expected to generate discernible difference between the two signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to validate the zEEG® by ZETO, Inc. (zEEG), a wearable wireless&#xD;
      headset and data acquisition (DAQ) system on both pediatric and adult patient populations&#xD;
      diagnosed with epilepsy. The study compares (i) the technical parameters of the two systems,&#xD;
      (ii) the sensitivity and specificity of the zEEG against standard clinical EEG DAQ systems&#xD;
      used for detecting abnormal epileptiform discharges, (iii) the correlation with intracranial&#xD;
      recordings, (iv) and the discriminability of the two systems by trained neurologists in a&#xD;
      double-blind paradigm. Since zEEG device has received a 510(k) clearance from FDA in 2018,&#xD;
      the study does not concern with the safety of the device. The device poses no significant&#xD;
      risk, as evaluated by the FDA, and qualifies as Class II category. The goal of the study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the utility of a dry, easy to use, wireless system in clinical electrography by a&#xD;
      quantitative assessment of the overall quality of the signal relative to a traditional&#xD;
      clinical EEG system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spec Aim 1: Quantify and compare the signal quality between the zEEG and clinical EEG system&#xD;
      in simultaneous recording sessions performed for diagnostic purpose in patients under&#xD;
      clinical setting, one session per patient. Specifically, we will be testing signal overlap&#xD;
      (amplitude, sampling frequency, alpha waves, sharp waves, focal slowing, spike and wave&#xD;
      patterns, and sleep spindles) and spectral correlation between the two systems. We will use a&#xD;
      multi-factorial ANOVA design, where the independent variables are arranged into 4 factors:&#xD;
      age-group (pediatric, adult), system (zEEG, cEEG), task (1-5), and recording sites (10-20&#xD;
      system). The dependent variable is the spectral signal to noise ratio (SNR) computed as the&#xD;
      spectral mean (divided by the spectral standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spec Aim 2: Determine the sensitivity and specificity of the two systems for epileptiform&#xD;
      activity in simultaneous recordings. Although Spec Aim 1 will provide us an estimate of the&#xD;
      sensitivity of zEEG relative to the clinical EEG system, it does not provide an estimate on&#xD;
      the specificity of the parameters for electrographic events that are relevant for diagnosis.&#xD;
      For example, if the zEEG with its high-impedance dry electrodes turns out to be a lot more&#xD;
      sensitive to electric potential changes than the standard clinical device, that might&#xD;
      increase its sensitivity for movement artifacts too, which would contaminate neuronal&#xD;
      signals. Sensitivity without specificity does not mean improvement. Therefore, we will test&#xD;
      whether the difference in sensitivity is associated with a difference in specificity as well.&#xD;
      A dry electrode-based system will surpass the standard wet electrode clinical systems if it&#xD;
      provides at least the same sensitivity and specificity for the representation of clinically&#xD;
      relevant EEG events. Therefore, we will compare the separation between myogenic artifacts,&#xD;
      teeth clenching, head movements, eye movements, and EEG between the two systems, zEEG and the&#xD;
      clinical EEG system. In this Specific Aim, we will only compare Xltek® (Natus, Inc.) a&#xD;
      clinical-grade FDA approved long-term monitoring EEG system with zEEG, as opposed to using&#xD;
      two different clinical EEG systems (Nicolet® and Xltek) to ensure the homogeneity of samples&#xD;
      (Appendix, Figure 2A). Most importantly, we will compare the separation between baseline and&#xD;
      epileptiform activity. Instances of epileptiform activity will be identified by trained&#xD;
      neurologists among our key co-investigators. We will compare the magnitude of amplitude- and&#xD;
      power spectra-change from baseline EEG to movement artifacts and epileptiform activity&#xD;
      between the two systems. Spectral density statistics will be computed between 1 and 180 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recordings for Spec Aim 1 and Spec Aim 2 will be performed on different subjects using&#xD;
      different clinical amplifiers as comparator systems: Nicolet® designed for ambulatory data&#xD;
      acquisition, and an Xltek® designed for long term monitoring. Each patient will participate&#xD;
      in the study only once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spec Aim 3: Testing the concordance of clinical evaluations made by 16 expert neurologists&#xD;
      based on EEG records obtained by the two systems. We will compare the clinical conclusions&#xD;
      made about relevant features of epileptiform activity captured in simultaneous zEEG and&#xD;
      clinical EEG samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this aim is to evaluate the clinical validity of the records made by using&#xD;
      zEEG relative to the records made by using standard clinical EEG systems. We are testing&#xD;
      whether the information conveyed by samples of the two different systems are concordant when&#xD;
      evaluated by trained neurologists. This aim compares how clinically informative the two&#xD;
      systems are, regardless of their technical parameters. Ultimately, the new EEG system is&#xD;
      informative only if the clinical conclusions drawn from the two types of samples are&#xD;
      concordant. Note, that this Aim does not concern which system is better. Instead, it&#xD;
      addresses whether the zEEG is good enough to replace the clinical EEG system, given its&#xD;
      advantage of ease of use, set up time, wearability and comfort. Nor does the Aim assume that&#xD;
      the two systems are indistinguishable. Expert neurologists will not compare the two systems&#xD;
      directly to each other. Instead, they will provide clinical assessments based on the samples.&#xD;
      Those samples will be pre-selected by other expert neurologists (the investigators of this&#xD;
      study). There will be no overlap between CO-Investigators and expert subject neurologists.&#xD;
      The clinical assessments provided by the subject neurologists will be blindly scored by a&#xD;
      computer program, and the PI and the author of the study will evaluate the concordance of&#xD;
      those scores. Based on the concordance, the investigators conclude whether the two EEG&#xD;
      systems convey the same clinical information or not. This procedure ensures the double-blind&#xD;
      paradigm and minimizes biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spec Aim 1: For the statistical evaluation we segment the data into equal blocks of 256&#xD;
      points (512 ms) and perform FFT (Fast Fourier Transform). We will use the sliding-window&#xD;
      multi-taper spectral decomposition to avoid edge effects between the blocks. We will perform&#xD;
      these analyses in each channel separately. Using multiple blocks, we will be able to compute&#xD;
      statistics on 351 samples from 3 m recording. The spectral difference will be estimated with&#xD;
      a confidence of 0.05 at different frequency bands and using Bonferrioni correction for the&#xD;
      multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, we will compute the correlation coefficient between the zEEG and clinical EEG&#xD;
      spectra under all 5 conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spec Aim 2: Our neurologists will identify, and clip prerecorded simultaneous zEEG and cEEG&#xD;
      samples during normal resting state, during movements, and during electrographic events based&#xD;
      on video replay and EEG. We will select 60 s intervals during each type of events, as many as&#xD;
      we can obtain during a 1 hr EEG session/subject. We apply the same filter setting and sample&#xD;
      rate (500 Hz) for both systems. Next we compute sample correlation between the zEEG and cEEG&#xD;
      within 1.25 s sliding windows. We compare power spectral density change within the same&#xD;
      system between resting state EEG, movement artifacts and electrographic events (inter-ictal&#xD;
      spikes, seizures, spikes, spike and wave, other epileptic discharges). We quantify the&#xD;
      spectral difference between these events by computing a discriminability index using ROC&#xD;
      analysis. ROC analysis tests how an 'ideal observer' would be able to discriminate between&#xD;
      those samples based on the spectral differences relative to the grand truth (based on the&#xD;
      classification by our expert neurologists) without knowing what period those samples were&#xD;
      extracted from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For statistical an analysis, a four-way ANOVA will be used, where the 4 factors are: age&#xD;
      group (pediatric, adult), system (zEEG, cEEG), tasks (1-5), and recording sites (10-20&#xD;
      system). The dependent variable is the spectral signal to noise ratio (SNR) computed as the&#xD;
      spectral mean (divided by the spectral standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spec Aim 3: The maximum achievable correct score per subject is 7 for the first test and 7&#xD;
      for the second. Next, we combine the scores from the sessions within the same system as&#xD;
      follows. If the scores from the first set are denoted as clinical EEG [a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6] and&#xD;
      zEEG [b1 b2 b3 b4 b5 b6] and in the second set as clinical EEG [a7 a8 a9 a10 a11 a12] and&#xD;
      zEEG [b7 b8 b9 b10 b11 b12], then we compute the difference scores as DclinicalEEG-zEEG (a1-&#xD;
      b1, a2-b2, … ,a12-b12). Our NULL is that the evaluations by the two experts will be&#xD;
      concordant between the two systems and the D scores will not be different from zero. The&#xD;
      alternative is that the expert evaluations of the two systems are discordant; hence the&#xD;
      distribution of D scores is significantly different from zero. We will calculate a one-sample&#xD;
      student T-test to compare the deviation of distribution from zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will ask 16 experts to provide their responses on testing the samples. We will make the&#xD;
      test to be performed on-line. The EEG samples will be de-identified. Gain, filtering and&#xD;
      sampling rate will be identical for all samples and between both systems. No more than 1 min&#xD;
      is needed per item. The total test with the 5 questions, about 10 samples (clinical EEG set&#xD;
      and zEEG set) will take about 10 minutes to take. According to our power test, a sample&#xD;
      size=16, STD=3 (in the range of 1 to 7) sample average D=2 the power of statistical test is&#xD;
      84.7%, sufficient for statistical conclusion to be drawn. Hence, the sample size = 16&#xD;
      suffices the desired statistical power of &gt;80% (http://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/). By&#xD;
      convention, 80% is an acceptable level of power (Ellis, 2010).&#xD;
