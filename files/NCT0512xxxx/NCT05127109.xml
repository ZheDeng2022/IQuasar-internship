      This is a research study to determine if a particular method of providing nutrition improves&#xD;
      the clinical outcomes of patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) who have undergone&#xD;
      abdominal surgery and would require nutrition delivered via the bloodstream (called total&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition or TPN). The nutrition method we are testing is a structured nutrition&#xD;
      delivery plan that involves tube feeding, oral nutrition supplements, and the use of a device&#xD;
      (called an indirect calorimeter or IC) to measure calorie needs. This study will also use two&#xD;
      devices to measure fat and muscle mass to examine changes during hospitalization. Subjects&#xD;
      will be followed throughout hospitalization where nutrition status and fat and muscle mass&#xD;
      will be closely monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study activities will begin within 72 hours of a patient's abdominal surgery. TPN (total&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition, a method of feeding that bypasses the usual process of eating and&#xD;
      digestion) will be started, a non-invasive method of assessing calorie needs (indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry (IC)) will be started, a urine sample will be collected to help assist in protein&#xD;
      needs, and fat/muscle mass will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), and&#xD;
      an ultrasound. This is a minimal risk study and all products/devices used are non-invasive&#xD;
      and FDA-approved. Indirect calorimetry and urine sample collection will be conducted every 3&#xD;
      days during the stay in the Intensive Care Unit - ICU, then every 5 days until hospital&#xD;
      discharge. BIA and muscle ultrasound will be conducted every 7 days during ICU stay, then&#xD;
      every 14 days until hospital discharge.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective trial is to study the impact of the utilization of structured&#xD;
      nutrition delivery pathway on 300 adult abdominal trauma and surgery patients admitted to a&#xD;
      Duke University Medical Center (DUMC) intensive care unit (ICU) through a structured&#xD;
      nutrition delivery pathway from surgical intervention to hospital discharge. Objectives&#xD;
      include evaluating the impact of a structured nutrition delivery pathway on 1) nosocomial&#xD;
      infectious complications as defined by CDC guidelines after 7 days of ICU admission and 2)&#xD;
      protein-calorie malnutrition, ventilator use, hospital disposition, hospital and ICU length&#xD;
      of stay, ED/hospital utilization, total parenteral nutrition (TPN)-related complications,&#xD;
      1-year mortality, and hospital charges. Patient outcomes will be compared to a retrospective&#xD;
      cohort of 300 historical matched control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention, a structured nutrition delivery pathway called the Nutrition&#xD;
      Ecosystem pathway consists of the following collaborative parts to optimize nutrition intake&#xD;
      and delivery within this patient population: 1) parenteral nutrition initiated within 72&#xD;
      hours of operative intervention 2) metabolic cart assessments to determine resting energy&#xD;
      expenditure (REE) and guide registered dietitians (RDs) 3) expedited delivery of oral&#xD;
      nutrition supplements and 4) a team-based approach on proper documentation of nutrition&#xD;
      delivery and intake. The population group will consist of 300 surgical patients admitted to a&#xD;
      DUMC ICU following emergent/urgent major abdominal surgery secondary to abdominal trauma,&#xD;
      intra-abdominal sepsis, ischemic bowel/vascular emergencies, or penetrating trauma and are&#xD;
      not expected to receive enteral or oral nutrition for at least 72 hours. 300 historical&#xD;
      matched control subjects not having received TPN in the first 7 hospital days will be&#xD;
      enrolled from Duke Electronic Health Record between January 2018 and June 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study poses minimal risks to patients as the study activities match the current standard&#xD;
      of care medical treatment such as nutrition delivery via TPN. Patients will benefit from&#xD;
      metabolic and physiologic assessments, closer monitoring, and interdisciplinary support for&#xD;
      nutrition optimization from nurses, dietitians, and providers throughout their&#xD;
      hospitalization. Given patients' energy expenditure will be routinely measured by indirect&#xD;
      calorimetry via a metabolic cart, a greater accuracy in caloric requirements will help&#xD;
      achieve precision and goal nutrition for all participants.&#xD;
