  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase 2, multicenter, open-label study is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      lurbinectedin monotherapy in 3 cohorts of participants with high-unmet medical need: advanced&#xD;
      (metastatic and/or unresectable) urothelial cancer (UC), large cell neuroendocrine tumor&#xD;
      (LCNET) of lung, and a tumor agnostic cohort of participants with homologous recombination&#xD;
      deficient (HRD) positive malignancies.&#xD;

    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR) According to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The ORR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response (BOR) is investigator-assessed confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria. BOR is defined as the best response recorded between the date of first dose and the date of objectively documented progression per RECIST v1.1, or the date of subsequent anticancer therapy, death due to any cause, loss to follow-up, or study discontinuation, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Progression Free Survival (PFS) as assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of first documented disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Time-To-Response (TTR) as assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>TTR is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of the first confirmed response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]), as assessed by the investigators.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-Assessed Duration of response (DOR) as assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>DOR is defined as the time from the first confirmed response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) to the date of the first documented tumor progression as determined using RECIST v1.1 criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Investigator-assessed Disease Control Rate (DCR) as assessed per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to disease progression or death, up to 36 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>DCR is defined as the proportion of participants whose best overall response (BOR) is confirmed complete response (CR), or partial response (PR), or stable disease (SD) using the RECIST v1.1 criteria.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS) in Participants Treated with Lurbinectedin</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and every 3 months, up to 16 months.</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of death from any cause. A participant who has not died will be censored at the last known alive date.</description>
