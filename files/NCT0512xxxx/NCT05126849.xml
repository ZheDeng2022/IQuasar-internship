  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outcomes for patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who are refractory to first-line&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapy (IST) and who lack a matched unrelated donor (MUD) remain poor.&#xD;
      Recently, the use of eltrombopag (ELT) has shown blood count improvements in 40% of these&#xD;
      patients. However, most refractory patients do not respond to ELT or other second-line&#xD;
      treatment and are therefore exposed to life-threatening infections, and bleeding. During the&#xD;
      past 2 decades, there has been a significant decrease in infection-related mortality in&#xD;
      patients with SAA unresponsive to initial IST but clonal evolution including paroxysmal&#xD;
      nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and acute myeloid leukemia&#xD;
      (AML) still occur in the long-term with a grim prognosis. Overall, the overall survival of&#xD;
      such patients with acquired refractory SAA to ELT is about 60-70% at 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using alternative donor sources (i.e.,&#xD;
      mismatched unrelated donors, cord blood (CBT), and haplo-identical family donors) may be&#xD;
      curative in patients with refractory SAA, despite carrying much higher rates of complications&#xD;
      than in transplantations from matched related or unrelated donors. Recently, our group showed&#xD;
      that CBT is a valuable curative option for young adults with refractory SAA. However, not all&#xD;
      patients have available CB and CBT treatment related mortality is high in adult patients.&#xD;
      Haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have improved&#xD;
      dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of post-transplantation&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (PTCy). Preliminary results in a little number of patients with refractory&#xD;
      SAA at Kings college (London, UK) and John Hopkins (Baltimore, USA) seem promising. The&#xD;
      investigators retrospectively analyzed data from 36 patients (median age 42 years)&#xD;
      transplanted between 2010 and 2017 in Europe on behalf of the SAA working party of the&#xD;
      European Blood and Marrow Transplantation group. The 1-year overall survival was about 80%&#xD;
      suggesting that this approach might be a valid option in this particular poor clinical&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate a benefit in term of the 2-year overall&#xD;
      survival rate from 60% (historical rates in patients with acquired refractory idiopathic&#xD;
      aplastic anemia) up to 80% using haplo-SCT with PTCy.&#xD;
