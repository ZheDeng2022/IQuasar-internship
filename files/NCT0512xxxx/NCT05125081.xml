  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to examine the effects and safety of Liuwei Dihuang pill and&#xD;
      placebo in presbycusis with Shen (kidney)-yin deficiency.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no approved pharmacologic therapies for age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also known&#xD;
      as presbycusis. Based on the syndrome differentiation in Chinese medicine (CM) theory, the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of presbycusis is related to the Shen (kidney)-yin deficiency. Liuwei Dihuang&#xD;
      Pill (LDP) is effective and commonly prescribed for the treatment of Shen-yin deficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to try to demonstrate an improvement in phonetically&#xD;
      balanced maximum (PBmax) after 1 years of treatment with the LDP versus the placebo. Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a safety follow-up after the treatment period. Safety and efficacy will be&#xD;
      determined by looking at a number of assessments (physical examinations, blood sampling,&#xD;
      hearing assessments, questionnaires, etc.).The amount of drug in the blood will also be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that around 120 people (at least 60 in each arm) with presbycusis with Shen&#xD;
      (kidney)-yin deficiency may take part in the study. The study participants will be recruited&#xD;
      at around 6 sites in the Shanghai, China.&#xD;
