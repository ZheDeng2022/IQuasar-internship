      Aim: To investigate if a subcutaneous (s.c.) booster dose of 90 µg of the naked Akston&#xD;
      AKS-452 vaccine (AKS-452X) at &gt;= 3 months post initial vaccination, with any of the four&#xD;
      registered vaccines, will boost the antibody titer and immune response in human healthy&#xD;
      volunteers 4-6 weeks after s.c. injection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: A booster dose of naked (i.e. non-adjuvanted) AKS-452 vaccine will provide an&#xD;
      enhanced immune response after vaccination with any of the registered vaccines against&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To determine the immunogenicity 4-6 weeks after subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      a booster dose of AKS-452X vaccine given at &gt;=3 months post-initial vaccination (i.e. Pfizer&#xD;
      [ Comirnaty], Moderna [Spikevax], Janssen [Ad26.COV2.S], AstraZeneca [Vaxzevria]) in human&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Vaccine safety and side effects after booster vaccination. Follow-up&#xD;
      will occur for up to 9 months post-study vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Single center, open-label, safety and efficacy study on the biological activity&#xD;
      of a SP/RBD-Fc antigen booster vaccine (AKS-452X) against COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy human volunteers, 18 - 85 years, having received a registered&#xD;
      vaccine (i.e. Pfizer [Comirnaty], Moderna [Spikevax], Janssen [Ad26.COV2.S], AstraZeneca&#xD;
      [Vaxzevria]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: One booster dose-level of naked AKS-452 (90 µg) administered via s.c. route in&#xD;
      150 subjects per cohort in which safety parameters and neutralizing IgG titers will be&#xD;
      reviewed after the booster dose of 90 µg s.c.. Enhanced immune response is defined as: i)&#xD;
      seroconversion based on a true positive based on the SP/RBD IgG ELISA assay positive/negative&#xD;
      cutoff criteria using the quantitative cut-off value defined by the assay kit batch expressed&#xD;
      in μg/mL. The positive/negative cutoff value was established as 2.42 µg/mL from the&#xD;
      validation analysis for the current lot of assay kits, but it should be noted that for each&#xD;
      new lot of assay kits, Akston QC performs a re-validation of the cutoff value in order to&#xD;
      maintain clinical agreement from lot-to-lot, ii) two times (2x) the baseline SP/RBD IgG at&#xD;
      day 56 after a boostering, as compared to the titer at the time of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: The percentage of patients that i) achieve&#xD;
      an SP/RBD-specific IgG antibody titer level of ≥ 2.42 µg/mL at the day 28 time-point&#xD;
      post-intervention (i.e. booster vaccine) if the base-line value prior to receiving the&#xD;
      booster vaccine was &lt; 2.42 µg/mL or ii) where the SP/RBD-specific IgG antibody titer is at&#xD;
      least 2x the base-line value prior to receiving the booster vaccine if the base-line value&#xD;
      prior to receiving the booster vaccine was ≥ 2.42 µg/mL. The percentage of patients in each&#xD;
      of the four cohorts that achieve the primary endpoint threshold at 28 days post-intervention&#xD;
      will be calculated (n (%)). Secondary endpoint: Safety evaluation in the four cohorts for&#xD;
      local and systemic adverse events after injection at each pre-defined scheduled follow-up (at&#xD;
      28, 56, 91, 182 and 238 days post intervention). Patients will continue to be followed&#xD;
      passively for additional safety events out to 9 months post-intervention.&#xD;
