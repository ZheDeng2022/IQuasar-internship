  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy; It is a disease characterized by sudden, repetitive, epileptic seizures that are&#xD;
      not triggered by an identifiable event and occur as a result of abnormal and excessive&#xD;
      electrical discharge in cortical neurons from ancient times to the present. It is known that&#xD;
      epilepsy has important social and psychological effects. Seizure recurrence and fear of&#xD;
      social exclusion are life-threatening factors for epilepsy patients. These difficulties&#xD;
      negatively affect the quality of life of patients by causing high levels of anxiety,&#xD;
      depression, sleep disorders and low self-esteem. Many positive effects of progressive&#xD;
      relaxation exercises on anxiety, depression, sleep and quality of life have been observed.&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of progressive relaxation exercises applied&#xD;
      to epilepsy patients on depression, sleep and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, which was planned as an experimental study with a pretest-posttest control group,&#xD;
      will be carried out by randomly dividing 60 patients diagnosed with epilepsy, who applied to&#xD;
      the Neurology Outpatient Clinic and Clinic of Fırat University Hospital, between September&#xD;
      2021 and June 2022, into 2 groups as intervention and control groups. Written consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from the patients who agreed to participate in the study at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study, and the study will begin. Before any intervention is made in the intervention group&#xD;
      and control group, a pre-test will be performed using the Patient Information Form, Beck&#xD;
      Depression Scale, Pitssburg Sleep Quality Index, and Quality of Life Scale (QOLIE 31) to&#xD;
      evaluate depression, sleep and quality of life of these patients. The intervention group will&#xD;
      be given progressive relaxation exercises 3 times a week for 4 weeks and the control group&#xD;
      will not make any interventions. With the posttest, both the intervention and control groups&#xD;
      will be filled with the Patient Information FormBeck Depression Scale, Pitssburg Sleep&#xD;
      Quality and Quality of Life Scale (QOLIE 31) and depression, sleep and quality of life will&#xD;
      be evaluated. Finally, it will be checked whether there is a significant difference between&#xD;
      the pretest and the posttest.&#xD;

      epilepsy ; It is a condition characterized by sudden, repetitive, epileptic seizures that are&#xD;
      not triggered by an identifiable event, resulting from abnormal and excessive electrical&#xD;
      discharge in cortical neurons from ancient times to the present. In other words, epilepsy is&#xD;
      one of the most common and chronic serious neurological diseases that require significant&#xD;
      behavioral and psychosocial adjustments, for which a high quality of life is aimed by keeping&#xD;
      seizures under control. In the study conducted by Rousseau et al. on 8 epileptic subjects, it&#xD;
      was observed that the progressive relaxation exercises they applied decreased the frequency&#xD;
      of seizures and increased the sense of well-being. It was found that it caused significant&#xD;
      decreases in the level of depression. There is no study in the literature examining the&#xD;
      Effect of Progressive Relaxation Exercises Applied to Epilepsy Patients on Depression, Sleep&#xD;
      and Quality of Life. For this reason, it was aimed to examine the effects of progressive&#xD;
      relaxation exercises applied to epilepsy patients on depression, sleep and quality of life by&#xD;
      conducting an experimental study with a pretest-posttest control group.&#xD;

    <description>Pitssburg Sleep Quality Index, Buysse et al. It is a scale that gives a quantitative measure of sleep quality for the purpose of defining good and bad sleep. It includes a total of 24 questions. 19 of these questions are self-evaluation questions, five of which are answered by the spouse or a roommate. When calculating the index score, questions answered by the individual's spouse or roommate are not included in the calculation.</description>

    <description>It is a self-assessment type scale developed by Beck et al. (1961) to measure the level of depression symptoms and change in severity in the adult age group. The Turkish validity and reliability study was performed by Hisli (1988). It consists of 21 items that measure the symptoms in the vegetative, emotional, cognitive and motivational areas of depression.</description>

It is a scale consisting of 31 items of 89 items in the QOLIE-89 Scale made by The QOLIE-31 Scale does not include SF-36 items in the QOLIE-89 Scale and items that question some symptoms such as non-epilepsy-specific pain. In the QOLIE-31 Scale, only epilepsy-related issues are questioned. The QOLIE -31 scale consists of 7 sub-dimensions that include the following health concepts.</description>
