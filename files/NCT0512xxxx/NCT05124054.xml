  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative recovery is a complex process influenced by various factors such as patients,&#xD;
      surgical methods and anesthetic properties. Such factors can be accompanied by many negative&#xD;
      situations. Previous studies evaluating recovery following anesthesia primarily evaluated the&#xD;
      incidence of morbidity, mortality, adverse anesthesia-related outcomes, and changes in vital&#xD;
      signs (1-4). These parameters are important, but the quality of recovery of patients has been&#xD;
      neglected in most studies. Therefore, various patient-reported outcome measurement scales and&#xD;
      tools have been developed (1,3-8). One of these scales is Stark et al. It is the QoR-15&#xD;
      questionnaire developed by in 2013 (4). QoR-15 aims to assess the quality of early recovery&#xD;
      and emotional health of patients after surgery (4,6). It is a 15-item questionnaire assessing&#xD;
      the patient's emotional state, physical comfort, psychological support, physical independence&#xD;
      and pain. This one-page QoR-15 questionnaire has been shown to be highly valid and reliable&#xD;
      in patients who have undergone general surgery (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      QoR-15 has been verified and translated into many languages such as Japanese, French,&#xD;
      Portuguese, Chinese, Swedish (13-17). It was reported in a systemic review that all&#xD;
      translated versions of the QoR-15 had sufficient validity and reliability to assess the&#xD;
      quality of postoperative recovery (19). However, an official Turkish version of the QoR-15&#xD;
      has not yet been developed or approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to develop the Turkish version of the QoR-15 (QoR-15T) and to&#xD;
      evaluate its validity, reliability and responsiveness for Turkish-speaking patients receiving&#xD;
      general anaesthesia.&#xD;

    <description>The QoR-15, a measurement tool to evaluate postoperative recovery in patients, consists of 15 items including pain, nausea, vomiting, and self-care status [9]. For each item, the patient is asked to express their status scoring from 0 to 10; therefore, the total score ranges from 0 to 150 points, with higher scores indicating better postoperative recovery. QoR-15 has been verified and translated into many languages such as Japanese, French, Portuguese, Chinese, Swedish.&#xD;
All translated versions of the QoR-15 were reported in a systemic review to have sufficient validity and reliability to assess the quality of postoperative recovery.The aim of this study is to develop the Turkish version of the QoR-15 (QoR-15T) and evaluate its validity, reliability and responsiveness for Turkish speaking patients receiving general anesthesia.</description>
