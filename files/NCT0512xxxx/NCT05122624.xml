  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although curative treatment exists, tuberculosis (TB) remains the leading cause of infectious&#xD;
      mortality worldwide - often because people seek care for TB symptoms in highly&#xD;
      resource-constrained clinics that cannot provide same-day diagnostic testing. The research&#xD;
      team has developed an easy-to-use clinical risk score that, if implemented in these settings,&#xD;
      might help clinicians identify patients at high risk for TB and thereby start treatment for&#xD;
      those patients on the same day. This study will investigate the effectiveness and&#xD;
      implementation of this score in four peri-urban clinics in Uganda, providing critical&#xD;
      pragmatic data to inform (or halt) the design of a definitive large-scale cluster randomized&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 1.5 million people die of tuberculosis (TB) every year. Many of these are people&#xD;
      who seek care in under-resourced clinics (for example, in rural areas or informal&#xD;
      settlements) where same-day TB diagnosis is not available. These patients are often unable to&#xD;
      return promptly to receive their results and start treatment, resulting in ongoing disease&#xD;
      transmission and often death. If TB treatment could be started on the same day as these&#xD;
      patients initially seek care, substantial mortality and transmission could be averted. The&#xD;
      research team has developed and validated a clinical risk score (&quot;PredicTB&quot;) for adult&#xD;
      pulmonary TB that could aid in clinical decision-making. This risk score ranges from 1-10,&#xD;
      can be calculated by hand in under a minute using readily available clinical data (e.g., age,&#xD;
      sex, self-reported HIV status), and has sufficiently high accuracy to inform decisions about&#xD;
      same-day empiric treatment initiation while confirmatory test results are pending. Same-day&#xD;
      treatment initiation improves patient outcomes for other infectious diseases (for example,&#xD;
      sexually transmitted diseases including HIV), and this novel clinical risk score holds&#xD;
      similar promise for TB, the leading cause of infectious mortality worldwide. However, before&#xD;
      conducting a large-scale cluster randomized trial to evaluate whether this score could&#xD;
      improve patient-important outcomes, it is critical to first generate evidence that this score&#xD;
      could be effective and be implemented in the most-resource-limited settings for which it is&#xD;
      intended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team proposes a type 2 hybrid effectiveness-implementation evaluation of the&#xD;
      PredicTB clinical risk score in four peri-urban clinics in Uganda, with an additional four&#xD;
      clinics serving as a comparison group. The Specific Aims are to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      PredicTB on clinical outcomes including rapid treatment initiation, TB mortality, and loss to&#xD;
      care (Aim 1); to evaluate the implementation of PredicTB in terms of reach, adoption,&#xD;
      implementation, and maintenance (Aim 2); and the project the long-term impact and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of PredicTB implementation (Aim 3). The primary outcome is the increase in&#xD;
      the proportion of patients with microbiologically confirmed TB who start treatment within&#xD;
      seven days of initial presentation. To accomplish these aims, the research team will adopt a&#xD;
      highly pragmatic study design in which the research team train clinicians in the use of the&#xD;
      PredicTB score and perform quarterly site visits but otherwise minimize contact between study&#xD;
      staff and treating clinicians. This will enable the research team to evaluate whether&#xD;
      implementation of PredicTB is likely to impact clinical decision-making and patient outcomes&#xD;
      under actual field settings. If successful, this evaluation will provide critical data to&#xD;
      justify (or halt) the conduct of a large-scale pragmatic clinical trial - not only will it&#xD;
      generate preliminary evidence of effectiveness, but it will also inform appropriate&#xD;
      implementation. Patients in highly resource-constrained settings are at the greatest risk of&#xD;
      suffering the ill effects of TB disease, including long-term morbidity and death. This study&#xD;
      represents an important first step toward improving clinical management for these&#xD;
      marginalized patients and thus toward reaching global targets for ending the TB epidemic.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adult patients submitting sputum for a new diagnosis of pulmonary TB in the four&#xD;
             study clinics and four comparison clinics between month -6 and month 18 will have&#xD;
             their records abstracted by study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Starting in the 13th month after PredicTB implementation (i.e., after the 12-month&#xD;
             post-implementation period has ended), study staff will position themselves in the&#xD;
             four study clinics for purposes of recruiting and enrolling adult patients submitting&#xD;
             sputum for a new diagnosis of pulmonary TB. No exclusions will be made except for age&#xD;
