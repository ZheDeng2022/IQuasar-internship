  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: emotional and physical alterations frequently appear in cancer patients. In&#xD;
      this sense, interventions based on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) show their&#xD;
      efficacy to improve these symptoms through increased psychological flexibility, however,&#xD;
      there is little evidence of the efficacy of ACT using combined modality (face-to-face + app),&#xD;
      despite the fact that this application modality may have beneficial effects in this group of&#xD;
      patients, who may see their participation in the interventions limited as a consequence of&#xD;
      the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method / design: Cancer patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following groups:&#xD;
      (1) face-to-face ACT + app group, (2) face-to-face ACT group, and (3) group receiving usual&#xD;
      treatment. The planned interventions last between 8 and 10 weeks and include experiential&#xD;
      exercises, metaphors, discussions, and homework assignments to promote awareness and&#xD;
      flexibility about thoughts and emotions associated with cancer. In the group that uses the&#xD;
      app, exercises (mindfulness, breathing), reminder systems, recording, reinforcement and&#xD;
      monitoring will also be provided. It is estimated that a total of 112 participants (38 per&#xD;
      group) will be necessary, and four evaluations will be carried out: T0 (pre-treatment), T1&#xD;
      (post-treatment, T2 (follow-up at three months) and T3 (follow-up at six months). months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : The primary results that are expected to be obtained are a significant increase&#xD;
      in the psychological flexibility of patients receiving treatment, with greater flexibility in&#xD;
      the group receiving the combined intervention, evaluated with the AAQ-II. Furthermore, as&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, it is expected to obtain significant improvements in anxiety and&#xD;
      depression (HADS), quality of life (EORTC QLQ C-30), Fatigue (BFI), Insomnia (ISI) and&#xD;
      post-traumatic growth (PTGI-SF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: the efficacy of the ACT-based intervention in cancer patients may be increased if&#xD;
      the benefits of using a modality that combines face-to-face and not face-to-face are added to&#xD;
      it.&#xD;

    <description>Acceptance and Action Questionnaire- II (AAQ-II). This instrument is designed to assess experiential avoidance and psychological inflexibility through 7 items that are answered with a Likert-type scale from 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) and a higher score indicates greater experiential avoidance (Bond et al., 2011).</description>

    <description>Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). This scale is used to assess anxiety and depression in a hospital settings. It is made up of 14 items (7 for anxiety and 7 for depression), which are answered on a scale from 0 to 3, with maximum values of 21 in each of the subscales</description>

    <description>EORTC QLQ C-30 (version 3), this is an instrument developed to assess the quality of life in cancer patients using 30 questions that refer to the quality of life experienced by the patient during the last week. The first twenty-eight items include questions about different symptoms and are answered on a scale that ranges from 1 (not at all) to 4 (a lot), while the last two ask patients about the perception of their global health and quality of life in a scale from 1 (terrible) to 7 (excellent). The different items are grouped into functional scales (physical / role / emotional / cognitive / social and global) and symptom scale (fatigue / nausea and vomiting / dyspnea / sleep problems / loss of appetite / constipation / diarrhea and financial impact ).</description>

    <measure>Mean of Fatigue scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of mean scores of fatigue from baseline to immediately after intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), is an instrument developed to assess fatigue in cancer patients that consists of 10 items with a Likert-type scale that assesses fatigue experienced in the last 24 hours from 0 (no fatigue) to 10 (worst fatigue imaginable). It also includes a scale to assess the degree to which fatigue has interfered with the patient's daily life in the last 24 hours, with a scale ranging from 0 (does not interfere) to 10 (completely inferred). The recommended cut-off points in cancer patients are: 1-3 (mild); 4-7 (moderate) and 8-10 (severe)</description>

    <description>Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). This instrument is designed to assess the severity of insomnia experienced through 5 items that are scored on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very severe / very dissatisfied / very much). The sum of the scores given by the subject to the different items are added together and a total score is obtained that ranges from 0-28. The recommended cut-off points are as follows: 0-7 (absence of clinical insomnia), 8-14 (subclinical insomnia), 15-21 (moderate clinical insomnia), and 22-28 (severe clinical insomnia).</description>
