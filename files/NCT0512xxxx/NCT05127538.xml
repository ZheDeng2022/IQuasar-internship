    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by chronic hyperglycemia due to a deficiency&#xD;
      in the insulin hormone(1,2). The most common symptoms of type 2 diabetes include diabetic&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy, which results in hyperglycemia, polyuria, muscle weakness, numbness,&#xD;
      and tingling sensations in the extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic peripheral neuropathy, one of the most common long-term complications of diabetes,&#xD;
      is characterized by damage to sensory and motor nerve fibers caused by uncontrolled&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, seen in approximately 50% of diabetic patients(3). In diabetic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, there is an impairment in the conduction of afferent and efferent fibers. Thus,&#xD;
      decreased muscle strength, weakening in postural control, and tactile sensation loss occurs&#xD;
      compared to healthy individuals(4-7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain is one of the most common problems in diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Pain and&#xD;
      paresthesia increase especially at night in the lower extremities (8-10). Diabetic&#xD;
      neuropathic pain results in different physical problems such as the increased risk of&#xD;
      falling, loss of balance and coordination while standing or walking, susceptibility to&#xD;
      injuries due to sensory loss, sleep disorders, and fatigue(11,12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait disorders are one of the complications seen in diabetic peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
      Neuromuscular damage due to neuropathy causes alterations in the biomechanics of the lower&#xD;
      extremities, and thus, deterioration in the time-distance characteristics of gait such as&#xD;
      stride length, stride width, double and single support period(13,14). Researchers found that&#xD;
      the potential lack of somatosensory feedback during walking and weakness of the ankle plantar&#xD;
      and dorsiflexor muscles were associated with high risk of falling in patients with neuropathy&#xD;
      (3,15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies report that increased dynamic mediolateral and anteroposterior swing cause postural&#xD;
      instability (14,16-18). Falls caused by lack of postural control and gait disorders are 15&#xD;
      times more common in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy than in healthy individuals&#xD;
      (19-22). Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the balance and calculate the risk of&#xD;
      falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, although studies are examining kinetic analyzes of gait in patients with&#xD;
      diabetic neuropathy, few studies were evaluating kinematic analyzes and stability limits&#xD;
      (2,15). In addition, the balance and gait parameters of patients with neuropathy were&#xD;
      compared with healthy individuals in studies, but no study compared with diabetic patients&#xD;
      without neuropathy (7). Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain due to type 2 diabetes on balance and gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS The study is a prospective controlled study. The study is being carried out at the&#xD;
      Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation Center Gait Analysis Laboratory Unit in Ankara.&#xD;
      Individuals diagnosed with neuropathic pain due to Type 2 Diabetes and individuals with&#xD;
      diabetes without neuropathic pain are included in the study by clinical examination and tests&#xD;
      by a physician. At the same time, healthy individuals are participating as the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study groups are below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Individuals diagnosed with neuropathic pain due to type 2 diabetes (n=14) Group 2:&#xD;
      Individuals with type 2 diabetes but no neuropathic pain (n=14) Group 3: Healthy control&#xD;
      group (n=14) We have started the study after the approval of the ethics committee. A written&#xD;
      informed consent form is being obtained from all individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for individuals with neuropathic pain due to type 2 diabetes (3,23):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being between the ages of 40-65 Taking 4 points or more from the Douleur Neuropathique en 4&#xD;
      questions (DN4) questionnaire Taking 12 points or more from the Leeds Assessment of&#xD;
      Neuropathic Signs and Symptoms (LANSS) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for individuals with type 2 diabetes but no neuropathic pain (2):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being between the ages of 40-65 Taking below 4 points from the Douleur Neuropathique en 4&#xD;
      questions (DN4) questionnaire Taking below 12 points from the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic&#xD;
      Signs and Symptoms (LANSS) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria of healthy individuals in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being between the ages of 40-65 Have no pain (Taking 1 point or less according to the Visual&#xD;
      Pain Scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria (7):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having a complaint of pain from different etiology Having a diabetic foot ulcer Presence of&#xD;
      neurological disease that may cause central neuropathic pain such as stroke, traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury, multiple sclerosis Had orthopedic surgery in the last six months Having vision&#xD;
      problems related to diabetes Had a diagnosis of vestibular disorders (Bening Paroxysmal&#xD;
      Positional Vertigo, Meniere's Disease, etc.) Having chronic pain syndrome such as&#xD;
      Fibromyalgia Syndrome Assessments Information Form: The researchers have recorded individual&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics of individuals such as age, gender, height, body weight, marital&#xD;
      status, education level, duration of complaints, and dominant side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions (DN4): DN4 is a scale consisting of 10 questions&#xD;
      evaluating neuropathic pain (24). Seven items are related to pain symptoms and three items&#xD;
      include a clinical examination. The scale asks whether patients have burning, painful cold,&#xD;
      electric shock, tingling, prickling, numbness, and itching. In addition, sensory changes in&#xD;
      the patient are examined with cotton, pins, and brushing. While 1 point is given for each&#xD;
      item in scoring, a score of 4 or more indicates the presence of neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (LANSS): Pain Questionnaire The LANSS is a&#xD;
      validated questionnaire that consists of 7 items, can distinguish neuropathic pain from&#xD;
      nociceptive pain, and is easy to score in clinical settings (25). The first part of the scale&#xD;
      consists of 5 items questioning the pain symptoms and answered as yes or no. The patient is&#xD;
      asked to think about the pain he or she has felt during the past week. In the second part,&#xD;
      the presence of allodynia and the sharp-blunt threshold value is evaluated by sensory&#xD;
      examination. The questionnaire is calculated between 0-24 points. Twelve points and above&#xD;
      indicates neuropathic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS): VAS is a scale that evaluates pain on a horizontal 100 mm line. On&#xD;
      the line, the left side indicates 'no pain' and the right side indicates 'the most severe&#xD;
      pain imaginable. Individuals are asked to mark a point on the line according to the severity&#xD;
      of the pain they feel (26).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait analysis Zebris Rehawalk (Zebris Medical GmbH, Germany): computerized gait evaluation&#xD;
      system is used to assess the kinetic and kinematic analysis of the gait. The dynamic foot&#xD;
      pressure distribution is analyzed with the pedobarography integrated into this system. The&#xD;
      system consists of a treadmill and a computer. For gait assessment, patients walk at their&#xD;
      preferred comfortable walking speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance:Static and dynamic balance and stability limit values are evaluated with the E-LINK&#xD;
      FP3 Force Plate (Biometrics Ltd, United Kingdom) system. For static balance measurement,&#xD;
      individuals are asked to place their feet on the marked places on the platform and hold an&#xD;
      object on the computer screen at a fixed point for 30 seconds without support from their&#xD;
      hands. For dynamic balance, individuals need to follow a moving object on the computer screen&#xD;
      for 30 seconds by putting their body weight forward, backward, and sideways with their feet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis For the sample size calculation G*Power Ver. 3.0.10 (Franz Faul,&#xD;
      Universität Kiel, Germany) was used. Step length is the primer outcome of the study from the&#xD;
      reference article (2). The analysis was carried out with an effective width of f=0.59, a&#xD;
      power of 90%, and a margin of error of 0.05. It was found that 14 individuals in all three&#xD;
      groups and a total of 42 individuals should be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data of the study will be analyzed by using the Statistical Program for Social Sciences&#xD;
      (SPSS) version 23.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Descriptive&#xD;
      data will be given as mean and standard deviation if numerical variables provide the&#xD;
      parametric assumption, if not, median and minimum-maximum values will be given. Qualitative&#xD;
      variables will be given with frequency and percentage values. Kruskal Wallis Test will be&#xD;
      used for the comparison of independent samples. All the statistical analyses will be set a&#xD;
      priori at an alpha level of p &lt; 0.05&#xD;
