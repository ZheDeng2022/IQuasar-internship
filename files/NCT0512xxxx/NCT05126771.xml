  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      stanford type A aortic dissection is the most common cause of death caused by aortic disease&#xD;
      in Chinese mainland. Patients who are hospitalized need immediate surgical&#xD;
      treatment.Emergency aortic arch replacement is difficult and risky. Different surgical&#xD;
      methods have different effects on postoperative prognosis. Aortic arch replacement is divided&#xD;
      into total-arch replacement (Sun's operation) and hemi-arch replacement. In this study, and&#xD;
      the learning Curve of Aortic Arch Replacement Surgery was evaluated with cumulative cum&#xD;
      curve.&#xD;

    <description>Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time was used as the main variables for evaluation and visualization of the aorta dissection surgery learning curve using Cumulative sum.Cumulative sum (CUSUM) is a statistical method that focuses on results rather than on the process of performing a program skills, it generates graphs that allow for quick detection of deviations from pre-established standards and is an alternative tool that can be used to evaluate the performance of individual program. CUSUM can be generated based on set acceptable and unacceptable failure rates and the degree to which type 1(α) and type 2(β) errors (false positive and false negative errors) will be tolerated. CUSUM was defined as Sn = ∑(Xi -p0), where Xi = 0 for success and Xi = 1 for failure, p0 is the target reference.</description>
