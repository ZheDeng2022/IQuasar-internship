  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the type of catheter used in the mapping&#xD;
      procedure prior to radioembolization improves the delivery of radioactivity to tumor(s) in&#xD;
      participants with liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The name of the devices involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pressure Enabled Drug Delivery (PEDD)/TriNav Infusion System&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard 2.4F microcatheter, not otherwise specified&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, open-label, single-center, investigator-initiated study to&#xD;
      determine if the type of catheter used to deliver the radiotracer in the mapping procedure&#xD;
      improves the delivery of radioactive microspheres during radioembolization treatment for&#xD;
      liver cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both catheters being used, the Pressure Enabled Drug Delivery (PEDD)/TriNav Infusion System&#xD;
      and theStandard 2.4F microcatheter have been cleared for clinical use by the U.S. Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radioembolization for the treatment of liver tumors typically requires 2 separate procedures.&#xD;
      The first procedure is called the mapping procedure. During the mapping procedure, the blood&#xD;
      supply to the liver and tumor are evaluated with a type of x-ray called angiography. Once the&#xD;
      optimal catheter position is determined for treatment, a &quot;simulation&quot; run is performed with&#xD;
      the injection of a fluid that acts like the radiation that will be delivered to treat the&#xD;
      tumors. This fluid is called a radiotracer. The study is looking to learn if the Pressure&#xD;
      Enabled Drug Delivery device increases the ratio of radiotracer delivered to liver tumor&#xD;
      tissue relative to normal liver tissue compared to a standard microcatheter. An improved&#xD;
      delivery of radiotracer may indicate improved delivery of radioactive microspheres which may&#xD;
      lead to improved tumor response rates and less liver toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include assessments for eligibility, study treatment including&#xD;
      evaluations, and follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the study procedures in the normal course of their&#xD;
      radioembolization procedure, with the addition of a second mapping procedure on the treatment&#xD;
      day. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two mapping procedures: Sequence A or&#xD;
      Sequence B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 10-20 people in total will take part in this research study.&#xD;

      research study by providing funding.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is radiotracer distribution, as measured by tumor to normal liver (T:N) ratio. Using SPECT/CT images collected subsequent to radiotracer delivery in mapping procedures, the volumetric tumor to normal liver (T:N) ratio of 99mTc-MAA distribution will be calculated using advanced imaging processing software, such as MIM SurePlan MRT. The T:N ratio of 99mTc-MAA delivered via the standard microcatheter will be compared to the PEDD device for each patient. The T:N ratio will be calculated for each tumor as well as in aggregate for the three largest tumors as described in Section 12.</description>
