  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognosis of patients with graft failure is dismal, and re-transplantation is the sole option&#xD;
      for long-term survival. Currently, there is no consensus concerning therapeutic options in&#xD;
      patients with primary or secondary (within the 60 days post-transplantation) graft failure&#xD;
      and finding a new donor within an acceptable delay is challenging. Literature is poor on the&#xD;
      subject while the overall survival of such patients is about 30% at 1 year. This situation&#xD;
      thus represents today a very challenging unmet medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, haploidentical (haplo) related donor Stem Cell Transplantation (haplo-SCT) have&#xD;
      improved dramatically outcomes using T-cell replete grafts with administration of&#xD;
      post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PTCy, which targets alloreactive T cells generated&#xD;
      early after an HLA-mismatched transplant, sparing regulatory T cells and leaving unaffected&#xD;
      the non-dividing hematopoietic stem cells) and standard post-transplant immune suppression&#xD;
      with a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) and mycophenolate mofetil. Our group re-transplanted a&#xD;
      patient who experienced two consecutive graft failures and was successfully managed through a&#xD;
      third haplo-SCT from her son using PTCy. We then retrospectively collected and analyzed data&#xD;
      from 26 primary graft failure patients transplanted between 2011 and 2017 in 15 centers on&#xD;
      behalf of French Society for Stem Cell Transplantation and Cell Therapy (SFGM-TC). The study&#xD;
      population consisted mainly of patients with primary or secondary (within the 60 days&#xD;
      post-transplantation) graft failure who underwent haplo-SCT and received PTCy as&#xD;
      graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis. The 1-year overall survival was about 60% suggesting&#xD;
      that this approach might be a valid option in this particular poor clinical situation but now&#xD;
      need validation through a phase II multicenter, national, prospective cohort study.&#xD;
