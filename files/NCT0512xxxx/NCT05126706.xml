      Thyroid hormones play an important role in the regulation of the body's metabolism. But the&#xD;
      relationship between thyroid hormone status and the basal metabolism rate is not absolute.&#xD;
      Because thyroid hormone function is not the only factor of control the metabolism and it can&#xD;
      be influenced by various factors such as physical activity and diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weight change after thyroidectomy is one of the concerns for thyroid cancer patients. The&#xD;
      evidence on the bodyweight changes following thyroidectomy has not been established well.&#xD;
      Being overweight and obese can increase the risk of developing many potential health&#xD;
      problems, such as heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and malignant disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, digital health care technology has been developed and applied for medical purposes&#xD;
      in many clinical practices. Digital Lifestyle Management is one of the strategies that can be&#xD;
      helpful for the obese to control their body weight by lifestyle modification. It provides&#xD;
      comprehensive, multifactorial, intensive interventions which are delivered via the digital&#xD;
      health care mobile service Noom application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of digital lifestyle management on body&#xD;
      weight and quality of life after total thyroidectomy in thyroid cancer patients by using the&#xD;
      digital health care Noom application.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The present study is a prospective randomized control trial. A total of 80 patients who&#xD;
      underwent total thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer is included. Fifty-four patients are&#xD;
      randomly assigned to the digital lifestyle management group and the other 26 patients are&#xD;
      assigned to the non-digital lifestyle management group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the experimental group (digital lifestyle management group), the patients will use this&#xD;
      application for the first 4 months with Noom applications with 1:1 personalized coaching&#xD;
      intervention, and then, use this app by self-help program without coaching intervention. The&#xD;
      digital lifestyle management program will record the patient's meals, exercise, steps taken,&#xD;
      reading articles, and give feedback to each patient. In order to monitor the psychological&#xD;
      state and quality of life of the patients, online questionnaires will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group (non-digital lifestyle management group), the patients will get the&#xD;
      conventional postoperative care protocol without using the Noom application. To investigate&#xD;
      the weight change and quality of life, variables are collected at baseline, 4 months, and 6&#xD;
      months after surgery.&#xD;
