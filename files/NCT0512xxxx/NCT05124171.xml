  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vaccination campaign in France began in early 2021 and was declared mandatory for all&#xD;
      French people in July 2021. The efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines has since been widely&#xD;
      demonstrated, as well as their safety, and now 60% of the adult population in France has&#xD;
      received a first dose, most of them with Pfizer-BioNTech's mRNA vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, despite the increasing coverage, new data highlight the need for a booster dose for&#xD;
      the most vulnerable people, including patients with immune deficiency. This makes it likely&#xD;
      that a booster dose will also be needed in the general population, especially among&#xD;
      healthcare workers, due to the active circulation of new variants since the beginning of&#xD;
      summer 2021 and evidence of reduced protection against them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, in addition to evaluating the potential benefit of a booster vaccination,&#xD;
      it appears interesting to also evaluate a heterologous vaccination regimen, i.e. a booster&#xD;
      with a different vaccine than the one used for the primary vaccination. Some studies have&#xD;
      already evaluated a two-dose heterologous regimen and the results have shown stronger&#xD;
      protection against SARS-CoV-2. In addition, this alternative could provide a real benefit in&#xD;
      terms of accessibility, cost, and acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine developed by Sanofi-Pasteur is based on a traditional recombinant protein&#xD;
      approach using GSK's AS03 adjuvant. Two formulations of this vaccine are currently under&#xD;
      development, the first targeting the S protein of the D614 strain (Wuhan strain), the second&#xD;
      targeting the B.1.351 variant. Their value as a booster needs to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is therefore to evaluate the immunological response and safety&#xD;
      induced by a homologous vaccine booster (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine booster) and a heterologous&#xD;
      vaccine booster (one of the two experimental Sanofi/GSK vaccines booster), on the D614&#xD;
      (Wuhan) strain and on the SARS-CoV-2 variants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The efficacy of COVID 19 vaccines for reducing the risk of severe COVID-19 infection has now&#xD;
      been demonstrated in real life. In France, the vaccination campaign started on December 27th,&#xD;
      2020 and was launched rapidly for healthcare professionals and for individuals at risk of&#xD;
      severe COVID on January 2021. On August 5th 30th, 2021, approximately 60% of the population&#xD;
      (&gt; 12 years) had already received complete vaccination. Out of approximately 74,3 million&#xD;
      doses of vaccine administered, 58 million doses are Pfizer BioNTech vaccine (78%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data currently available on the persistence of immunity on the one hand and the appearance of&#xD;
      viral variants with reduced sensitivity to vaccine immunity on the other, raise the need to&#xD;
      administer further additional dose at an interval from the primary vaccination that remains&#xD;
      to be defined, possibly different according to age and co-existing diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the only data published are related to the administration of a third dose&#xD;
      (booster) of the same vaccine as the one used for primary vaccination. However, some vaccines&#xD;
      developed more recently could be an interesting alternative for booster dose in terms of&#xD;
      reactogenicity, availability, cost and acceptance. Moreover heterologous vaccination could be&#xD;
      more immunogenic than homologous scheme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur is based on a conventional adjuvanted recombinant&#xD;
      protein approach. Two prototype vaccines are under development, one based on the Spike&#xD;
      protein of the SARS CoV-2 D614 strain, the other on the B.1.351 strain. Their interest as&#xD;
      booster vaccines needs to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial is to assess the response induced by a booster dose of either&#xD;
      recombinant protein-based subunit vaccine (targeting D614 strain or B.1.351 strain) or by a&#xD;
      booster dose of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (targeting Wuhan strain) in individuals&#xD;
      previously vaccinated with 2 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine. These results will&#xD;
      provide important information for booster vaccination recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled will be healthy adults with no medical history of COVID-19; they will&#xD;
      be recruited in 10(15?) centers in mainland France, via the COVIREIVAC network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, single-blinded, multicentre trial with three parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 1 receiving Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1.A: 18-64 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1.B: 65 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 2 receiving SP/GSK subunit D614 vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2.A: 18-64 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2.B: 65 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM 3 receiving SP/GSK subunit B.1.351 vaccine&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3.A: 18-64 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 3.B: 65 years and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo 4 visits :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V1 (D0): inclusion, randomization, pregnancy test, PCR test, blood draw and&#xD;
           administration of the booster dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V2 (D28): follow-up visit with a review of solicited and unsolicited local and systemic&#xD;
           reactions that occurred since the last visit, and blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V3 (D90): follow-up visit with review of potential adverse events and blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  V4 (D365): follow-up visit with review of potential adverse events and blood draw&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be used to conduct immunological analyses, and cellular analyses for a&#xD;
      sub-category of 26 participants per group.&#xD;
