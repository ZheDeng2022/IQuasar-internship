  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alcohol use is the second leading cause of preventable death after smoking. The Evin law was&#xD;
      built in 1991 with the goal of reducing exposure to alcohol marketing among the youngest. But&#xD;
      this law is currently extremely weakened, and in a press release of February 26, 2018, the&#xD;
      French Society of Alcoology is alarmed by these developments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on the impact of alcohol marketing focus for the most part on young adolescents and&#xD;
      the links between marketing exposure and alcohol initiation. But beyond these links, little&#xD;
      work has been done on the impact of alcohol marketing on vulnerable subjects with regular&#xD;
      alcohol consumption. Alcohol consumption is one of the very first causes of hospitalization&#xD;
      in France. The damage is often limited to the notion of risks of dependence, but it can&#xD;
      appear as soon as consumption of 1 standard unit/day and mainly concerns the 45-64 year olds.&#xD;
      To our knowledge, there are no studies on the impact of alcohol marketing carried out among&#xD;
      regular alcohol users with moderate or severe alcohol use disorders.&#xD;
