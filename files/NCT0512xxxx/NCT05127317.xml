      Mechanical power is the amount of energy transferred to the respiratory system of patients&#xD;
      during each breath period. After overcoming the resistances required for respiration, the&#xD;
      remaining energy may end up by damaging the lung parenchyma. Promising studies are showing&#xD;
      that this amount of energy, which can be calculated mathematically, can be used as a single&#xD;
      indicator instead of the limits used for barotrauma, volu-trauma, or atelecto-trauma in adult&#xD;
      patients. However, the MP limit that should not be exceeded in pediatric patients is not yet&#xD;
      clear. In this study, we present our MP calculations in pediatric anesthesia&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation is applied to millions of healthy and sick lungs every year in&#xD;
      perioperative conditions and intensive care units. Meanwhile, the energy applied to the lungs&#xD;
      by the ventilator during mechanical ventilation is usually used to overcome resistance in the&#xD;
      chest wall and airways. Leftover energy is consumed by temperature, inflammation, and&#xD;
      potentially lung tissue damage (1). The risk of ventilation-related damage increases in lungs&#xD;
      with impaired homogeneity and ventilation-perfusion imbalance (1). As demonstrated by&#xD;
      experimental and clinical studies, mechanical ventilation-induced lung injury (VILI) is&#xD;
      associated with tidal volume, peak pressure, respiratory rate, and airflow. The physical&#xD;
      force applied during ventilation TV increases exponentially with driving pressures (ΔPaw),&#xD;
      flow (exponent = 2), and respiration rate (RR) (exponent = 1.4), and linearly with positive&#xD;
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (2). When the effects of these parameters are formulated, the&#xD;
      energy applied to the lungs is revealed. This energy has been formulated as Joule/minute and&#xD;
      has now taken its place as mechanical power (MP) in the literature. (2). A benefit of the MP&#xD;
      calculation is that it is a single, easily calculated indicator parameter that can be used&#xD;
      for the risks of barotrauma, volutrauma, or atelectotrauma associated with VILI. As shown in&#xD;
      different publications, high MP values were associated with negative outcomes such as&#xD;
      increased 30-day mortality in intensive care patients, increased length of stay in hospital&#xD;
      and intensive care unit, and decreased number of ventilator-free days(3)(4). Cressoni et al.&#xD;
      showed in their experimental study that MP values above 12 J/min in healthy pigs are&#xD;
      associated with MV-related complications and this value can also be used as an alarm limit in&#xD;
      humans(5). In addition, Costa et al found that 0.32 ± 0.14 J / min/ kg indexed MP(MP/Kg) was&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality in ARDS patients(6). Some recent studies also support the&#xD;
      conclusion that Mp calculation is beneficial(7)(8). For this reason, Gattinoni et al.&#xD;
      suggests that MP limits and formula should be added to the mechanical ventilator software(2).&#xD;
      However, studies on MP have often focused on ARDS and have been performed on intensive care&#xD;
      patients or experimental animal models(9). Although MP is a promising safety limit with its&#xD;
      easy computability, there are still questions about the formula and its usefulness. The&#xD;
      success of the MP formula in perioperative situations and especially in pediatric patients&#xD;
      has not been adequately tested. As far as we know, our study is one of the first publications&#xD;
      to question the MP threshold in healthy pediatric cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our primary aim is to calculate the MP applied in pediatric cases who will&#xD;
      undergo inguinal hernia surgery under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our other aims are the calculation of the mechanical power applied per kilogram and the other&#xD;
      transferred energies, their comparison with the literature, and questioning the possible&#xD;
      contribution of a mechanical power formula to safe mechanical ventilation in pediatric cases.&#xD;

    <description>In our study, mechanical power (MP) will be calculated during mechanical ventilation in patients who will be operated under general anesthesia.&#xD;
MP will be calculated with the simplified formula applied by Gattinoni et al. MPvcv: RR x Tv x (PIP-[(Pplat-PEEP)/2]) x 0.098(2) In pressure-controlled ventilation, the simplified MP formula of Becher et al. well be used.&#xD;
MPpcv: RR x Tv x (ΔPinsp + PEEP) x 0.098 (11)&#xD;
For MP calculated according to the weight of the patients; Indexed MP: MP /kg according to IBW. For the force applied to the lungs in each inspiration; Dynamic power (mJ/min): Vt x RR x [(Pplato+ tPEEP)/2]. For the driver power that provides the gas flow; Driving power (mJ/min): Vt x RR x [ (Pplat - tPEEP) / 2]. Calculating mechanical energy; Mechanical energy (mJ/kg): 0.098 x (V x kg ) x (PIP - [(P plateau- PEEP) / 2]) formulas were used</description>
