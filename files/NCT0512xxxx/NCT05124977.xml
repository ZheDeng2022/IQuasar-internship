  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increasing emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria worldwide is now considered one of&#xD;
      the most urgent threats to global health. The association between increase of antibiotics&#xD;
      consumption and resistance emergence has been well documented for all patients admitted to&#xD;
      the Intensive care unit (ICU) who received antibiotic treatment and for patients treated for&#xD;
      ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reduction of use of antibiotics is a major point in the war against antimicrobial resistance.&#xD;
      VAP is the first cause of healthcare-associated infections in ICU and more than half of&#xD;
      antibiotics prescriptions in ICU are due to VAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the diagnosis of pneumonia under MV has been made, initiation of antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      must be prompt but there is no clear consensus on its duration. In the case of a good&#xD;
      clinical response to treatment, it has been shown in some situations that short course&#xD;
      antibiotics can be effective without side effects and antimicrobial stewardship initiatives&#xD;
      can be applied successfully and effectively to the management of Community Acquired Pneumonia&#xD;
      (CAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that an antimicrobial stewardship is possible in the treatment of VAP with&#xD;
      no increase in the rate of all-cause mortality, treatment failure or occurrence of new&#xD;
      episode of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate whether an antimicrobial stewardship for VAP based on daily&#xD;
      assessment of clinical cure and antimicrobial discontinuation, if it is obtained, would be&#xD;
      non-inferior in terms of all-cause mortality, treatment failure or occurrence of new episode&#xD;
      of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, national multicenter (24 centers), phase III, comparative&#xD;
      randomized (1:1), single-blinded clinical trial comparing two management strategies of&#xD;
      treatment of pneumonia on the basis of two parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Antimicrobial stewardship based on daily clinical assessment of clinical&#xD;
      cure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Increasing emergence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria worldwide is now considered one of&#xD;
      the most urgent threats to global health. The association between increase of antibiotics&#xD;
      consumption and resistance emergence has been well documented for all patients admitted to&#xD;
      the Intensive care unit (ICU) who received antibiotic treatment1 and for patients treated for&#xD;
      ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP). Reduction of use of antibiotics is a major point in&#xD;
      the war against antimicrobial resistance. VAP is the first cause of healthcare-associated&#xD;
      infections in ICU and more than half of antibiotics prescriptions in ICU are due to VAP.&#xD;
      Current international guidelines define VAP as a pneumonia occurring&gt;48 hours after&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation and distinguishes early onset VAP occurring in the first five days&#xD;
      after admission and late VAP, occurring after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the diagnosis of pneumonia under MV has been made, initiation of antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      must be prompt but there is no clear consensus on its duration. In the case of a good&#xD;
      clinical response to treatment, it has been shown in some situations that short course&#xD;
      antibiotics can be effective without side effects and antimicrobial stewardship initiatives&#xD;
      can be applied successfully and effectively to the management of Community Acquired Pneumonia&#xD;
      (CAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      American guidelines strongly recommend a 7-day course of antibiotic therapy rather than a&#xD;
      longer duration but remark that &quot;there exist situations in which a shorter or longer duration&#xD;
      of antibiotics may be indicated, depending upon the rate of improvement of clinical,&#xD;
      radiologic, and laboratory parameters&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that an antimicrobial stewardship is possible in the treatment of VAP with&#xD;
      no increase in the rate of all-cause mortality, treatment failure or occurrence of new&#xD;
      episode of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective is to investigate whether an antimicrobial stewardship for VAP based on daily&#xD;
      assessment of clinical cure and antimicrobial discontinuation, if it is obtained, would be&#xD;
      non-inferior in terms of all-cause mortality, treatment failure or occurrence of new episode&#xD;
      of pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a prospective, national multicenter (24 centers), phase III, comparative&#xD;
      randomized (1:1), single-blinded clinical trial comparing two management strategies of&#xD;
      treatment of pneumonia on the basis of two parallel arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group: Antimicrobial stewardship based on daily clinical assessment of clinical&#xD;
      cure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: standard management: duration of appropriate antibiotic therapy for confirmed&#xD;
      VAP according to guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is a hierarchical endpoint with a first non-inferiority criteria and a&#xD;
      second efficacy criteria.&#xD;
