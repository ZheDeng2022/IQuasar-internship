    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent disorder of movement or posture due to non-progressive&#xD;
      impairments of the developing brain. Current estimates indicate that as many as 30% of CP&#xD;
      cases may be genetic in nature. In our study, we will re-examine the data of children with&#xD;
      CP, who are registered in the Slovenian National Registry of Cerebral Palsy. All children&#xD;
      will be invited to the University Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana,&#xD;
      where they will be re-examined by a neurologist. Blood for genetic testing will be taken. In&#xD;
      the case of confirmed genetic ethiology of CP, the search for specific therapy will be&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) is a permanent disorder of movement or posture due to non-progressive&#xD;
      impairments of the developing brain. In children, CP is the most common cause of motor&#xD;
      impairment, which is often accompanied by other disorders such as epilepsy, mental&#xD;
      retardation, speech and language disorders, eating disorders, visual and hearing disorders,&#xD;
      and behavioral disorders. Approximately 1 child in every 500 live births is diagnosed with&#xD;
      cerebral palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of CP are usually related to inadequate blood flow and oxygen supply to the baby's&#xD;
      central nervous system during pregnancy or birth, complications of premature birth, and other&#xD;
      complications in the neonatal period such as respiratory distress, infections, or jaundice.&#xD;
      It is estimated that in up to one third of children with CP the cause is unexplained. The&#xD;
      cause of CP in these children may also be rare genetic diseases. For some of these diseases a&#xD;
      targeted treatment is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Slovenia, all children with CP, born since 1996, are included in the Slovenian National&#xD;
      Registry of Cerebral Palsy (SRCP), which is part of the European registry - Surveillance of&#xD;
      Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE). Children are entered into the register at University&#xD;
      Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre Ljubljana at the age of 5, after prior&#xD;
      parental consent, otherwise anonymously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, we will re-examine the data of children with CP, who are registered in the&#xD;
      SRCP. All children will be invited to the University Children's Hospital, University Medical&#xD;
      Centre Ljubljana, where they will be re-examined by a neurologist. With the consent of the&#xD;
      patient or his/her parent/guardian, blood for genetic test will be taken. Utilising next gen&#xD;
      sequencing (NGS), a gene panel of more than 100 genes associated with the CP spectrum&#xD;
      disorders will be performed. In the case of confirmed genetic ethiology of CP, the search for&#xD;
      specific therapy will be possible.&#xD;
