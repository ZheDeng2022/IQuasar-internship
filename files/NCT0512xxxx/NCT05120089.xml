  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal deformity may not only alter the physical appearance, but may also have a&#xD;
      psychological impact on the child, particularly in the adolescent to whom self- image is so&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effect of muscle energy technique compared to myofacial&#xD;
      release in the adolescent with spinal deformities( scoliosis and/ or kyphosis).&#xD;

    <description>It is defined as the greatest angle at a particular region of the vertebral column, when measured from the superior endplate of a superior vertebra to the inferior endplate of an inferior vertebra.

    <description>Muscle energy technique is an associate degree of osteopathic manipulation methodology. The muscles of patients were used, on request, to type a singular controlled position, in a very specific direction, and against a distinctly executed therapist-applied counterforce. Muscle energy technique could be a post-isometric relaxation, because it reduces the tone of a muscle or cluster of muscle after a brief period following an isometric contraction. The result of post-isometric relaxation is mediated by receptive input from Golgi connective tissue organ (GTO) that has associate degree repressive result on the antagonist muscles mediated by the muscle spindle receptive. The technique will be applied for two month (3 session/week)</description>
