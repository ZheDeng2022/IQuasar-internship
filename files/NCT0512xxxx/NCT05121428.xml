      The primary objective of this study is to better understand patients' attitudes and&#xD;
      experiences during office-based opioid treatment (OBOT) in the COVID-19 pandemic. This study&#xD;
      specifically aims to evaluate attitudes and experiences of people prescribe buprenorphine&#xD;
      across five domains with the hope of evaluating a) whether telemedicine has improved their&#xD;
      access to and experiences with OBOT; b) the factors that motivate individuals in OBOT to&#xD;
      abstain from opioid drug use; c) how patients' view the use of cannabis, benzodiazepines, and&#xD;
      nicotine during OBOT; d) the degree to which patients in OBOT report using cannabis,&#xD;
      benzodiazepines, and nicotine and how their use might have changed during the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic; and e) whether patients attitudes towards cannabis, benzodiazepines, and&#xD;
      cigarettes/e-cigarettes are associated with their use of those same substances.&#xD;

        The subject population consists of adults aged 18+ who live in Massachusetts and are&#xD;
        currently prescribed buprenorphine by a healthcare provider to treat OUD. Those under the&#xD;
        age of 18 will be screened out of the investigation during the consent process. In&#xD;
        addition, because many of the survey questions used in this investigation are based on&#xD;
        established survey instruments that were created in the English language and validated&#xD;
        among English-speaking participants, we will limit the subject population or this study to&#xD;
        English-speaking adults.&#xD;
