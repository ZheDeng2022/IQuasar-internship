    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective propensity score-matched analysis of a large institutional cohort of&#xD;
      patients in order to compare long-term outcomes and clinicopathologic characteristics between&#xD;
      patients treated with breast conserving surgery or mastectomy for breast cancer.&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to compare long-term outcomes and clinicopathologic characteristics&#xD;
      between patients treated with breast conserving surgery + whole breast irradiation or&#xD;
      mastectomy for breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent observations regarding long-term outcomes among patients with early-stage breast&#xD;
      cancer who underwent breast-conserving surgery plus whole-breast irradiation or mastectomy&#xD;
      are from a small number of registry-based studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, these findings may overestimate differences in survival between the two groups,&#xD;
      compared with randomized controlled trials conducted in the 1980s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study performed a propensity score-matched analysis in a cohort of 9710 patients aged&#xD;
      &lt;70 years who underwent breast conserving surgery + whole breast irradiation or mastectomy&#xD;
      without external radiotherapy for a first primary breast cancer (pT1-2, N0-3a) at the&#xD;
      European Institute of Oncology between 2000 and 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were matched by propensity score.&#xD;

        Retrospectively analysis of patients who received treatment for invasive breast cancer at&#xD;
        the European Institute of Oncology between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The original cohort comprised 9710 eligible patients with breast cancer, of whom 2289&#xD;
        (23.6%) underwent breast conserving surgery + whole breast irradiation and 7421 (76.4%)&#xD;
        underwent mastectomy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        After propensity score matching, 1970 of the 2289 patients who underwent mastectomy (86.1%)&#xD;
        were successfully matched to 1970 patients who underwent breast conserving surgery.&#xD;
