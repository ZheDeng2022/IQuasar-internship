      ASOP is a prospective cohort study comparing three methods for assessing risk of self-induced&#xD;
      lung injury in patients with acute respiratory failure being managed with pressure-support&#xD;
      ventilation. We will describe the relationship between three different assessment methods for&#xD;
      risk of self-induced lung injury and compare them to a gold standard measurement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) is known to cause significant morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      in patients with acute respiratory failure. Most studies on VILI have involved the effects of&#xD;
      inappropriate (often excessive) mechanical ventilator settings. More recently, it has been&#xD;
      noted that similar lung damage can be caused by large, patient generated, uncontrolled tidal&#xD;
      volumes and driving pressures, which has been termed &quot;self-induced lung injury,&quot; or SILI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure-support ventilation (PSV) is a common mechanical ventilation mode often used in&#xD;
      patients with active inspiratory efforts to help reduce patient inspiratory work and improve&#xD;
      comfort. PSV effectively allows spontaneously breathing patients to determine their breath&#xD;
      flow-rate and breath duration, eliminating flow and cycle dyssynchrony. However, pressure&#xD;
      support ventilation does not allow for physicians to control tidal volume or driving&#xD;
      pressure. The risk of SILI may thus be increased with PSV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several different methods have been proposed to address these challenges. However, to date&#xD;
      none of these methods have been compared to assess for concordance in their ability to&#xD;
      indicate an increased risk of self-induced lung injury. ASOP is a prospective cohort study&#xD;
      comparing three methods for assessing risk of self-induced lung injury in patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory failure being managed with pressure-support ventilation.&#xD;
