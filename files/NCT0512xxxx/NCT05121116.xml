  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study was to assess the effects of participation in an online&#xD;
      Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on everyday memories of personal past&#xD;
      events in individuals with depression vulnerability. Previous research has demonstrated that&#xD;
      individuals with depression experience various difficulties when thinking about personal past&#xD;
      events, such as more intense negative emotions, difficulties in regulating their emotions,&#xD;
      and difficulties in recalling highly contextualized and detailed events. Some of these&#xD;
      difficulties may continue following recovery from depression and as such may constitute a&#xD;
      vulnerability for recurring depression. Other studies have found that mindfulness-based&#xD;
      interventions (MBIs) may influence how people experience and regulate their emotions, and&#xD;
      certain aspects of how people remember personal past events. Therefore, it is possible that&#xD;
      MBIs may also influence how individuals with depression vulnerability emotionally process&#xD;
      memories of personal past events. In the present study participants with a history of&#xD;
      depression were allocated to either an 8-week online MBSR condition where participants were&#xD;
      introduced to and engaged in different mindfulness practices, or a waitlist-control&#xD;
      condition, where participants did not receive any active training or treatment. In order to&#xD;
      assess the effects of the MBSR program on everyday memories of personal past events&#xD;
      participants were asked to complete a memory diary in which participants recorded both&#xD;
      spontaneously arising and word-cued memories of personal past events in everyday life, before&#xD;
      and after participating in the MBSR program or the waitlist-control condition. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that participants in the MBSR condition would report reduced&#xD;
      difficulties related to memories of personal past events compared to the waitlist-control&#xD;
      group, including how participants emotionally process these memories. The investigators&#xD;
      predicted that these effects would be greater for spontaneously occurring memories than for&#xD;
      voluntary memories, since previous research comparing individuals with different levels of&#xD;
      mindfulness skills suggests that mindfulness may be especially beneficial for influencing&#xD;
      emotion regulation in response to memories that come to mind spontaneously.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the effects of an online, self-directed Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction&#xD;
      (MBSR) program on emotion regulation in response to everyday involuntary and voluntary&#xD;
      (word-cued) autobiographical memories in individuals with a history of depression&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine whether an online, self-directed MBSR program performs similar to MBIs in&#xD;
      previous studies in terms of effects on depression symptoms, trait mindfulness, and trait&#xD;
      emotion regulation; and whether the effects of this program are similar for trait and state&#xD;
      measures of emotion regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the effects of an online, self-directed MBSR program on additional aspects of&#xD;
      involuntary and voluntary autobiographical memories in individuals with a history of&#xD;
      depression, including memory specificity, centrality, and emotional experience in response to&#xD;
      the memories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANT RECRUITMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment was done as part of a larger research project on mindfulness and&#xD;
      autobiographical memory in depression vulnerability, which recruited both individuals with&#xD;
      and without a depression history. The outlined study uses data from a sample of remitted&#xD;
      depressed participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly allocated to either an 8-week active MBSR condition, or a&#xD;
      waitlist-control condition. Participants in both conditions received information about mental&#xD;
      health support organizations and student support options on campus following enrollment in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants assigned to the active MBSR intervention participated in an 8-week,&#xD;
      self-directed MBSR program which is freely available online (www.palousemindfulness.com).&#xD;
      This MBSR program consists of a guided body scan in week 1, guided sitting meditation in week&#xD;
      2, mindful yoga practices in week 3 and 4, meditation on difficult emotions in week 5,&#xD;
      visualization meditation in week 6, lovingkindness meditation in week 7, and a silent&#xD;
      meditation in week 8. Most mindfulness practices are planned to last approximately 30 minutes&#xD;
      and participants are encouraged to engage in a mindfulness practice daily or as often as&#xD;
      possible. In weeks 2 - 8 participants could choose to alternate the practice introduced each&#xD;
      week with practices from previous weeks. In addition to the formal mindfulness practices&#xD;
      described above, the MBSR program encourages participants to employ mindfulness in their&#xD;
      daily lives and gives access to educative readings and videos related to the weekly&#xD;
      mindfulness practices. Participants in the active intervention had immediate access to all&#xD;
      MBSR practices on the website but were asked to complete the practices sequentially and in&#xD;
      the order described above over a period of eight weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the waitlist-control condition did not receive any intervention during the&#xD;
      trial, but were given a link to the MBSR program after completing the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to determine the effects of the MBSR program on everyday autobiographical memories,&#xD;
      all participants recorded everyday involuntary and voluntary (word-cued) autobiographical&#xD;
      memories in a naturalistic memory diary, and rated the memories along several dimensions,&#xD;
      including emotion regulation, emotional experience, memory specificity, and centrality.&#xD;
      Participants also completed self-report measures of depression symptoms, trait mindfulness,&#xD;
      trait emotion regulation, personal past events, and intervention adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The investigators hypothesized that participants in the MBSR condition would show&#xD;
      decreased memory suppression, expressive suppression, brooding, and reflection, and increased&#xD;
      cognitive reappraisal and non-reactivity in response to autobiographical memories compared to&#xD;
      the waitlist-control group. The investigators predicted that these effects would be greater&#xD;
      for involuntary than for voluntary memories, since previous research on trait mindfulness and&#xD;
      emotion regulation in response to autobiographical memories suggests that mindfulness skills&#xD;
      may be especially beneficial for influencing emotion regulation in response to memories that&#xD;
      come to mind involuntarily.&#xD;

    <description>Self-rated (1 = Not at all, to 5 = A great deal) memory suppression (&quot;I tried not to keep thinking about it&quot;), expressive suppression (&quot;I controlled my emotion by not expressing it&quot;), reflection (&quot;I analyzed the event to try to understand my feelings&quot;), brooding (&quot;I thought: Why do I always react this way?&quot;, cognitive reappraisal (&quot;I changed the way I was thinking about the situation&quot;), and non-reactivity (&quot;I noticed the memory and feelings without having to react to them&quot;) in response to autobiographical memories was measured with a naturalistic memory diary method. Participants were asked to record and rate involuntary autobiographical memories in the memory diary immediately upon retrieval, over a period of up to five days or until they had recorded seven memories. For each involuntary memory recorded in the memory diary, participants were instructed to record and rate a word-cued (voluntary) memory when they had time later that day.</description>
