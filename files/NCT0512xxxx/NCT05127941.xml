  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The multicenter, prospective, observational, non-interventional study conducted in German&#xD;
      Stroke Units is investigating patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) under effective&#xD;
      anticoagulation with rivaroxaban or apixaban.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyze under routine conditions wether the volume increase of ICH&#xD;
      under treatment with rivaroxaban and apixaban can be reduced with the antidote andexanet&#xD;
      alfa. Thus, data of patients under effective treatment with rivaroxaban or apixaban and&#xD;
      treated with andexanet alfa at baseline will be assessed at the time of onset of ICH, during&#xD;
      the hospital stay and during a follow-up by telephone at 30 and 90 days after hospital&#xD;
      discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is defined as the change in size or volume of the hematoma by computed&#xD;
      tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with ICH under effective&#xD;
      treatment with rivaroxaban and apixaban, who are treated with andexanet alfa. Further&#xD;
      objectives comprise evaluations concerning the functional status according to modified Rankin&#xD;
      Scale (mRS), changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and&#xD;
      occurrences of ICH or new intraventricular bleeding as well as mortality rates.&#xD;

        Patients with anticoagulating therapy with rivaroxaban or apixaban admitted with a&#xD;
        clinically symptomatic ICH will be included in the study if they have been treated with&#xD;
        andexanet alfa. A repeat CT or MRI between 12-72h after initial imaging to assess size and&#xD;
        volume of bleeding corresponds to the standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The option to include patients under anticoagulating therapy edoxaban will be evaluated&#xD;
        during the course of the study in case a marketing authorization of andexanet alfa for&#xD;
        patients under edoxaban will be received.&#xD;
