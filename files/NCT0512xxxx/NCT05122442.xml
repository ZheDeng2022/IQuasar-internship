  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Genetic diagnostic testing becomes increasingly important for enhancing our understanding of&#xD;
      the disease notably the genetics and providing the best care to the patients, and several&#xD;
      initiatives seek to gather more data in order to better understand and treat those diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within this context, Novartis and SENSGENE/Strasbourg University Hospitals (HUS) want to set&#xD;
      up, through a research collaboration, a non-interventional study in France to better&#xD;
      understand the epidemiology of IRDs, particularly the distribution of pathogenic variants in&#xD;
      patients. This study aims to serve as a starter study to implement an IRD national registry&#xD;
      led by SENSGENE/Strasbourg University Hospitals (HUS). The data collected might also be used&#xD;
      to populate global European registries. The primary objective has been defined in a&#xD;
      sufficient broad way to address this perspective of registries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As IRDs can present from birth to late middle age, this study will include both children and&#xD;
      adult patients regardless of age, sex, and the type of IRD.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients, whatever age or gender, clinically diagnosed with IRD or with high&#xD;
             suspicion for IRDs based on clinical examination and functional tests (such as fundus&#xD;
             exam and ERG), regardless of genetic testing&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who attended a consultation at one of the participating centers from SENSGENE&#xD;
             network over the inclusion period starting from sites initiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who had been prescribed a genetic test for IRD prior to or at the date of&#xD;
             inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients/Parents/Legally authorized representatives (LAR) opposed to the collection&#xD;
             and processing of their medical data/the medical data of their children/the medical&#xD;
             data of the person for whom they are LAR;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are suffering from any other retinal disorder or optic neuropathy that&#xD;
             may clinically or genetically overlap with IRD or non-genetic (phenocopy);&#xD;
