  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Up to 78% of women diagnosed with breast cancer experience impairments in their cognitive&#xD;
      function (e.g., frequent forgetfulness, slow processing speeds, and difficulties in&#xD;
      concentration, multitasking and/or word retrieval) in the course of cancer treatment. These&#xD;
      cognitive impairments (CI) have negative effects on patients' social relationships, overall&#xD;
      life satisfaction, and treatment adherence. Dietary intake may be an important factor in&#xD;
      mitigating risk of CI that breast cancer patients experience. Several studies have suggested&#xD;
      that dietary intake of specific nutrients and foods (e.g., carotenoids, B-vitamin, and&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids rich foods) can be helpful to decrease the severity of cancer-related&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (CRCI). High-quality dietary patterns can be also helpful to protect&#xD;
      white matter volume and its integrity; damage to and changes in white matter contributes to&#xD;
      CRCI. However, despite the high incidence of CRCI in breast cancer patients, very little is&#xD;
      known about etiology of CRCI. Thus, the purpose of this observational study with&#xD;
      cross-sectional design is to examine the relationships of diet with brain structural and&#xD;
      functional outcomes of breast cancer patients. The study will aim to enroll 30 female&#xD;
      postmenopausal breast cancer survivors (age 45-65) who have recently completed chemotherapy&#xD;
      treatment within 3-6 months from study enrollment. Participants will complete study&#xD;
      questionnaires online, and will have an in-person study visit to complete a functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) scan, cognitive testing, and blood sample collection via&#xD;
      fingerstick and venous blood draw. We expect our study will advance the field's understanding&#xD;
      and ability to early assess, manage, and prevent CRCI.&#xD;
