  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to determine whether the use of a timed tone played during&#xD;
      sleep, in addition to the use of established therapies, will reduce or eliminate the&#xD;
      occurrence of nightmares. In particular, the protocol tests two different mechanisms for&#xD;
      improvement: 1) further decreasing autonomic arousal and providing a mechanism for&#xD;
      restoration and 2) enhancing memory processing for the alternate version of the traumatic&#xD;
      events.&#xD;

      Study Population: The study population consisted of veterans who experienced nightmares and&#xD;
      were enrolled in a voluntary inpatient stress unit at the Topeka VA. Given that individuals&#xD;
      enrolled in the inpatient unit were under constant treatment conditions, there are no&#xD;
      specific demographic requirements for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were informed about the study and, if interested, completed the informed consent&#xD;
      process. Consented participants were randomly assigned to a treatment group. Self-reported&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., sleep duration, quality, presence and severity of nightmares) were assessed&#xD;
      every morning via sleep diaries and sleep was recorded objectively via the DREEM device.&#xD;
      Participants were debriefed upon completion of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants who consent for participation and meet inclusion/exclusion criteria were&#xD;
      randomly assigned into one of three potential groups. Participants were randomly sorted into&#xD;
      groups via an ordered systematic separation pattern. Both participants and data analysts were&#xD;
      blinded to the group assignments. Specific protocol details for each group are described&#xD;
      below. Regardless of group assignment, all participants followed the treatment unit's&#xD;
      standard protocols, with the only change being that Groups 2 (Cognitive Processing Therapy +&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia) &amp; 3 (Cognitive Processing Therapy + Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia + Nightmare Augmented Protocol-NAP) participated in an&#xD;
      Exposure, Relaxation, and Rescripting Therapy (ERRT) and Group 1 (Cognitive Processing&#xD;
      Therapy only group) did not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NAP intervention: Veterans in group 3 completed the Cognitive Processing Therapy +ERRT&#xD;
      protocol augmented by the auditory stimulation delivered by the DREEM device. Auditory&#xD;
      stimulation consists of exposure and sleep stimulation. Exposure stimulation includes playing&#xD;
      a rhythmic tone at 40-60hz (commonly referred to as pink noise) throughout the ERRT session&#xD;
      and during the presleep exposure portion of ERRT. During the ERRT session, the tone will be&#xD;
      played softly so as not to interfere with the session and will be played throughout the&#xD;
      entire session. Before sleep, the veteran played the 40-60hz tone via their smartphone while&#xD;
      they read their rescripted nightmare. During sleep, the 40-60hz tone was delivered during&#xD;
      slow-wave-sleep (SWS) by the DREEM device. The DREEM device is a headband like device used to&#xD;
      measure and enhance sleep via auditory stimulation. The DREEM device uses&#xD;
      electroencephalogram (EEG) to determine when an individual is in SWS and then uses built in&#xD;
      speakers to play the desired tone (this tone is undetectable to the dreamer and will not wake&#xD;
      them). The DREEM device has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective device for measuring&#xD;
      and enhancing sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Presleep arousal, sleep quality, and the occurrence of a posttrauma&#xD;
      nightmare(s) were assessed via sleep diaries. Sleep diaries were completed every night prior&#xD;
      to bedtime and every morning upon awakening. Each daily diary consisted of outcome measures&#xD;
      including the Nightmare Diary entry, Presleep Arousal Scale (PAS), Morning Diary entry,&#xD;
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Trauma-Related Nightmare Survey (TRNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analyses: Repeated measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) will be used to compare&#xD;
      nightmare frequency and sleep quality both within and between treatment groups. These&#xD;
      analyses will be used to determine if groups had significant reductions in nightmare&#xD;
      frequency/ improvements in sleep quality improvement and to determine if there are group&#xD;
      differences in sleep quality. For participants in the NAP group, the researchers will use&#xD;
      multilevel modeling (MLM) to determine whether there were changes in sleep macro or micro&#xD;
      architecture concurrent with introduction of the auditory tone.&#xD;

    <measure>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The PSQI is a self-report measure designed to assess certain qualities and problems associated with sleep. Participants rate quality of sleep and degree of sleep difficulties for the month preceding the assessment. A global sleep quality score is obtained by summing the seven component scores including: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction. Higher scores reflect poorer sleep quality. The global score ranges from 0-21. A cut-off score of 5 as distinguishing &quot;good&quot; sleepers from &quot;poor&quot; sleepers with a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6% and specificity of 86.5%. The PSQI was adapted for daily usage following standard protocols.</description>

    <measure>Presleep Arousal Scale (PAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>through study completion, an average of 1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The PAS is a self-report measure designed to assess somatic and cognitive arousal prior to sleep. Furthermore, the PAS can be combined to assess overall presleep arousal. The PAS has been found to be a reliable and valid measure of arousal. Cronbach's Î±s of the Cognitive and Somatic subscales were, respectively, 0.88 and 0.79. Furthermore, all item-subscale correlations are highly significant and in the predicted direction (all rs significant at p &lt; 0.01). The PAS was updated for daily use.</description>
