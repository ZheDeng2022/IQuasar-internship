  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of methods for&#xD;
      delivering mental health support when real-time communication is not possible (e.g. on long&#xD;
      duration space flights where communication lags of up to 45 minutes are anticipated). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that the two enhanced treatment conditions (i.e., those with&#xD;
      therapist support) will outperform the online self-management program without support. The&#xD;
      investigators also predict that outcomes for the two enhanced conditions will be comparable&#xD;
      to those reported in the literature for in-person psychotherapy programs.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of methods for&#xD;
      delivering mental health support when real-time communication is not possible (e.g. on long&#xD;
      duration space flights where communication lags of up to 45 minutes are anticipated).&#xD;
      Participants will be healthy, high functioning adults (e.g., medical residents, postdoctoral&#xD;
      fellows in the sciences, math, and engineering) who report elevated psychological distress,&#xD;
      mood or anxiety symptoms. Participants will complete a self-guided online therapy program&#xD;
      (MyCompass) and will be randomized to receive one of the following: (1) online therapy&#xD;
      without therapist support, 2) online therapy plus therapist support via electronic text-based&#xD;
      messaging (i.e., secure email), or 3) online therapy plus therapist support via video&#xD;
      messaging. Outcomes will be evaluated weekly via online self-report measures of psychological&#xD;
      distress, mood, anxiety, number of hours and quality of sleep, fatigue, and resiliency&#xD;
      indicators (i.e., coping and mindfulness). The investigators will examine changes over time&#xD;
      in outcomes across all three groups. The investigators hypothesize that the two enhanced&#xD;
      treatment conditions (i.e., those with therapist support) will outperform the online&#xD;
      self-management program without support. The investigators also predict that outcomes for the&#xD;
      two enhanced conditions will be comparable to those reported in the literature for in-person&#xD;
      psychotherapy programs.&#xD;

    <description>The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a 19-item questionnaire that assesses seven components of sleep quality (subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, duration, efficiency, disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction). Each component is rated on a 0-3 severity scale referring to the frequency of each disturbance, and yields a global score with a range of 0-21.</description>

    <description>The Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) measures fatigue and its effects on functioning. The FSS is comprised of nine items rated on a Likert-type rating scale (1-7), where one indicates no impairment and seven indicates severe impairment.</description>
