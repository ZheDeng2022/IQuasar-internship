  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The literature unequivocally supports follow-up in the postpartum period post hospital&#xD;
      discharge in hypertensive patients, compared to uncomplicated delivery follow-up&#xD;
      recommendations of 4-6 weeks postpartum, leading to decreased morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      utilizing at-home blood pressure monitoring and virtual/telemedicine appointments. There is&#xD;
      much evidence that telemedicine visits are equally, if not more effective, result in cost&#xD;
      savings, and are generally preferred by patients, specifically when there is a risk of&#xD;
      exposure for the patient and newborn, an appropriate factor to consider amidst the global&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic. Maternal health and well-being have substantial links with cultural and&#xD;
      racial factors. Black women are three times as likely to have morbid outcomes related to&#xD;
      gestational complications, specifically hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Minority&#xD;
      populations have historically displayed inferior access to care due to concerns related to&#xD;
      transportation, healthcare insurance, or provider accessibility and distrust, resulting in&#xD;
      diminished compliance with follow-up and negative health sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine follow-up within 10 days of delivery (48-72 hours after discharge) reduces&#xD;
      readmission rates, increase access to- and compliance with care, and improve patient safety&#xD;
      satisfaction, thus establishing feasibility. Home vital sign monitoring gives an increased&#xD;
      volume of data points for providers to utilize in titrating antihypertensive medications to&#xD;
      optimize blood pressure control, ultimately decreasing stroke and cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      Existing research lacks comprehension regarding specific cardiological impacts of labile&#xD;
      postpartum blood pressures, however researchers inferentially hypothesize that poor blood&#xD;
      pressure management in the postpartum period can have devastating long-term cardiological&#xD;
      consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This QI project will demonstrate standardized programming for patients with hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which may potentially lead to increased compliance,&#xD;
      satisfaction, and accessibility, resulting in improved long-term cardiovascular health in&#xD;
      vulnerable populations. The American heart Association (AHA) and ACOG have established that&#xD;
      HDP are associated with long-term cardiovascular disease, however obstetricians lack guidance&#xD;
      on effective, evidence-based research for standardization of care, leading to subsequently&#xD;
      disjointed medical management with much room for error in transitioning from obstetrician to&#xD;
      internist or cardiologist. Thus, implementing and establishing feasibility of remote&#xD;
      monitoring and follow-up while applying standardized algorithms and protocols for&#xD;
      antihypertensive medication titration and management may provide support in addressing and&#xD;
      eradicating these gaps. As such, this pilot project has massive prospective future&#xD;
      applicability and benefit for a highly vulnerable population.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This QI project out of CSMC will create a formal remote patient follow-up and monitoring&#xD;
      program utilizing the platform Vytrack as its' primary technology. Vytrack has the capability&#xD;
      to sync with the EHR utilized by CSMC (C-S Link, an iteration of Epic), however this feature&#xD;
      will not be utilized in establishing feasibility during this pilot project, due to cost&#xD;
      prohibitions. Vytrack will provide participants with Bluetooth technology that automatically&#xD;
      uploads in real-time and access to an application on participant's personal smartphone&#xD;
      devices. Providers may choose to create emergency alerts within desired parameters for&#xD;
      participant's uploaded vital signs via a provider portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 participants will be manually enrolled with Vytrack after eligibility is confirmed by the&#xD;
      primary investigator. Participants will receive standard education on how to properly use&#xD;
      Vytrack technology and prompted to check their vital signs twice daily (morning and night) or&#xD;
      more per primary obstetrician preference until the end of their enrollment period (ten days&#xD;
      postpartum), while additionally maintaining their primary obstetrician's standard care.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be scheduled for a virtual medical appointment at 48-72 hours&#xD;
      post hospital discharge for vital sign evaluation and optimization with a provider, employing&#xD;
      an algorithm to titrate antihypertensive therapy as needed. The initial usage of&#xD;
      antihypertensive therapy will be in accordance with the participant's care team as an&#xD;
      inpatient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this project is predominantly to establish feasibility of such programming in&#xD;
      this large academic hospital setting through ascertaining retention rates over ten days&#xD;
      postpartum as well as participant satisfaction, with a target of at least 90% retention and&#xD;
      compliance rate and at least 80% satisfaction over traditional methods. Satisfaction will be&#xD;
      analyzed through post-participation surveys, displaying Likert-scale style questions.&#xD;
      Secondarily, through improved patient engagement in postpartum care and accessibility to&#xD;
      standardized management, this QI project anticipates at least a 20% reduction in postpartum&#xD;
      readmissions for hypertensive emergencies.&#xD;
