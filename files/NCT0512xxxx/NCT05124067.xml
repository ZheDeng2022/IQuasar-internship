    <textblock>
      Our study will aim to evaluate the effects of dexmedetomidine, dexamethasone and Ondansetron&#xD;
      on the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in children undergoing dental&#xD;
      rehabilitation surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the most common and unpleasant&#xD;
      postoperative complications, which is a major concern in surgical patients. PONV affects&#xD;
      about 20-40% of surgical patients, with certain high-risk patients experiencing rates of up&#xD;
      to 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has a high incidence in children, especially for tonsillectomy and dental surgery. PONV&#xD;
      could lead to several adverse consequences, including dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and&#xD;
      wound dehiscence. it has also been reported PONV is associated with delayed hospital&#xD;
      discharge, unplanned hospital admission, and increased financial costs required for patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several anti-emetic drugs have been described for the prophylactic control of PONV.&#xD;
      Dexamethasone is common practice in surgery, as part of a multimodal pain and antiemetic&#xD;
      strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist that exhibits an anti-emetic action by&#xD;
      antagonizing vomiting signals in the afferent pathway from the stomach or small intestine and&#xD;
      solitary tract nucleus and is effective at preventing PONV, however, the high cost of this&#xD;
      drug has prevented it from being widely used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist which has been widely used in&#xD;
      clinical practice and has been explored extensively in the pediatric population due to its&#xD;
      beneficial effects on perioperative morbidities. In the past few years, many studies in&#xD;
      paediatrics have been published showing that dexmedetomidine lowered postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores and opioid consumption, decreased the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) and&#xD;
      improved the quality of recovery in pediatric patients undergoing different surgical&#xD;
      procedures. In addition, a small selection of studies reported that dexmedetomidine could&#xD;
      lower the incidence of nausea or vomiting after surgery and during the use of&#xD;
      patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in paediatrics. However, the effect of dexmedetomidine on&#xD;
      PONV remains poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      in our study, we will evaluate the effect of dexmedetomidine on preventing postoperative&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting in children in comparison with dexamethasone and ondansetron&#xD;

    <description>Postoperative vomiting will be recorded by a nurse who will be blinded to study conditions. It will be treated if vomiting occurred more than twice in 2 minutes with granisetron (0.1mg/kg and repeated if necessary but not in less than 12 hours).</description>

    <description>Postoperative pain will be assessed at 1st, 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th and 24th hrs. Postoperative by using the Pediatric Objective Pain Scale, where each criterion scores 0 - 2 to give a total score 0 - 10, and a total score of less than 5 mean adequate analgesia</description>

    <description>Emergence delirium using the pediatric anesthesia emergence delirium (PAED) scale at four time points: T0: after extubation; T1: 5 min after extubation; T2: 10 min after extubation; T3: 15 min extubation .&#xD;
The PEAD scale contains five items: eye contact, purposefulness of actions, awareness of surroundings, restlessness and consolability. Each item will be scored into five grades (0-4) according to degree, giving a maximum total of 20 points. Patients with severe agitation defined as a PAED score ≥ 10 will be treated with intravenous propofol (1 mg/kg)</description>
