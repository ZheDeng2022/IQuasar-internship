      This study has been designed as a multicentre, randomised, double-blind study of AVT03 in&#xD;
      healthy adult Male subjects. The study will assess the PK, PD safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      AVT03 compared to Prolia when administered as a single 60 mg SC dose&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a (First In Human)FIH, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, 2-arm,&#xD;
      parallel-group study of AVT03 compared with Prolia when administered as a single 60 mg SC&#xD;
      injection in healthy adult male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a 4 week Screening period, a 28-week treatment and assessment&#xD;
      period, and an End of Study (EOS) visit on Day 196. Subjects will undertake a Screening visit&#xD;
      between Day -28 and Day -1 to determine their eligibility in the study. Subjects who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be admitted to the study site on the day prior to dosing (Day -1),&#xD;
      during which their continued eligibility will be assessed up to Day 1 prior to dosing. On Day&#xD;
      1, eligible subjects will be randomized and will receive a single dose of AVT03 or Prolia.&#xD;
      Subjects will receive adequate calcium and vitamin D supplements during the study as required&#xD;
      (based on the Investigator's discretion), starting from Screening to ensure subjects have&#xD;
      appropriate levels of these parameters at the time of IP administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staggered sentinel dosing strategy will be implemented as a safety measure, with equal&#xD;
      numbers of subjects randomized to each treatment in a 1:1 ratio: Sentinel Group 1 (n = 2&#xD;
      subjects [1 per group]), Sentinel Group 2 (n = 4 subjects [2 per group]), and Sentinel Group&#xD;
      3 (n = 6 subjects [3 per group]). Following investigational product (IP) administration,&#xD;
      there will be at least 72 hours of close observation and safety monitoring by the&#xD;
      Investigator for each subject and between sentinel groups (ie, at least 72 hours should have&#xD;
      elapsed following IP administration for the last subject in each sentinel group). Provided no&#xD;
      significant safety or tolerability concerns (or events that meet the study stopping criteria)&#xD;
      have been identified in the previous sentinel group following a safety review and discussion&#xD;
      between the Investigator, Medical Monitor, and Sponsor Medical Lead, the next sentinel group&#xD;
      of subjects will be randomized and dosed. Once the IP dose is deemed to be safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated in all 3 sentinel groups, the remaining subjects (n = 194 [94 per group]) will be&#xD;
      randomized and dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel subjects will remain confined to the study site from Day -1 to Day 4 (72 hours&#xD;
      postdose); all remaining subjects will be confined to the study site from Day -1 up to Day 3&#xD;
      (48 hours postdose). Following dosing, PK, PD, safety, tolerability, and other assessments&#xD;
      will be performed according to the Schedule of Assessments (Table 1). Subjects will return to&#xD;
      the study site on an outpatient basis daily up to Day 12, then once a week from Day 15 to Day&#xD;
      29, followed by once approximately every 2 weeks up to Day 141, and finally on Day 196 for&#xD;
      the EOS visit.&#xD;
