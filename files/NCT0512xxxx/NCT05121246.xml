  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized, double blind, parallel group, single dose, 3 arm study to investigate and compare&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, immunogenicity and tolerability of MB05 with US and EU&#xD;
      Synagis® in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, the similarity in pharmacokinetics will be assessed by&#xD;
      sampling the levels of drug in the blood, and by comparing these levels among the different&#xD;
      administration arms. Safety, tolerability, and immunologic response to the administered drugs&#xD;
      will also be evaluated throughout.&#xD;
