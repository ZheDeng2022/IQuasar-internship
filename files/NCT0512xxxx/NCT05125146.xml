  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is defined as the inability to fall asleep or stay asleep at night and it is one of&#xD;
      the most prevalent sleep disorders that can have deleterious impacts on health and this&#xD;
      population's quality of life. Currently, both pharmaceutical interventions (trazodone) and&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBTi) are widely used to treat patients with insomnia. Although&#xD;
      CBTi has been efficacious in many patients, multitude of barriers for receiving treatment&#xD;
      such as its limited availability of therapists, high costs and long wait times challenge its&#xD;
      ability in sufficiently meeting the population's health needs and demands. To improve the&#xD;
      delivery of CBT, electronically delivered CBTi (e-CBTi) has been developed as an accessible&#xD;
      and effective alternative intervention for improving sleep outcomes in patients with&#xD;
      insomnia. While evidence suggest that e-CBTi is effective when compared to placebos/waitlist&#xD;
      control, evidence comparing guided e-CBTi to pharmaceutical interventions is still&#xD;
      insufficient and needs further exploration.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      60 participants diagnosed with insomnia will be recruited to the study through referrals from&#xD;
      health care professionals at Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC), family physicians, and&#xD;
      other health care providers or self-referrals. After consenting to participate in the study,&#xD;
      an initial psychiatric assessment will be completed by one of the psychiatrists on the study&#xD;
      to confirm the diagnosis and eligibility to take part in the study. Inclusion criteria: 18&#xD;
      years old or older; non-organic insomnia (F51.0) (World Health Organization 1995); difficulty&#xD;
      initiating [sleep onset latency (SOL)] and/or maintaining sleep [wake after sleep onset&#xD;
      (WASO)] for?=?30 min and/or use of sleep-promoting medication (SPM) at least three nights per&#xD;
      week for at least 3 months (Buysse et al. 2006); speak and read English, and consistent and&#xD;
      reliable access to the internet.Exclusion criteria includes presence of another untreated&#xD;
      sleep disorder such as sleep apnea, alcohol or substance use disorder, ongoing&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy, non-assessed or untreated clinically significant somatic&#xD;
      or mental symptoms or illnesses or other sleep disorders that could explain current insomnia&#xD;
      symptoms or interfere with or be worsened by CBT-i. Alcohol and substance use will be&#xD;
      evaluated during the initial assessment by a psychiatrist on the research team. If the&#xD;
      participant meets criteria for a substance use disorder, they will be excluded from the study&#xD;
      and directed to the proper resources (i.e., support groups). Pregnant women are excluded from&#xD;
      participation owing to concerns about potential adverse fetal effects of treatment as there&#xD;
      are no adequate and well controlled studies on trazodone in pregnant women for it to be&#xD;
      deemed completely safe for use during pregnancy. During the initial assessment before&#xD;
      enrollment, participants will be explained thoroughly and transparently the potential risks&#xD;
      and benefits of trazodone in pregnancy and will be asked if they are or think they may be&#xD;
      pregnant. Pregnant participants or participants who think that they may be pregnant will be&#xD;
      excluded from participation in the trial. This pregnancy testing plan can minimize potential&#xD;
      fetal risks and protect women from potential harm while minimizing participants' burdens and&#xD;
      maximizing the benefits of participation in the clinical trial for females of reproductive&#xD;
      potentials. Additionally, if a participant thinks that they may be pregnant or becomes&#xD;
      pregnant during the duration of the study, they will be instructed to meet with the&#xD;
      psychiatrist and be removed from eligibility, terminating study participation. Participants&#xD;
      will be advised to speak with the doctor and the doctor will help the participant to decide&#xD;
      the treatment option to withdraw trazodone that is best for her and her baby. To withdraw&#xD;
      trazodone, the dosage of trazodone should be tapered off gradually under a doctor's advice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of the initial assessment which determines eligibility, all eligible&#xD;
      participants will then be randomly assigned to two groups using the online randomization (&#xD;
      https://www.graphpad.com/quickcalcs/index.cfm ). Participants assigned to group A will be&#xD;
      prescribed trazodone in addition to their treatment as usual (TAU), and participants assigned&#xD;
      to group B will receive e-CBTi along with TAU. Patients in the e-CBTi experimental group will&#xD;
      receive a 7-week online program in addition to treatment as usual. The content of this&#xD;
      program will involve interactive and engaging therapy modules, for which participants will&#xD;
      receive individualized feedback from a therapist each week. All online sessions and&#xD;
      interactions will occur through a secure online platform (OPTT). Through the platform, the&#xD;
      pre-designed therapy modules are assigned to the patients, and are accessible to them at any&#xD;
      time through the week. Each module consists of approximately 30 slides, which take an average&#xD;
      of 45 minutes to complete. Every week participants will submit homework, which is then&#xD;
      directly submitted to the therapist that will provide personalized feedback to each patient.&#xD;
      The other group will be prescribed trazodone in addition to their TAU for 7 weeks, which has&#xD;
      been scietifically proven to effectively treat insomnia. Participants allocated to this arm&#xD;
      will also have the opportunity to take part in the e-CBTi after the 7 weeks study period.&#xD;
      Participants in the pharmacotherapy group will be asked to complete the same questionnaire as&#xD;
      the e-CBTi group. All sleep diary and ISI information are collected via OPTT regardless of&#xD;
      study arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Intervention Trazodone is the treatment of choice for insomnia and&#xD;
      participants allocated to the pharmaceutical intervention group will be prescribed trazodone&#xD;
      as regular treatment for the duration of the study. Participants on trazodone will also visit&#xD;
      the psychiatrist every month to ensure that the wellbeing of the participants are protected,&#xD;
      the quality of the data is maintained, and the conduct of the trial are in compliance with&#xD;
      the approved protocol, and other regulatory requirements. Trazodone is the routine practice&#xD;
      for insomnia and trazodone is covered for most patients (eg. Ontario works, ODSP, under age&#xD;
      25, etc). If the patient is not covered for trazodone, the research lab will provide gift&#xD;
      cards available in the lab to accommodate the $50/month for cost of trazodone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-CBTi intervention: Online Module Content The e-CBTi modules will involve guiding&#xD;
      participants to develop constructive and balanced strategies that would help assist&#xD;
      participants to handle sleep problems that are affecting their life. The Online CBTi is based&#xD;
      on a simple but powerful idea that insomnia is caused by thoughts and behaviors that can be&#xD;
      changed, thus the module aims to adjust the negative thinking so that they can think about&#xD;
      and adapt to the things that are happening to them; which allows participants to adjust the&#xD;
      way they behave and think about their problems in a way that is not as negative and instead&#xD;
      in a way that is potentially more realistic and productive. The module content is designed to&#xD;
      help patients with insomnia to deal with inaccurate thoughts about sleep and negative sleep&#xD;
      behaviors effectively, change participants' lifestyle practices that negatively affect their&#xD;
      sleep, and improve relaxation skills to improve healthy sleep patterns. More specifically, we&#xD;
      focus on addressing and exploring the concept of sleep, sleep habits, sleep hygiene, bedtime&#xD;
      worries, negative thoughts, and thoughts examination during our module to assist participants&#xD;
      in working on thought processes, challenging irrational thoughts, and replacing them with&#xD;
      balanced alternative thinking related to sleep.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All therapists are research assistants hired by the principal investigator. They all undergo&#xD;
      training in psychotherapy and additional training from a psychiatrist on the research team&#xD;
      before any interaction with participants. During this training, therapists complete feedback&#xD;
      on practice homework templates which are reviewed by a psychiatrist on the research team to&#xD;
      ensure adequate quality of work. All therapists are supervised by the lead psychiatrist who&#xD;
      is an expert in the area of electronically delivered psychotherapy modalities. Before any&#xD;
      submission of feedback to a participant, it is reviewed by the lead psychiatrist. Data&#xD;
      through out the study would be collected to monitor changes in patients' symptoms through&#xD;
      ISI, standard questionnaires and other behavioural variables to assess the efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment. As data is collected through the study, anonymized data (diagnosis, initial,&#xD;
      bi-weekly and 7-week assessments) will be openly shared for other researchers to use as well.&#xD;
