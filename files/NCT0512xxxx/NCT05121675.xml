  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to understand how incentives (either points alone or points that&#xD;
      can be exchanged for gift certificates) encourage engagement with an online mental health app&#xD;
      (Neuroflow) for University students. Overall, the hope of this study is to help us understand&#xD;
      how best to support mental health and wellness in university students.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As mental health awareness and intervention has gained more traction throughout the years,&#xD;
      applications - such as NeuroFlow - have emerged in an effort to facilitate aid to those who&#xD;
      are unable to afford or access alternative mental health care methods (Huckvale et al, 2020).&#xD;
      However, over 95% of mental health and wellness applications have not actually been studied&#xD;
      (Lecomte et al., 2020). Additionally, a large portion examines user adoption of various&#xD;
      mental health applications based on different factors, leaving a gap in research regarding&#xD;
      client engagement and interest post-installation (Huang and Bashir, 2017). Thus, despite&#xD;
      promises, applications for promoting mental health often do not achieve their intended goals&#xD;
      due to lack of sufficient client engagement/interest. In order to address this discrepancy,&#xD;
      the use of financial incentives and other incentives from the field of behavioral economics&#xD;
      may help (Beidas et al., 2019). As an application, NeuroFlow embeds behavioral economic&#xD;
      principles to increase motivation and engagement with the application (such as personalized&#xD;
      pop-up notification reminders and app gamification including points accrual for activity&#xD;
      completion and celebratory messages for meeting points thresholds) and also provides&#xD;
      financial incentives whereby points accrued can be redeemed into gift cards for popular&#xD;
      outlets such as Amazon. However, it is not clear if this financial incentive increases&#xD;
      engagement or has knock-on effects for mental health and wellbeing over and above the&#xD;
      behavioral economics incentives per se. In this study, we will conduct a pilot two-arm&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial where we will examine the effect of a treatment group (NeuroFlow&#xD;
      app with behavioral economics and financial incentives vs. NeuroFlow app with behavioral&#xD;
      economics incentives only) on application engagement and mental health and wellbeing (anxiety&#xD;
      and depression symptoms, sleep, self-regulation and wellbeing). The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to gain an understanding of how incentives encourage participation and engagement with an&#xD;
      online mental health platform, NeuroFlow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial to assess differences in user&#xD;
      retention and usage rates associated with two incentive structures within the NeuroFlow app&#xD;
      (I.e., general structure versus financial compensation). We will assess user engagement with&#xD;
      utilization data (ie., daily, weekly, and monthly active users) and measures of the total&#xD;
      number of activity counts completed by a user. After consenting to participate in the study,&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to use Neuroflow either with points only or with&#xD;
      points and the opportunity to exchange those points for gift cards. In both conditions,&#xD;
      participants will begin by completing a consent form and a brief questionnaire with their&#xD;
      contact information, which will be used to grant them access to the Neuroflow platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both recruitment methods, participants will be required to sign up for a 15 minute check&#xD;
      in and check out meeting before and after the trial to answer participant questions regarding&#xD;
      the app/app set up or concerns about the consent form. Furthermore, a Qualtrics survey will&#xD;
      also be dispersed to participants to be taken during this time along with an initial baseline&#xD;
      assessment (to be administered in the NeuroFlow app).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline and post-app usage Qualtrics survey links will also be sent with measures&#xD;
      (Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), World Health&#xD;
      Organization- Five Well-Being Index (WHO-5), and Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale&#xD;
      (DERS)) to participants in order to assess differences in user retention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both conditions, participants will use the Neuroflow app throughout the duration of the&#xD;
      4-week study (28 days). Participants will be sent a push notification each day through the&#xD;
      app to complete their daily activities, which could include surveys, videos, or skill-based&#xD;
      practice materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the collaboration of the Neuroflow team, the usage metrics of the app will be pulled&#xD;
      after the end of the study. The user metrics of interest are identifying factors that include&#xD;
      first name, last name, gender, age, date of birth, and the applicable assignments to each&#xD;
      participant - care team manager and behavioral health specialist. Additionally, the first and&#xD;
      last score, first and last date, and time between the first and last assessment dates for the&#xD;
      measures of interest (PHQ-9, GAD-7, WHO-5, DERS). Furthermore, the total activity number and&#xD;
      the total activity rate across all measures will be collected. No additional data from or&#xD;
      about participant phone usage or activities will be pulled as part of the study other than&#xD;
      the usage metrics specified above, specific to Neuroflow.&#xD;

It also includes financial incentives so users can earn redeemable points accrued for activity completion for gift cards at popular outlets (e.g., 1000 points which is the maximum per month = $10 gift card).</description>
