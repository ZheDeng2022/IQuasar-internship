    <textblock>
      The study is designed to assess the effect of a 3-month remote comprehensive intervention&#xD;
      program by a multidisciplinary team combined with mobile supportive text messages aimed to&#xD;
      raise the level of happiness and subjective wellbeing, on weight outcomes and physical and&#xD;
      behavioral parameters among bariatric surgery patients after sleeve gastrectomy who had a&#xD;
      weight regain of â‰¥10% from nadir, compared to a control group which will receive standard&#xD;
      care of a single meeting with the study's registered dietitian at the clinic and then be&#xD;
      advised to continue follow up.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One hundred patients will be recruited to the study and randomized to intervention or control&#xD;
      group. The comprehensive 3-month remote intervention program by the multidisciplinary study&#xD;
      team includes 6-weeks of online meetings with the study registered dietitian, sleep and&#xD;
      physical activity consultants, followed by another 6-weeks of online meetings with the study&#xD;
      RD, overall 12 weeks containing a total of 12 remote consultations (6 dietitian, 3 physical&#xD;
      activity consultant, 3 sleep consultant). In addition, the intervention group will receive&#xD;
      weekly text messages to their mobile phone, meant to enhance happiness and subjective&#xD;
      wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will receive standard care of a single meeting with the study's registered&#xD;
      dietitian at the clinic including nutrition and behavioral recommendations and then advised&#xD;
      to continue follow up, engage in physical activity and general lifestyle recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will undergo comprehensive tests at baseline and at the end of intervention after&#xD;
      3 months. Patients from both groups who will arrive to the follow-up appointment after 3&#xD;
      months will receive a participation reward which will include a gift card on the sum of 154&#xD;
      NIS for purchasing a multivitamin package for bariatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, 3 and 6 months after intervention completion, self-reported data will be collected&#xD;
      via phone calls including weight, physical activity (type, times per week and duration per&#xD;
      time), professional follow up and adherence to BS recommendations.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients will be recruited to the study and randomized to intervention or control group. Medical and demographic data collection as well as measurements and validated questionnaires will be conducted at baseline (T0) and after the intervention (3 months after T0). In addition, at 3- and 6-months post intervention patients will be contacted via phone calls and asked about their weight, physical activity, sleeping and nutritional habits, and adherence to bariatric surgery recommendations. At T0, the intervention group will be scheduled for remote meetings and the the control group will receive a single meeting with the study's registered dietitian at the end of data collection of T0, along with a recommendation to continue follow-up and lifestyle changes.</intervention_model_description>
