  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Breaking Free&#xD;
      Online, in a comparison of outpatients seeking treatment for substance use disorder who&#xD;
      receive standard care with group peer support, versus with access to Breaking Free Online,&#xD;
      versus with access to Breaking Free Online and individual peer support.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 225 outpatients receiving standard care for substance use disorder from the Centre&#xD;
      for Addiction and Mental Health will be randomized to receive clinical monitoring (CM) with&#xD;
      group peer support, Breaking Free Online only, or Breaking Free Online with individual peer&#xD;
      support, in an eight-week trial with a six-month follow-up period. The primary outcome is&#xD;
      substance use frequency; secondary outcomes include substance use problems, depression,&#xD;
      anxiety, quality of life, treatment engagement, and cost-effectiveness.&#xD;

    <description>This interview will follow established principles of qualitative research and include questions specifically designed for this study. This interview will have a two-pronged focus including (1) barriers and facilitators to the implementation of online CBT and (2) a complementary ethnographic focus on &quot;health work&quot; patients engage in to understand the impact of online CBT and explore ways to optimally deliver support during the care journey. Thematic analysis of interview data will be undertaken to offer a summative description of how patients give meaning to their experience.</description>

    <description>Breaking Free Online (BFO) is an online intervention, supporting adults struggling with substance use. It provides psychoeducation and skills building exercises in CBT and compatible approaches. The intervention strategies contained within BFO are provided via a six-domain biopsychosocial model used in CBT. Each domain of the model corresponds to a module in the BFO program which contains psychoeducation and an 'action' strategy to facilitate behaviour change. Data captured at the baseline assessment is used by the program to provide feedback to the individual on their levels of functioning across the six domains. The program then guides the user to concentrate on intervention strategies for domains with the greatest level of impairment.&#xD;
All groups will receive 'clinical monitoring,' including biweekly study assessments during the acute treatment period and monthly assessments during the six month follow-up period.</description>

    <description>BFO delivered with peer support will comprise BFO with at least weekly contact with a peer with lived experience. Peer support workers will receive training on how to facilitate participant engagement with and progress through the BFO program, as well as a weekly session plan. As part of this training, peer support workers will be given their own access code to use BFO and be encouraged to use the program. Session One constitutes an initial orienting to the program. Subsequent sessions review each information and action strategy in the BFO program, with a series of prompts to guide peer support of this content.&#xD;
