  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is an effective therapy, graft versus host&#xD;
      disease (GVHD) is the most significant complication after HSCT. Both acute GVHD and chronic&#xD;
      GVHD are leading causes of non-relapse morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute graft versus host disease usually occurs within the first 100 days of transplant and&#xD;
      can involve the skin, gut, or liver. Chronic graft versus host disease usually occurs after&#xD;
      the first 100 days of transplant and can involve skin, eyes, mouth, joints, liver, intestines&#xD;
      commonly. These two diseases are different, but both happen due to the imbalance of the donor&#xD;
      immune system in the host.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to learn more about ruxolitinib as a treatment for both acute&#xD;
      and chronic GVHD. Specifically, the investigators would like to learn more about the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (PK - the process of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination&#xD;
      from the body - meaning how the drug moves through the body) and the pharmacodynamics (PD -&#xD;
      the body's biological response to the drug) of ruxolitinib.&#xD;
