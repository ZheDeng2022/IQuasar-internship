    <textblock>
      This study was the second year.The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      the lifestyle modification intervention for overweight employees with obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnea. A randomized control trial with single blind will be used. Stratified with&#xD;
      proportional randomized sampling will be employed and 160 suitable participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from 4 electronics industries in northern of Taiwan. The subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      divided into three groups. The total duration of intervention program is 6 months. Only the&#xD;
      intervention group received the Combining Smartphone Application with lifestyle modification&#xD;
      Intervention. The home portable sleep monitor will be used to collect the change of AHI at&#xD;
      baseline, 3, and 6 months after intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The study will introduce a health-promoting lifestyle through the combination of a smartphone app (MyFitnessPal) for the experimental group, emphasizing the use of behavior change techniques to reduce weight, thereby improving the obstructive sleep apnea with overweight and obese employees in the workplace. The self-monitoring, instant feedback, and social support, as well as individualized tailor-made functions are used in intervention programs. The intervention process adopts a healthy weight reduction plan, focusing on a balanced diet, moderately reducing the calories of the food, and combining weight loss methods such as increasing exercise as the main axis, emphasizing the concept of self-monitoring of weight, calorie intake, and exercise .</description>
