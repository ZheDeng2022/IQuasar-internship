    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy D3 dissection or complete mesocolic excision (CME) has&#xD;
      become the standard treatment for right hemi-colon cancer, and the treatment of Henle trunk&#xD;
      is one of the difficulties of the operation. However, there are many variations in the Henle&#xD;
      trunk, and the vein wall is thin. It is very easy to damage the Henle trunk and its branches&#xD;
      during the operation, resulting in massive bleeding, especially for beginners. In addition,&#xD;
      retrospective studies found that for ileocecal or ascending colon tumors, low ligation of&#xD;
      Henle trunk can obtain better lymph node clearance. In the early stage, the investigators&#xD;
      improved the surgical method for ileocecal or ascending colon tumors. An endoscopic linear&#xD;
      stapler was used to disconnect the surrounding tissues of Henle trunk under the guidance of&#xD;
      indocyanine green developer. The retrospective study of small samples found that it can&#xD;
      significantly reduce the incidence of local bleeding, shorten the operation time, and obtain&#xD;
      the same lymph node clearance rate. At present, there is less large-scale randomized&#xD;
      controlled study on the disconnection of Henle trunk with linear stapler for right colon&#xD;
      cancer. In recent years, the were nearly 1000 cases/year of colorectal cancer operated in&#xD;
      department of gastrointestinal surgery of shanghai east hospital. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to cooperate with many domestic colorectal cancer treatment centers to&#xD;
      take the lead in carrying out this prospective, multicenter and randomized controlled trail,&#xD;
      to explore the safety and efficacy of linear stapler in the treatment of Henle trunk in&#xD;
      laparoscopic radial hemicolectomy of colon cancer. The investigators hope to provide accurate&#xD;
      clinical evidence for individualized precision treatment of rectal cancer patients.&#xD;

      Laparoscopic right hemicolectomy D3 dissection or complete mesocolic excision (CME) has&#xD;
      become the standard treatment for right hemi-colon cancer, and the treatment of Henle's trunk&#xD;
      is one of the difficulties of the operation. The traditional view is that D3 lymph node&#xD;
      dissection should be performed routinely in the right hemicolectomy, that is, the blood&#xD;
      vessels of the right hemi-colon including the Henle trunk and its tributary should be ligated&#xD;
      at the level of superior mesenteric artery and vein, and the lymph nodes should be cleaned.&#xD;
      However, there is a large degree of variation in the anatomy of Henle trunk, which is even&#xD;
      considered as the &quot;fingerprint&quot; of CME in the right colon. Coupled with the thin venous wall,&#xD;
      it is very easy to damage Henle trunk and its branches during operation and resulting in&#xD;
      massive bleeding, especially for beginners. In addition, a retrospective study found that the&#xD;
      lymph node metastasis rate around the middle colonic vein and Henle trunk was less than 5% in&#xD;
      ileocecal or ascending colon tumors. Low ligation in this area can also obtain a better lymph&#xD;
      node resection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above points, the investigators propose to improve the surgical method in&#xD;
      ileocecal or ascending colon tumors using a combined cephalic caudal approach. When the&#xD;
      accessory right colonic vein is separated from the head and then turned to the caudal side&#xD;
      for upward dissociation. After no metastasis of 203 groups of lymph nodes is confirmed&#xD;
      according to indocyanine green (ICG) development during the operation, the Henle trunk and&#xD;
      its root tissue were resected with a linear stapler. The investigators believe that this&#xD;
      method has the following advantages: 1. The Henle trunk together with the branches could be&#xD;
      effectively disconnect, which can reduce the difficulty of operation and shorten the learning&#xD;
      curve; 2. The incidence of bleeding was reduced. Our preliminary small sample studies have&#xD;
      confirmed that the improved operation does not increase postoperative complications and can&#xD;
      obtain the same oncological prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, parallel controlled trial designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of linear stapler in laparoscopic radical resection of&#xD;
      ascending colon cancer. The total number of patients enrolled in this study is 128, including&#xD;
      64 in the control group and 64 in the experimental group. In the experimental group,&#xD;
      indocyanine green was injected for development during the operation after ileocolic vessel&#xD;
      and the middle colonic vessel were dissected. The tributary vessels of the Henle trunk were&#xD;
      disconnected with a linear stapler if there was no obvious lymph node development, which&#xD;
      means ligated not in the root. Otherwise, they were transferred to the experimental group. In&#xD;
      the control group, the branches of Henle's trunk were dissected according to the conventional&#xD;
      method and clamped at the root. The main research objectives include: 1. Intraoperative&#xD;
      bleeding volume 2. Operation time. Secondary research objectives included: 1. Lymph node&#xD;
      detection rate 2. R0 resection rate 3. Complication rate 4. At least one serious complication&#xD;
      rate within 30 days after resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, there is less large-scale randomized controlled study on the disconnection of&#xD;
      Henle trunk with linear stapler for right colon cancer. In recent years, the were nearly 1000&#xD;
      cases/year of colorectal cancer operated in department of gastrointestinal surgery of&#xD;
      shanghai east hospital. Therefore, the investigators plan to cooperate with many domestic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer treatment centers to take the lead in carrying out this prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter and randomized controlled trail, to explore the safety and efficacy of linear&#xD;
      stapler in the treatment of Henle trunk in laparoscopic radial hemicolectomy of colon cancer.&#xD;
      The investigators hope to provide accurate clinical evidence for individualized precision&#xD;
      treatment of rectal cancer patients.&#xD;
