  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a frequently encountered disorder. According to the Rome IV&#xD;
      criteria, it is characterized by abdominal pain associated with a change in stool frequency&#xD;
      or con-sistency, or with symptomatic improvement by defecation (Mearin 2016). Associated&#xD;
      symptoms, such as bloating and flatulence, are frequently reported. The underlying&#xD;
      pathophysiology remains obscure, although several pathways have been proposed. Low-grade&#xD;
      immune activation, visceral hypersensitivity, alteration in gut microbiome have all been&#xD;
      reported (Mearin 2016). As diet exerts an impact on all these pathophysiological mechanisms,&#xD;
      the role of dietary intervention receives spe-cial attention, with special interest in the&#xD;
      role played by so-called fermentable oligo-, di-, monosac-charides and polyols (FODMAPs).&#xD;
      Multiple studies indicated the beneficial effects of the low FODMAP diet in at least part of&#xD;
      the patients (Halmos 2014, Eswaran 2016, Staudacher 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a disaccharide, lactose is part of the FODMAPs. Lactose intolerance (LI) results from&#xD;
      lactose malabsorption (LM) secondary to insufficient hydrolysis of the disaccharide lactose&#xD;
      into galactose and glucose (Misselwitz 2019). The undigested lactose will eventually reach&#xD;
      the colon, resulting in fermentation from colonic bacteria with production of different&#xD;
      compounds such as short chain fat-ty acids, carbon dioxide, H2 and methane (Catanzaro 2021).&#xD;
      These compounds have an osmotic effect and can stimulate colonic contractions. In patients&#xD;
      suffering from LI, these pathophysiologi-cal mechanisms generate symptoms such as abdominal&#xD;
      pain and cramps, flatulence, diarrhea, in-creased bowel sounds, among others, similar to the&#xD;
      mechanisms by which FODMAPs induce symp-toms of IBS. As dairy products are highly present in&#xD;
      our Western diet, LI will often be considered in patients presenting with such symptoms and&#xD;
      they will be referred for further testing. When LM is diagnosed, a lactose-free diet (LFD)&#xD;
      will be advocated to alleviate symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the earlier-mentioned studies investigated symptomatic improvement by the low FODMAP&#xD;
      diet, it remains uncertain whether this restrictive diet remains beneficial in patients&#xD;
      without evidence of LM. In a recent study the low FODMAP diet and LFD provided comparable&#xD;
      improvement in symptom severity (Krieger-Grübel 2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the improvement in IBS symptoms and quality of life (QOL) by a low FODMAP di-et&#xD;
           when lactose malabsorption has been previously excluded;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the improvement in IBS symptoms and QOL obtained by a low FODMAP diet to a&#xD;
           lactose free diet (data from the PreVaIL study).&#xD;
