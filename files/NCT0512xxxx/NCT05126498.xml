      The aim of this study is to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Dutch&#xD;
      surgical care, expressed as number of performed procedures, altered treatment plans, and&#xD;
      surgical outcomes in the Netherlands during the year 2020. This was done by executing a&#xD;
      nationwide prospective cohort study, under the name &quot;Dutch COVIDsurg II Snapshot Study&quot;. This&#xD;
      study was conducted in collaboration with the Dutch Institute of Clinical Auditing (DICA).&#xD;
      For this study, the surgical audits for lung cancer surgery (DLCA-S), Upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      cancer surgery (DUCA), pancreatic cancer surgery (DPCA), hepatobiliary surgery (DHBA),&#xD;
      colorectal cancer surgery (DCRA), hip fracture surgery (DHFA), aortic aneurysm surgery&#xD;
      (DSAA), and bariatric surgery (DATO), were expanded with an additional COVID-19 survey, since&#xD;
      August 2020. This survey focused on alterations in, or delay of treatment and diagnostics,&#xD;
      perioperative outcomes, and specific COVID-19 related symptoms and complications during the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. All academic-, general community-, teaching- and non-teaching hospitals in&#xD;
      the Netherlands performing pulmonary, upper gastrointestinal, pancreatic, hepatobiliary,&#xD;
      colorectal, hip fracture, aneurysmal or bariatric procedures were approached to participate&#xD;
      in the Dutch COVIDSurg II Snapshot study. Patients who underwent surgery during the period&#xD;
      January 1st 2018 until December 31st 2019, were included in the historical cohort. Patients&#xD;
      who underwent a surgical procedure in the period January 1st 2020 until December 31st 2020&#xD;
      were included in the study group.&#xD;
