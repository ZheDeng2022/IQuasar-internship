  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to compare the impact of video directly observed therapy&#xD;
      on inhaler technique accuracy with participants receiving video directly observed therapy vs.&#xD;
      participants receiving standard asthma care. Participants will be randomized between the two&#xD;
      groups. We will follow up and compare the two groups to see if they have improved asthma&#xD;
      control as measured by symptom-free days, higher inhaler technique at 3-month follow up,&#xD;
      higher checklist scores on a standardized inhaler technique checklist, higher proportion of&#xD;
      days covered (PDC) of their inhaled asthma controller medication, and have fewer acute care&#xD;
      visits for asthma.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Inhaler technique</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>For all participants, the inhaler technique checklist will be completed at the baseline and 3-month visits. The rate of inhaler technique accuracy (absence of errors, yes/no) at 3-months will be compared between the vDOT intervention and standard asthma care groups (primary outcome). The number and type of technique errors for both groups will be recorded at 3-months. b. For intervention participants only, each (daily) submitted video will receive 2 ratings to record a numeric score (0-10) and a yes/no accuracy score. The number and type of technique errors (i.e. did not shake inhaler, did not hold breath, etc) during the first 30 days will be assessed. The length of time to technique mastery (technique accuracy doses x 3 consecutive doses) will be recorded.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Symptom-free days</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>We will measure the change from baseline in the number of SFD during the prior 2 weeks, assessed at the end of the 3-month intervention period. This outcome measure is consistent with the symptom monitoring suggested by the national guidelines for asthma care and has been suggested as an appropriate surrogate marker for asthma control. We will ask parents to report the number of days during the prior 2 weeks that their child experienced no symptoms of asthma (defined as a 24 hour period with no coughing, wheezing, chest tightness, or shortness of breath, and no need for rescue medications).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Healthcare utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Questions regarding healthcare utilization and asthma exacerbations will be included. We will ask caregivers to report the number of steroid bursts, unscheduled (acute) healthcare visits, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations due to asthma in the past 3 months at the baseline and 3-month visit.</description>

    <measure>Medication Adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>s a proxy of medication adherence, we will measure the proportion of days covered (PDC) of their inhaled asthma medication for the 90 days (3 months) while enrolled in the proposed study.</description>

    <description>Participants in the standard asthma care group will receive standard of care asthma education conducted by a respiratory therapist in the specialty clinics at Arkansas Children's Hospital at the baseline visit. Education will include standard of care instruction on the participant's prescribed asthma medications, how to use an asthma action plan, as well as training and demonstration of proper inhaler technique. They will not have any additional study activities until the 3-month visit. They will be instructed to take their medications as prescribed.</description>

    <description>The vDOT intervention group will submit video clips of doses of inhaled controller asthma medication via the Emocha® smartphone application with each prescribed dose of inhaled controller medication. Each video will include a date and time stamp of the medication dose. Participant videos will be evaluated by trained personnel using an inhaler technique checklist to score each dose and create a report detailing the steps that were taken to complete the medication dose.</description>
