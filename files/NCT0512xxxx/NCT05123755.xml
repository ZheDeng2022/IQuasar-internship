    <textblock>
      A Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study in patients&#xD;
      hospitalized with confirmed severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to examine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of AV-001 Injection administration&#xD;
      daily to the earlier of day 28 or EOT (day prior to hospital discharge) to patients with&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 disease. A total of 120 eligible patients (20 patients in each of cohort 1, 2&#xD;
      and 3 and 60 patients in cohort 4) will be recruited from up to 20 participating&#xD;
      institutions/hospitals. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AV-001&#xD;
      Injection or AV-001 placebo Injection, together with standard of care (SOC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a coronavirus novel to the&#xD;
      human population, discovered in December 2019 and is currently the cause of a global&#xD;
      pandemic. Since the emergence of coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China on 29&#xD;
      December 2019, it has spread rapidly across the globe, with over 212 million cases and more&#xD;
      than 4,438,657 deaths reported worldwide as of 23 August 2021.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large observational studies suggest patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS have similar&#xD;
      respiratory system mechanics to patients with ARDS from other causes. SOC for patients with&#xD;
      ARDS remains limited with current interventions that focus primarily on supportive therapy,&#xD;
      including fluid management strategies and further injury prevention via lung protective&#xD;
      ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence suggests pulmonary endothelial cells contribute to the initiation and&#xD;
      propagation of ARDS in COVID-19 by altering vessel barrier integrity, promoting a coagulative&#xD;
      state, inducing vascular inflammation (endotheliitis) and mediating inflammatory cell&#xD;
      migration. In ARDS patients, the host vascular response (HVR) becomes unrestrained, resulting&#xD;
      in vascular barrier dysfunction, pulmonary edema and, ultimately, life-threatening impairment&#xD;
      of lung function. Central to the pathogenesis of ARDS is the accumulation of pulmonary fluid&#xD;
      within the interstitium and alveolus owing to increased permeability of the lung&#xD;
      microvasculature and loss of endothelial barrier integrity. Deterioration of vascular barrier&#xD;
      function results in compromised gas exchange, impaired lung function and in severe cases,&#xD;
      death. Large observational studies suggest patients with COVID-19-associated ARDS have&#xD;
      similar respiratory system mechanics to patients with ARDS from other causes. SOC for&#xD;
      patients with ARDS remains limited with current interventions that focus primarily on&#xD;
      supportive therapy, including fluid management strategies and further injury prevention via&#xD;
      lung protective ventilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AV-001 is a synthetic Angiopoietin-1 (Angpt-1) mimetic that has been shown to activate the&#xD;
      Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinase; a transmembrane protein target most highly expressed on the&#xD;
      surface of endothelial cells in the vasculature. The Tie2/Angiopoietin signaling axis has&#xD;
      been identified as a nonredundant gatekeeper of vascular homeostasis. In healthy individuals,&#xD;
      Tie2 is highly activated and signals the endothelium to fortify intracellular junctions and&#xD;
      reduce expression of adhesion molecules, which serve as leukocyte tethers upon inflammation.&#xD;
      As such, homeostatic activation results in the promotion of barrier defense against vascular&#xD;
      leakage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 120 eligible patients (20 patients each in cohorts 1, 2 and 3 and 60 patients in&#xD;
      cohort 4) will be recruited from participating institutions / hospitals. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either AV-001 Injection or AV-001 placebo Injection,&#xD;
      together with SOC. All patients will receive supportive care according to the SOC for the&#xD;
      trial site hospital likely to include remdesivir and or dexamethasone. Study drug will be&#xD;
      administered by bolus IV injection (&lt; 60 seconds). Doses of AV-001 Injection to be&#xD;
      administered will start with the lowest proposed dose of 12.5 μg/kg/day in cohort 1 (DL1) and&#xD;
      are anticipated to increase to 25 μg/kg/day in cohort 2 (DL2), 56 μg/kg/day in cohort 3 (DL3)&#xD;
      and to be determined (TBD) based on recommendation from the DSMB for cohort 4 (DL4). The dose&#xD;
      for cohort 4 will be chosen based on available safety and efficacy data obtained from all&#xD;
      patients completing DL1, DL2 and DL3. DL4 may be an intermediate dose level, repeat of an&#xD;
      earlier dose level (DL1, DL2, or DL3) or expansion of earlier dose level cohort (DL1, DL2, or&#xD;
      DL3). Based on emerging data, a decision to enroll a fifth cohort (n=20 to increase the&#xD;
      sample size to n=140) may also be made for the purpose of investigating an intermediate dose&#xD;
      level, evaluating effects in patients with a different baseline Clinical Progression Scale&#xD;
      (CPS) score or to provide comparative data regarding AV-001 Injection in patients with other&#xD;
      respiratory viruses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population for the Phase 2a study will consist of patients with severe COVID-19&#xD;
      disease which is defined by oxygen saturation (SpO2) &lt; 94% on room air at sea level, a ratio&#xD;
      of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) &lt; 300 mm&#xD;
      Hg, respiratory frequency &gt; 30 breaths/min or lung infiltrates &gt; 50% as per the NIH COVID-19&#xD;
      Treatment Guidelines. Patients with PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 mm Hg but not requiring mechanical&#xD;
      ventilations are eligible for this study. Patients hospitalized with a baseline WHO COVID-19&#xD;
      Clinical CPS score of 5 and 6, on the 10-point scale will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
