  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis for this clinical research project is that the severity of RA may be detected&#xD;
      and predicted using an optimized ML/AI algorithm that uses infrared thermal images of&#xD;
      inflamed joints and standard clinical RA-related markers (i.e., ESR and CRP) by computing&#xD;
      DAS-28 ESR scores in real-time. The infrared thermal images coupled with clinical laboratory&#xD;
      markers and the ML/AI algorithm are expected to assist a practicing clinician in the RA&#xD;
      diagnosis and the prediction of the occurrence of flares in RA patients. Physicians who use&#xD;
      this technology, would need minimum training and will be able to accurately and reliably&#xD;
      diagnose RA using a cheaper method which does not involve incident radiation emitted by other&#xD;
      imaging modalities such a X-RAY, musculoskeletal (MSK) ultrasound, or a magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI). The aim would be to have the Infrared thermal imaging devices at remote VA&#xD;
      clinics that do not have a rheumatology specialist where veterans can go for their&#xD;
      inflammatory arthritis flare and get this image by the local VA RN. These clinical results&#xD;
      can then be assessed by and discussed with a Rheumatologist via telehealth visits.&#xD;

      Objective #1: To assess the clinical feasibility of implementing a novel, physician&#xD;
      assisting, diagnostic approach for RA when compared to conventional RA examination and&#xD;
      diagnostic procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, non-interventional study will assess clinically assess and diagnose the&#xD;
      severity of RA in sero-positive RA patients experiencing active flares by using conventional&#xD;
      examination and diagnostic methods, and compared those with a physician-assisting, diagnostic&#xD;
      approach that involves the use of an infrared thermal imaging device, which detects heat&#xD;
      waves to be correlated between RA patients and control subjects (i.e., those who do not have&#xD;
      RA or who are in remission). Standard clinical laboratory values will be documented from the&#xD;
      EHR system as well and will include ESR (sedimentation rate) and CRP (c-reactive protein).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective #2: To develop and optimize a ML/Artificial intelligence(AI) algorithm that would&#xD;
      process and analyze thermal images and assist in the predictive diagnosis of RA using the&#xD;
      DAS-28 ESR score for those thermal images of the inflamed joints of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will predict the probability of an actual flare occurrence and its severity in RA&#xD;
      patients by using an optimized, physician assisting ML/AI algorithm that processes and&#xD;
      analyzes thermal images from sero-positive RA patients in pain and experiencing flares and&#xD;
      that calculates the DAS-28 scoring system in real-time&#xD;

    <description>no risk infrared thermal image would be used to capture pictures of the patients joints that are reported to be painful during a rheumatoid arthritis flare along iwth labs such as esr and crp. these will then be fed to a machine learning algorithm that will learn to predict the DAS 28 score for the RA patient and their flare.</description>
