      Evaluation of the rotational stability of a new toric intraocular lens (IOL), the TECNIS&#xD;
      Eyhance toric II.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With increasing demands of patients concerning the refractive outcome after cataract surgery,&#xD;
      toric intraocular lenses (IOLs) have become more popular. Originally, toric IOLs were used&#xD;
      mainly to correct corneal astigmatism in patients with high degrees of astigmatism. Since a&#xD;
      couple of years, toric IOLs are available from numerous manufacturers to correct moderate or&#xD;
      even low amounts of astigmatism which are much more prevalent. Only about 8% of the&#xD;
      population has a corneal astigmatism of 2.0 D or more, while the incidence of a corneal&#xD;
      astigmatism of 0.75 D or more is about 30%. The use of toric IOLs in this population results&#xD;
      in less spectacle dependence due to the astigmatic correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toric IOLs became the gold standard to correct corneal astigmatism during cataract surgery&#xD;
      and rotational stability and axis alignment are critical to the efficacy of the surgical&#xD;
      outcome. Misalignment may be caused intra- or postoperatively. Intraoperatively, misalignment&#xD;
      may happen due to cyclotorsion of the eye in supine position or due to peribulbar anaesthesia&#xD;
      and imprecision of positioning the IOL along the correct meridian in the capsular bag. This&#xD;
      can be compensated for by preoperative corneal marking in the sitting position and meticulous&#xD;
      positioning of the IOL during surgery. However, there are several other risk factors that&#xD;
      influence rotational stability in the postoperative period, such as IOL design, haptic design&#xD;
      and material, axial length, capsulorhexis size, capsular bag diameter and capsular bag&#xD;
      shrinkage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term success of toric IOLs depends on rotational stability, nevertheless rotation mostly&#xD;
      happens in the early postoperative period and once the anterior and posterior capsules fuse,&#xD;
      IOL rotation is less frequent. A study by Kim et al. showed no significant differences in&#xD;
      lens rotation between the early and late postoperative follow-up, and Kwartz et al. showed no&#xD;
      significant differences between the two periods when different lens materials were used.&#xD;
      Varsits et al. reported that rotation of toric IOLs is typically seen within the first hour&#xD;
      after implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that tilt and decentration of the IOL can lead to a negative effect on optical&#xD;
      performance and horizontal tilt induces against-the-rule-astigmatism. Every degree of&#xD;
      rotation results in a loss of 3.3% of cylindrical power and misalignment of more than 10&#xD;
      degrees is considered an indication of surgical repositioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is therefore to evaluate the rotational stability of the TECNIS Eyhance&#xD;
      toric II intraocular lens.&#xD;
