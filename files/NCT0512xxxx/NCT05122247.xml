  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to apply a validated machine-learning based model (SHIELD-RT,&#xD;
      NCT04277650) to a cohort of patients undergoing systemic therapy as outpatient cancer&#xD;
      treatment to generate an automatic system for the prediction of unplanned hospital admission&#xD;
      rates and emergency department encounters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A previously described machine learning (ML)-based model accurately predicted ED visits or&#xD;
      hospitalizations for cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy or chemoradiation. An IRB&#xD;
      approved prospective randomized trial, SHIELD-RT (NCT04277650) found that preemptive&#xD;
      intervention for patients undergoing radiation and chemoradiation based on the ML model's&#xD;
      risk stratification decreased the relative risk of acute care visits by 50%, showing that&#xD;
      ML-guided escalation of care improved personalized supportive care and treatment compliance&#xD;
      while decreasing healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to apply this validated ML based model to a cohort of patients&#xD;
      undergoing systemic therapy as outpatient cancer treatment to generate an automatic system&#xD;
      for the prediction of unplanned hospital admission rates and emergency department encounters.&#xD;
      Once validated, this study will add to the previously published body of evidence supporting a&#xD;
      randomized trial evaluating the ML algorithm's ability to assign intervention for patients&#xD;
      receiving systemic therapy at highest risk for acute care encounters.&#xD;
