    <textblock>
      The Re-TREAT study is a prospective clinical, phase 2, interventional, single-arm,&#xD;
      multicenter trial for patients with local relapse of one or more brain metastases. Patients&#xD;
      with recurrence of one or more brain metastases that have previously been treated with&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgey (SRS) are treated with repeated SRS. The aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of salvage SRS. The primary outcome is local control of the relapsed&#xD;
      tumor and the secondary endpoints include toxicity as evaluated by the investigator and&#xD;
      quality of life measured as a patient reported outcome. As an exploratory endpoint, the value&#xD;
      of advanced MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and PET (positron emission tomography) imaging&#xD;
      as a biomarker for prediction of response to treatment or toxicity will be studied.&#xD;

      Background It is estimated that 10-20 % of patients with cancer develop brain metastases (BM)&#xD;
      and the number is increasing due to prolonged patient survival as a result of improvements in&#xD;
      surgery and systemic treatment. With few exceptions however, chemotherapy is not effective in&#xD;
      treating disease within the central nervous system and therefore BM are often treated as a&#xD;
      separate compartment independently from the rest of the disease throughout the body.&#xD;
      Treatment modalities include surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and whole&#xD;
      brain irradiation (WBI) or a combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SRS is a technique where a high dose of radiation is delivered through multiple fields, often&#xD;
      as rotational intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), where the beam is aimed at the&#xD;
      tumor from everchanging angles, in order to minimize the dose to the surrounding tissue. In&#xD;
      contrast to other radiation modalities, where a margin is added to the target in order to&#xD;
      eradicate tumor cells that are not visible on imaging, SRS employs very small margins because&#xD;
      brain metastases tend to be localized with sharp boundaries to surrounding tissue. The&#xD;
      relative low dose absorbed by the surrounding tissue allows for delivery of the whole&#xD;
      radiation dose to the tumor in one to three treatment sessions ('fractions'), as opposed to&#xD;
      conventionally fractionated radiotherapy which is delivered in multiple fractions for the&#xD;
      protection of surrounding healthy tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a whole, SRS results in high rates of local tumor control (65-90%) and low rates of&#xD;
      toxicity (10-15%), which is usually mild. The most significant adverse event following SRS is&#xD;
      radionecrosis, which is estimated to occur in 5-25% of patients. This is a condition which is&#xD;
      poorly defined but is commonly used to describe a situation where the contrast enhancing area&#xD;
      in the irradiated volume increases, often accompanied by increasing edema in the surrounding&#xD;
      tissue. The condition may or may not cause symptoms. In cases of symptomatic, progressive&#xD;
      radionecrosis, oral corticosteroids such as prednisolone may be needed for longer periods of&#xD;
      time. Differentiation between relapsed metastasis and radionecrosis is notoriously difficult&#xD;
      and represents one of the major diagnostic challenges in all of neuro-oncology. Advanced&#xD;
      imaging techniques such as dynamic MRI (e.g. perfusion weighted images) or PET (positron&#xD;
      emission tomography) have been used to aid in differentiation in experimental studies, but&#xD;
      this currently remains an area of research. The development of the brain lesion over time and&#xD;
      use of close follow-up using MRI will most often aid in interpretation of the images by the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary team conference consisting of a radiologist, a radiation oncologist and a&#xD;
      neurosurgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard treatment in case of local tumor relapse following SRS. Patients who&#xD;
      have not previously received WBI may be offered this, but the possible detrimental effects on&#xD;
      neurocognition and quality of life are well documented4 and many clinicians as well as&#xD;
      patients prefer to avoid this for as long as possible. Few patients in this category are&#xD;
      recommended surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Salvage SRS (repeated SRS to the same area at time of relapse) is commonly practiced at some&#xD;
      institutions, Rigshospitalet being one of them, but the evidence to support routine use is&#xD;
      sparse. The treatment has been evaluated only in retrospective studies. These have found high&#xD;
      rates of local control (70-90%), but as adverse events and side effects cannot be evaluated&#xD;
      from retrospective studies without risk of critical bias, the safety of this treatment&#xD;
      remains to be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The Re-TREAT study is a prospective clinical, phase 2, interventional,&#xD;
      single-arm, multicenter trial with patients with local relapse of one or more brain&#xD;
      metastases. In the trial, they are treated with salvage SRS. The aim is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and toxicity of salvage SRS. The primary outcome is local control of the relapsed&#xD;
      tumor and the secondary endpoints include toxicity as evaluated by the investigator and&#xD;
      quality of life measured as a patient reported outcome. As an exploratory endpoint, the value&#xD;
      of advanced MRI and PET-imaging as a biomarker for prediction of response to treatment or&#xD;
      toxicity will be studied.&#xD;
