    <textblock>
      This project is designed to determine whether an efficacious behavioral intervention for&#xD;
      insomnia can improve the quit rates achieved by an efficacious smoking cessation program&#xD;
      aimed at PTSD patients (&quot;Integrated Care&quot;). A second aim is to deepen our understanding of&#xD;
      the mechanisms relating sleep and smoking in PTSD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In summary, participation will involve a screening period of approximately one week, six&#xD;
      weeks of temporally aligned IC (&quot;Integrated Care&quot; - manualized smoking cessation treatment&#xD;
      integrating components of behavioral treatment for PTSD) and behavioral sleep treatments&#xD;
      (Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia or CBTI), and follow-up telephone interviews at&#xD;
      two months and six months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Patients in the VA Palo Alto inpatient psychiatry and domiciliary programs&#xD;
      indicating interest in quitting cigarette smoking will be pre-screened by the Medical&#xD;
      Director to determine whether an individual's psychiatric conditions contraindicates use of&#xD;
      bupropion or NRT (Nicoderm). Patients interested in quitting will be referred to the study&#xD;
      coordinator. Coordinator will be notified whether medication or NRT is contraindicated for&#xD;
      participant and/or of a diagnosed sleep disorder (treated or untreated) other than insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuing participants will be consented and then complete 24 hours of cued symptom&#xD;
      reporting using a personal digital assistant (PDA) to verify their capacity to adhere to this&#xD;
      component of the study protocol. Continuing participants will undergo a research&#xD;
      psychodiagnostic assessment followed by an ambulatory screening polysomnogram (PSG) to&#xD;
      exclude undiagnosed sleep disorders. (Participants exhibiting evidence of sleep disorder will&#xD;
      be referred for a clinical sleep study.) Screening assessments and psychodiagnostics have&#xD;
      been sequenced with the aim of minimizing burden for those excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants meeting all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to IC+CBTI or&#xD;
      IC+Desensitization Treatment for Insomnia (DTI: a manualized placebo control intervention).&#xD;
      They will meet twice with the IC therapist to complete IC sessions 1 and 2. Over the course&#xD;
      of these sessions, they will negotiate a quit date at least three weeks from that time and at&#xD;
      least four weeks prior to their projected discharge from inpatient treatment. (Inpatient&#xD;
      stays in both of these programs average thirteen weeks.) IC sessions 3 and 4 will be evenly&#xD;
      spaced between IC session 2 and the planned quit date. Three weeks prior to their quit date,&#xD;
      they will initiate sleep treatment (sessions 1 and 2) and nightly mattress actigraphy. Two&#xD;
      weeks prior to their quit date they will begin PDA-based EMA. One to two weeks prior to their&#xD;
      quit date, they will commence bupropion and receive sleep treatment session 3. One week prior&#xD;
      to their quit date they will receive sleep treatment session 4. On their quit date they will&#xD;
      begin NRT. Thereafter, for weeks four through six, they will receive IC sessions five through&#xD;
      eight and sleep treatment session five through seven, respectively. At the end of week six,&#xD;
      they will receive IC session eight which will also serve as the 3 week assessment of smoking&#xD;
      status (the primary outcome assessment of the study). (Note that the first planned assessment&#xD;
      of cessation status will occur prior to the expected discharge date for all participants.)&#xD;
      The final research interventions will be telephone interviews at two months and six months.&#xD;
      Salivary cotinine samples will be obtained at the end of each post-quit week (only if the&#xD;
      participant is not using NRT) the last corresponding to the primary outcome assessment, at&#xD;
      both telephone follow-up smoking status assessments (by mail).&#xD;
