    <textblock>
      All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 5-15 mg. one hour before surgery. General&#xD;
      anesthesia with double lumen endobronchial tube was given. Patient was induced by propofol&#xD;
      and fentanyl. Cisatracurium was given to facilitate intubation. Patient was ventilated with&#xD;
      50% oxygen in air. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and fentanyl in order to keep&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of the baseline. Cisatracurium was given every 30&#xD;
      minutes in order to control ventilation. At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was&#xD;
      reversed.In PACU, the I.V. PCA machine was connected to the patient. The setting of PCA was&#xD;
      basal infusion of morphine 1 mg/hr bolus of morphine 1 mg with lockout interval 5 minutes and&#xD;
      4-hour limit 30 mg.The patient's mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate were recorded&#xD;
      before induction, before intubation, at 15, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes after intubation,&#xD;
      and at 4, 8,16 and 24 h after surgery. The total amounts of fentanyl, propofol and magnesium&#xD;
      sulphate were recorded. The time between the cessation of magnesium sulphate and extubation&#xD;
      was recorded. The amounts of morphine usage at 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery were&#xD;
      recorded. Pain score was evaluated at rest and deep breath and sedation score at 1, 2, 3, 4,&#xD;
      8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery using numeric rating scale (NRS). Sedation score was graded&#xD;
      as 0 = fully awake, 1 = somnolence, responds to call, 2 = somnolence, responds to tactile&#xD;
      stimulation, 3 = asleep, responds to painful stimulation. The times that the patient first&#xD;
      sipping, taking food, sitting at the edge of bed and walk with help were also recorded. The&#xD;
      side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression were recorded.&#xD;
      Cost effective analysis was also evaluated.&#xD;

      All patients were premedicated with oral midazolam 5-15 mg. one hour before surgery. In the&#xD;
      operating room, each patient was monitored with noninvasive blood pressure, ECG and pulse&#xD;
      oximetry. After the patient was anesthetized, direct blood pressure, end-tidal carbon dioxide&#xD;
      tension (ETCO2) and esophageal temperature were monitored. Choice of anesthesia was general&#xD;
      anesthesia with double lumen endobronchial tube (Bronchocath). Patient was induced by&#xD;
      propofol 1.5-2.5 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 μg/kg. After the patient was unconscious, cisatracurium&#xD;
      0.2 mg/kg was given to facilitate intubation. Patient was ventilated with 50% oxygen in air.&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained with propofol 6 -12 mg/kg/hr and 1 μg/kg of fentanyl was given&#xD;
      intermittently every 1-1.5 hour in order to keep blood pressure and heart rate within 20% of&#xD;
      the baseline. Cisatracurium (0.03 mg/kg) was given every 30 minutes in order to control&#xD;
      ventilation. The patient was ventilated with volume controlled ventilator. Throughout the&#xD;
      surgery, the ETCO2 was kept between 30-35 mmHg. During two lung ventilation, the airway&#xD;
      pressure was kept within 20 cmH2O and respiratory rate 10-12 beats/minute. One lung&#xD;
      ventilation was achieved with airway pressure less than 30 cmH2O and respiratory rate 12-20&#xD;
      beats/minute. During the surgery, the lower part of the patient was warmed with forced air&#xD;
      warmer (Bier Hugger) At the end of surgery, neuromuscular blockade was reversed by&#xD;
      prostigmine 2.5 mg and atropine 1.2 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post anesthesia care unit, the I.V. PCA machine was connected to the patient. The&#xD;
      setting of PCA was basal infusion of morphine 1 mg/hr bolus of morphine 1 mg with lockout&#xD;
      interval 5 minutes and 4-hour limit 30 mg. The patient's mean arterial blood pressure, heart&#xD;
      rate were recorded before induction, before intubation, at 15, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes&#xD;
      after intubation, and at 4, 8 , 16 and 24 hour after surgery. The total amounts of fentanyl,&#xD;
      propofol and magnesium sulphate were recorded. The time between the cessation of magnesium&#xD;
      sulphate and extubation was recorded. The amounts of morphine usage at 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours&#xD;
      after surgery were recorded. Pain score was evaluated at rest and deep breath and sedation&#xD;
      score at 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours after surgery using numeric rating scale (NRS).&#xD;
      Sedation score was graded as 0 = fully awake, 1 = somnolence, responds to call, 2 =&#xD;
      somnolence, responds to tactile stimulation, 3 = asleep, responds to painful stimulation. The&#xD;
      times that the patient first sipping, taking food, sitting at the edge of bed and walk with&#xD;
      help were also recorded. The side effects such as nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory&#xD;
      depression were recorded. Cost effective analysis was also evaluated.&#xD;
