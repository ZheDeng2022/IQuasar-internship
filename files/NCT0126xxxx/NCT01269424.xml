      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      O6-benzylguanine may help temozolomide work better by making tumor cells more sensitive to&#xD;
      the drug. Giving genetically modified peripheral blood stem cells during or after treatment&#xD;
      may prevent side effects caused by chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies O6-benzylguanine and temozolomide in combination with&#xD;
      genetically modified peripheral blood stem cells in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      glioblastoma multiforme.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of introducing and expressing P140K MGMT cDNA from a&#xD;
           lentiviral-based provirus in autologous hematopoietic stem cells harvested from&#xD;
           Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety associated with infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells&#xD;
           transduced ex vivo with a lentiviral vector expressing P140K MGMT in patients with GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether any patients who receive P140K MGMT-transduced CD34 cells tolerate&#xD;
           O6-benzylguanine (BG) and dose-escalated temozolomide (TMZ) without myelosuppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the ability to detect P140K-transduced BG and TMZ-resistant hematopoietic&#xD;
           cells from the bone marrow and peripheral blood in patients infused with&#xD;
           P140K-transduced CD34 progenitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the feasibility of in vivo enrichment of P140K-expressing hematopoietic&#xD;
           cells by repeated treatments of BG and TMZ at doses that appear therapeutic for GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of various types of chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy&#xD;
           on conditioning the patient's bone marrow to host the transduced autologous hematopoetic&#xD;
           stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate tumor response, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1 (LV P140K MGMT gene transfer after concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients&#xD;
           receive radiotherapy (60cGy in 30 2cGy daily doses) and TMZ 75mg/m2 /daily for 6 weeks,&#xD;
           cell infusion at week 7 (T0) followed by BG 120 mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 1h and&#xD;
           TMZ 50 mg/m2/day x 5 days, every 28 days (starting on T+28) for 6 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2 (LV P140K MGMT gene transfer prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy): Patients&#xD;
           receive BG 120mg/m2 intravenous infusion over 1h and TMZ 400 mg/m2 one dose given on day&#xD;
           T-2 or T-3 days prior to cell infusion, followed within 72-96 hours by radiotherapy&#xD;
           (60cGy in 30 2cGy daily doses) and concurrent BG + TMZ at 50 mg/m2/day x 5 days, every&#xD;
           28 days,starting on T+28 for a total of 7 cycles of BG + TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3 (intra-patient dose escalation of TMZ in patients with evidence of P140K-marked&#xD;
           cells): Dose escalation of TMZ in patients with evidence of P140K marked cells in vivo&#xD;
           given as described above for cohort 1 or cohort 2. After completion of radiotherapy,&#xD;
           patients will receive BG + TMZ at 50 mg/m2/day x 5 days. Patients not experiencing any&#xD;
           grade 3 toxicity will be increased to the next TMZ dose level of 65 mg/m2/day x 5.&#xD;
           Subsequent dose escalation without grade 3 toxicity will be 80 mg/m2/day, 100 mg/m2/day,&#xD;
           120mg/m2/day and 140 mg/m2/day x 5. If at subsequent cycles a grade 3 or greater&#xD;
           hematologic toxicity occurs, the dose level for the next cycle will be reduced one&#xD;
           level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for replication-competent lentivirus detection and&#xD;
      other laboratory biomarker studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed, supratentorial GBM who have&#xD;
             undergone gross total tumor resections or near gross total resection (resection of&#xD;
             &gt;90% of enhancing tumor demonstrated by MRI) are eligible up to their third&#xD;
             post-operative week. Patients with infratentorial disease, multifocal or&#xD;
             leptomeningeal disease will be excluded. In general, patients will not have &gt; 1 cm&#xD;
             residual measurable or evaluable disease after surgical tumor resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2 or Karnofsky ≥ 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have received no myelosuppressive chemotherapy prior to the diagnosis of&#xD;
             GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hematologic (ANC ≥ 1,000/mm3, platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3, Hgb ≥ 9.5) , hepatic&#xD;
             (Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl, AST and ALT less than or equal to 3 times upper limit of&#xD;
             normal, prothrombin time &lt;1.2 times normal), and renal (Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl&#xD;
             or Creatinine Clearance ≥ 60mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with serum creatinine levels&#xD;
             above institutional normal) . These tests will be repeated within 2 weeks of treatment&#xD;
             with BG and TMZ, and must meet the same criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EKG without evidence of acute cardiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Post-operative steroids are tapered to ≤ 24 mg decadron/d&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of child-bearing potential must be using single barrier contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have all sutures removed prior to registration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be considered to be clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medical condition associated with immunosuppression, active infection or medical&#xD;
             illness which may jeopardize patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV seropositivity. This exclusion is included for two reasons. First, there is&#xD;
             evidence of decreased marrow reserve in HIV+ patients and antiviral treatment is&#xD;
             associated with myelosuppression. Thus, drug treatment designed to be myelosuppressive&#xD;
             may be more toxic in this patient population. Second, extensive laboratory culturing&#xD;
             of the bone marrow and peripheral blood progenitor cells is required. No preclinical&#xD;
             samples which are HIV+ have been evaluated with the gene transfer modality proposed&#xD;
             and thus the feasibility and safety of gene transfer and selection in HIV+ samples&#xD;
             cannot yet be advocated. Such studies are planned so as to not preclude HIV+ patients&#xD;
             in later studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. There is data to indicate that TMZ is teratogenic and&#xD;
             carcinogenic. Thus, its use in pregnant women would confer unnecessary risk to the&#xD;
             fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with symptomatic pulmonary disease and other severe co-morbid conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with cardiac insufficiency and an LVEF of &lt; 40%. History of acute coronary&#xD;
             event disease or arrhythmia within 6 months prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy (including gliadel wafers) or hematopoietic cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to undergo repeated MRI evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior diagnosis of malignant disease within a three year period with the exception of&#xD;
             surgically cured basal cell carcinoma or carcinoma in situ of the cervix&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental incapacity or psychiatric illness preventing informed consent&#xD;
