  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, controlled, diagnostic, multicenter trial will compare two diagnostic&#xD;
      imaging pathways--coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and single photon emission&#xD;
      tomography (SPECT) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI)--to determine the incidence of major&#xD;
      adverse coronary events (MACE), defined as myocardial infarction (MI) or cardiac-related&#xD;
      death, and cross-over to revascularization. CCTA may be used to direct patients with symptoms&#xD;
      of stable angina or angina equivalent to optimal medical therapy (OMT). The use of CCTA as a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool for angina symptoms will be associated with no increase in MACE or&#xD;
      revascularization, decreased cost, reduced risks (e.g., less radiation exposure), additional&#xD;
      insights into alternate explanations of chest pain, and increased cost-effectiveness in&#xD;
      comparison with use of SPECT MPI/invasive coronary angiography (ICA).&#xD;

      The Randomized Evaluation of Patients with Stable Angina Comparing Utilization of Diagnostic&#xD;
      Examinations (RESCUE) is a multi-center randomized, controlled trial responding to the need&#xD;
      for comparative analysis of these imaging technologies and the role of OMT in clinical care.&#xD;
      A total of 4300 patients will be randomized to CCTA or SPECT MPI/ICA for diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment of angina at up to 80 institutions internationally. This study builds on the&#xD;
      results of the COURAGE trial by comparing CCTA and SPECT MPI/ICA integrated into a care&#xD;
      paradigm featuring initial treatment with OMT for patients diagnosed with CAD without&#xD;
      significant disease in the left main coronary artery. Participants will be followed for a&#xD;
      composite endpoint of MACE and cross-over to revascularization over a follow-up period up to&#xD;
      two years (two to six time points depending on diagnostic results and time of enrollment into&#xD;
      the trial). The primary endpoint of the study is a combined endpoint of occurrence of MACE&#xD;
      and revascularization. We will calculate differences in the combined MACE/revascularization&#xD;
      endpoint between the CCTA and SPECT MPI/ICA arms. Participant outcomes will be assessed by&#xD;
      age, gender, comorbidity, and angina classification class at presentation. Several&#xD;
      comparative-effectiveness analyses will be performed. We hypothesize that the CCTA arm will&#xD;
      be associated with no increase in MACE or revascularization, decreased cost, reduced risks&#xD;
      (e.g., less radiation exposure), additional insights into or alternate explanations of chest&#xD;
      pain, and increased cost-effectiveness in comparison with SPECT MPI/ICA. Findings are&#xD;
      expected to result in validation of an evolving new standard of care for patients with stable&#xD;
      angina that takes advantage of CCTA and OMT to more cost-effectively drive appropriate care&#xD;
      while reducing the need for invasive diagnosis and increased radiation exposure with SPECT&#xD;
      MPI/ICA.&#xD;
