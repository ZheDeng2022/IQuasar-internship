  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      On the dual basis of findings indicating GABA increases following acute and eight week&#xD;
      SSRI/dopamine agonist administration and those indicating GABA-ergic effects following 14 day&#xD;
      pyrimidine administration, the purpose of this study is to assess our following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relative to placebo, an oral dose of 1g of uridine BID for seven days will increase&#xD;
           brain GABA levels in a sample of healthy, unmedicated adult males;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Relative to placebo, an oral dose of 1g of uridine BID for seven days will increase NTP&#xD;
           levels in a sample of healthy, unmedicated adult males; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Brain GABA levels will be directly correlated to high energy phosphate levels in this&#xD;
           sample of healthy, unmedicated adult males.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on prior MRS studies by our group as well as the work of others, we hypothesize that&#xD;
      oral administration of uridine will actuate an increase in brain gamma-amino butyric acid&#xD;
      (GABA) levels, along with beta-nucleotide triphosphate (ß-NTP) levels, as compared with&#xD;
      baseline. Our aim is to investigate this specific neuropharmacological effect and to&#xD;
      demonstrate the suitability of a novel magnetic resonance spectroscopy protocol in so doing.&#xD;
      Our rationale includes the consideration that the clinical utility of an intervention&#xD;
      demonstrably effective in elevating brain GABA and high energy phosphate levels is broad,&#xD;
      since lowered GABA and bioenergetic states are associated with a plurality of affective,&#xD;
      anxiety, and substance use disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the dual basis of findings indicating GABA increases following acute and eight week&#xD;
      SSRI/dopamine agonist administration and those noting GABA-ergic effects of 14 day pyrimidine&#xD;
      administration, we hypothesize that an oral dose of 2g of uridine per day for seven days will&#xD;
      increase brain GABA levels in a sample of healthy, unmedicated adult males. We also&#xD;
      hypothesize that this 2g dose of uridine per day for 7 days will increase ß-NTP levels and,&#xD;
      further, that the increase in GABA and high energy phosphate levels will be correlated. Of&#xD;
      note, the phosphorylation of glutamic acid decarboxylase by ATP significantly increased the&#xD;
      activity of this enzyme, which is reponsable for the synthesis of GABA. This choice of time&#xD;
      period will allow a determination of time course to efficacy between the acute and extended&#xD;
      ranges, and further, because therapeutic dosage levels of uridine have yet to be established,&#xD;
      in this and future studies we hope to determine the optimal dosage at which uridine increases&#xD;
      brain GABA and ß-NTP levels.&#xD;
