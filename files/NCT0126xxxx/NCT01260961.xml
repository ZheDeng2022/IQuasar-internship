  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dr. Sherie Novotny of the Department of Psychiatry at UMDNJ-RWJMS and collaborators are&#xD;
      starting a treatment trial to determine whether Docosa Hexanoic Acid(DHA), the major omega-3&#xD;
      fatty acid found in the brain and a component of fish oil, has any effects on the symptoms of&#xD;
      autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to carry out a trial to test the effect of DHA compared to a placebo (a pill with&#xD;
      no drug in it) on several aspects of autism in children and adolescents, in a 12-week&#xD;
      clinical study with children or adolescents in the age group of 5-17 with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      Autism Spectrum Disorder. Additionally this trial will study genes related to the therapeutic&#xD;
      agent, DHA, and biomarkers related to DHA in the urine.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Growing evidence supports oxidative stress may contribute to autism. Docosa Hexanoic&#xD;
      Acid(DHA)is a normal substance that is present in large amounts in the brain and can be used&#xD;
      by the body to produce natural antioxidants. Our hope is that supplementing DHA in&#xD;
      individuals with autism may improve some aspects of their functioning. Specifically our aims&#xD;
      are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on the global severity of child and&#xD;
      adolescent autistic disorder, via a 12-week double blind placebo-controlled parallel study.&#xD;
      Global severity will be assessed by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic&#xD;
      (ADOS-G) and additionally in younger children by the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To assess the effect of DHA vs. placebo treatment on behavioral symptoms and&#xD;
      functional ability in children with autism. Assessment will be by the Aberrant Behavior&#xD;
      Checklist (ABC)-Community Version11.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. To develop an improved protocol and study design based upon these studies for future&#xD;
      large scale studies of DHA in the autistic population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4. Monitor the effects of therapy on the isoprostane biomarker. Aim 5: Develop additional&#xD;
      biomarkers that correlate with autism and with therapy. We will extend the analyses to&#xD;
      neuroprostanes and resolvins. We will measure: (i) Urinary excretion of the isoprostane&#xD;
      metabolites, 2,3 Dinor-5,6 dihydro-PGF2t and iPF4Î±-VI. (ii) DHA derived resolvins D2, D4, D5&#xD;
      and D6 and neuroprotectin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Confirm our preliminary results by correlating increased isoprostane excretion with&#xD;
      GSTM1*0 copy number in individuals with autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 7: In the same way, correlate GSTM1*0 copy number with response to therapy assessed by&#xD;
      diminution of isoprostane excretion during therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 8: Study additional biomarkers developed through Hypothesis #2 for correlation with&#xD;
      GSTM1*0 copy number and response to therapy to identify additional gene-biomarker&#xD;
      correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 9: Study additional polymorphisms of genes related to DHA metabolism, for association&#xD;
      with autism, gene-biomarker correlations, and correlation with response to therapy.&#xD;
