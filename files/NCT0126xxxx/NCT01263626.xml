      The aim of the study is to establish the accuracy of a new device designed specifically to&#xD;
      record and detect cough episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cough is an important defense mechanism of the respiratory tract. The presence of chronic&#xD;
      cough may indicate the presence of underlying diseases, including reflux. Despite the&#xD;
      increased number of patients suffering from cough in the ENT and GI practice, to date, there&#xD;
      has been no method/device to objectively assess the frequency of cough episodes in a given&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PULMOTRACK-CC, manufactured by KarmelSonix (Haifa, Israel), has recently introduced an&#xD;
      innovative device that is able to record cough episodes and then automatically detect and&#xD;
      count them with the help of a specific software program. This study will assess the accuracy&#xD;
      of this novel cough monitoring and counting technology and validate potential clinical use in&#xD;
      patients with chronic cough.&#xD;
