      Primary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare progression free survival (PFS), the time from randomization to progressive&#xD;
      disease,in children with optic pathway glioma (OPG) age ≥ 6 months to &lt; 18 years, who receive&#xD;
      combination antineoplaston therapy (ANP therapy) vs. temozolomide (TMZ); study subjects will&#xD;
      have 1) received prior treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated&#xD;
      secondary to toxicity or progression of OPG, or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after&#xD;
      completion of carboplatin or cisplatin therapy. PFS data will be censored on the date of the&#xD;
      last tumor assessment documenting absence of progression for study subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are alive, on study and are progression-free at the time of the analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who discontinue, receive no subsequent therapy and are progression-free at the time of&#xD;
           the analysis;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who are given/change therapy other than the study treatment prior to observing&#xD;
           progression;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Who discontinued (due to personal preference or toxicity) with a change in therapy,&#xD;
           withdrew, or was lost to follow-up;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For whom documentation of disease progression or death occurs after ≥ 2 consecutive&#xD;
           missed tumor assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To describe the toxicity profile for ANP therapy vs. TMZ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival (OS) for subjects treated with ANP therapy vs. TMZ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare disease stabilization rates for subjects treated with ANP therapy vs. TMZ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), and&#xD;
           progressive disease (PD) rates for subjects treated with ANP therapy vs. TMZ.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, phase 3, open-label, multicenter, protocol study in children age ≥ 6&#xD;
      months to &lt; 18 yr., with recurrent and/or progressive OPG who have 1) received prior&#xD;
      treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or&#xD;
      progression of OPG or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after completion of carboplatin or&#xD;
      cisplatin therapy. A total of 158 subjects will be enrolled and randomized equally to one of&#xD;
      two therapy groups: ANP therapy (79 subjects) or TMZ (79 subjects). If an average of 4&#xD;
      subjects is enrolled each month, enrollment will be completed in 3 years and 3 months. There&#xD;
      will be an additional three years of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children of either gender and from all racial/ethnic groups will be eligible for this&#xD;
      protocol study if they meet the criteria outlined in Section 3. Upon determination of&#xD;
      eligibility, including the obtaining of an informed consent, study subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to ANP therapy or TMZ. The randomization will be stratified by prior RT (Y/N),&#xD;
      hypothalamic involvement (Y/N) and age (&lt; 5 years / ≥ 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a group of children treated with TMZ after developing progressive and/or recurrent disease&#xD;
      following first-line chemotherapy, a 2-year PFS of 49% and a 4-year PFS of 31% was reported&#xD;
      by Gururangan and associates. Based on their results, and assuming an exponential&#xD;
      distribution, a least squares estimate of the hazard is 0.333 per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those study subjects, in the BRI Phase 2 study of ANP therapy for OPG, who 1) received&#xD;
      prior treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or&#xD;
      progression of OPG or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after completion of carboplatin (or&#xD;
      cisplatin) therapy, a least squares estimate of the hazard is 0.075 per year. Since the&#xD;
      sample size in the Phase 2 study is small and may overstate the effect of ANP therapy in&#xD;
      general use, a hazard of 0.167 per year was utilized in determining the sample size for the&#xD;
      proposed Phase 3 protocol study, giving a hazard ratio (TMZ:ANP) of 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy hypothesis of the proposed protocol study is that ANP therapy provides&#xD;
      for a significantly better PFS than does TMZ. This protocol study is event-driven (PD or&#xD;
      death from any cause), and will be completed after 90 events have occurred. The required&#xD;
      sample size in each treatment group is 79.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A log rank test of equality of survival curves, with a 0.05 two-sided significance level, has&#xD;
      90% power to detect the difference in PFS between children treated with ANP therapy vs.&#xD;
      children treated with TMZ. Assuming an accrual rate of 4 subjects per month, the accrual&#xD;
      period is 3 years and 3 months. There is an additional 3 years of follow-up. A common&#xD;
      exponential dropout rate of 0.05 per year is assumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study utilizes an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. It is event-driven (PD or death&#xD;
      from any cause), and will be completed after 90 events have occurred. All subjects are&#xD;
      evaluable for PFS from the time of randomization to the time of PD or death, regardless of&#xD;
      therapy group, eligibility, or adequacy of follow-up. All study subjects who receive at least&#xD;
      one dose of ANP therapy or TMZ are evaluable for safety.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children age ≥ 6 months &lt; 18 years are eligible if they have 1) received prior&#xD;
             treatment with carboplatin or cisplatin, which was terminated secondary to toxicity or&#xD;
             progression of OPG or 2) developed recurrence of OPG after completion of carboplatin&#xD;
             or cisplatin therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children with or without prior RT are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histological confirmation of OPG is required unless the risks of obtaining a&#xD;
             diagnostic biopsy are prohibitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Evidence of OPG (≥ 5 mm), as diagnosed by MRI of the brain, with and without&#xD;
             gadolinium contrast, within four weeks of protocol study entry is required. The MRI is&#xD;
             interpreted by two independent neuroradiologists. If there is disagreement, a third&#xD;
             independent neuroradiologist will adjudicate. Baseline MR spectroscopy (MRS) and&#xD;
             positron emission tomography (PET) scan are also performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Children who are receiving corticosteroids and, for at least one week prior to entry&#xD;
             into the protocol study have been on the lowest dose of corticosteroids that preserves&#xD;
             optimal neurologic function, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Children with a life expectancy of &gt; 6 months are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Children ≤ 14 years of age with a Lansky performance status of &gt; 60 are eligible.&#xD;
             Children &gt; 14 years of age with a Karnofsky performance status of &gt; 60 are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Children with normal organ and marrow function (as defined below) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes &gt; 2000/mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;1,500/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum NA+, K+, BUN within institutional normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;75,000/ mm3&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;3 times institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. At the recommended therapeutic dose, the effects of ANP therapy on the developing&#xD;
             human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential who agree&#xD;
             to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to protocol study entry and for the duration of protocol study are&#xD;
             eligible. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while&#xD;
             participating in this protocol study, she will inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Children who are able to understand a written informed consent document, and are&#xD;
             willing to sign it, are eligible. A subject with a parent or guardian who is able to&#xD;
             understand a written informed consent document, and who is willing to sign it on the&#xD;
             subject's behalf, is eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Children receiving prior ANP or TMZ therapy are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Children with an uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to,&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, uncontrolled hypertension (&gt; grade 2) or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness and/or social situations that would limit compliance with protocol study&#xD;
             requirements are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Children with a history of congestive heart failure, deep venous thrombosis, or other&#xD;
             cardiovascular or renal conditions that would contradict administration of high dose&#xD;
             intravenous sodium or insertion of a subclavian venous catheter are not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pregnant women are not eligible because the teratogenic and abortifacient effects of&#xD;
             ANP therapy in humans are unknown. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for&#xD;
             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to the mother receiving ANP therapy,&#xD;
             breastfeeding is discontinued if the mother receives ANP therapy.&#xD;
