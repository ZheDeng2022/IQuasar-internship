  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury has a high morbidity and mortality in both civilian and military&#xD;
      populations. Blast and other mechanisms of traumatic brain injury damage the brain by causing&#xD;
      neurons to disconnect and atrophy. Such traumatic axonal injury can lead to persistently&#xD;
      vegetative and minimally conscious states, for which extremely limited treatment options&#xD;
      exist, including physical, occupational, speech and cognitive therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 50,000 patients have received vagus nerve stimulation for epilepsy and depression.&#xD;
      In addition to decreased seizure frequency and severity, patients report enhanced mood,&#xD;
      reduced daytime sleepiness independent of seizure control, increased slow wave sleep, and&#xD;
      improved cognition, memory, and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate objective improvement in clinical outcome by&#xD;
      placement of a vagus nerve stimulator in patients who are recovering from severe traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury. Our hypothesis is that stimulation of the vagus nerve results in increased&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow and metabolism in the forebrain, thalamus and reticular formation, which&#xD;
      promotes arousal and improved consciousness, thereby improving outcome after traumatic brain&#xD;
      injury resulting in minimally conscious or persistent vegetative states. If this study&#xD;
      demonstrates that vagus nerve stimulation can safely and positively impact outcome, then a&#xD;
      larger randomized prospective crossover trial will be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will achieve this objective by evaluating whether vagus nerve stimulation&#xD;
      impacts clinical recovery from minimally conscious or persistent vegetative states caused by&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury as assessed by the FIM™ instrument and Functional Assessment Measure&#xD;
      (FIM+FAM) as well as the JFK Coma Recovery Scale Score. The investigators will also evaluate&#xD;
      whether vagus nerve stimulation alters resting and activational functional MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve patients will be enrolled in this initial crossover pilot study. These patients will&#xD;
      have sustained a severe traumatic brain injury (Disability Rating Scale score of 22 to 29)&#xD;
      more than twelve months from starting the study, and have no other concurrent active severe&#xD;
      medical problems. Baseline EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed prior&#xD;
      to left vagus nerve stimulation implantation. Patients will be randomized to alternating&#xD;
      three month periods with the device on or off. Outcomes will be assessed at three month&#xD;
      intervals with the FIM™ instrument and Functional Assessment Measure (FIM+FAM) and JFK Coma&#xD;
      Recovery Scale by a neuropsychologist blinded to the status of the device. Outcomes will also&#xD;
      be assessed using quantitative eye movement tracking and functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging. Patients will cross over every 3 months and be followed for at least 18 months.&#xD;
