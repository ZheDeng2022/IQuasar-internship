      This study is going to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of ziprasidone in 120&#xD;
      schizophrenic patients with depressive symptoms. The study will be carried out at 2 mental&#xD;
      centers in China. Subjects will be required to attend the center at screening, baseline,&#xD;
      Weeks 1, 2, 4 ,6 and 8 or early termination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, patients underwent psychiatric and physical examination, standard lab tests,&#xD;
      and an Electrocardiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, if they continued to be eligible, they began ziprasidone 20 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on response and tolerability, ziprasidone could be gradually escalated to a maximum&#xD;
      of 80 mg twice daily.&#xD;

      Primary objective The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of ziprasidone in the&#xD;
      treatment of depressive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives The secondary objective was to evaluate the efficacy and the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of ziprasidone in the treatment of schizophrenic patients with depressive&#xD;
      symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This study was going to determine the efficacy, tolerability and safety of&#xD;
      ziprasidone in 120 schizophrenic patients with depressive symptoms. The study was carried out&#xD;
      at 2 mental centers in China. Subjects were required to attend the center at screening,&#xD;
      baseline, Weeks 1, 2, 4 ,6 and 8 or early termination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At screening, patients underwent psychiatric and physical examination, standard lab tests,&#xD;
      and an Electrocardiograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, if they continued to be eligible, they began ziprasidone 20 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on response and tolerability, ziprasidone could be gradually escalated to a maximum&#xD;
      of 80 mg twice daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage/Administration&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline subjects received study drug according to the following regimen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1-2: ziprasidone 20 mg twice daily. Day 3-4: ziprasidone 40 mg twice daily. Day 5-6:&#xD;
      ziprasidone 60 mg twice daily. Day 7-Week 8: ziprasidone 40, 60 or 80 mg twice daily. At&#xD;
      visit 3 (week 1) the dosage of study drug was titrated up or down based on the clinical&#xD;
      status of the subject and the safety and tolerability of the study drug. Subjects received&#xD;
      all study drugs with food and under supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Duration It's a 8 weeks' study. There are 7 visits in this study. Visit 1 is&#xD;
      screening visit; Visit 2 is baseline visit; Visit 3 is Week 1; Visit 4 is Week 2; Visit 5 is&#xD;
      Week 4; Visit 6 is Week 6; Visit 7 is Week 8.&#xD;
