  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder complaints are very common in overhead athletes.The application of kinesiotape that&#xD;
      keeps the shoulder in a correct position is used to avoid this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This could enlarge the dynamic size of the subacromial space and thus contribute to&#xD;
      prevention of shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 young elite handball players will participate in this study.Researchers will perform a&#xD;
      number of measurements before and after applying kinesiotape to correct shoulder position:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of subacromial space&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  measurement of 3D kinematics of shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of shoulder posture&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of this study is that tape can influence the position of the scapula and is&#xD;
      therefore able to change the size of the subacromial space.This results in a more efficient&#xD;
      use of shoulder muscles with higher maximal strength as a result and maximizes shoulder&#xD;
      mobility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder complaints are very common in overhead athletes. Throwing motions question large&#xD;
      explosive strength and stability of the intrinsic instable shoulder joint. Malpositioning of&#xD;
      the scapula increases the risk of overload injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of kinesiotape that keeps the shoulder in a correct position is used to avoid&#xD;
      this. Until now no studies have shown if the tape is able to correct the position of the&#xD;
      scapula. If this is the case, the application of the tape could enlarge the dynamic size of&#xD;
      the subacromial space (virtual space in the shoulder in which rotator cuff tendons run&#xD;
      through) and thus contribute to prevention of shoulder injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Robert Van Cingel, director of the&#xD;
      Sports Medical Center Papendal(SMCP) in the Netherlands. SMCP is a multidisciplinary center&#xD;
      for sports medicine, sports rehabilitation and sports cardiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 young elite handball players will participate in this study. Three researchers will&#xD;
      perform a number of measurements before and after applying kinesiotape to correct shoulder&#xD;
      position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Measurement of the size of the subacromial space with dynamic ultrasound. Ultrasound is&#xD;
           completely harmless and painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurement of three-dimensional kinematics of the shoulder with FASTRAK. Sensors are&#xD;
           placed on the skin of the shoulder with adhesive tape. Both placement of markers and&#xD;
           measurements are non-invasive and painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessment of shoulder posture by measuring several angles and distances. Measurement of&#xD;
           shoulder strength and mobility. These measurements are all non-invasive and painless.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of this study is that tape can influence the position of the scapula and is&#xD;
      therefore able to change the size of the subacromial space. This results in a more efficient&#xD;
      use of shoulder muscles with higher maximal strength as a result and maximizes shoulder&#xD;
      mobility.&#xD;
