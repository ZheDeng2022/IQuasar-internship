    <textblock>
      Aplastic Anemia (AA) is an autoimmune hematologic stem cell disease mediated by activated&#xD;
      T-lymphocytes that leads to pancytopenia. The disease related morbidity and mortality if left&#xD;
      untreated can approach 90%. For over 30 years, anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) in combination&#xD;
      with cyclosporine (CsA) remains the standard therapy. However, the treatment response with&#xD;
      ATG is at best between 50-60% with a sizeable number of partial responses. Treatment with ATG&#xD;
      is also associated with significant toxicity and high relapse rate that can be as high as&#xD;
      45%. Since the prognosis in refractory and relapsed AA remains poor, there is a need for less&#xD;
      toxic novel immunosuppressive agents that can improve response rates and remission duration&#xD;
      in refractory and relapsed AA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alefacept is a human recombinant dimeric fusion protein composed of the terminal portion of&#xD;
      leukocyte functioning antigen-3 (LFA3/CD58) and the Fc portion of human IgG1. It prevents&#xD;
      co-stimulatory signals between antigen presenting cells and memory T cells by competitive&#xD;
      inhibition of CD2 in T cells, induces selective apoptosis of CD4+ and CD8+ memory effector T&#xD;
      cells by interaction between the Fc portion of IgG1 and the FcyIII in NK cells, and possibly&#xD;
      direct ligation of CD2 molecules on T cells that subsequently result in the alteration in T&#xD;
      cell agonist signaling. It has been used successfully in the treatment of other T cell&#xD;
      mediated disorders particularly psoriasis and steroid refractory graft versus host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD) with minimal side effects. In a case of liver transplant associated AA (similar to&#xD;
      transfusion associated AA) which is fatal in most patients, Alefacept induced remission after&#xD;
      patient did not respond to ATG and other immunosuppressants. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that the LFA3-CD2 co-stimulatory pathway play an important role in the immune pathogenesis of&#xD;
      AA and treatment with Alefacept can help treat refractory/relapsed cases of AA.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To define the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), of alefacept in&#xD;
                relapsed/ refractory aplastic anemia (AA).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate the efficacy of alefacept in refractory/ relapsed AA by determining&#xD;
                overall response rates (ORR) which includes complete remission [CR] and partial&#xD;
                remission (PR) rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  To evaluate for predictive markers for response to Alefacept with relapsed/&#xD;
                refractory AA and evaluate its effect on the PNH clone. The effects of alefacept in&#xD;
                major populations of lymphocytes will be evaluated. The absolute numbers of various&#xD;
                T cell populations including CD3+ T cell, CD3+/CD4+ T cell, CD3+/CD8+, CD57+&#xD;
                natural killer cell count and CD4/CD8 ratio will be measured as part of an&#xD;
                immunodeficiency panel by flow cytometry. The functional properties of T cells will&#xD;
                be evaluated by measuring markers of T cell activation and cytokine production. The&#xD;
                saturation of CD2 receptors with alefacept will be determined. Occupied CD2 will&#xD;
                not be detectable by competing antibody in-vitro. The expression of CD2 within&#xD;
                lymphocytes will be measured prior to the initiation of therapy and every 2 weeks&#xD;
                prior to and 30 minutes after the administration of alefacept. The presence of a&#xD;
                Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria (PNH) clone in patients with AA has been shown&#xD;
                to correlate with increased response to immunosuppression25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single center study. Patients will receive intravenous&#xD;
      Alefacept once weekly for a total of 12 weeks in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of the 12 week treatment, patients will go through a&#xD;
      12 week observation period. After completion of the study, patients will be followed&#xD;
      periodically. The dose defined in the Phase 1 study will be used for the subsequent Phase 2&#xD;
      study. Four bone marrow biopsies will be taken at screening, week 13, week 24, and the end of&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
