  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to determine whether TH9507, a stabilized analogue of growth&#xD;
      hormone-releasing factor (GRF), would have an effect on insulin sensitivity or control of&#xD;
      diabetes in patients with type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

             Association;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months before screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects on stable diabetes treatment regimens (receiving oral hypoglycemics with or&#xD;
             without insulin) for at least 2 months before screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening and pre-randomization glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) &lt;10.0%, according to&#xD;

             all study protocol requirements;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serum creatinine &gt;2 mg/dL;&#xD;
&#xD;

             examination for cancer (if male);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of oral or parenteral glucocorticoids in the 30 days before screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of any experimental or marketed growth hormone, growth hormone secretagogues,&#xD;

             past 6 months. Similarly, during the lead-in period, any subject with more than one&#xD;
             severe hypoglycemic episode or any hospitalization or emergency room visit due to poor&#xD;
             glycemic control will be excluded from randomization;&#xD;
