  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Median sternotomy has been the standard incision for coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG)&#xD;
      in patients undergoing surgery for coronary artery disease. Given the increasing risk profile&#xD;
      of contemporary cardiac surgery patients, sternal complications are subject to increase&#xD;
      concomitantly. Despite advances in many areas of cardiac surgical procedures, innovation in&#xD;
      sternal closure technique has been lacking and postoperative complications remain. In this&#xD;
      study, the investigators aim to assess the effectiveness of using a novel osteoconductive&#xD;
      biologic bone cement (KryptoniteTM, Doctors Research Group Inc.) as an adjunct to&#xD;
      conventional sternal closure in post CABG patients having median sternotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of interest for this study will include: pain, discomfort, lung function, wound&#xD;
      healing and analgesic use. The investigators assume that the use of KryptoniteTM will&#xD;
      decrease postoperative pain leading to improvement in postoperative lung function. This may&#xD;
      also lead to improvement in patient recovery and decrease in postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will undertake a single-blinded randomized, controlled study consisting of&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either Group A (usual closure with stainless steel wires) or Group B (usual closure with&#xD;
      stainless steel wires plus application of bone cement). Each group will consist of 64&#xD;
      patients in a total of 128 patients. Lung function data using a spirometer will be collected&#xD;
      preoperatively and 3rd and 5th postoperative days as well as in outpatient clinic. Pain data&#xD;
      will be collected on the 1st to 5th postoperative days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Procedure Research assistants will be dedicated to participant recruitment, data collection,&#xD;
      and assessment of sternal wounds. Upon admission, or scheduling for surgery, consecutive CABG&#xD;
      surgery patients who will have median sternotomy will be approached by a research assistant&#xD;
      for preoperative screening (to determine eligibility for the study). Thereafter, informed&#xD;
      consent will be sought to examine their recovery for a period of approximately 16&#xD;
      post-operative weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When undertaking the clinical trial, randomization of the participants will be achieved using&#xD;
      an opaque envelope. Envelopes will be kept at the operation theatre and will be opened by a&#xD;
      nurse or the surgeon prior to surgery. This envelope will also contain a data collection form&#xD;
      to be completed by the surgeons (regarding bone quality, sternotomy, and number of sternal&#xD;
      wires).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, blinded research assistants will collect pain data from the participants&#xD;
      on the 1st to 5th postoperative days. These will be measured using a 10-point numeric rating&#xD;
      scale. The scales will be anchored with descriptors 0=none, 10=worst. These data will be&#xD;
      collected at rest and after coughing. Lung function data (FEV1.0, FVC) will be collected&#xD;
      using a bedside spirometer on the 3rd and 5th postoperative days. Other relevant clinical&#xD;
      data (e.g., age, grafts used for and nature of surgery, analgesic use, other complications,&#xD;
      length of stay) will be collected through a health record audit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participants are discharged, data collection will be done when they return to the&#xD;
      clinic for follow-ups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Outcomes Other outcomes that will be monitored will include: postoperative death&#xD;
      within 6 weeks, abnormal prolongation in wound healing, length of ICU stay, length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, postoperative pleural effusion, necessity to evacuate effusion, atelectasis,&#xD;
      pneumonia, reoperation requiring sternal reentry, sternal dehiscence, wound infection&#xD;
      (superficial or deep), mediastinitis, amount of analgesia, and all other causes of morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size There is not much information prior to this study. It has been assumed that the&#xD;
      mean differences for the changes in FEV1.0, FVC and pains score at 5 days after surgery&#xD;
      between bone cement and control groups to be 15% and the standard deviation to be 25%&#xD;
      respectively. With these assumptions, a two-sided test, overall level of significance at 5%&#xD;
      and power of 80%, the number of patients that is needed to be enrolled in this study is 64&#xD;
      patients per group after accounting that there will be 1% chance that the patient may have&#xD;
      some major postoperative complication that will prevent the patient from being extubated at 5&#xD;
      days after surgery. The total number of patients that need to be recruited in this study is&#xD;
      128 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Participants will be recruited and in-hospital data collected by research&#xD;
      assistants hired for this study. Staff nurses in the wards will also collect in-hospital&#xD;
      data. They will be trained to use the study questionnaires and measures. Once patients are&#xD;
      discharged from the hospital, the assistants will also follow-up in the outpatient clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis For this study, the investigators wish to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      KryptoniteTM on pain, and change in postoperative lung function using spirometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the investigators are interested in the outcomes over time, the effectiveness of the&#xD;
      intervention during the acute period postoperatively as well as 6 postoperative week will be&#xD;
      of greatest interest. In order to investigate the difference in the percentage change in&#xD;
      FEV1.0, FVC and pain score at 5 days after surgery between bone cement and control groups, 2&#xD;
      sample t-test will be carried out respectively if normality and homogeneity of variance&#xD;
      assumptions are met; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used respectively. The&#xD;
      association between postoperative death in the early period and surgery type group (bone&#xD;
      cement or control group) will be evaluated using Chi-Square test if the assumptions for the&#xD;
      Chi-Square test are met; otherwise, Fisher's Exact test will be carried out. Other outcomes&#xD;
      that are monitored will be summarized by the surgery type group using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      All the analyses will be performed using PASW Statistics 18 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety, particularly related to sternal union and wound healing, are of major importance in&#xD;
      this study. In particular, sternal union will be monitored for all patients by visual&#xD;
      inspection. All participants will undergo a visual inspection and palpation of their sternum,&#xD;
      by the team doctors and nurses, regularly throughout the course of this study. Should any&#xD;
      concerns arise with the sternum or wound healing, a digital photograph of the sternum (using&#xD;
      appropriate draping for patient privacy) may be taken, and referred to his/her consultant&#xD;
      surgeon in charge. The photographs will be used to assist in documenting the healing&#xD;
      processes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN ISSUES There are a number of important issues that are related to blinding, design and&#xD;
      co-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addressing Issues of Observer Blinding l All those collecting data will be trained rigorously&#xD;
      in the standardized study procedures and use of the questionnaires and measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      l The nature of some of the data to be collected is only the patient's opinion/response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      l A manual of operations will be developed for research associates' use and assistance with&#xD;
      any question/concerns will be available by telephone at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      l Although double blinding is desirable in clinical trial designs to minimize/eliminate&#xD;
      observation bias, it is not possible to blind the surgeon. The data collection members will&#xD;
      be kept blinded regarding the grouping of the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addressing Issues of Participant Blinding l The outcome measures for this study are&#xD;
      participative in nature, particularly as compared to those often used in clinical trials&#xD;
      research (e.g., mortality/morbidity). Yet, these outcome data are highly relevant to&#xD;
      determining the effectiveness of using a sternal closure technique such as this, in this&#xD;
      particular population. As stated in the project objectives, it is one of our goals to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of the intervention on pain and discomfort; both of which are important&#xD;
      to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      l A 'placebo' is neither achievable nor feasible. Surgeons involved in participant's care&#xD;
      will not divulge the group to which the participant was assigned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL/SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conduct of this study will conform to the standards of DSRB. Data management will be&#xD;
      undertaken using DSRB standards for maintaining patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEASIBILITY Cardiac surgeons at National University Hospital will offer the intervention for&#xD;
      this study. The investigators anticipate it will take approximately 12 months to recruit the&#xD;
      study sample and 4 months thereafter to complete data collection.&#xD;
