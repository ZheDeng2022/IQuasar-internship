  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of safinamide, an investigational drug for Parkinson disease (PD). Safinamide&#xD;
      is being developed as add-on therapy for the treatment of Parkinson disease. It is theorized&#xD;
      that safinamide acts by increasing the available dopamine in those areas of the brain where&#xD;
      dopamine is decreased as a result of Parkinson;s Disease. . Dopamine in the brain is involved&#xD;
      in controlling body movements. Safinamide has been extensively studied in animals, and has&#xD;
      been shown to increase the level of dopamine in these animals. Safinamide has also been&#xD;
      tested in patients with Parkinson disease. The goal of this research trial is to see if&#xD;
      safinamide is safe and well tolerated and to better understand how it affects the dopamine&#xD;
      system in the brain in individuals with Parkinson disease. Data from this trial may provide&#xD;
      essential information about the effectiveness and safety of these doses of safinamide in&#xD;
      patients with early Parkinson disease, who are already receiving a stable dose of their&#xD;
      normal Parkinson disease treatment.&#xD;

    The Dopamine transporter brain imaging trial is terminated due to a company decision to return&#xD;
