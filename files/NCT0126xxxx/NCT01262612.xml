      In some patients with cancer there are also cancer cells in the abdominal cavity or between&#xD;
      the lung membranes. These cancer cells create too much moisture in the abdominal cavity or&#xD;
      between the lung membranes. If there is fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites fluid) this&#xD;
      can bring on abdominal distension, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, fatigue, bloating and&#xD;
      sometimes wheezing. Too much fluid between the lung membranes (we call this pleural fluid)&#xD;
      gives breathlessness, chest pain and coughing. The use of diuretics may offer a small group&#xD;
      of patients symptom reduction. Additionally, the fluid can be drained through a needle&#xD;
      puncture or fluid collection (through a biopsy). But usually, the moisture quickly returns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research done in this hospital with cediranib showed that with some patients with&#xD;
      cancer who suffered from fluid in the abdominal cavity or between the lung membranes, this&#xD;
      moisture reduces while using this drug. It also reduced the symptoms caused by this excessive&#xD;
      moisture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study is conducted to see whether patients with cancer and fluid in the abdominal&#xD;
      cavity or fluid between the lung blades benefit from using cediranib. This involves not only&#xD;
      whether the amount moisture reduces, but also if the complains decrease. In addition, we will&#xD;
      carefully consider the possible side effects of cediranib.&#xD;

      Malignant ascites is a difficult clinical problem. Increasing intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
      resulting from fluid accumulation may cause anorexia, sleep disturbance, pain, dyspnoea,&#xD;
      abdominal distension, fatigue, nausea vomiting and reduced mobility. The main complaints of&#xD;
      pleural effusion are dyspnoea and cough. Paracentesis and thoracentesis provide relief for a&#xD;
      very limited period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have shown high concentrations of VEGF in malignant ascites and pleural effusion.&#xD;
      Beneficial effects of treatment with an intravenous or intraperitoneal antibody against VEGF&#xD;
      on malignant ascites have been reported. In the recent past we have treated two patients with&#xD;
      symptomatic malignant ascites (colorectal cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively) in a phase&#xD;
      I study with cediranib. Shortly after start of cediranib, within a couple of days, the&#xD;
      ascites disappeared. However, after stopping cediranib for progressive disease on other sites&#xD;
      the ascites reappeared within days. Therefore, one of those patients was treated with&#xD;
      cediranib as palliative treatment until two days before his death, which was beneficial for&#xD;
      this patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this phase II study we would like to investigate the effects of treatment with cediranib&#xD;
      as palliative treatment on malignant ascites or pleural effusion.&#xD;
