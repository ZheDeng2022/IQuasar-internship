  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Desmoid-type fibromatosis (or desmoid tumor) represents an intermediate grade neoplasm with a&#xD;
      striking predilection for locally invasive growth and recurrence following resection. It&#xD;
      occurs in children as well as young adults. As a typically localized disease, the historical&#xD;
      standard of care for treatment has been surgical resection, with or without ionizing&#xD;
      radiation. In some cases where surgical resection or radiation is not feasible, chemotherapy&#xD;
      has been used. Two clinical trials conducted in the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) and the&#xD;
      Children's Oncology Group (COG) evaluated the role for either low intensity or non-cytotoxic&#xD;
      chemotherapy for children with desmoid tumor that is not amenable to standard therapy. These&#xD;
      were largely empirical treatment strategies or based on somewhat anecdotal observations. By&#xD;
      better understanding desmoid tumor biology, even more effective therapy targeting a&#xD;
      particular protein that is central to the disease can be developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desmoid tumor is well-known to be associated with deregulation of the Adenomatous Polyposis&#xD;
      Cell/beta-catenin (APC/β-catenin pathway). This is true of familial cases associated with&#xD;
      Gardner's Syndrome and also in sporadic desmoid tumor, nearly all of which display&#xD;
      histological or molecular evidence of Adenomatous Polyposis Cell/beta-catenin (APC β-catenin)&#xD;
      pathway activation (Alman et al., 1997; Lips et al., 2009). Several new pieces of evidence&#xD;
      support the concept that deregulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) cell&#xD;
      proliferation/survival pathway may play an important role in tumor biology when the&#xD;
      APC/β-catenin pathway is disrupted. Sirolimus, a drug that inhibits mammalian target of&#xD;
      rapamycin (mTOR), is currently being evaluated as an anti-cancer agent in a variety of tumor&#xD;
      types, but it has not been previously studied in desmoid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting this pilot study to begin to explore whether mTOR inhibition&#xD;
      may be beneficial for children and young adults with desmoid tumor.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a translational research project that will directly test the hypothesis that mTOR&#xD;
      is active in desmoid tumor in children and young adults. Activity will be assessed by&#xD;
      clinical and histological studies following a course of pre-operative chemotherapy using&#xD;
      sirolimus. Clinical response will be measured using validated pain assessment scales because&#xD;
      desmoid tumor size is unlikely to change during the course of pre-operative chemotherapy in&#xD;
      this study. Histological response will be based on quantifying the phosphorylation of&#xD;
      following mTOR targets: thr389p-p70S6K, p-4E-BP1, and ser473p-AKT.&#xD;
