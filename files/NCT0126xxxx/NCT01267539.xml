      A prospective follow-up study was carried out in the Yang Ming branch of the Taipei City&#xD;
      Hospital between April 2008 and April 2010. Sixty-seven climacteric women with sleep&#xD;
      difficulty received SZRT at a rate of 4.0 g, thrice daily for four weeks. Baseline scores&#xD;
      were measured on the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), followed by further measures at&#xD;
      the end of weeks one and four. The World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)&#xD;
      assessment and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) were undertaken as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
      Regression models were constructed to explore the score differences between the baseline and&#xD;
      at weeks one and four by various determinants including age, body mass index (BMI), and&#xD;
      severity of baseline menopausal symptoms. Among 99 surveyed patients, 67 and 61 were screened&#xD;
      for intention to treat (ITT) and per-protocol population set analysis, respectively.&#xD;
      Statistically significant reductions in the PSQI index scores evidenced on the fourth week.&#xD;
