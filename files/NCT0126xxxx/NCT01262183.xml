  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For esophageal cancer that can not be removed by surgery, the choice of treatment is a&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We call this combination- (or concurrent)&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Chemotherapy is treatment with drugs that kill cancer cells. Both&#xD;
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy make the tumour smaller and enhance each other's effect. The&#xD;
      goal of treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy is to cure the cancer.&#xD;
      Unfortunately only a small proportion of patients are cured with this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improvements in the outcome of treatment may be expected by using the so-called &quot;targeted&quot;&#xD;
      treatments. With esophageal cancer, a protein (the epidermal growth factor receptor (this is&#xD;
      a kind of trap), the EGFR), is present in many tumours. This protein causes the tumor to&#xD;
      grow. Panitumumab is a drug that blocks the functioning of this receptor (catcher), so that&#xD;
      possibly the growth and spread of esophageal cancer is prevented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this trial is to see if survival of patients with inoperable esophageal&#xD;
      cancer improves as panitumumab is added to standard treatment with chemoradiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will also investigate whether patients tolerate the addition of panitumumab to the&#xD;
      standard treatment. Also, the biological characteristics of the tumor will be examined. In a&#xD;
      proportion of patients it will be determined how the enhancement of the cancer is visible on&#xD;
      an FDG-PET scan before the start of treatment and how this changes during the treatment. It&#xD;
      will be also be evaluated how this treatment affects the survival.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A complete response rate of approximately 30% is achieved for standard treatment of&#xD;
      irresectable carcinoma of the oesophagus, consisting of concurrent chemoradiation therapy&#xD;
      (50.5 Gy + cisplatin/5-FU). Attempts to improve outcome by intensifying conventional&#xD;
      cytotoxic drugs or increasing the radiation dose have not been successful. Future&#xD;
      improvements will likely require the incorporation of targeted agents that probably will not&#xD;
      add significant toxicity, the use of molecular predictors of response and early&#xD;
      identification of responders. In both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      oesophagus expression of EGFR is correlated with poor outcome. Furthermore the addition of&#xD;
      cetuximab, a chimaeric EGFR antibody, to radiation therapy in head and neck cancer and&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer showed a gain in overall survival. In head and neck cancer studies&#xD;
      with the addition of panitumumab to chemo-radiation therapy are currently ongoing. Therefore,&#xD;
      we propose to perform a randomised phase II study of chemo-radiation therapy with or without&#xD;
      the combination of panitumumab (human EGFR antibody) in irresectable squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      or adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus without distant metastases.&#xD;
