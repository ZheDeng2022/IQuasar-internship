      Menorrhagia is the term used to define excessive menstrual blood losses, as often based on a&#xD;
      subjective judgment of women. Many arbitrary values, expressed in milliliters of blood, have&#xD;
      been proposed to define this symptom: 60 on each cycle has also been confirmed in our&#xD;
      preliminary study on 87 healthy women. The quantitative determination of menstrual blood&#xD;
      losses is nevertheless rarely performed, only in research settings. Although menorrhagia is a&#xD;
      quite frequent symptom in healthy women apparently haemostatically competent in the fertile&#xD;
      age (20-30%), its incidence becomes very high in women affected by congenital coagulation&#xD;
      factors deficiency and (50-62.9%) inherited platelet defects, e.g. Glanzmann's&#xD;
      Thromboasthenia (GT); also in von Willebrand Disease the bleeding symptom &quot;menorrhagia&quot; has&#xD;
      an high prevalence (60-75%)(8); for GT an incidence of 90% has been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This explains the need for a study focused on the evaluation of menorrhagia in CBDs,&#xD;
      addressed to answer to the following, still unsolved questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definition of the entity of menstrual blood losses in women affected by CBDs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Elaboration of specific treatment schedules for each type of CBD&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Impact of different specific treatment schedules on kinetic and entity of menstrual&#xD;
           losses (how does treatment modify losses?).&#xD;

      The following is a multicentric, observational, cross-over study intended to apply an easy&#xD;
      and simple system for the quantitative determination of menstrual losses in women affected by&#xD;
      Congenital Bleeding Disorders (CBDs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of menstrual losses represents a scarcely studied field in this specific&#xD;
      subset of patients (1), but it is very interesting because of the high incidence of&#xD;
      menorrhagia,changeable according to each type of CBDs, but between 60 and 100% in women in&#xD;
      the fertile age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The system adopted for the determination of menstrual losses, called QUEM (QUantitative&#xD;
      Evaluation of Menses),is based on the collection of tampons and pads in standard bags which&#xD;
      are readily vacuum sealed with a simple device for the whole of woman's period. QUEM has&#xD;
      already been validated in preliminary in vitro and ex vivo studies (both in 87 healthy women&#xD;
      and in women with CBDs), by comparing it with the gold standard, the Alkaline Haematin&#xD;
      Method. A correlation coefficient close to 1 was obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study QUEM will be applied to women in the fertile age (between 18 e 45&#xD;
      years),with an ascertained diagnosis of CBD (FVII, FX, FII deficiencies, Glanzmann and von&#xD;
      Willebrand disease, symptomatic Hemophilia A and B carriers), followed up for heavy periods&#xD;
      at their reference hemophilia centre and needing a specific treatment will be enrolled in&#xD;
      this multicentric study. Also women with apparently normal menses but a severe bleeding&#xD;
      disorder will be enrolled. Women with ascertained menorrhagia will be treated with specific&#xD;
      replacement therapies, already commonly adopted in clinical practice based on the type of CBD&#xD;
      and scheduled to reduce heavy periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate 4 consecutive menstrual cycles, the first and the second period&#xD;
      without treatment (when possible) and the following two by the administration of the specific&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bleeding anamnesis (bleeding score) will be performed by applying an international&#xD;
      reference method, already validated in von Willebrand Disease type 1 (vWD1) [2] and adopted&#xD;
      in an Italian multicentric study on 814 patients affected by different types of VWD [3]. The&#xD;
      determination of this score has been considered useful also for other CBDs. This study has&#xD;
      already been approved by the IRC of &quot;San Salvatore Hospital&quot;- L'Aquila-Italy. The study is&#xD;
      already enrolling, in Italy, women. All the needed materials and equipments will be provided;&#xD;
      patients will be carefully informed about the objectives of the study and they will follow a&#xD;
      short course illustrating the use and the characteristics of the method proposed (QUEM).&#xD;
