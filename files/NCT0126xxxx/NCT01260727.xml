    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of and immune response to an HIV vaccine,&#xD;
      administered using two different devices, followed by a vaccine boost, in healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in treatment, HIV/AIDS rates remain high in low- and middle-income countries&#xD;
      in resource-limited areas of the world. Preventive HIV vaccines would be an effective way to&#xD;
      decrease the spread of HIV/AIDS. This study will evaluate an experimental HIV preventive&#xD;
      vaccine followed by booster: the PENNVAX-G DNA vaccine and the Modified Vaccinia&#xD;
      Ankara-Chiang Mai Double Recombinant (MVA-CMDR) booster vaccine. The MVA virus is a mild form&#xD;
      of a vaccinia virus that is used in smallpox vaccines and does not cause smallpox infection.&#xD;
      It has been safely used in vaccines for many years. Study researchers will examine if the&#xD;
      combination of the two vaccines will provide an effective way for the body to build a defense&#xD;
      against HIV. The PENNVAX-G vaccine will be administered to participants using one of two&#xD;
      devices-the Biojector 2000 needleless device or the CELLECTRA intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      electroporation (EP) device-to evaluate how the immune response to the vaccine changes based&#xD;
      on the device that is used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the PENNVAX-G vaccine, administered by either Biojector 2000 injection or&#xD;
      CELLECTRA EP, followed by an MVA-CMDR vaccine boost, in healthy, HIV-uninfected adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in two parts. Participants in the first part of the study will&#xD;
      attend a baseline study visit, and they will undergo blood and urine collection, a medical&#xD;
      history review, physical examination, and HIV testing counseling. All participants will&#xD;
      receive the PENNVAX-G vaccine at baseline and Day 28. They will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive the vaccine by either the Bioinjector 2000 needleless device or the CELLECTRA IM EP&#xD;
      device. On Days 84 and 168, all participants will receive the MVA-CMDR vaccine by IM&#xD;
      injection delivered via needle and syringe. Participants will remain in the clinic for 1 hour&#xD;
      after each vaccination for observation and vital sign monitoring, and they will record their&#xD;
      temperatures and any symptoms in a diary for 7 days after each vaccination. Study staff will&#xD;
      contact participants 1 to 2 days after each vaccination for follow-up monitoring. In addition&#xD;
      to the vaccination study visits, participants will attend study visits at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5,&#xD;
      6, 13, 14, 25, 26, 37, 50, and 52 and will repeat the baseline study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the first part of the study, participants' study data will be reviewed&#xD;
      and the safety of the vaccine regimen will be determined. If the regimen is found to be safe,&#xD;
      then the second part of the study will begin. Participants in the second part of the study&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned to receive the PENNVAX-G vaccine administered by either the&#xD;
      Bioinjector 2000 device or the CELLECTRA EP device at baseline and Day 28, followed by the&#xD;
      MVA-CDMR boost at Days 84 and 168, or they will receive placebo PENNVAX-G vaccine&#xD;
      administered by either the Bioinjector 2000 device or the CELLECTRA EP device at baseline and&#xD;
      Day 28, followed by a placebo MVA-CDMR boost at Days 84 and 168. All study visits and&#xD;
      procedures that occurred during the first part of the study will also take place in the&#xD;
      second part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the second part of the study will have the option of enrolling in a substudy.&#xD;
      The purpose of the substudy is to evaluate the antibody response of the reproductive tract&#xD;
      mucosa to the PENNVAX-G DNA, MVA-CDMR, and placebo vaccines administered in the main part of&#xD;
      study. The substudy will also evaluate the effectiveness of using the Instead Softcup as a&#xD;
      collection method to collect vaginal secretions for testing. Mucosal specimens and urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected from participants at the screening visit and during the Week 2, 6,&#xD;
      14, 26, and 50 study visits.&#xD;
