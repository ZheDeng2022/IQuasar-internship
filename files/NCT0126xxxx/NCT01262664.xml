    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of&#xD;
      PROHIBITIN-TP01 that can be given to patients with advanced prostate cancer for which there&#xD;
      are no standard therapy options. The safety of this drug will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROHIBITIN-TP01 is designed to destroy &quot;white fat&quot; (the type of fat that collects around the&#xD;
      stomach and is associated with obesity in men). Fat is known to produce substances that can&#xD;
      promote prostate cancer growth. Investigators want to learn if decreasing fat can slow the&#xD;
      growth of prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study using PROHIBITIN-TP01 in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of PROHIBITIN-TP01 based on when you join this study. Up to 5 dose levels of&#xD;
      PROHIBITIN-TP01 will be tested. Three (3) participants will be enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of PROHIBITIN-TP01 is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive PROHIBITIN-TP01 as an injection under the skin 1 time each day for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1, 8, 15 and 22:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. You will be required to fast&#xD;
           for about 8 hours before this blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any symptoms or side effects you may have had since your last&#xD;
           visit and about any other drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour,&#xD;
           and 4 hours after you receive the Day 1 and Day 22 dose of PROHIBITIN-TP01.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG either right before or within 4 hours after you receive the study&#xD;
           drug (Days 1, 15, and 22 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive the study drug for up to 28 days. You will no longer be able to receive the&#xD;
      study drug if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 7 days after you stop receiving the study drug, the following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight, as well as&#xD;
           measurements of your waist and hips.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This testing will also&#xD;
           include a measurement of your PSA, testosterone, cholesterol, and other research tests&#xD;
           that may show how the study drug affected you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about symptoms or any side effects you have had since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have CT or MRI scans and a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty (30) days after you stop receiving the study drug, the following procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 teaspoons - in addition to that listed above) will be collected to learn&#xD;
           if your immune system reacts to PROHIBITIN-TP01 by forming antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about symptoms or any side effects you have had since your last visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be contacted by phone or e-mail every 3 months for 1 year and asked about your&#xD;
      kidney function, current weight, prostate cancer status, and any side effects you may have&#xD;
      had. Each phone call will last up to 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. PROHIBITIN-TP01 is not FDA approved or commercially&#xD;
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 39 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have histologically confirmed carcinoma of the prostate that is metastatic or&#xD;
             otherwise incurable, and a BMI defined as obese (i.e. &gt;30 kg/m2). Any histologic&#xD;
             variant is acceptable other than small cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have been on androgen deprivation therapy for a minimum of 6 months, and continue that&#xD;

             for therapy. Prior to registration on the study, patients with CRPC must be at least 3&#xD;
             weeks from their last treatment, such as ketoconazole, abiraterone, low-dose&#xD;
             dexamethasone, anti-androgens, or cytotoxic therapy, (excluding ongoing therapy to&#xD;
             suppress testosterone, which must also be continued during this trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Have an ECOG performance status 0, 1 or 2&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Have adequate bone marrow function defined as an absolute peripheral granulocyte count&#xD;

             (without transfusion or growth factor support)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Have adequate hepatic function defined as a total bilirubin of &lt;/= 1.5 mg/dl and AST&#xD;
             &lt;/= 2x the upper limits of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have adequate renal function defined as serum creatinine &lt;/= 1.5x the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal or creatinine clearance &gt;/= 60 mL/min (measured or calculated). In addition,&#xD;
             patients must have a 24 hr urine collection showing less than 2000 mg of protein.&#xD;
             EXCEPTION: Patients with hematuria will be eligible with up to 3000 mg protein per 24&#xD;
             hours provided they do not have casts, eosinophiluria or electrolyte wasting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have adequate cardiovascular function as defined by: i) a normal B-type Natruetic&#xD;
             Peptide (BNP) with ii) no signs or symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease and iii) a&#xD;
             normal ECG. If these criteria are not met, patients must have an echocardiogram or&#xD;
             multigated cardiac scan (MUGA) showing an EF of 45% or greater with no more than&#xD;
             &quot;mild&quot; diastolic dysfunction and a BNP of &lt; 200 pg/mL to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Sign the current IRB approved informed consent indicating that they are aware of the&#xD;
             investigational nature of this study, in keeping with the policies of the institution&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Small cell prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Infectious process, which, in the opinion of the investigator, could worsen or its&#xD;
             outcome be affected, as a result of the investigational therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any of the following in previous 6 months: NYHA Class III/IV congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina, cerebrovascular accident (including transient ischemic attack),&#xD;
             pulmonary embolism or myocardial infarction (by ECG or serologic criteria)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Significant co-morbidity that could affect the safety or evaluability of participants,&#xD;
             specifically including: i) Chronically uncontrolled hypertension, defined&#xD;
             conventionally as consistent systolic pressures above 140 or diastolic pressures above&#xD;
             90 despite therapy. Note that this may be better established with home BP readings&#xD;
             than with clinic visit results. Note further that this is NOT a criterion related to&#xD;
             particular BP results at the time of assessment for eligibility, nor does it apply to&#xD;
             acute BP excursions that are related to iatrogenic causes, acute pain or other&#xD;
             transient, reversible causes. The intent is to exclude patients that may have&#xD;
             unrecognized renal damage from chronic, uncontrolled hypertension, NOT to exclude&#xD;
             patients who may be hypertensive acutely. There are no absolute criteria for BP&#xD;
             readings with respect to eligibility (as determined by treating physician).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ( # 9 cont'd) (ii) Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, defined as: Hgb A1c &gt;8.5%; or&#xD;
             symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes &gt; 1 per week during the two months prior to&#xD;
             eligibility evaluation; or more than 1 glucose excursion to &gt;300 mg/dL in prior two&#xD;
             months--unless clearly iatrogenic and the cause has been eliminated iii) Lung disease&#xD;
             requiring supplemental oxygen iv) Known chronic liver disease causing either fibrosis&#xD;
             or synthetic dysfunction v) Known HIV infection vi) Overt psychosis, mental disability&#xD;
             or being otherwise incompetent to grant informed consent or a history of&#xD;
             non-compliance with medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Hydronephrosis (either bilateral or involving a solitary kidney) that has not been&#xD;
             addressed by means of a nephrostomy or indwelling stent. EXCEPTION: Non-obstructive&#xD;
             hydronephrosis in setting of prior urinary diversion is consistent with eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients require ongoing therapy with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),&#xD;
             i.v. vancomycin, aminoglycosides, or other potently nephrotoxic drugs, and must agree&#xD;
             to abstain from NSAIDs from the time the consent is signed up until 30 days after the&#xD;
             last dose of study drug is received, other than low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day or less).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Any other medical condition that in the opinion of the principal investigator would&#xD;
             compromise the ability to deliver or evaluate study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unwillingness to maintain adequate contraception measures for the entire course of the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
