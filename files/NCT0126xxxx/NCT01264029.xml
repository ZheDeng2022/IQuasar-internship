      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  New weight-loss intervention programs are being studied to determine their effectiveness&#xD;
           in helping overweight and obese individuals reach a healthy weight. However, these&#xD;
           programs often have not been tested against each other, and researchers are interested&#xD;
           in determining which interventions are most effective both immediately and over the long&#xD;
           term in promoting and maintaining weight loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mindful Tai Chi is a combined form of the meditative martial art tai chi and the&#xD;
           practice of mindfulness meditation. Tai chi and mindfulness meditation both have common&#xD;
           philosophical underpinnings that address health promotion and well-being by applying the&#xD;
           skill of non-judgmental awareness on a moment-to-moment daily basis. More research is&#xD;
           needed on whether Mindful Tai Chi and mindfulness meditation can help improve various&#xD;
           health factors in overweight and obese individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the effects of Mindful Tai Chi, mindfulness meditation, walking, or a discussion&#xD;
      group on the weight and well being of overweight and obese participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals at least 18 years of age who are either overweight or obese (body mass&#xD;
      index between 25 and 40), have a sedentary lifestyle (have not engaged in more than 1 hour of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise per week within the last month), and are willing to commit to a specific&#xD;
      weight-loss intervention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study involves four visits for collecting information and 12 weeks of research&#xD;
           study activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the first visit, participants will hear information about the study and may ask&#xD;
           any questions. They will be screened with a medical history and physical examination,&#xD;
           and those eligible will be assigned to one of the four study groups: Mindful Tai Chi&#xD;
           (MTC), Mindfulness Meditation (MM), Mall Walking (MW), or Weekly Discussion (WD) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the second visit, participants will give blood and urine samples, receive an&#xD;
           abdominal ultrasound, ride a stationary bicycle for 5 minutes, and fill out&#xD;
           health-related questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 12 weeks, participants will be involved in the following activities depending on&#xD;
           their group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MTC: Class for 2 hours per week, emphasizing the meditation aspects of tai chi. Each&#xD;
           session will include at least 20 minutes of meditation. Participants will receive&#xD;
           written instructions and an accompanying DVD in comparable formats specifying a minimum&#xD;
           of 30 minutes of daily home assignment. In weeks 2 and 8, participants will have a&#xD;
           workshop for mindfulness skill application in daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MM: Class for 2 hours per week of mindfulness meditation. Participants will receive&#xD;
           written instructions and an accompanying DVD in comparable formats specifying a minimum&#xD;
           of 30 minutes of daily home assignment. In weeks 2 and 8, participants will have a&#xD;
           workshop for mindfulness skill application in daily activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MW: Participants will meet at a designated mall location once a week for 2-hour walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WD: Participants will meet at the National Institutes of Health for weekly weight-loss&#xD;
           discussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the third and fourth visits, participants will receive the same procedures as those&#xD;
           used in the second visit. These visits will occur at the end of the 12-week activity&#xD;
           period and at a 3-month follow up visit.&#xD;

      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to pilot test the efficacy of a Mindful Tai Chi&#xD;
      (MTC) intervention as an integrative approach to facilitate durable weight loss and&#xD;
      well-being among sedentary obese and overweight individuals. Numerous interventions for&#xD;
      obesity are available but the results are temporary, with most individuals returning to or&#xD;
      exceeding their baseline weights. Contrasting with conventional emphases on quantitative&#xD;
      weight reduction with factual didactics, exercise and diet, this protocol will focus on&#xD;
      enhancing individuals integrative resources utilizing mindfulness principles facilitating&#xD;
      changes in self healthcare behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MTC is a combined form of Tai Chi and mindfulness meditation. Tai Chi and mindfulness both&#xD;
      have common philosophical underpinnings that address health promotion and well-being. Tai Chi&#xD;
      is a gentle moving meditation that fosters individuals body-mind-spiritual integration&#xD;
      through specific movements. MTC is a systemic intervention with multidimensional effects on&#xD;
      health and well-being that facilitate healthy lifestyle by applying the skill of&#xD;
      non-judgmental awareness on a moment-to-moment daily basis. We hypothesize improvements in&#xD;
      health and well-being variables of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy ambulatory volunteers 18 years and older with BMI between 25 and &lt;&#xD;
      40 will be recruited from the greater Washington area. Exclusion criteria include mental or&#xD;
      physical health limitations that impede participation in the treatments or assessment of&#xD;
      outcome variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A randomized controlled clinical trial: comparing the MTC group to an active health&#xD;
      education (HE) control group. These groups will participate in the assigned activities in a&#xD;
      90 minute session twice a week for 10 weeks. All groups will be assessed at baseline and upon&#xD;
      completion of the treatments at week 10 and at a 2 month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The primary outcomes are changes in weight and multiple domains of&#xD;
      well-being. BMI and intra-abdominal fat by abdominal ultrasound will measure weight changes.&#xD;
      Physical well-being variables include biomarkers (lipid profile, BP, CRP, Leptin, IL 6, and&#xD;
      A1C), aerobic fitness from VO(2) max measurement with 6 to 10 minutes of a treadmill test,&#xD;
      and telomerase activity in leukocytes. A battery of questionnaires will measure&#xD;
      psychological, cognitive-affective, socio-spiritual and overall well-being. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes include mindfulness quality and lifestyle indices.&#xD;
