      The overall objective of this study is to develop and test an efficient self-report&#xD;
      instrument to measure Complementary and Alternative Medicine(CAM)-relevant contextual factors&#xD;
      important in healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial phase of the study involves developing and refining an item bank. During the&#xD;
      initial 'item bank development' phase, the investigators will run focus groups and cognitive&#xD;
      interviews with individuals who participate in CAM and conventional medicine interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current protocol in ClinicalTrials.gov pertains only to the initial phase of the study&#xD;
      involving focus groups and cognitive interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The next step of instrument development is called Calibration, and will involve administering&#xD;
      the revised item bank to an internet sample and to persons who receive services in a CAM&#xD;
      clinic and a conventional primary care setting. The items will be calibrated using item&#xD;
      response theory and classical test theory. This will result in a computerized adaptive&#xD;
      testing version of the instrument, as well as a static short form of the instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final phase of the project will involve conducting initial validation studies of the&#xD;
      instrument. The instrument will be called the Healing Encounters and Attitudes List (HEAL).&#xD;
      The investigators will evaluate the convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the&#xD;
      HEAL in a sample of 200 persons with chronic low back pain who are receiving physical&#xD;
      therapy, chiropractic care, or mindfulness-based stress reduction. For convergent validity,&#xD;
      the HEAL is expected to display moderate to large correlations with measures of similar&#xD;
      constructs. The HEAL is expected to correlate modestly with self-report measures of general&#xD;
      psychosocial functioning, in support of discriminant validity. Finally, HEAL score should&#xD;
      account for a significant proportion of the variance in treatment outcome, supporting&#xD;
      predictive validity.&#xD;

      This project will develop and test a patient self-report measurement tool to assess the&#xD;
      perceived contextual factors, such as patient attitudes and expectations, patient provider&#xD;
      relationship factors, and environmental factors that contribute to healing. Our project is&#xD;
      synergistic with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiative, Patient Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and will use the rigorous instrument&#xD;
      development and validation methodology of PROMIS. The overall objective of this study is to&#xD;
      develop an efficient self-report instrument to measure CAM-relevant contextual factors&#xD;
      important in healing, hereafter referred to as the Healing Encounters and Attitudes List&#xD;
      (HEAL), and conduct initial validation in persons seeking CAM and conventional treatment for&#xD;
      pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Develop an item bank. We will employ several iterative steps used&#xD;
      successfully in PROMIS to identify items that assess contextual factors of healing relevant&#xD;
      to CAM. Initial steps in developing an item bank include: a) compilation and evaluation of&#xD;
      existing instruments and relevant questions, b) consultation with experts, and c) focus&#xD;
      groups with individuals who participate in CAM and conventional medicine interventions, and&#xD;
      d) item editing. During the initial year of this study, we expect to identify conceptual&#xD;
      areas of potential importance to CAM interventions and patients, and identify and edit items&#xD;
      to create an item bank assessing these conceptual areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Calibrate items. We will use item response theory (IRT) and classical test&#xD;
      theory (CTT) to calibrate the items from Aim 1 on three samples: 1) an internet-based sample&#xD;
      (n= 1000), 2) 100 outpatients participating in CAM interventions at our Center for&#xD;
      Integrative Medicine (CIM), and 3) 100 outpatients at a General Internal Medicine clinic.&#xD;
      During year 2-3 we administer the items in the item bank to the 1200 persons, conduct IRT and&#xD;
      CTT analyses and refine the item bank to only those items that best assess the constructs.&#xD;
      Specific aim 2 will result in a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) version of the HEAL,&#xD;
      which maximizes information while minimizing patient time burden. A static short form of the&#xD;
      HEAL will be derived from the HEAL CAT in Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Conduct initial validation studies. We will evaluate convergent,&#xD;
      discriminant, and predictive validity of the Healing Encounters and Attitudes List (HEAL) in&#xD;
      a sample of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients receiving CAM and conventional medicine&#xD;
      treatments. The validity studies will use two samples of adults with CLBP: 100 persons&#xD;
      receiving CAM treatments: chiropractic manipulation (CM) or mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction (MBSR) at the CIM, and 100 persons receiving conventional care (physical therapy)&#xD;
      at Centers for Rehab Services referred by the General Internal Medicine Clinic (GIMC) of the&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We will administer the CAT version of the&#xD;
      HEAL questionnaire developed in aims 1 and 2 as well as conventional measures of treatment&#xD;
      expectancy, confidence in treatment provider, psychosocial functioning, and treatment outcome&#xD;
      measures for CLBP of pain and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3a: Scores on the HEAL measure will display moderate to large correlations&#xD;
           (r's &gt; .50) with similar self-report measures, supporting convergent validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3b: Scores on the HEAL measure will correlate modestly (r's = .20-.35) with&#xD;
           self-report measures of general psychosocial functioning, supporting discriminant&#xD;
           validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 3c: HEAL scores will account for a significant proportion of variance in&#xD;
           treatment outcome in both samples. In addition, we predict that HEAL scores will&#xD;
           demonstrate incremental validity, i.e., they will account for significant incremental&#xD;
           variance in outcome beyond that accounted for by existing measures of treatment&#xD;
           expectancy and related constructs.&#xD;
