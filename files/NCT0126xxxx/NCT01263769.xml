      The Study Drug:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Axitinib is designed to decrease blood supply to the tumor, which may slow tumor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take axitinib by mouth 2&#xD;
      times a day every day for 12 weeks. The dose may be changed based on any side effects you may&#xD;
      have. You should take the drug about 12 hours apart. You should take the pills at about the&#xD;
      same time each day. If you vomit anytime after taking a dose, you must not &quot;make it up&quot; with&#xD;
      an extra dose, but instead take the next dose as previously scheduled. Any missed dose may be&#xD;
      taken late up to 3 hours before the next scheduled dose, otherwise, it should be skipped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood pressure monitor will be given to each participant for home use. You will be given&#xD;
      instructions and shown how to monitor your blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be provided with a calendar to record the date and time of each dose, and your blood&#xD;
      pressure reading before taking the drug. Missed doses should also be recorded. You must also&#xD;
      bring the study drug bottle to each study visit so the research nurse can count any remaining&#xD;
      pills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drug list will be given to you to record drugs taken within 4 weeks before you enrolled on&#xD;
      the study and while on study. A new list will be provided during each clinic visit. You&#xD;
      should not start a new prescription or over-the-counter drug before talking with the study&#xD;
      doctor, except in the case of a medical emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care. This questionnaire will&#xD;
           take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who are able to become pregnant will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing to check your thyroid&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 5 and 9, you will be called and asked if you have had any side effects. This call&#xD;
      should take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 7 and 12:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your thyroid&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine (about 2 tablespoons) will be collected for routine testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan of chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Week 12 only, you will have an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 13, you will have surgery to remove the kidney tumor. You will receive a separate&#xD;
      consent form for this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 19:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your thyroid&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan of chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have been treated for high blood pressure while taking the drug, your blood&#xD;
           pressure will be monitored and your blood pressure medication will be reduced. Once your&#xD;
           blood pressure reaches a certain level, this will be managed by your primary care&#xD;
           doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Week 19, every 4 months (+/- 2 weeks) for the first 1 year, every 6 months (+/- 2&#xD;
      weeks) for the third and fourth year, then every year (+/- 1 month) for a total of 5 years&#xD;
      post surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT scan of the chest and abdomen to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine testing and to check your thyroid&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the questionnaire about kidney cancer care (only during the first 2&#xD;
           years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take axitinib for up to 12 weeks. You will stop taking axitinib earlier than&#xD;
      expected if the disease gets worse or if you have severe side effects. In both cases, you&#xD;
      will move on to surgery after axitinib has been stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, you will be contacted by the study staff every 4 months (+/- 2 weeks) for 1&#xD;
      year, every 6 months (+/- 2 weeks) for the next 2 years and every 12 months (+/- 1 month) for&#xD;
      2 more years (for a total of 5 years after surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Axitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to&#xD;
      treat advanced kidney cancer in adults when 1 previous drug treatment for this disease has&#xD;
      not worked. In this study, it is being used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
