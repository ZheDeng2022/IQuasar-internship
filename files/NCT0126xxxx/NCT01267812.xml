      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in&#xD;
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer&#xD;
      cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving bortezomib&#xD;
      together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib and rituximab together&#xD;
      works in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have previously undergone stem cell&#xD;
      transplantation&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the two year disease free survival in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients&#xD;
      treated with bortezomib + rituximab after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile, safety, overall survival, time to treatment failure,&#xD;
      remission duration, and biological markers of mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with&#xD;
      bortezomib + rituximab after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV) over 3-5&#xD;
      seconds and rituximab IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment with bortezomib repeats every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 8 courses and treatment with rituximab repeats every 6 months for up to 4&#xD;
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
