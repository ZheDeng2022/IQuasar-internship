    <textblock>
      The coronary bifurcation lesions pose a therapeutic problem with high rates of periprocedural&#xD;
      complications, higher rates of in-stent restenosis and stent thrombosis. These are lesions&#xD;
      where stenting is not superior in comparison to balloon angioplasty in regard to side branch.&#xD;
      It was demonstrated many times, in literature and in daily practice, that angiographically&#xD;
      high grade ostial side branch stenosis is not flow limiting and do not cause ischemia,&#xD;
      therefore do not require treatment. From the other side, our own data with MRI before and&#xD;
      after bifurcation PCI demonstrated that occurrence of angiographic stenosis more than 70% in&#xD;
      diameter is associated with periprocedural myonecrosis in the region of side branch. This&#xD;
      fact puts a very important question about the mechanisms of this myonecrosis. If the jailed&#xD;
      side branch has no significant flow limiting stenosis, but there is some degree of residual&#xD;
      ischemia, which after some period of persistence could lead to myonecrosis, will mean that&#xD;
      more aggressive treatment of ostial stenosis is needed. It is interesting that the strategy&#xD;
      of treatment is very important, because techniques with second stent implantation (with&#xD;
      primary purpose to limit SB ischemia) are associated with higher grade of troponin increase.&#xD;
      Of course this is association and not causality, despite that in randomized study (NORDIC I)&#xD;
      it was confirmed also.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is without explanation the fact of rare occurrence of significant (flow limiting, FFR&#xD;
      &lt;.75) stenosis appearance (less than 40% in side branches with ostial stenosis more than 75%)&#xD;
      and almost 50% periprocedural myonecrosis detected in the side branch areas. One working&#xD;
      hypothesis is that stent implantation and related episode of ischemia induces prolonged&#xD;
      vasospasm, resulting in prolonged ischemia. Thus, the ostial stenosis could be&#xD;
      non-significant as estimated and registered by FFR, but on microcirculatory lever ischemia&#xD;
      could persist is small areas for which available flow is not sufficient despite that global&#xD;
      regional flow is deemed sufficient. It is also possible that those patients have not enough&#xD;
      recruitable collaterals. It is also possible that both factors act together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although FFR is useful for assessing the degree of ischemia caused by a coronary lesion, it&#xD;
      cannot give information as to whether this ischemia may be clinically significant or not,&#xD;
      i.e. whether the ischemia affects a large territory. Therefore, it can be implicated that FFR&#xD;
      may not be useful in predicting clinically meaningful ischemia in a specific side branch&#xD;
      vessel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intracoronary electrocardiography (i.c. ECG) is a very sensitive method for ischemia&#xD;
      detection. The i.c. ECG reacts earlier on ischemia; the changes are much more prominent and&#xD;
      easy to register. The wire tip could be positioned directly in different regions and thus to&#xD;
      &quot;map&quot; regional ischemia. In most of the studies and from our own observations became evident&#xD;
      that when surface ECG do not react the i.c. ECG demonstrates significant changes in&#xD;
      ST-segment and QRS complex. Moreover, the registration of i.c. ECG is very cheap and needs&#xD;
      only an adapter connecting coronary wire end and ECG. An i.c. ECG also can differentiate&#xD;
      residual ischemic changes in distal main vessel and side branch as sources of prolonged&#xD;
      ischemia, respectively - source of periprocedural myonecrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the clinical significance of side branch vessel by&#xD;
      occluding the blood flow with a 1-minute balloon occlusion. We will also assess whether there&#xD;
      is any change in ECG (i.c. and 12-lead surface records) on balloon occlusion and relation&#xD;
      with periprocedural myonecrosis.&#xD;
