  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Spain, the gastric carcinoma is the 5th most frequent malignant tumor in women and the 6th&#xD;
      in men, and represents the 3rd cause of cancer-related deaths amongst women and the 4th&#xD;
      amongst men. The average of 5-year survival rate in Spain is under 30%. The main reason of it&#xD;
      is that, despite carrying out an adjuvant treatment, more than the 50% will present relapsed&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib has been the first RAF inhibitor, both of RAF-1 and B-rRAF and its b-RAF variant&#xD;
      V600E. Moreover, it has shown its ability to inhibit other tyrosin-quinase receptors as VEGFR&#xD;
      2 and 3, c-kit, Flt-3 or PDGFR. Its activity has been clearly proven in clear cell renal&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism by which Sorafenib seems to act is not because of the existence of a mutation&#xD;
      of RAS or RAF, but because as there is a VHL shortage the HIP produces a VEGF, bFGF or TGF&#xD;
      overexpression that produces in turn a hyper-stimulation on the RAF/ERK/MEK pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and angiogenesis seem to be clearly involved in the gastric carcinoma&#xD;
      tumorigenesis and progression. Because of that, it seems interesting to associate Sorafenib&#xD;
      to an oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, which has shown its effectiveness in relapsed patients&#xD;
      after receiving cisplatin-based schemes. Moreover, there is a phase 1 trial confirming the&#xD;
      tolerance of the oxaliplatin and Sorafenib association, describing partial responses amongst&#xD;
      gastric cancer patients previously treated with cisplatin.&#xD;
