      The study does involve 3 days confinement at the beginning of the trial and 4 days at the end&#xD;
      of the trial. The trial duration is 17 days with 6 visits not including the confinement&#xD;
      periods. The trial is being conducted in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis subjects. Serial&#xD;
      blood samples will be taken after each doses of the CYP substrates are administered and blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected for briakinumab PK and briakinumab ADA.&#xD;
