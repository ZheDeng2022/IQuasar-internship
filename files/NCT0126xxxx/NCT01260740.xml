      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Two areas on the surface of the brain, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and motor&#xD;
      cortex (MC), play a key role during learning. Researchers are interested in determining the&#xD;
      effect that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the DLPFC and MC has on participants'&#xD;
      performance of learning tasks. By studying the effect of TMS on reaction time, learning, and&#xD;
      memory, researchers hope to better understand how to treat conditions such as Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease and traumatic brain injury that affect these parts of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation on the dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
           cortex and motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To learn which areas of the brain are used to perform certain learning and memory tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy, right-handed individuals between 18 and 70 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical and neurological examination and a medical&#xD;
           and psychiatric history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to take part in one of five different parts of this study.&#xD;
           Most participants will have four 2-hour visits to the National Institutes of Health&#xD;
           Clinical Center. Some participants (those involved in Part 5) will have only one 2-hour&#xD;
           visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parts 1 and 2 (four visits): Participants will have TMS, and then do a learning task&#xD;
           that may provide a small monetary reward. On the first visit, before the TMS,&#xD;
           participants will take an intelligence test based on reading aloud the words given on a&#xD;
           card. Participants who have not had a routine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of&#xD;
           the brain within the past year will also have a scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Parts 3 and 4 (four visits): Participants will have a functional MRI scan while doing a&#xD;
           learning task that may provide a small monetary reward. On the first visit, before the&#xD;
           functional MRI, participants will take an intelligence test based on reading aloud the&#xD;
           words given on a card. Participants who have not had a routine magnetic resonance&#xD;
           imaging (MRI) scan of the brain within the past year will also have a scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Part 5 (one visit): Participants will take an intelligence test based on reading aloud&#xD;
           the words given on a card. Then, participants will have TMS followed by a functional MRI&#xD;
           scan. During the functional MRI, participants will do a button-pressing task that may&#xD;
           provide a small monetary reward.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also be asked to provide a small blood sample for genetic analysis.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (TBS) produces functional changes in human&#xD;
      motor cortex. Continuous inhibitory TBS, (cTBS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) produces a&#xD;
      temporary impairment of learning in healthy individuals similar to that seen in patients with&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Parkinson disease (PD). The depression of learning by cTBS&#xD;
      may serve as a model for learning and memory deficits in these disorders and provide a means&#xD;
      of screening treatments for efficacy and exploring their mechanisms. Our immediate goal is to&#xD;
      see whether manipulation of the behavioral contingencies of the task, particularly adding&#xD;
      reward, will overcome the virtual lesion produced by cTBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim of the project is to examine inhibitory effects of cTBS on implicit (serial&#xD;
      reaction time /SRT) and explicit (trial-and-error) motor learning of a sequence of target&#xD;
      locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second aim of the project is to examine the effects of cTBS on non-motor implicit and&#xD;
      explicit probabilistic classification learning using the weather prediction task (WPT). We&#xD;
      will investigate the involvement of M1 and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in implicit&#xD;
      and explicit learning by studying participants who will perform these tasks following cTBS&#xD;
      over: 1) M1, 2) DLPFC and 3) sham TBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our third aim is to examine the effect of manipulating reward during implicit and explicit&#xD;
      learning following inhibitory TBS over M1 and DLPFC as it is possible that learning deficits&#xD;
      caused by TBS can be improved by increasing the amount of reinforcement during learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our fourth aim is to examine the neural networks underlying implicit and explicit learning&#xD;
      with and without reward by studying participants who will perform these tasks during&#xD;
      functional MRI (fMRI). Finally, we will also perform fMRI during implicit sequence learning&#xD;
      and after cTBS over M1 to identify its effects on the neural networks involved in implicit&#xD;
      learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers (n = 272, aged 18 70), without any contraindication to TBS or MRI. This&#xD;
      number includes 60 participants each for Experiments 1 and 2, 24 participants each for&#xD;
      Experiments 3-5. In addition, 35 participants are included for piloting behavioral and&#xD;
      imaging procedures. In order to account for potential dropouts and withdrawals (up to 20%),&#xD;
      the total accrual ceiling includes a further 45 participants to equal 272.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contains five, mixed or crossover design experiments with appropriate controls to&#xD;
      eliminate order effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will examine the effects of reward and TBS and their interaction on measures of learning.&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be how TBS and reward interact to alter the pattern of BOLD&#xD;
      activation on MRI and the effects of relevant genetic variation on learning variables and&#xD;
      BOLD activation. We will examine the effects of genetic variations in relevant genes on these&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
