      This study, a nonrandomized open-label Phase I safety and exploratory study, will evaluate&#xD;
      the safety of topical norepinephrine in post-surgical breast cancer patients who are&#xD;
      undergoing radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also provide information about whether topical norepinephrine can prevent or&#xD;
      decrease the severity of the radiation dermatitis experienced by these patients.&#xD;

    <measure>Safety of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field</measure>
    <time_frame>Safety will be assessed during the study (5-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 1, 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary safety hypothesis is that there will be little or no skin irritation associated with the application of the topical norepinephrine and no systemic effects secondary to transdermal absorption.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy of daily topical application of norepinephrine to the radiation field</measure>
    <time_frame>Efficacy will be assessed during the study (5-7 weeks) and at follow-up visits approximately 1, 2 and 4 weeks after the end of the treatment period.</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the portion of the radiation site that is treated with topical norepinephrine immediately prior to daily radiotherapy will have less severe radiation dermatitis than the adjacent untreated portion of the radiation site.</description>

        Eligibility Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects must:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  be â‰¥ age 18 years of age with a documented pathological diagnosis of Stage Ia (T1, N0,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  with connective tissue disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with rashes, ulcerations, or poorly healed scars in the study drug application area&#xD;
             (axilla).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with a known allergy to norepinephrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with known uncontrolled hypertension (repeatedly elevated BP; systolic BP &gt;139 or&#xD;
             diastolic BP &gt;89).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with a known clinically significant abnormal ECG within the past 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  receiving MAO inhibitors or antidepressants (triptyline or imipramine types).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with lymphovascular space invasion on pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with dermal lymphatic invasion on pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  with proximity of the tumor to the overlying skin as evidenced by a distance of less&#xD;
             than 5 mm on US or MRI (if performed) and within 2 cm of the anticipated application&#xD;
             field&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  diagnosis of inflammatory breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  receiving chemotherapy other than Herceptin concurrent with the radiation.&#xD;
