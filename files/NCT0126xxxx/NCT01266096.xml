  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Current tests to detect cancer, including CAT scans and MRI scans, are limited. PET scans use&#xD;
      special dyes that are injected into a vein and can better localize possible cancer. The&#xD;
      investigators have developed a new particle that can carry a radioactive dye to a very&#xD;
      specific area of the tumor. When using a PET scan the radioactive dye can be viewed in areas&#xD;
      of possible disease. This particle has been studied in mice and was safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study&#xD;
      will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the&#xD;
      design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors.&#xD;

    <description>This is a two-year microdosing study that will enroll 5 metastatic melanoma patients and 18 malignant brain tumor patients (surgical (n=13) and non-surgical candidates (n=5)). We have already accrued 5 melanoma patients and expect to accrue brain tumor patients within a 1 year period.</description>

    <description>Five (5) patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent melanoma, and 18 malignant brain tumor patients (surgical (n=13) or non-surgical candidates (n=5)). Patients with either primary or metastatic brain tumors, will be i.v. injected with approximately 5 mCi (3.4-6.7 nanomoles) of 124I-cRGDY-PEG-dots (specific activity range 750.0 - 1450 mCi/mol) and undergo the microdosing study for purposes of collecting pharmacokinetic and dosimetry data. All studies will be performed using a dedicated scanner, which integrates a dedicated PET scanner and a spiral CT with proprietary fusion software.</description>

             mucosal melanomas or malignant brain tumor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or surgery in patients requiring flap&#xD;
             reconstruction in the head and neck region.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed patients with previous excisional biopsy.&#xD;
