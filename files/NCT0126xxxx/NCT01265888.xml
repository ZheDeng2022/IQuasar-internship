  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Phase 2 open label, dose escalation study to find the minimally and maximum effective dose&#xD;
      (dose beyond which no further effect on PVR is seen) of inhaled nitric oxide generated by the&#xD;
      GeNOsyl® System compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to 54 subjects undergoing RHC are planned in this study, and shall include subjects&#xD;
      meeting eligibility criteria classified as WHO Group 1 PAH or WHO Group 3 IPF-PH. Subjects&#xD;
      will receive inhaled nitric oxide from the GeNOsyl® System to characterize the hemodynamic&#xD;
      response and evaluate safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose cohorts of approximately 5, 15, and 20 ppm nitric oxide in air will be studied.&#xD;
      Different dose levels will be achieved by varying the flow rate of the drug substance (80 ppm&#xD;
      NO2 in balance air) delivered to the subject via nasal cannula. Each subject will receive two&#xD;
      different doses of inhaled nitric oxide separated by a placebo (medical grade air or&#xD;
      supplemental oxygen) washout. Eligible subjects will be assigned to a dosing cohort in an&#xD;
      escalating manner to receive study drug (80 ppm nitric oxide in air.)&#xD;
