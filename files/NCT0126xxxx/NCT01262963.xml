      The study is a Phase 1, open-label study designed to characterize the absorption,&#xD;
      distribution, metabolism and excretion of GSK2118436 following administration of a single&#xD;
      oral 14C labeled dose of GSK2118436 as a suspension in subjects with BRAF mutation positive&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GSK2118436 is an orally administered, potent and selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor that&#xD;
      is being developed for the treatment of BRAF mutation-positive tumors. The study is a Phase&#xD;
      1, open-label study designed to characterize the absorption, distribution, metabolism and&#xD;
      excretion of GSK2118436 following administration of a single oral 14C labeled dose of&#xD;
      GSK2118436 as a suspension in subjects with BRAF mutation positive tumors. A sufficient&#xD;
      number of subjects will be enrolled to complete approximately four subjects. Following&#xD;
      completion of the study, subjects may continue dosing with GSK2118436 in the rollover study,&#xD;
      BRF114144.&#xD;
