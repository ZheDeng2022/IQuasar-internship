  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among antidepressant treatments, ECT stands as the most effective in treating acute&#xD;
      depression. However, patient concerns with the cognitive side effects of ECT have encouraged&#xD;
      the development of new and more focal forms of brain stimulation such as transcranial Direct&#xD;
      Current Stimulation (tDCS). However, not all patients may respond to this treatment in the&#xD;
      way that it is currently administered and this has raised interest in finding alternative,&#xD;
      possibly more optimal ways of administering tDCS. This study will investigate whether tDCS&#xD;
      stimulation using an alternative electrode montage has antidepressant effects.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject meets criteria for a DSM-IV Major Depressive Episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Total MADRS score â‰¥20.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has not responded to tDCS given with a standard montage OR subject is unable&#xD;
             to receive tDCS with standard montage - for example, due to skin rash etc at site of&#xD;
             electrode placement for standard montage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Diagnosis (as defined by DSM-IV) of: any psychotic disorder (lifetime); eating&#xD;
             disorder (current or within the past year); obsessive compulsive disorder (lifetime);&#xD;
             post-traumatic stress disorder (current or within the past year); mental retardation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (as per DSM-IV criteria) within the&#xD;
             last 3 months (except nicotine and caffeine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Inadequate response to ECT in the current episode of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is on regular benzodiazepine medication which it is not clinically appropriate&#xD;
             to discontinue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high suicide&#xD;
             risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Neurological disorder or insult, e.g., recent stroke (CVA), which places subject at&#xD;
             risk of seizure or neuronal damage with tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has metal in the cranium, skull defects, or skin lesions on scalp (cuts,&#xD;
             abrasions, rash) at proposed electrode sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subject who is pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Participants who are not fluent in English will not be included in the trial for&#xD;
             safety reasons: a) It is usually not possible to have an interpreter reliably&#xD;
             available every weekday for up to 4 weeks and it is not safe to give tDCS to a subject&#xD;
             who cannot tell us immediately of any side effects; b) As this is a novel treatment,&#xD;
             the study involves detailed neuropsychological testing for safety reasons. This&#xD;
             testing cannot be effectively or validly completed by someone who is not fluent in&#xD;
             English. Note that translation of the proposed tests into English has not been&#xD;
             validated and that we cannot be confident that neuropsychological impairment would be&#xD;
             detected using this method.&#xD;
