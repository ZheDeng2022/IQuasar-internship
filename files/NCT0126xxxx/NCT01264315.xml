      Rationale: We recently reported a study where overall and event free survivals in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed myeloma patients receiving an autologous transplant followed by an allograft from&#xD;
      an HLA-identical sibling were superior as compared to those undergoing a double autologous&#xD;
      transplant. A larger multicenter study by the Gruppo Italiano Trapianti di Midollo (GITMO),&#xD;
      co-ordinated by our group and recently closed, employing a tandem auto-allo approach in newly&#xD;
      diagnosed patients confirmed the achievement of prolonged event free and overall survival.&#xD;
      Importantly, the achievement of at least very good partial remission at the time of&#xD;
      allografting conferred a significant advantage in both event-free-survival (HR 0,23, CI&#xD;
      0,11-0,48; p=0,0001) and overall survival (HR 0,26; CI 0,09-0,79; p=0,02). Moreover, recent&#xD;
      advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma have identified&#xD;
      specific signalling pathways that have become targets for biologically-based drugs such as&#xD;
      thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide and employed in several trials, including after&#xD;
      allograft. The aim of the current proposal is to combine the post-transplant efficacy of&#xD;
      graft-vs.-myeloma with the anti-myeloma effect of lenalidomide in newly diagnosed myeloma&#xD;
      patients with an HLA-identical sibling treated with a tandem autograft-allograft approach.&#xD;
      Maintenance/consolidation of the response may be a key factor to further improve rate of&#xD;
      clinical and molecular (as a prelude to cure) remissions and prolong overall and event free&#xD;
      survivals after allografting. We would like to investigate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      lenalidomide as consolidation/maintenance therapy in patient undergoing tandem&#xD;
      autologous-allogeneic transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of study: To evaluate 1) toxicity and tolerability of lenalidomide after&#xD;
      allografting; 2)To evaluate efficacy of lenalidomide in inducing complete remission, defined&#xD;
      as negative immunofixation, 12 months after allografting; 3) overall-survival; 4) event-free&#xD;
      survival; 5) molecular remission rate. Furthermore we plan to compare molecular remission&#xD;
      rate in patients treated with lenalidomide after tandem auto-allo transplant and after double&#xD;
      autologous transplant and to monitor minimal residual disease in patients achieving clinical&#xD;
      CR with lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection: Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma with an HLA identical&#xD;
      sibling suitable for PBSC donation will be included. Complete cytogenetic analysis at&#xD;
      diagnosis will be required. The patient must have the capacity to give informed consent. Age&#xD;
      &gt;18 and &lt; 65. Negative pregnancy test and willing to use contraceptive techniques during and&#xD;
      for 12 months following treatment is required. Only very unfitted patients will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment plan: Lenalidomide will be started at 6 months post-allotransplant at the dose of&#xD;
      10 mg/day continuously in all patients (unless in molecular CR), if the following conditions&#xD;
      are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1 x 109/L without the use of growth factors;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  platelet count &gt; 75 x 109/L without transfusion support;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  calculated or measured creatinine clearance: ≥ 20 mL/minute;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  total bilirubin &lt; 2 x the upper limit of normal,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AST and ALT &lt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  less than 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone, and no more than 2 immunosuppressive drugs other&#xD;
           than steroid to control GVHD (if more immunosuppression is required to control GVHD, the&#xD;
           maintenance therapy with lenalidomide will be held until this criteria will be&#xD;
           satisfied) Treatment will be continued without interruption, unless not tolerated, until&#xD;
           unacceptable adverse events are experienced or progressive disease occurs. Moreover,&#xD;
           lenalidomide will be discontinued in patients who achieve and maintain molecular&#xD;
           remission for 2 consecutive controls at least 6 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety section - dose modification plan: During the study patients will be monitored for the&#xD;
      occurrence of side effects. Toxicity events will be graded according to the NCI toxicity&#xD;
      criteria. In case of severe toxicity, the lenalidomide dose will be reduced or withheld as&#xD;
      outlined in the protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical section: - Total patient sample size: 53. This is a phase 2 study designed&#xD;
      according to a Simon's two-stage Minimax Design. An early stopping rule will be established&#xD;
      to interrupt the study in case of futility (a non satisfactory response rate). In stage I 27&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled; if &lt; 14 complete remissions will be observed, the trial will be&#xD;
      stopped. In stage II 26 more patients will be enrolled. If ≥ 32 responses will be observed,&#xD;
      it will be concluded that the lenalidomide maintenance is active in increasing the complete&#xD;
      remission rate after auto-allograft.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis plan: Toxicity monitoring will be incorporated into the study design by requiring&#xD;
      that the trial be terminated after an initial stage if the number of observed toxicities&#xD;
      (treatment related deaths) is excessive.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A. Pre-transplant phase: Induction Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will start induction treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (RD) for 4 cycles&#xD;
      every 28 days (as was detailed also in the GIMEMA protocol RV-MM-PI-209):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide will be given orally at the dose of 25 mg/day for 21 days followed by a 7&#xD;
           day rest period (day 22 to 28),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone will be given orally at the dose of 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 every 28&#xD;
           days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient relapses during RD before the end of the 4th cycle, the induction treatment may&#xD;
      be held and stem cell collection may be attempted with cyclophosphamide according to&#xD;
      physician willing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For dose reduction during induction therapy see Appendix O. Antithrombotic prophylaxis as per&#xD;
      protocol RV-MM-PI-209. For patients not previously enrolled in protocol RV-MM-PI-209, we&#xD;
      recommend prophylaxes with aspirin for patients without additional thrombotic risk factors,&#xD;
      and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) 100 U/kg for the others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Otherwise, induction schemas are accepted provided thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib,&#xD;
      alone or in combination, are included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell (PBSC) Mobilization and collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1-2 months from the completion of the last induction course, patients will undergo PBSC&#xD;
      mobilization with cyclophosphamide 4 g/m2 and G-CSF (10 ug/kg/day starting at day 5 until&#xD;
      completion of PBSC collection) to collect an adequate number of PBSC (4 to 10 x 106/kg CD 34+&#xD;
      cells). Patients who fail to collect the minimum of 4 x 106/kg CD 34+ cells will receive a&#xD;
      second course of cyclophosphamide for a second mobilization attempt. Patients who fails to&#xD;
      collect a minimum of 4 x 106/kg CD 34+ will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. High-Dose Melphalan / Autologous PBSC Transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
      High dose melphalan will be given 4 to 8 weeks after high dose cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Melphalan will be administered at a cumulative dose of 200 mg/m2. This will be given in&#xD;
           one dose infused on day -2. Dose will be calculated according to the participating&#xD;
           institutional standard practice for using body weight. High dose Melphalan is&#xD;
           administered via a central catheter as per single center procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Peripheral Blood Stem Cell or Bone Marrow Infusion: Infuse &gt; 2 x 106 CD 34+ cells /kg,&#xD;
           hydration requirements, and pre-medication per guidelines of the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. G-CSF: Administer G-CSF 5 ug/kg/day subcutaneously or intravenously from day +3 until&#xD;
           ANC &gt;1000 for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. Allogeneic transplant phase: Non-myeloablative PBSC Allografting&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-conditioning Upon recovery from high-dose melphalan, between 40-120 days post&#xD;
      autografting (preferably within 60 days) patients will proceed to nonmyeloablative allograft.&#xD;
      If indicated, radiation to high risk skeletal lesions may be given pre-transplant. If&#xD;
      interval exceeds 120 days, present to PCC for discussion and approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recovery from high-dose melphalan will be defined by patients achieving the following&#xD;
      clinical criteria after receiving high dose melphalan:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mucositis and gastrointestinal symptoms resolved, off hyperalimentation and intravenous&#xD;
           hydration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. have completed steroids for autologous GVHD;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. LFT / renal function values within the inclusion criteria for initial autograft;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. off IV antibiotics and amphotericin for documented infections;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. patients should be CMV antigenemia negative;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. if patients have experienced CMV infection post-autograft, they must have completed&#xD;
           therapy with Ganciclovir or Foscarnet and have been off this therapy for &gt; two weeks and&#xD;
           remain CMV antigenemia negative;&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. should have completed administration of any radiotherapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. any patient who does not fulfill these criteria, can be discussed with the principle&#xD;
           investigator for recommendations as to the timing of the allograft.&#xD;
