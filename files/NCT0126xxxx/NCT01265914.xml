  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ascending doses of a novel, universal flu vaccine, in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FP-01.1 is composed of a mixture of synthetic peptides, modified with a fluorocarbon vector,&#xD;
      which is anticipated to enhance the immune properties of the drug, and allows differentiation&#xD;
      from recent investigational interventions by avoiding the use of adjuvant. The peptide&#xD;
      sequences, derived from internal influenza-A proteins, were selected based on the presence of&#xD;
      CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes and a high degree of conservation across all influenza strains,&#xD;
      using a proprietary bioinformatics approach, and, it is proposed, will enable FP-01.1 to&#xD;
      universally treat influenza-A -infected populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is the initial exploration of the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity response&#xD;
      of FP-01.1 in healthy volunteers. Ascending doses of FP-01.1 will be assessed.&#xD;

             requirements of the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Satisfactory medical assessment with no clinically significant or relevant&#xD;
             abnormalities in medical history, physical examination, vital signs, ECG and&#xD;
             laboratory evaluation (haematology, biochemistry or urinalysis) as assessed by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability to provide written, personally signed and dated informed consent to&#xD;
             participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The subject has a body mass index within the range 19.0-32.0 kg/m2 and falls within&#xD;
             the weight range of 50.0-100.0 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject is willing to refrain from consuming alcohol for 24h prior to all visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. As a result of the medical screening process, the Principal Investigator or&#xD;
             Co-Investigator considers the subject unfit for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current or recurrent disease (e.g. cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, renal,&#xD;
             liver, gastrointestinal, autoimmune, immune suppression, malignancy or other&#xD;
             conditions) that could affect the action, absorption or disposition of the&#xD;
             investigational medicinal product (IMP) or could affect clinical or laboratory&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Significant illness as judged by the Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator within&#xD;
             2 weeks of the first dose of IMP.&#xD;
