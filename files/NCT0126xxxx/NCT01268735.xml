      Purpose To try to establish whether lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF) can be&#xD;
      influenced by increased lubrication with rewetting and lubricating eyedrops containing&#xD;
      hydroxypropyl-guar, which has proven lubricating effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods During summer and fall of 2009, 16 ophthalmologists from various regions of Croatia&#xD;
      investigated the effect of topical therapy with lubricating eyedrops on the signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of dry eye, with the special emphasis on lid-parallel conjunctival folds (LIPCOF).&#xD;
      229 patients were enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results After 14 days of therapy with lubricating eyedrops containing hydroxypropyl-guar,&#xD;
      statistically significant reduction of LIPCOF grade was observed, as well as the reduction of&#xD;
      symptoms and other signs of dysfunctional tear syndrome (TBUT, Schirmer test, conjunctival&#xD;
      hyperemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion Results of this study have shown positive influence of lubricating eyedrops&#xD;
      containing hydroxypropyl-guar on signs and symptoms of dysfunctional tear syndrome even after&#xD;
      only 14 days of treatment. It is of particular interest that LIPCOF grade was statistically&#xD;
      significantly decreased, pointing at increased friction and decreased ocular surface&#xD;
      lubrication as possible causes of its appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having this in mind, every clinician involved in dysfunctional tear syndrome treatment must&#xD;
      also think about lubrication as integral part of treating this condition.&#xD;

      Ruprecht et al. (1976-78) were among the first to ask a general population a simple question:&#xD;
      &quot;do you have gritty sensation in your eyes?&quot;. The results have shown that in the age group&#xD;
      55-59, 22,8% females and 9,9% males reported this symptom. In the age group 45-54 years,&#xD;
      almost 20% of females and 15% of males also had dry eye signs. Based on reported symptoms,&#xD;
      Schirmer test, TBUT test or Rose Bengal Staining, Jacobssson et al. in their survey among 780&#xD;
      subjects belonging to general population in Sweden have found that prevalence of dry eye in&#xD;
      the age group 55-72 years was 15%. In the more recent study by Hikichi et al. in Japan, which&#xD;
      screened 2127 patients in eight medical centers, dry eye symptoms were found among 17% of&#xD;
      them. No seasonal fluctuations were observed. Survey on 504 subjects aged 30-60 in Kopenhagen&#xD;
      has revealed the prevalence of dry eye in 11% of them. In a larger study in Maryland, USA,&#xD;
      involving 2520 residents older than 65, 15% reported one or more dry eye symptoms, but only&#xD;
      2.2% of them also had pathological Schirmer test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mentioned studies have shown that dry eye symptoms were most prevalent in the age group older&#xD;
      than 50, although no correlation was found between the age and gender. McCarthy et al.&#xD;
      analyzed the prevalence of dry eye in Melbourne (Australia). 926 participants older than 40&#xD;
      were enrolled in the survey. Dry eye was diagnosed in 10.8% of subjects by Rose Bengal&#xD;
      staining, in 16.3% of them by Schirmer test, 8.6% by TBUT test, 1.5% by fluorescein staining,&#xD;
      in 7.4 of subjects by using two or more tests, and in 5.5% of subjects with the extreme&#xD;
      symptoms of dry eye unrelated to hay fever. Women reported dry eye symptoms more frequently&#xD;
      than men. Canadian Dry Eye Epidemiology Study (CANDEES) tried to establish the prevalence of&#xD;
      dry eye in Canada. Questionnaires were mailed to every optometrist in Canada, who were asked&#xD;
      to hand them out to 30 consecutive patients. The total of 13.517 completed questionnaires&#xD;
      were returned (15.6% of those sent out). All age groups were enrolled in the study. 55% of&#xD;
      subjects were in the age group 21-50, 60.7% were women, and 24.3% of them wore contact&#xD;
      lenses. Dry eye symptoms were reported by 28.7% of surveyed subjects. When asked to describe&#xD;
      the severity of symptoms, 7.6% reported moderate but constant symptoms, while 1.6% of them&#xD;
      described them as severe. It is interesting to note that the vast majority of subjects who&#xD;
      reported having severe symptoms were women (ratio women to men: 46:1). Regarding gender, 33%&#xD;
      of women and 22% of men reported dry eye symptoms. Salisbury Study (1997) found dry eye&#xD;
      symptoms in 59% of surveyed subjects. In Beaver Dam Eye Study (2000) 14,4% out of 3703&#xD;
      surveyed subjects had dry eye symptoms11. Part of this study was to analyze possible&#xD;
      association of dry eye symptoms with other parameters. Statistically significant and&#xD;
      independent association was found between dry eye symptoms and arthritis, smoking, coffee&#xD;
      drinking, hyperthyreosis, goiter, diabetes and taking multivitamin food supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When analyzing causes of first visits to the general outpatient office in Zagreb University&#xD;
      Hospital Eye Department, 6.3% of all patients reported dysfunctional tear syndrome symptoms&#xD;
      as their primary cause for visit. That percentage rose to 48% when only patients with&#xD;
      external eye disease symptoms were analyzed, and would no doubt be even higher if only&#xD;
      chronic external eye inflammatory conditions were counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group of authors led by Prof.Hoeh 1995 published the paper Lid-parallel conjunctival folds&#xD;
      are a sure diagnostic sign of dry eye. The method described was named Lidkantenparallelen&#xD;
      Konjunktivalen Falten, or Lid Parallel Conjunctival Folds (LIPCOF). It was presented as a&#xD;
      very useful and innovative way of diagnosing dry eye. However, it was up till now mentioned&#xD;
      in relatively few published papers and is rarely used in everyday clinical practice,&#xD;
      especially outside Europe, where it is frequently termed conjunctivochalasis and not&#xD;
      associated with dry eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to authors, the height and/or number of bulbar conjunctival folds parallel to the&#xD;
      temporal margin of the lower eyelid are observed. Before assessment, lower eyelid is briefly&#xD;
      lifted from the eye surface- if folds disappear, they indeed are what is described as LIPCOF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings are ranked as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 0: no folds- normal finding (not dry eye) Grade 1: one fold above the normal tear&#xD;
      meniscus height- mild dry eye Grade 2: multiple folds up to the height of normal tear&#xD;
      meniscus- moderately dry eye Grade 3: multiple folds above normal tear meniscus height-&#xD;
      severe dry eye Authors claim that LIPCOF has 93% positive predictive value. In other words,&#xD;
      it detects dry eye with 93% certainty. Its negative predictive value is claimed to be 76%.&#xD;
      Furthermore, LIPCOF is not invasive, takes very short time to perform and has no additional&#xD;
      costs, as it requires use of no test strips, dyes etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all mentioned advantages of this method, we still do not know what it actually&#xD;
      measures- proven correlation between conjunctival folds and other signs and symptoms of dry&#xD;
      eye does not automatically point at the reasons of their appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the possible causes of LIPCOF may be decreased lubrication and increased friction of&#xD;
      ocular surface and eyelids during blinking in dysfunctional tear syndrome. The importance of&#xD;
      friction between the upper eyelid and ocular surface was well described by Korb in his Lid&#xD;
      Wiper Epitheliopathy concept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nowadays, we have at our disposal commercially available rewetting eyedrops which, due to&#xD;
      their formulation, display proven lubricating effect as well. If their application reduces&#xD;
      LIPCOF grade, then increased friction may be the cause of the appearance of folds.&#xD;
      Furthermore, such finding may show that this sign of dysfunctional tear syndrome may be&#xD;
      influenced by appropriate therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was to try to establish whether LIPCOF can be influenced by increased&#xD;
      lubrication with rewetting and lubricating eyedrops containing hydroxypropyl-guar which has&#xD;
      proven lubricating effect. Should that be the case, then it may be concluded that&#xD;
      conjunctival folds appear due to the increased friction, and that they are dynamic condition,&#xD;
      reversible after appropriate therapy. The influence of lubrication on other signs and&#xD;
      symptoms of dry eye was also observed.&#xD;
