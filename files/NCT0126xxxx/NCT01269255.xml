      A Phase I trial of Induction chemotherapy and Chemoradiotherapy with TS-1 and Cisplatin (SP)&#xD;
      as first-line treatment in patients with high risk advanced gastric cancer. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill&#xD;
      tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the&#xD;
      amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Radiation therapy was effectively used in&#xD;
      esophageal cancer, laryngeal cancer and rectal cancer, but gastric cancer are rarely studied&#xD;
      in Korea. There is an increasing interest in preoperative radiotherapy in effort to improve&#xD;
      survival and increase pathologic complete response in patients with gastric cancer.&#xD;
      Chemoradiotherapy may be the best modality in the neoadjuvant setting for high-risk advanced&#xD;
      tumors, such as type IV or large type III, N3/bulky N2 metastasis, or locally advanced&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
