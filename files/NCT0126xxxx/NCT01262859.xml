  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Induction chemotherapy is gaining momentum in the management of locally advanced squamous&#xD;
      cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). The combination of docetaxel, cisplatin, and&#xD;
      5-FU (TPF) was superior compared with PF in a Phase III clinical trials73,74. We have&#xD;
      completed a Phase II clinical trial that showed that docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab&#xD;
      (TPE) is highly active and well tolerated as induction chemotherapy in SCCHN (Argiris et al.&#xD;
      ASCO 2008; A6002). Preliminary survival results are very encouraging. 39 patients were&#xD;
      enrolled and with median follow up 26 months the 2-year PFS was 70% and the 2-year OS 84%.The&#xD;
      combination of chemotherapy plus cetuximab is already a standard treatment in recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic SCCHN47. Therefore, TPE can be used as the platform for the addition of novel&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGFR and VEGF are among the most important and validated molecular targets in cancer therapy.&#xD;
      The incorporation of novel targeted therapies to chemotherapy and radiotherapy is of&#xD;
      particular interest in head and neck cancer, and may improve efficacy without significantly&#xD;
      increasing toxicity. A Phase III trial of carboplatin/paclitaxel/bevacizumab with or without&#xD;
      cetuximab in advanced NSCLC has been proposed by SWOG. Bevacizumab is currently being&#xD;
      investigated in SCCHN with promising results. A Phase II study investigating the combination&#xD;
      of pemetrexed and bevacizumab (UPCI 05-002) as well as a Phase II trial of cetuximab and&#xD;
      bevacizumab (UPCI 05-087) in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN are ongoing at the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh with encouraging results (ASCO 2008 and ASCO 2009). In this study, 32 have been&#xD;
      already enrolled. There was only 1 patient with grade 3 hemorrhage. The objective response&#xD;
      rate is 20%, the median PFS 2.8 months and the median OS 8.1 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to further improve the efficacy of TPE and the rate of complete responses we propose&#xD;
      to add bevacizumab to the TPE followed by XPE regimen we developed at the University of&#xD;
      Pittsburgh. Due to non-overlapping toxicities and based on our prior experience we anticipate&#xD;
      that the regimen will be well tolerated. Moreover, we plan to obtain tumor biopsies and blood&#xD;
      samples in the first cycle and evaluate the modulation of biomarkers post combination&#xD;
      therapy. Data from induction with TPE (presented at ASCO 2009) indicate the potential&#xD;
      significance of cytokine levels in patient outcome. Also, we will evaluate the feasibility of&#xD;
      subsequent concurrent radiation, cisplatin, cetuximab and bevacizumab. Patients with stable&#xD;
      disease in the primary could be considered candidates to surgical resection at the discretion&#xD;
      of their physician, if the tumor is resectable.&#xD;

             each patient will be determined by a team composed of an Ear, Nose, and Throat&#xD;
             Surgeon, a Radiation Oncologist and a Medical Oncologist. Stage determination, optimal&#xD;
             local treatment, and its timing according to this protocol will be determined at this&#xD;
             evaluation. The unequivocal demonstration of distant metastasis (M1) confers&#xD;
             ineligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of squamous cell or poorly&#xD;
             differentiated carcinomas, or WHO types I-III of the nasopharynx.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior surgical therapy will consist only of incisional or excisional biopsy, and organ&#xD;
             sparing procedures such as debulking of airway compromising tumors or neck dissection&#xD;
             in a patient with an existing primary tumor. Any non-biopsy procedure must have taken&#xD;
             place &gt; 4 weeks but &lt; 3 months of initiating protocol treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  All patients should have their tumor tissue tested for HPV and will consent to have&#xD;
             available archival tumor samples, unstained slides or blocks from previous diagnostic&#xD;

&#xD;
        Calculated Creatinine Clearance = (140-age) X actual body wt.(kg) 72 X serum creatinine&#xD;
        Multiply this number by 0.85 if the patient is female&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Total bilirubin within normal limits and AST/ALT less than 3 times the upper limit of&#xD;
             normal.&#xD;

        using one of the following formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported in&#xD;
             mg/DI&#xD;
&#xD;

               -  Patients with a prior history of squamous cell or basal carcinoma of the skin or&#xD;
                  in situ cervical cancer must have been curatively treated. Patients with a&#xD;
                  history of other prior malignancy must have been treated with curative intent and&#xD;
