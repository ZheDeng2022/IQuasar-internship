    <textblock>
      This study will invite two groups of volunteers to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from one group of volunteers will be used to find out how much study drug, known as&#xD;
      GSK1325756, is in the blood after taking the drug twice in one day. Data will also collected&#xD;
      to find out if the level of cetain blood cells, known as neutrophils, change significantly&#xD;
      after taking the study drug twice in one day. This group of volunteers will be aged 40 to 64&#xD;
      years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the other group of volunteers will be used to find out if taking the study&#xD;
      drug, GSK1325756, twice in one day with or without food, makes a difference to the level of&#xD;
      study drug in the blood. This group of volunteers will also provide data to find out if any&#xD;
      study drug metabolites are present in the bile, a fluid secreted by the liver. This group of&#xD;
      volunteers will be aged 65 to 80 years of age.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The current study will be conducted in two parts. In Part A - Cohort 1, healthy fed subjects&#xD;
      aged 40 to 64 years (inclusive) will be enrolled to evaluate both the pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics of twice daily oral administration of GSK1325756 compared to matching&#xD;
      placebo. In Part B - Cohort 2, healthy elderly subjects aged 65 to 80 years (inclusive) will&#xD;
      be enrolled to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of twice daily oral administration of&#xD;
      GSK1325756 for administered under fed and fasted conditions. Parts A and B may be performed&#xD;
      in parallel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate duration of the current study is expected to be between 64 and 74 days. The&#xD;
      study will require subjects to complete a screening visit within 30 days, followed by Part A&#xD;
      - Cohort 1 enrolment requiring 3 x (3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period) or Part B&#xD;
      Cohort 2 enrolment requiring 2 x (3 day treatment period + 7 day washout period). All&#xD;
      subjects will complete a follow up visit within seven to 14 days of last dose.&#xD;
