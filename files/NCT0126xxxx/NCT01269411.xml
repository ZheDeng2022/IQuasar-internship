    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of RO4929097 in treating&#xD;
      patients with recurrent invasive gliomas. RO4929097 may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine, in patients with recurrent MGs (many of whom receive dexamethasone, a moderate&#xD;
      CYP3A4 inducer), the safety and maximum-tolerated dose of RO4909297 administered at 2 dose&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the pharmacokinetics, intratumoral drug concentration, target modulation, and&#xD;
      evidence of any treatment effect in the malignant glioma tumor tissue by R04929097&#xD;
      administered at the dose found in Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of RO4909297 in patients with recurrent MGs&#xD;
      (many of whom receive dexamethasone, a moderate CYP3A4 inducer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the progression-free survival of patients with recurrent malignant glioma&#xD;
      following treatment with R04929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Determine if the RPTD dose of RO4929097 significantly inhibits p75^NTR cleavage and&#xD;
      processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Determine the effects of RO4929097 on the establishment and growth of BTIC cultures in&#xD;
      neurosphere growth conditions, effects on proliferation, ability to self-renewal, and ability&#xD;
      to differentiate along lineage-specific pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determine the ability of RO4929097 to inhibit Notch signaling, by assessing downstream&#xD;
      target activation, in glioma tissue of patients with recurrent MG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Determine the association between a number of serum, tumor, and BTIC markers and response&#xD;
      to R04929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation (part A) study followed by an open-label&#xD;
      (part B) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART A: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART B: Patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1-7 and undergo surgery on day 8.&#xD;
      Beginning 28 days later, patients receive oral RO4929097 once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and&#xD;
      15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post resection tumor specimens are collected for correlative studies, including&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic and biomarker assays.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3 month&#xD;
      for up to 6-12 months.&#xD;
