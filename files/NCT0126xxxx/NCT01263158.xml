    <textblock>
      Slow labour progress is common in nulliparous women and is associated with childbirth&#xD;
      complications and negative birth experiences. Oxytocin augmentation is widely used to treat&#xD;
      slow labour despite associated risks for the fetus. An ongoing debate concerns whether&#xD;
      oxytocin should be administered directly or postponed after arrested labour. The overall aim&#xD;
      is to study labour progress in healthy nulliparous women and to compare childbirth outcomes&#xD;
      and experiences in women randomised to expectant versus early oxytocin augmentation for slow&#xD;
      labour progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that it is to early to start oxytocin treatment when labour progress has&#xD;
      been slow for 2 to 3 hours in healthy women having their first baby and therefore beneficial&#xD;
      for childbirth outcomes to postpone oxytocin for another 3 hours. In this randomised&#xD;
      controlled trial nulliparous women with a normal pregnancy, spontaneous onset of active labor&#xD;
      at term, and a cervical dilatation of 4 - 9 centimetres on admission to the delivery ward&#xD;
      were included (n=2,072). All women whose labour did not progress after amniotomy (n=630) were&#xD;
      randomly allocated either to labour augmentation by oxytocin infusion (Early oxytocin, n=314)&#xD;
      or to postponement of oxytocin augmentation for another three hours (Expectant, n=316). One&#xD;
      month postpartum the women received a postal questionnaire concerning their experiences of&#xD;
      labour and birth. All participating women gave their informed consent. Maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcomes like mode of delivery, postpartum haemorrhage, perinatal lacerations, low Apgar&#xD;
      score, need of neonatal intensive care and maternal experiences of childbirth were compared&#xD;
      between the randomised groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In contemporary handling of labouring women in the western world, it has become extremely&#xD;
      common to intervene through &quot;active&quot; or disciplined&quot; management (Enkin et al., Widela et al.,&#xD;
      Gerdhardstein et al., Frigoletto et al). It is a widespread routine - and potential side&#xD;
      effects will therefore have a great impact. The use of the hormone oxytocin to enhance and&#xD;
      speed up labour is the most common method, but the sparse scientific data regarding its&#xD;
      effect are inconsistent and mostly demonstrate uncertain and sometime side effects (Thornton&#xD;
      &amp; Lilford, Frazer 1994, 1998, Cammu &amp; Van Eeckhout).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effects, when evaluated, are short-term effects of maternal (obstetric) and fetal&#xD;
      outcomes. The studies performed have mostly aimed to investigate whether the active&#xD;
      management can reduce the rate of caesarean sections. However, in a meta-analysis of four&#xD;
      randomised studies of the effects of oxytocin as intervention in spontaneous labour (Frazer),&#xD;
      no significant reduction in the incidence of caesarean section, instrumental deliveries, and&#xD;
      use of analgetics or hyper stimulation of labour was found. The only statically significant&#xD;
      differences were in side effects: an increased incidence of discomfort and of pain in the&#xD;
      group given oxytocin. In this meta-analysis, no significant differences in fetal conditions&#xD;
      between the groups were found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only one of the studies found sought the women's view on the augmentation procedures (Enkin).&#xD;
      Over half of the women who were interviewed, said that the oxytocin treatment was unpleasant&#xD;
      and indicate that they would like to try without the drug when giving birth the next time.&#xD;
      Over 80% felt that it had increased the amount of pain that they had experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite of poor evidence of benefits, around half of birth giving women in Sweden receive&#xD;
      oxytocin during labour and in some other countries, far more than that (Waldenström,&#xD;
      O'Driscoll, Enkin). It has become the standard care of treating labours with slow progress.&#xD;
      According to an investigation by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare&#xD;
      (Socialstyrelsen 1996), the indications for oxytocin use and the amounts administered are not&#xD;
      systematically recorded, and the assessments of its effects are even less well recorded. This&#xD;
      makes evaluation by using existing documents very unreliable, and randomised controlled&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the effects of oxytocin treatment vs no or delayed oxytocin treatment on the&#xD;
           obstetrical and fetal outcome of spontaneous, but prolonged labour. Primary outcome is&#xD;
           rate of spontaneous vaginal deliveries. Secondary outcome are length of labour,&#xD;
           postpartum haemorrhage, sphincter lacerations, Apgar score, perceived pain and sense of&#xD;
           safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study labour experiences in women exposed to oxytocin treatment vs women without&#xD;
           oxytocin treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The planned study design is a randomised controlled study with healthy women with normal&#xD;
      pregnancies and spontaneous labour, where labour progression is deemed to be prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women with full-term, normal pregnancies, spontaneous onset of active labour (effaced&#xD;
      cervix and minimum 4 cm dilated) and about to give birth to their first child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with multiple pregnancies, complicated pregnancies, maternal disease during&#xD;
      pregnancies, ruptured membranes for more than 2 hours before onset of labour contractions,&#xD;
      and fetus in breech presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 247 in each group is needed to show a difference in spontaneous vaginal&#xD;
      deliveries from 81,2% to 90% with a 2-sided test, alpha=0,05 and 80% power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women fulfilling the criteria as described above are regarded as potential study subjects.&#xD;
      Information about the study is distributed during the last trimester at the antenatal clinic.&#xD;
      On arrival at the delivery ward, all women fulfilling these criteria are again informed about&#xD;
      the study and asked for consent to participate. The progression of labour is thoroughly&#xD;
      followed and documented for women who have agreed to participate. If the labour is prolonged&#xD;
      during the active phase and is classified as inertia, i.e. with no further opening of the&#xD;
      cervix for 2 hours or less than 1 cm in 3 hours, the subject are randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      labour augmentation by means of oxytocin infusion within twenty minutes (standard care) or to&#xD;
      expectancy and observation another 3 hours (experimental group) If the subjects in the&#xD;
      experimental group after the 3 hours still do not progress in their labour, a reassessment&#xD;
      regarding the need for labour augmentation is done. Women fulfilling inclusion criteria, and&#xD;
      who have agreed to participate, but whose labours proceed normally, are followed according&#xD;
      the same protocol, hence serving as external controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment and follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      The handling of the participants will be done according to a standard protocol holding&#xD;
      continuous documentation of the progression of labour, of the amount of oxytocin&#xD;
      administered, of the analgesia used and of the obstetric outcome (caesarean section,&#xD;
      instrumental vaginal delivery, length of labour, Apgar score etc). At the inclusion in the&#xD;
      study, the women assess their expectancies, their perceived pain and sense of safety, using a&#xD;
      visual analogue scale. Pain and sense of safety is then assessed at several occasions during&#xD;
      and after delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to study the women's retrospective perceptions of their labour, they receive a&#xD;
      questionnaire regarding their perceived experience one month post partum. This instrument&#xD;
      focus on perceived pain, perceived safety, perceived participation in decision-making, sense&#xD;
      of control and patient satisfaction. This questionnaire also contains questions regarding&#xD;
      breast-feeding and a separate part is to be answered by the father. The latter part holding&#xD;
      questions about the fathers' levels of preparation for the delivery, and his expectations and&#xD;
      experiences as a supportive person in the labour room. A subgroup of the subjects (24 + 24) -&#xD;
      oxytocin exposed and unexposed women - will be interviewed at one and four months after&#xD;
      birth, using a qualitative interview method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the baby is done at birth through Apgar scoring, fetal pH and base excess from&#xD;
      the umbilical cord blood. In addition to this, a subgroup of the neonates will get their&#xD;
      motor activity, heart frequency and respiration activity continuously registered during the&#xD;
      first night after birth. This is done with the help of a so-called &quot;sleep-box&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hours after the inclusion in the study, a reassessment of the progress of the labour is&#xD;
      performed to evaluate whether the progression is satisfactory, or if oxytocin for those&#xD;
      assigned to the experimental group is assessed to be required (procedures).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reassessments are then done regularly with 2-3 hours interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Making a randomised, clinical study with care/treatment group and non-care/non-treatment&#xD;
      group, always raises the question whether it is good ethics or not to abstain from the&#xD;
      presently applied care programme. In this case, scientific data regarding the beneficial&#xD;
      outcomes are ambiguous and inconsistent, and it is thus not obvious which of the procedures&#xD;
      offered is &quot;best&quot; for the woman and the child. With this background, performing the study&#xD;
      including well informed subjects and aiming at evaluating effects of standard procedures,&#xD;
      must be considered ethically acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few controlled studies on the effects of the standard procedure of treating slow&#xD;
      labour progression with oxytocin and these show conflicting results. Considering this&#xD;
      widespread treatment involving large population of women and newborns, it is of great&#xD;
      importance to evaluate potential benefits and side effects in controlled studies. Knowledge&#xD;
      about this is especially important in the reorganisation and rationing of resources within&#xD;
      obstetric services. In the attempts to shorten women's hospital stays, the shortening of&#xD;
      duration of labour has sometimes been considered a means to make obstetric care more&#xD;
      cost-efficient and this fact makes independent evaluation of the care even more important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients have the right to get evidence based care and treatment. This study&#xD;
      will hopefully contribute to a better evidence based handling of women in labour who are&#xD;
      subjected to secondary inertia, and in addition it will give us more information about&#xD;
      fathers' experiences, which will help us enhance the care of the next-to-kin of the labouring&#xD;
      woman.&#xD;
