      This project investigate any difference in inflammatory response,wound heeling rate,&#xD;
      functional outcome and level of pain in patience with different surgical treatment (PCCT vs.&#xD;
      DHS vs. Osteosynthesis with nails) after a fracture of the proximal femur.&#xD;

      This project investigates microcirculation in skin and muscle after different surgical&#xD;
      treatment of pertrochanteric fractures of the femur for detecting the less damaging method.&#xD;
      Three different systems are compared: the PCCT and the osteosynthesis with nails ( two&#xD;
      minimal-invasive methods) and the conventional dynamic hip screw ( DHS). All three are long&#xD;
      established and show no difference in results in any clinical trials. The method for every&#xD;
      patient is chosen randomly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The microcirculation is measured as parameter for tissue damage and wound heeling. It is&#xD;
      registered by O2c, which works with measuring reflected lightwaves. It is strictly&#xD;
      noninvasive and causes absolutely no pain for the patient. The measurement device consists of&#xD;
      two small probes, which simply stick to the patientÂ´s skin. There are eleven measurements on&#xD;
      this study: one directly before and one shortly after and one 6 h after the surgery, followed&#xD;
      by three measuring appointments after 12, 24, 48 hours. Afterwards there are appointments&#xD;
      planed after 4, 7 and 12 days. After 7 days a CT controls the leg-rotation. In addition it&#xD;
      detects any dislocation of the fracture or fixing item.The next appointments are planed after&#xD;
      6 week. In the last two sessions the patients are questioned according to established&#xD;
      questionnaires, e.g the Harris hip score to evaluate any loss of functionality of the&#xD;
      operated leg. And a control of physical strength is planed on these appointments. It is known&#xD;
      today that most patients can not reach the same level of physical strength after the&#xD;
      treatment as before the fracture. Additionally an EMG records muscle damage. And the level of&#xD;
      pain is evaluated with the Visual Analogue Scale simultaneity with the O2c-measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The last measurement is planed after 6 month. Then the fracture is controlled by an X-ray.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters like operation time, blood loss, ASA score (for pre-existing condition)&#xD;
      are included to create comparable patient profiles. Therefore the AO classification of the&#xD;
      fracture and the grade of osteoporosis according to the Singh-Classification is recorded,&#xD;
      too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also on every measuring appointment blood samples are tested on parameters of systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response and muscle cell destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore this project is meant to establish limits of microcirculation measured with O2c.&#xD;
      So in the future is will be possible to predict any wound heeling difficulties with this&#xD;
      no-invasive measuring technic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore this study will research on the one hand if these three operation methods differ in&#xD;
      wound heeling, functionality or level of pain and on the other hand establish a possibility&#xD;
      to detect wound heeling complications early and easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both results are extremely relevant to be able to choose the treatment most suited to the&#xD;
      individual patient. So the pertrochanteric fracture of the femur, which is common in older&#xD;
      and multimorbid population, will no longer result in risky re-operations due to wound heeling&#xD;
      complications or limited functionality and quality of life.&#xD;
