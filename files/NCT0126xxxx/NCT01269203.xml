  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if curcumin can reduce the symptoms&#xD;
      reported by patients with multiple myeloma (MM) who receive treatment with lenalidomide.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Curcumin is the active ingredient in the spice turmeric. It may interfere with the production&#xD;
      of cytokines (which cause inflammation), which may help reduce multiple symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A placebo is not a drug. It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any&#xD;
      disease or illness. It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study&#xD;
      drug has any real effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the flip of a&#xD;
      coin) to 1 of 2 groups. Group 1 will take curcumin. Group 2 will take a placebo. You will&#xD;
      have an equal chance of being assigned to each group. No matter which group you are in, you&#xD;
      will be given standard care by your treating doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neither you nor the study staff will know if you are receiving the study drug or the placebo.&#xD;
      However, if needed for your safety, the study staff will be able to find out what you are&#xD;
      receiving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take curcumin/placebo 2 times every day about 12 hours apart. You will begin taking&#xD;
      curcumin/placebo when you begin maintenance therapy with lenalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be given a pamphlet with more information about how to take the curcumin/placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You must bring the study capsules you have not yet taken to the clinic every study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 4 weeks is called a study cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you begin treatment with lenalidomide and curcumin/placebo:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be taught how to use the automated symptom assessment telephone program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete 4 questionnaires about pain and other symptoms, and your quality of&#xD;
           life. In addition, some personal information (such as your name, address, race, and&#xD;
           smoking history) will be collected. Completing the questionnaires will take about 20&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked about any drugs you may be taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telephone System Calls for Symptom Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A telephone system will call you once a week at a time convenient to you. Using the numeric&#xD;
      key pad on your telephone, you will rate your symptoms and how they interfere with your daily&#xD;
      activities. Each phone call will take about 5 minutes to complete. You will be given a&#xD;
      brochure explaining the steps to complete the symptom questionnaire and a telephone number to&#xD;
      call if you have questions or problems with the telephone system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of Cycle 4 and at the End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -You will complete 3 questionnaires about your pain and other symptoms and your quality of&#xD;
      life. The questionnaires will take about 20 minutes to complete. If for some reason, you are&#xD;
      unable to complete the questionnaire through the automated symptom assessment telephone&#xD;
      program, you may be able to complete it with the research staff, either by phone or during a&#xD;
      routine clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will talk to you during your regularly scheduled visits for each cycle of&#xD;
      treatment with lenalidomide. You will be asked about side effects you may be having and drugs&#xD;
      you are taking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take curcumin/placebo for 6 months. You will remain on the study for about 6-7&#xD;
      months (depending on how your clinic visits are scheduled). You will be taken off study if&#xD;
      you have intolerable side effects or the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Curcumin is not FDA approved. At this time, curcumin is&#xD;
      only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 70 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
