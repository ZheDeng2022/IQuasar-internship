  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD in the adult population is associated with several measures of harmful dysfunction. For&#xD;
      example, adult ADHD is associated with high rates of separation/divorce and never-married&#xD;
      status, lower educational attainment and occupational achievement, absenteeism, presenteeism,&#xD;
      and job termination, as well as decreased social function. Individuals with adult ADHD are&#xD;
      more likely than controls to have a comorbid diagnosis of bipolar disorder, alcohol and&#xD;
      substance abuse, as well as antisocial personality disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychostimulants are the most frequently employed medications in the treatment of adult ADHD.&#xD;
      Several psychostimulants are Health Canada and US FDA-approved for the treatment of ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms in adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hitherto, no trial has evaluated the safety and efficacy of a psychostimulant in the&#xD;
      treatment of ADHD symptomatology in adult individuals with bipolar disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vyvanse is the first prodrug stimulant indicated for the treatment of adult (and pediatric)&#xD;
      ADHD. Vyvanse is a therapeutically inactive molecule (i.e. prodrug). After oral ingestion,&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine is converted to l-lysine, a naturally occurring essential amino acid, and&#xD;
      active d-amphetamine, which is responsible for the drug's activity. Vyvanse provides a longer&#xD;
      duration of effect consistent throughout the day with reduced potential for risk of abuse.&#xD;
      Vyvanse is generally well tolerated with an adverse event profile similar to other&#xD;
      psychostimulant medications. Available evidence indicates that in most treated subjects,&#xD;
      Vyvanse is weight-neutral and/or is associated with weight loss. Moreover, in some&#xD;
      individuals, it is associated with improvement in both glucose and lipid homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of safety/tolerability profiles as well as the effectiveness of&#xD;
      lisdexamfetamine in a &quot;real-world&quot; population has significant translational value.&#xD;
