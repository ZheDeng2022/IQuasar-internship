    <measure>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Calculated Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline; 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the ([post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value] divided by the Baseline value) x 100. Baseline was defined as the mean of the values from Weeks -1 and 0. Least square (LS) mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 was based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects of treatment and triglyceride (TG) stratum and Baseline value as a covariate. Missing LDL-C values at Week 12 were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure (only post-Baseline values were carried forward).</description>

      <recruitment_details>A total of 177 participants were enrolled and treated across 11 study sites in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During Screening, appropriate participants washed off all lipid-regulating drugs and supplements as necessary for 6 weeks prior to randomization. Participants not taking lipid-regulating medications or supplements for 4 weeks prior to Screening may have combined the S1 and Q1 visits. Participants with hypercholesterolemia were stratified into the normal (&lt;150 milligrams per deciliter [mg/dL]) or elevated (≥150 mg/dL) triglycerides (TG) stratum.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Calculated Low-Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C)</title>
        <description>Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the ([post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value] divided by the Baseline value) x 100. Baseline was defined as the mean of the values from Weeks -1 and 0. Least square (LS) mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 was based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with effects of treatment and triglyceride (TG) stratum and Baseline value as a covariate. Missing LDL-C values at Week 12 were imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) procedure (only post-Baseline values were carried forward).</description>

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline to Week 12 in Lipoprotein (a)</title>
        <description>Percent change from Baseline was calculated as the ([post-Baseline value minus the Baseline value] divided by the Baseline value) x 100. Baseline was defined as the mean of the values from Week 0. LS mean percent change from Baseline to Week 12 was based on an ANCOVA model with effects of treatment and TG stratum and Baseline value as a covariate. Missing Lipoprotein (a) values at Week 12 were imputed using the LOCF procedure (only post-Baseline values were carried forward).</description>
