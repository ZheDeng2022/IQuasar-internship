      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The Ukrainian Research Center for Radiation Medicine and the U.S. National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health have been studying cancer risks and outcomes in individuals who participated in the&#xD;
      decontamination clean-up process following the Chornobyl nuclear accident. Some of these&#xD;
      individuals were exposed to external radiation at various levels, as well as radioactive&#xD;
      iodine that may have affected the thyroid and increased the risk of developing thyroid&#xD;
      cancer. Because more individual and comparative data are needed on the affected populations&#xD;
      and clean-up workers associated with the Chornobyl accident, researchers are interested in&#xD;
      collecting personal information and saliva samples from Chornobyl clean-up workers who have&#xD;
      been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To assess the radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer among male Chornobyl clean-up&#xD;
      workers and collect saliva samples for an initial study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Male Chornobyl clean-up workers from Kyiv and Donetsk oblasts who have been diagnosed with&#xD;
      thyroid cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will complete a standardized questionnaire during a personal interview. The&#xD;
           questionnaire will ask for detailed information on the following areas of study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Work history, conditions, and activities inside the 70-km clean-up and radiation&#xD;
           calculation zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Residence history inside and outside the 30-km exclusion zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Milk consumption between April 26 and June 30, 1986 (to assess radioactivity from&#xD;
           radioiodine fallout).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Potential non-radiation risk factors for thyroid cancer (e.g., smoking, alcohol&#xD;
           consumption, family cancer history).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide a saliva sample for pilot study testing....&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much is known about the radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer, but there is considerable&#xD;
      uncertainty about the magnitude of the radiation risk among those who were exposed as adults,&#xD;
      particularly in males. A large number of clean-up workers, mostly male, who participated in&#xD;
      decontamination and clean-up activities after the Chornobyl accident were exposed to external&#xD;
      radiation at various levels. An increased thyroid cancer risk has been reported from studies&#xD;
      of Russian, Estonian and Latvian clean-up workers, but there is little evidence of a dose&#xD;
      response. However, recent published data from an IARC study of thyroid cancer cases and&#xD;
      controls pooled from the Chornobyl clean-up workers in Belarus, Russia and Baltic countries&#xD;
      show a strong dose response with an estimated risk per unit dose that is much higher than&#xD;
      those reported from other irradiated populations exposed as adults. Following the completion&#xD;
      of our NCI study of leukemia among Ukrainian clean-up workers, we are proposing a nested&#xD;
      case-control study to assess the radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer among the 150,000&#xD;
      male cleanup workers in Ukraine. In preparation for this study, a pilot study is in progress&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility of a full study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are (i) to identify thyroid cancer cases and demographically matched controls&#xD;
      without thyroid cancer occurring among the 150,000 Ukrainian clean-up workers through linkage&#xD;
      to the National Cancer Registry and Chernobyl State Registry of Ukraine; (ii) to trace/locate&#xD;
      and interview a small sample of subjects with thyroid cancer and their respective controls ;&#xD;
      (iii) to obtain saliva buccal cell samples; and (iv) to locate and transfer thyroid tumor&#xD;
      specimens from identified cases to the archive maintained at the Research Center for&#xD;
      Radiation Medicine (RCRM),for diagnostic verification and possible future genetic/molecular&#xD;
      research using the latest available techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort includes Ukrainian clean-up workers who meet the following eligibility criteria:&#xD;
      males, first year of service as a clean-up worker (1986-1990); initial registration as a&#xD;
      clean-up worker in one of the study areas; and age when first worked in the Chornobyl zone&#xD;
      (under 60). For the pilot study, we will select 100-110 cases with thyroid cancer in three&#xD;
      study areas, Kyiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts and controls (with a case-control ratio&#xD;
      of 1:3). We will assess the feasibility of proxy interview for deceased thyroid cancer cases&#xD;
      in the study area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will be conducted in the framework of the planned nested case-control study&#xD;
      in the cohort of Chornobyl clean-up workers but will involve only a small number of subjects&#xD;
      with thyroid cancer and their respective controls. Thyroid cancer cases will be identified by&#xD;
      linkage to the Cancer Registry of Ukraine. Controls will be identified from the Chernobyl&#xD;
      State Registry. Locating archived tumor tissues will be done by search of the Cancer Registry&#xD;
      of Ukraine database supplemented by interview data. Consent for transfer of tissues to RCRM&#xD;
      will be sought at the time of interview.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        For the pilot study, we will select clean-up workers with thyroid cancer reported in three&#xD;
        study areas, Kyiv, Donetsk and Dnipropetrovsk oblasts and controls (with a case-control&#xD;
        ratio of 1:3) demographically matched to cases. We estimate the number of these cases will&#xD;
        be between 100 and 110. These two oblasts have been chosen to represent an area known, from&#xD;
        the leukemia study, to have a high study participation rate (Kyiv and Dnipropetrovsk&#xD;
        oblasts) and an area newly added and thus unknown regarding participation rate (Donetsk).&#xD;
        All study subjects are males and average about 55 years. In view of the very high survival&#xD;
        rate for thyroid cancer, a majority of the subjects are expected to be alive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Excluded from the study will be those who cannot be located, refuse to participate in the&#xD;
        study, or do not provide informed consent.&#xD;
