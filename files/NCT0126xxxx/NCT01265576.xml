  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if VT-122 provides a clinical benefit when added to&#xD;
      Sorafenib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common clinical course of the patient with cancer is local tumor progression leading&#xD;
      to the development of metastases, systemic inflammation and the ensuing symptom cluster known&#xD;
      as anorexia-cachexia syndrome. This syndrome includes cachexia (anorexia, weight loss and&#xD;
      muscle wasting), fatigue, weakness, pain, dyspnea, nausea, malaise, depression and poor&#xD;
      performance status. Patients suffering from this syndrome also have poor tolerance, adherence&#xD;
      and response to anti-cancer therapy, resulting in disease progression and reduced life&#xD;
      expectancy. In spite of the dire need, no proven options for treating inflammatory cancer&#xD;
      cachexia are currently available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VT-122 is the co-administration of the cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) inhibitor, etodolac and the&#xD;
      beta-adrenergic antagonist, propranolol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that these drugs can attenuate systemic inflammation and ameliorate the&#xD;
      symptoms of inflammatory cachexia in patients with advanced cancer. As a result, this&#xD;
      treatment may improve tolerability and adherence to anti-cancer therapy, thereby yielding&#xD;
      direct and indirect benefits in reducing disease progression and improving both the life&#xD;
      expectancy and quality of life for patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potentially synergistic activities of beta blockers and COX-2 inhibitors, their&#xD;
      offsetting side effects and their known beneficial impact on co-morbidities associated with&#xD;
      liver failure may make them well-suited for use with sorafenib, the standard of care for&#xD;
      patients with advanced HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether use of VT-122 is safe and effective in&#xD;
      cachectic patients with advanced HCC. In addition to assessing cachexia-related symptoms, the&#xD;
      ability of the VT-122 regimen to improve tolerability to sorafenib and thereby to improve&#xD;
      both survival and quality of life will also be assessed.&#xD;
