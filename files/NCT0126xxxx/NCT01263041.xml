      effects of enteral l-arginine to decrease feeding intolerance and risk of NEC in neonates via&#xD;
      its role as a NO precursor. Also, enteral glutamine which may play a role as an&#xD;
      immunomodulator on preterm neonates. all these had never been studied in developing countries&#xD;
      where sepsis and nec act as a major participant in mortality rates.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common acquired gastrointestinal disease that&#xD;
      occurs predominantly in premature infants and is considered to be one of the leading causes&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality in their age group (Schnabl et al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary prevention of NEC should be the priority, since NEC frequently progresses from&#xD;
      nonspecific signs, to extensive necrosis within a matter of hours with medical or surgical&#xD;
      treatment, making successful treatment and secondary prevention difficult to achieve (Lin et&#xD;
      al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the assumed novel preventive measures against NEC is L-arginine &amp; glutamine&#xD;
      supplementation to high risk infants (Neu, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We conducted a prospective, interventional, single blinded clinical study in the period from&#xD;
      1/2011- 3/2014 in both NICUs of Children Hospital &amp; Maternity Hospital of Ain Shams&#xD;
      University. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Faculty of Medicinie, Ain&#xD;
      Shams University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study was to assess the preventive role of enteral L-arginine &amp; glutamine against&#xD;
      NEC and to assess the role of glutamine in decreasing the impact of sepsis on premature&#xD;
      neonates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy five preterm neonates were enrolled. Inclusion criteria were GA≤ 34 weeks assigned to&#xD;
      feed in the first week of life. Exclusion criteria were the presence of any contraindication&#xD;
      to feeding (e.g. intestinal surgery), sever or multiple congenital anomalies, intracranial&#xD;
      hemorrhage &gt; grade 2 or non- bacterial congenital infection. They were equally divided into 3&#xD;
      groups (L-arginine group, Glutamine group &amp; Control group), 25 neonates per group were&#xD;
      randomly enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-arginine group included 25 preterm neonates among which 56% were females. Mean for birth&#xD;
      weight was 1.45kg, mean for gestational age was 31.84 weeks, 72% were delivered via CS.&#xD;
      Median for APGAR score at 1 &amp; 5 minutes were 6 &amp; 8 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for the glutamine group, among the 25 neonates included, 52% were females, 92% were born&#xD;
      to CS. Mean for birth weight was 1.45kg while mean for GA was 31.84 weeks. Median for APGAR&#xD;
      score was 5 in 1st minute (significantly lower than other 2 groups) and 8 at 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In control group that also included 25 neonates, 56% were females and 88% were born to CS.&#xD;
      Mean for birth weight was significantly lower if compared to other groups (1.31 kg) while GA&#xD;
      was comparable to them (30.64). Median for APGAR score in 1 &amp; 5 minutes was 7 &amp; 8&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study subjects received their usual care and medications according to the treating&#xD;
      physicians' protocols of management. Additionally, L-arginine group received enteral&#xD;
      l-arginine supplementation (starting 0.75mmol/kg/day and reaching 1.5 mmol/kg/day when&#xD;
      enteral feeding reaches 40% of full intake), while glutamine group additionally received&#xD;
      enteral glutamine supplementations (starting 156mg/kg/day and reaching 312 mg/kg/day when&#xD;
      enteral feeding reaches 40% of full intake). The additional enteral supplementations where&#xD;
      added with the start of feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects were followed up daily since the time of enrollment till they were discharged,&#xD;
      died or completed 30 days of life. Daily measurement of weight, blood pressure and blood&#xD;
      sugar level were done. Feeding protocol of all patients was recorded regarding age on which&#xD;
      feeding was initiated, daily increment of feeding, frequency of feeding intolerance, and&#xD;
      stoppage of feeding for any stage of NEC. Frequency of septic episodes and hospital stay were&#xD;
      also recorded. Plasma l-arginine &amp; glutamine levels were measured at time of enrollment&#xD;
      (sample 1), after 15 days of enrollment (sample 2) and at time of diagnosis of any stage of&#xD;
      NEC (sample 3). Staging and diagnosis were done according to Bell's criteria. Transcranial&#xD;
      ultrasound was done to all study subjects at time of enrollment, before discharge and&#xD;
      whenever needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall incidence of NEC was 12%. Comparing the groups, glutamine group had significant lower&#xD;
      incidence of NEC while no difference in NEC incidence was found between L-arginine &amp; control&#xD;
      group. Lower gestational age and birth weight were significant risk factors, however; both&#xD;
      didn't affect the age of NEC diagnosis. MOD, gender, age on starting feeding and daily&#xD;
      increment (wither &gt; 20cc or ≤ 20 cc/kg/day) also didn't affect the incidence of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the NEC outcome,3 patients were diagnosed as having NEC in arginine group among&#xD;
      which one suffered stage 1 (improved), one suffered stage 2 NEC (improved), and one suffered&#xD;
      stage 2 (died), while in control group, among the 6 diagnosed neonates, one suffered stage 1&#xD;
      (died), 5 suffered stage 2 (0ne improved &amp; 4 died). Occurrence of NEC significantly increased&#xD;
      risk of mortality &amp; delayed reaching full oral intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall mortality in the whole study was 13.3%. No significant difference between the 3&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While age on starting feeding was significantly higher in glutamine group (p&lt;0.05), it had no&#xD;
      effect on the length of stay or the clinical outcome on the 3 groups. Regarding the frequency&#xD;
      of septic episodes, length of stay and attacks of feeding intolerance, no significant&#xD;
      difference was reported between the 3 groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As for plasma levels of l-arginine &amp; glutamine, no significant difference was estimated among&#xD;
      control and glutamine groups regarding initial glutamine levels while edscap group had&#xD;
      significantly higher initial l-arginine level compared to l- arginine group. Both l-arginine&#xD;
      and glutamine levels were significantly higher in sample 2 in all groups when compared to&#xD;
      sample 1 of same patient. However, their levels in sample 2 were significantly correlated to&#xD;
      the initial levels rather than their diverse enteral supplementation. No correlation was&#xD;
      found between l-arginine and glutamine plasma levels at point of diagnosis of NEC to initial&#xD;
      level, gestational age or birth weight. Reaching the full oral intake was significantly&#xD;
      delayed in NEC patients, while it wasn't affected by age of initiation of feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessing the side effects that may be contributed to L-arginine, incidence of hypotension&#xD;
      requiring inotropic management or hyperglycemia requiring insulin therapy showed no&#xD;
      statistical significance between the 3 groups denoting possible safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the study supports the finding that enteral glutamine supplementation may be helpful&#xD;
      in decreasing the incidence of NEC in preterm neonates. However, this beneficial role was not&#xD;
      proven for arginine against NEC, or for glutamine itself against sepsis. Larger studies are&#xD;
      needed to confirm the results.&#xD;
