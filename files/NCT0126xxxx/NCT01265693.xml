    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of antiviral therapy with pegylated interferon&#xD;
      alpha for hepatitis C and B on auditory disability as there are reports in the English&#xD;
      literature on auditory disability caused by interferon alpha.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population to be studied: Patients with chronic hepatitis C or B treated by pegylated&#xD;
      interferon- alpha.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design Primary end-point: to assess the rate of auditory disability induced by&#xD;
      pegylated interferon alpha for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitisB virus (HBV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary end-point: to investigate the outcome of auditory disability induced by pegylated&#xD;
      interferon alpha for HCV and HBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type/design of trial to be conducted: Prospective, longitudinal and controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each participant, base line conventional auditory assessment will be performed as well as&#xD;
      during and at the end of treatment. The results will be compared to base-line measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At base line (pre treatment), all participants will undergo a thorough conventional&#xD;
      audiological assessment including clinical assessment by an ear, nose and throat (E.N.T)&#xD;
      specialist and pure-tone audiometry (air conduction and if necessary also bone conduction),&#xD;
      speech reception threshold and discrimination. In case of conductive defect detection,&#xD;
      tympanometry will be added to auditory assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pure-tone audiometry will be re-performed at week 12 of anti-viral treatment and at the end&#xD;
      of therapy: at week 24 in genotype 2/3 patients or at week 48 or 72 in genotype 1 patients.&#xD;
      Additional unscheduled audiometry tests will be performed at any time during the study if a&#xD;
      participant will complain of hearing loss or tinnitus, or as follow-up assessment in patients&#xD;
      with treatment-induced hearing loss (as scheduled by the E.N.T specialist (co-investigator).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following audiometric parameters will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pure Tone Average (PTA)- (parameter which reflects the average frequencies 500, 1000 and&#xD;
           2000HZ) for each ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speech Reception Threshold (SRT) for each ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Discrimination values for each ear&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The degree of hearing loss (decrease in threshold sensitivity) compared with base line&#xD;
           measurements [Î”-differences in decibels (dB)]. If hearing loss will be detected within&#xD;
           several frequencies, the average degree of decreased sensitivity will be determined&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Presence/absence of tinnitus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Objectives and Purpose To assess the rate and the outcome of auditory disability&#xD;
      induced by pegylated interferon alpha in patients with chronic viral hepatitis C and B&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hearing loss is defined as a decrease in threshold sensitivity of 15 dB or greater at one or&#xD;
      more test frequencies in relation to the base line measurements (in order to increase the&#xD;
      sensitivity of hearing loss detection).&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Auditory disability&quot; exists if either hearing loss or tinnitus occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of anti-treatment-induced hearing loss/tinnitus:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of detection of hearing loss as per scheduled audiometric testing or following&#xD;
      clinical symptoms (patient's complaints) or if tinnitus occurs, the following management will&#xD;
      be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Repeated pure-tone audiometry will be performed every 5 days (up to 4 tests) as in most&#xD;
           cases, recovery of hearing loss occurs within 2 weeks. Further need for additional&#xD;
           follow-up audiometric testing will be determined by the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A discussion will be performed and documented in any case of auditory disability. The&#xD;
           severity of hearing loss and degree of functional impairment, the results of follow-up&#xD;
           audiometric testing, the severity of liver disease and the necessity of the continuation&#xD;
           of anti viral therapy will be discussed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases with mild, non-clinically significant and non-progressive hearing loss, continuation&#xD;
      of anti viral therapy is optional. In that case, only follow-up measurements and testing with&#xD;
      no further intervention will be carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for concomitant short course of corticosteroids treatment will be discussed per each&#xD;
      case. In cases with significant and/or progressive hearing loss or severe tinnitus, cessation&#xD;
      of anti-viral treatment will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be identified by initials and trial number in the case report form&#xD;
      (CRF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and Withdrawal of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection who will receive anti viral treatment&#xD;
      consists of PEG-IFN-alpha-2a or 2b combined with ribavirin, Patients with chronic hepatitis B&#xD;
      who receive anti-viral treatment with PEG-IFN-alpha 2a (Pegasys) Age 18-70 who are eligible&#xD;
      for anti viral treatment. Patients who attend and are treated in the Liver Unit of Haifa and&#xD;
      Western Galilee District of Clalit Health Services and Carmel Medical Center will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with all HCV genotypes will be included and will be treated by the standard-of-care&#xD;
      therapy for hepatitis C: 48 weeks for genotypes 1 or 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and 24 weeks for genotypes 2 or 3. Virological response will be determined at week&#xD;
      12 of treatment. In non-responders therapy will be discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In those patients with genotype 1 and &quot;slow virological response&quot;, 72 weeks of therapy will&#xD;
      be considered. Included will be also patients with chronic hepatitis B receiving PEG-IFN&#xD;
      alpha 2a for up to 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study completion is anticipated at 3 years after its initiation. Subject exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with severe base line (pre anti-viral treatment) hearing loss (&gt;70 dB hearing&#xD;
           levels by PTA) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Refusal to participate in the study Subject withdrawal criteria: subjects who refuse to&#xD;
           continue participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Safety Auditory assessment is not associated with adverse events and it is&#xD;
      completely safe&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics The distributions of continuous variables will be analyzed using the&#xD;
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for normality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measured auditory parameters (decibels) of the patients will be compared between the&#xD;
      three measurement times using the ANOVA test for repetitive measurements or the Friedman&#xD;
      Two-way ANOVA test, as needed (for parametric and non-parametric groups respectively),&#xD;
      followed by the Bonferroni post hoc test for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical groups will be evaluated for associations using the Chi-square test or the&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test, as needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two-tailed p values of 0.05 or less will be considered significant. The number of subjects&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled 100 patients. Criteria for the termination of the trial. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed only fpr participants who will complete auditory assessment before&#xD;
      during and at the end of therapy.&#xD;
