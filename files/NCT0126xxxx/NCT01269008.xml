      Post-prandial hyperglycemia occurs despite meticulous carbohydrate counting and rapid acting&#xD;
      insulin therapy. Furthermore, this occurs even in the setting of the closed loop system.&#xD;
      Currently the algorithm used for calculating the glucose-responsive insulin delivery cannot&#xD;
      respond in a timely fashion to the glucose absorption resulting from a meal. In diabetes,&#xD;
      there is paradoxical immediate post-prandial hyperglucagonemia that results in immediate&#xD;
      post-prandial hyperglycemia. Amylin deficiency and/or dysregulated GLP-1 seems to be the&#xD;
      etiology. Pharmacologic replacement of these hormones alleviates immediate post-prandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia in diabetes. With this protocol, the investigators would like to optimize&#xD;
      treatment of T1DM by physiologic replacement of hormones in addition to insulin and in the&#xD;
      process also optimize the insulin algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a paired, randomized, and controlled comparison of pramlintide and insulin versus&#xD;
      exenatide and insulin Vs insulin monotherapy using the ePID closed-loop system for insulin&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will stratify the study subjects into the following sub-groups of 5&#xD;
      subjects of 22-30 years old, 4 subjects of 18-21 years old, 4 subjects of 16-18 years old.&#xD;
      The investigators would also begin the study with the 21-25 year patient sub-group and then&#xD;
      transition to the other sub-groups after evaluating all the safety issues. 22-30 year old&#xD;
      ones would be considered as an adult subset, 18-21 year olds would be considered pediatric&#xD;
      subset according to the guidelines of FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH)&#xD;
      and 16-18 year olds are considered typical pediatric population. At this time,&#xD;
      Spanish-speaking subjects will not be recruited because Medtronic Minimed as yet does not&#xD;
      have any literature in Spanish that may used in explaining the study to this group of&#xD;
      patients. When in the future Medtronic is able to provide us with the appropriate Spanish&#xD;
      literature, the investigators will at that time amend the protocol to include this group of&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes complications can be minimized or forestalled with the use of intensive insulin&#xD;
      management. In the post-Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) era, diabetologists&#xD;
      around the globe are engaged in developing better methods of improving glycemic control in&#xD;
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). To achieve the DCCT-recommended glycemic and&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) goals, in addition to physicians, engineering and pharmaceutical&#xD;
      companies are augmenting our ability to improve control by innovative compounds and&#xD;
      technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring. Despite these substantial advances,&#xD;
      hyper- and hypoglycemia continue to be problematic in the management of T1DM, especially in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current T1DM management involves checking blood glucose pre-prandially and once at bedtime (4&#xD;
      times/day), and making insulin dose adjustments based on these 4 blood glucose measurements.&#xD;
      This approach is woefully inadequate. Post-meal hyperglycemia is missed, and low blood&#xD;
      glucose is undetected until the patient has symptomatic hypoglycemia. Moreover, we depend on&#xD;
      patients to make appropriate dose modifications to basal rates of insulin when on the pump,&#xD;
      without the guidance of adequate blood glucose measurements. The continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring system (CGMS) is increasingly studied as a tool to examine glucose trends, and is&#xD;
      helping to combat inadequate self-monitoring. However, the CGMS still relies on the patient's&#xD;
      ability to make accurate insulin dose adjustments based on glucose readings. To address this&#xD;
      issue the closed loop system is now under investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The closed loop system is developed to closely emulate physiologic insulin delivery. The&#xD;
      algorithm was developed by modeling beta cells and validated by hyperglycemic clamp studies&#xD;
      using the subcutaneous site for measurement of blood glucose and insulin delivery. The&#xD;
      algorithm is known as the external Physiologic Insulin Delivery (ePID). Current studies&#xD;
      suggest that basal requirements are detected accurately, and the algorithm responds&#xD;
      effectively. However, meal related elevation in blood glucose remains a challenge, as when&#xD;
      blood glucose levels begin to rise and are seen in the subcutaneous glucose sensor signal, it&#xD;
      is already too late to administer insulin in a way that will effectively minimize the&#xD;
      postprandial glucose peak. Improvements in the ePID algorithm have been studied to improve&#xD;
      the postprandial response with some success, but require user intervention for best results,&#xD;
      and despite that glucose excursions fail to normalize in the post-prandial period. It is&#xD;
      likely that further improvements in postprandial glycemia will be limited with insulin&#xD;
      monotherapy. Besides insulin there are other dysregulated hormones such as glucagon and&#xD;
      amylin, which contribute to post-prandial hyperglycemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autoimmune destruction of insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas is presumed to&#xD;
      cause T1DM. In addition to insulin, other hormones such as glucagon and amylin play a role in&#xD;
      normalizing glucose excursions. Failure of glucagon suppression results in immediate&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycemia, and a loss of glucagon response to hypoglycemia results in late&#xD;
      postprandial hypoglycemia. Despite the increasing use of subcutaneous continuous insulin&#xD;
      administration and newer insulin analogs, insulin replacement remains imperfect, and glucose&#xD;
      excursions are inadequately controlled in diabetes. This suggests that other factors, in&#xD;
      addition to diet and insulin management, may need to be addressed if postprandial glucose&#xD;
      excursions are to be normalized in T1DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent discovery of the hormone amylin has enhanced our understanding of postprandial&#xD;
      glucose homeostasis. Patients with T1DM have deficiencies of both insulin and amylin. Amylin,&#xD;
      a 37-amino acid polypeptide hormone, is co-secreted from the pancreatic beta cells in&#xD;
      conjunction with insulin in response to nutrient stimuli. Amylin, in the immediate&#xD;
      postprandial period, may mediate part of its effect by suppressing glucagon secretion,&#xD;
      resulting in the suppression of hepatic glucose production and the slowing of gastric&#xD;
      emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pramlintide acetate is a synthetic analog of the naturally occurring human hormone amylin. It&#xD;
      effectively reproduces amylin agonist activity in an equipotent fashion. Pramlintide acetate&#xD;
      has been reported to improve glycemic control in adults with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus. Specifically, postprandial glucose excursions are improved with adjunctive&#xD;
      pramlintide use compared with insulin monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exenatide is a synthetic analog of exendin-4. It is FDA approved for use in adults with type&#xD;
      2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Clinical studies indicate that exenatide is very effective in&#xD;
      decreasing postprandial glucose excursions. The investigator's brochure for exenatide&#xD;
      suggested that in adults with T2DM, exenatide was well tolerated at 0.1 mcg/ kg/ dose, and&#xD;
      resulted in glucose lowering. Our preliminary data in children with T1DM suggests that 1.25&#xD;
      mcg and 2.5 mcg are good pre-prandial initial doses with a prandial insulin dose reduction of&#xD;
      30%. The principal mechanism of action in T1DM is suppression of glucagon, with a subsequent&#xD;
      suppression of hepatic glucose production and decreased immediate post-prandial&#xD;
      hyperglycemia. These effects result in further reduction of HbA1c beyond the reduction&#xD;
      observed with insulin alone. Additionally, in T2DM, exenatide delays gastric emptying, and&#xD;
      decreases food intake through centrally mediated mechanisms causing satiety and improved&#xD;
      weight control. The most notable adverse effect of exenatide is nausea, which improves with&#xD;
      the duration of treatment and steady dose escalation of exenatide. Hypoglycemia may occur&#xD;
      with concurrent use of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current exploratory studies we are proposing a novel way to combat immediate&#xD;
      postprandial hyperglycemia in subjects with T1DM by using the study medications through the&#xD;
      experimental closed loop system. Subjects will not be on the closed loop system prior to&#xD;
      eligibility, and would not have used the closed loop system at an earlier time. We will use&#xD;
      prandial pramlintide/exenatide in the first protocol, and test the hypothesis that this&#xD;
      intervention will be superior to using insulin monotherapy in the closed loop system. This&#xD;
      would be a Biologic, phase I, single center study and a paired, randomized, and controlled&#xD;
      comparison of pramlintide and insulin versus exenatide and insulin Vs insulin monotherapy&#xD;
      using the ePID closed-loop system for insulin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will stratify the study subjects into the following sub-groups of 5 subjects of 22-30&#xD;
      years old, 4 subjects of 18-21 years old, 4 subjects of 16-18 years old. We would also begin&#xD;
      the study with the 22-30 year patient sub-group and then transition to the other sub-groups&#xD;
      after evaluating all the safety issues. 22-30 year old ones would be considered as an adult&#xD;
      subset, 18-21 year olds would be considered pediatric subset according to the guidelines of&#xD;
      FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and 16-18 year olds are considered&#xD;
      typical pediatric population. At this time, Spanish-speaking subjects will not be recruited&#xD;
      because Medtronic Minimed as yet does not have any literature in Spanish that may be used in&#xD;
      explaining the study to this group of patients. When in the future Medtronic is able to&#xD;
      provide us with the appropriate Spanish literature, we will at that time amend the protocol&#xD;
      to include this group of subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening: Screening evaluations will be performed 1-2 months prior to study enrollment, and&#xD;
      will consist of an informed consent, medical history, physical examination (including height,&#xD;
      weight, and vital signs), and blood samples for clinical laboratory tests. The clinical&#xD;
      laboratory tests will include a CBC to check for anemia, hemoglobin A1C (within last month),&#xD;
      serum electrolytes, serum amylase, Serum HCG pregnancy test for female subjects. The&#xD;
      approximate volume of blood is expected to be less than 5 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following informed consent (and with appropriate subject assent) if subject is found eligible&#xD;
      for the study, they will undergo a baseline open-loop evaluation using a Medtronic Data&#xD;
      logger continuous glucose monitor (Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA). The data on glucose&#xD;
      excursions will be collected on their usual insulin dosages so as to appropriately configure&#xD;
      the algorithm of the closed-loop system during the inpatient admission. Basal rates and&#xD;
      insulin to carbohydrate ratios will be adjusted during the period between screening and the&#xD;
      start of the 3 studies that they will undergo subsequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After screening, subjects will undergo a 3-period crossover design trial in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study A Subjects will be admitted to the general clinical research center (GCRC) on the&#xD;
      evening prior to the study at 6 PM. For female subjects a stat serum HCG pregnancy test is&#xD;
      done prior to the start of the study. Two sensors will be placed in the subcutaneous tissue.&#xD;
      Insertion of IV line will occur between 9-10 PM. During the night hourly samples of blood&#xD;
      glucose will be used to adjust insulin basal or boluses so as to maintain euglycemia. Around&#xD;
      6 a.m. subjects will be started on the closed-loop system for the automated delivery of&#xD;
      insulin based on the glucose sensor measurements. An intravenous line will be inserted in the&#xD;
      antecubital fossa to maintain blood glucose concentrations within the normal range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for basal glucose, insulin, and glucagon concentrations will be drawn at minus&#xD;
      30, minus 10, and 0 min prior to study start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study A (Control): Subjects will receive meals at 0 minutes (approximately 7 AM&#xD;
      breakfast), 300 min (approximately Noon lunch) and dinner at 600 min (approximately 5 PM&#xD;
      dinner). A partial bolus of insulin will be administered prior to breakfast in addition to&#xD;
      closed loop system (since the system is not expected to have calibrated by the time of&#xD;
      breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study B: Subjects will receive 30 mcg of pramlintide just before 300 and 600 minutes.&#xD;
      Pramlintide will be administered as a subcutaneous injection just prior to lunch and dinner.&#xD;
      A partial bolus of insulin will be administered for breakfast in addition to closed loop&#xD;
      system (since the system is not expected to have calibrated by the time of breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For study C: Subjects will receive 2.5 mcg of exenatide subcutaneously just before 300 and&#xD;
      600 min. Exenatide will be administered as a subcutaneous injection just prior to lunch and&#xD;
      dinner. A partial bolus of insulin will be administered for breakfast in addition to closed&#xD;
      loop system (since the system is not expected to have calibrated by the time of breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 0 mins, subjects will drink a standard liquid meal of Boost High Protein Drink 9.6 oz (360&#xD;
      calories, 40 g of carbohydrate) over a period of 10 min. This meal will not be counted in the&#xD;
      final analysis since the closed loop system will not have had enough time to adjust to the&#xD;
      basal conditions of the meal. A partial bolus of insulin will be administered for breakfast&#xD;
      in addition to closed loop system (since the system is not expected to have calibrated by the&#xD;
      time of breakfast).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 300 minutes, subjects will receive a solid meal based on Estimated Energy Requirements&#xD;
      (EER) as reported by the Institute of Medicine Dietary Reference Intakes macronutrients&#xD;
      report, 2002. The carbohydrate content of the meal will be 75 g. Pramlintide 30 mcg/&#xD;
      Exenatide 2.5 mcg will be administered subcutaneously before lunch and dinner. Insulin will&#xD;
      be administered based on ePID algorithm by the closed loop system in response to glucose&#xD;
      concentrations detected by subcutaneous sensing. Blood samples for glucose concentrations&#xD;
      will be drawn every 15min-half hour (more frequently immediately after meals) after&#xD;
      initiating closed loop system. Blood samples for hormone analysis (insulin,&#xD;
      pramlintide/exenatide and glucagon) will be drawn at approximately every 15 min to half hour&#xD;
      intervals after lunch which will be served at approximately around Noon in the first hour and&#xD;
      then every half to one hour until dinner. Dinner will be served at approximately around 5 PM&#xD;
      (the carbohydrate content of the meal will be similar to lunch). Blood glucose will be&#xD;
      measured at the bedside using a YSI glucose analyzer every half hour. The study will end at&#xD;
      885 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total blood volume drawn for studies A, B, and C will be approximately 97cc, 133cc and 133cc&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject's will be always monitored by nursing staff of the CRC, study staff and the PI is&#xD;
      available by phone and on call during the study. Medtronic personnel will be present for the&#xD;
      first four studies to ensure all the equipment is working optimally and to provide guidance&#xD;
      related to the closed loop system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, if subject's blood glucose values are less than 70 mg/dl, oral glucose&#xD;
      (5-15 g) will be administered for countering low blood glucose to achieve euglycemia (90-130&#xD;
      mg/dl). 1-2 doses of oral glucose should correct hypoglycemia. If more than 4 consecutive&#xD;
      doses are required to achieve euglycemia the study will be terminated, and the subject will&#xD;
      be offered a meal tray and blood sugar rechecked to ensure euglycemia. Additional 0.2 cc&#xD;
      blood samples for glucose may be necessary to ensure safety during an episode of hypoglycemia&#xD;
      and these may be done before the scheduled time for blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If blood glucose by Analox machine is greater than 300mg/dl, blood ketones will be measured&#xD;
      and if ketones are above 1.5 mmol/L we will terminate the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study the subject will be evaluated by the research staff for the need to&#xD;
      receive a snack. A snack will be served before discharge only if BG of subject is less than&#xD;
      70mg/ dl at the end of the study. If the Principal Investigator or the attending physician&#xD;
      feels that the subject needs to be observed for a longer period of time then it would be at&#xD;
      his/her discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will return two additional times (2-4 weeks apart) to complete the exact same&#xD;
      study, with the difference that if the patient received pramlintide on the last occasion&#xD;
      he/she will get either exenatide or just insulin via the closed loop system at the subsequent&#xD;
      visits. (Total of 3 visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female subjects would have a stat serum HCG pregnancy test is done prior to the start of the&#xD;
      study for each visit. Subjects will have stat CBC prior to initiating closed loop study.&#xD;
      Serum Electrolytes will be done at the onset of the study and then will be repeated if the&#xD;
      patient had vomiting at the end of the study. Serum amylase would be done at each visit and&#xD;
      the results would be tracked on the case report forms. Capillary blood glucose check would be&#xD;
      done when necessary as an extra safety measure in addition to subject's blood glucose being&#xD;
      monitored through YSI and interstitial glucose monitored through glucose sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For uniformity sake, we would be using only using Insulin Aspart for the entire duration of&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at least four subjects develop grade 3 nausea, with the 30 mcg dosage of pramlintide or&#xD;
      with the 2.5 mcg of exenatide then the protocol would be modified so that the subjects&#xD;
      receive only a 15 mcg dose of pramlintide and 1.25 mcg of exenatide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT FOR SEVERE NAUSEA: If severe nausea develops during the study, Zofran 0.15 mg/kg IV&#xD;
      will be given. The maximum dose is 8 mg. If the subject still has emesis, the study subject&#xD;
      would be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study drugs and study laboratory tests will be provided at no cost to the subject. The&#xD;
      subjects will receive $70 at screening and $210 for the three subsequent study visits. The&#xD;
      total compensation involved for the study would be $ 700.&#xD;
