    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of veliparib when given together&#xD;
      with radiation therapy in treating patients with advanced solid malignancies (abnormal cells&#xD;
      divide without control and can invade nearby tissues) with peritoneal carcinomatosis,&#xD;
      epithelial ovarian, fallopian, or primary peritoneal cancer. Veliparib may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. Giving veliparib with radiation therapy may kill more&#xD;
      tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the maximum tolerable dose of veliparib in combination with low-dose&#xD;
      fractionated whole abdominal radiation therapy (LDFWAR) in patients with peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis from advanced solid malignancies. At dose levels 5 and 6: to determine the&#xD;
      maximum tolerable dose of veliparib in combination with LDFWAR in patients with epithelial&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal cancers with intraabdominal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of veliparib in conjunction with&#xD;
      LDFWAR in patients with peritoneal carcinomatosis from advanced solid malignancies; at dose&#xD;
      levels 5 and 6: to determine the safety and toxicity of veliparib in combination with LDFWAR&#xD;
      in patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian or primary peritoneal cancers with&#xD;
      intraabdominal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess clinical activity of veliparib plus LDFWAR in patients with peritoneal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis from advanced solid malignancies as assessed by response rate by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria. At dose levels 5 and 6: to assess&#xD;
      the clinical activity of veliparib plus LDFWAR in patients with epithelial ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
      or primary peritoneal cancer and intraabdominal disease as assessed by response rate by&#xD;
      RECIST 1.1 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Evaluate if microsatellite instability or baseline levels of various deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) repair proteins (excision repair cross-complementing 1 [ERCC1], x-ray repair&#xD;
      complementing defective repair in Chinese hamster cells 1 [XRCC1], breast cancer 1, early&#xD;
      onset [BRCA1], breast cancer 2, early onset [BRCA2], poly [adenosine diphosphate&#xD;
      (ADP)-ribosyl]ation [PAR]) correlate with clinical activity of this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Evaluate changes in quality of life for patients treated with this regimen by serial&#xD;
      measurements using the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (QLQC-30) standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 (days 5-21 of course&#xD;
      1). Patients undergo LDFWAR in BID on days 1 and 5 of weeks 1-3. Treatment repeats every 28&#xD;
      days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months.&#xD;
