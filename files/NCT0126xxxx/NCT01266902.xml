    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide continued access to TMC278 in HIV-1 infected patients&#xD;
      who were randomized and treated with TMC278 in the Phase IIb or Phase III trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase III, open-label (all people know the identity of the drug), multicenter,&#xD;
      roll-over trial to provide continued access to TMC278 to HIV-1 infected patients who were&#xD;
      randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance) and treated with TMC278 in the Phase IIb&#xD;
      (TMC278-C204 [C204]) or Phase III trials (i.e., TMC278-TiDP6-C209 [C209] or TMC278-TiDP6-C215&#xD;
      [C215]) and who continue to benefit from their antiretroviral treatment, according to the&#xD;
      investigator. In addition, information on the long-term safety and tolerability, including&#xD;
      resistance data in case of virologic failures, of oral doses of TMC278 25 mg once daily&#xD;
      (q.d.) in combination with a background regimen containing 2 N(t)RTIs will be collected.&#xD;
      Available efficacy data will also be collected. Approximately 750 HIV-1 infected individuals&#xD;
      are expected to participate in this trial. The duration of participation in the study for an&#xD;
      individual participant will be 2 to 3 years. The final/withdrawal visit of the Phase IIb or&#xD;
      Phase III trials will be the first visit of this trial. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      evaluated throughout the trial. Visits and assessments performed should be based on the&#xD;
      local, generally accepted standard of care, with visits occurring at least every 6 months.&#xD;
      Oral tablets of TMC278 25 mg once daily (q.d.) should be administered together with a meal.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Grade 3/4 Events of Rash Irrespective of Causality</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>Number of participants with grade 3/4 events of rash irrespective of causality were assessed. A grade 3 rash defined as diffuse macular, maculopapular or morbilliform rash with vesicles or limited number of bullae or; rash with superficial ulcerations of mucous membranes limited to 1 anatomical site or; rash with at least one of the following: elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than 2*baseline value and at least 5 times upper limit of normal; fever greater than (&gt;) 38 degree celsius or 100 degree fahrenheit; eosinophils &gt; 1000/millimeter (mm)^3; serum sickness-like reaction. A grade 4 rash defined as the following: extensive or generalized bullous lesions or; Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome (SJS) or ulceration of mucous membrane involving 2 or more distinct mucosal sites or toxic epidermal necrolysis.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Virologic Rebound</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 360</time_frame>
    <description>Time to virologic rebound was time to (first) human immunodeficiency virus type1 (HIV-1) ribonucleic acid (RNA) greater than or equal to (&gt;=) 50 or &gt;=200 copies/milliliter (copies/mL). The mean survival time and its standard error were underestimated because the largest observation was censored and the estimation was restricted to the largest event time.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time To Treatment Failure</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Week 360</time_frame>
    <description>Time to treatment failure was defined as time to virologic rebound (time to first HIV-1 RNA &gt;= 50 or &gt;= 200 copies/mL) or discontinuation for reason other than RPV having become commercially available in the participating country, whichever came first, calculated as the time (in days) from baseline until treatment failure. The mean survival time and its standard error were underestimated because the largest observation was censored and the estimation was restricted to the largest event time.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline up to weeks 96, 192, 288, 336</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in CD4+ cell count were reported for NC=F approach (participants who discontinued because RPV became commercially available or could be accessed through another source or because the participants switched to other local [RPV-based] treatment options or local standard of care, were censored at that time; other participants after discontinuation had their CD4+ values imputed with baseline value. Intermittently missing values were imputed with a last observation carried-forward approach).</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 7 years</time_frame>
    <description>A SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: results in death; is life threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <pre_assignment_details>Total of 482 participants were treated and 437 discontinued at data cut-off date (8 February 2018) because they switched to commercially available rilpivirine (RPV) (371 participants), as planned per protocol. Only 6 of the 482 participants discontinued as they reached a virologic endpoint. At last contact date of last participant under Protocol Amendment 3 (28 February 2020), out of 45 participants 37 switched to commercially available RPV and 6 were lost to follow-up.</pre_assignment_details>

A grade 3 rash defined as diffuse macular, maculopapular or morbilliform rash with vesicles or limited number of bullae or; rash with superficial ulcerations of mucous membranes limited to 1 anatomical site or; rash with at least one of the following: elevations in aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) more than 2*baseline value and at least 5 times upper limit of normal; fever greater than (&gt;) 38 degree celsius or 100 degree fahrenheit; eosinophils &gt; 1000/millimeter (mm)^3; serum sickness-like reaction. A grade 4 rash defined as the following: extensive or generalized bullous lesions or; Stevens-Johnsons Syndrome (SJS) or ulceration of mucous membrane involving 2 or more distinct mucosal sites or toxic epidermal necrolysis.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>Not all Adverse Events (AEs) were collected; AEs considered related to rilpivirine (RPV), leading to discontinuations, serious adverse events (SAEs), or grade 3/4 events of rash regardless of causality were collected; discontinuation rate was greater than (&gt;) 90 percent which makes interpretation of results difficult.</limitations_and_caveats>
