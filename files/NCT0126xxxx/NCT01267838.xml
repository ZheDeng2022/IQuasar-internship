&#xD;
      STUDY-SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need for stenting of the main and side branch (double stenting) in the treatment of&#xD;
      coronary bifurcation lesion primarily depends on the complexity of the bifurcation lesion. If&#xD;
      the bifurcation lesion is very complex (Medina classification 111, severe stenosis of both&#xD;
      branches, severe calcified lesion, long lesions etc.) double stenting may be the treatment of&#xD;
      choice. When double stenting is required, the most frequently used stenting techniques are&#xD;
      T-stenting and Culotte-stenting. It is still unclear, however, which double stent technique&#xD;
      yields the best long-term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized study will compare the long-term safety and efficacy of T-stenting versus&#xD;
      Culotte-stenting in the treatment of de-novo coronary bifurcation lesions with drug-eluting&#xD;
      stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-hundred patients in whom a double-stenting technique is intended for the treatment of a&#xD;
      de-novo coronary bifurcation lesion will be randomly assigned to T-stenting or&#xD;
      Culotte-stenting with an approved drug-eluting stent. Patients will undergo 9-month&#xD;
      angiographic follow-up with quantitative coronary angiography. Clinical follow-up is planed&#xD;
      at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 5 years. The primary study endpoint is the&#xD;
      maximal percent diameter stenosis in the bifurcation lesion at 9 months. Secondary endpoints&#xD;
      include binary restenosis (estimated by Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) analysis),&#xD;
      Target Lesion Revascularisation (TLR), Freedom from Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE) and&#xD;
      the rate of stent thrombosis according to the definition of the Academic Research Consortium&#xD;
      (ARC definition). The study will have 90% power to detect a 25% reduction in the primary&#xD;
      endpoint at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

      1. STUDY BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, a simple stepwise provisional T-stenting approach is most frequently used type of&#xD;
      treatment in coronary bifurcation lesions. When stenting of both the side branch and the main&#xD;
      branch (double stenting) is needed because of dissection, TIMI flow &lt; 2, high residual&#xD;
      stenosis &gt; 75% there is a variety of techniques, which have been proposed. The most common&#xD;
      techniques are T-stenting and Culotte-stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adriaenssens et al (1) have analysed the data of 132 patients treated with Culotte-stenting&#xD;
      including Quantitative Coronary Angiography (QCA) analysis and clinical follow-up 1 year post&#xD;
      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The authors demonstrated an incidence of binary&#xD;
      angiographic restenosis of 22% for the whole bifurcation lesion. Procedural angiographic&#xD;
      success was achieved in all lesions (final kissing balloon dilatation was performed in 62 %&#xD;
      of patients). At 12 months, 28 of 132 (21%) patients had undergone target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization. The incidence of stent thrombosis (at 1 year) was low (1.5%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ferenc et al. (2) compared systematic T-stenting with the provisional T-stenting in 202&#xD;
      patients of the BBK 1 study. There was no significant difference between the 2 strategies.&#xD;
      Overall, maximum percent diameter stenosis in the bifurcation was 31 % at 9 months,&#xD;
      corresponding to a binary restenosis rate of 11 %. Within 1-year follow-up, this prompted&#xD;
      target lesion reintervention in 9,9 % of the patients. The risk of late stent thrombosis was&#xD;
      low (2 %) at 2-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomised multicenter Nordic 2 study addressed the question whether Crush-stenting or&#xD;
      Culotte-stenting achieves better angiographic and clinical outcome after PCI in bifurcation&#xD;
      lesions (Erglis et al). The results demonstrated the superiority of Culotte-stenting as&#xD;
      compared to the Crush-stenting. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) as primary study endpoint&#xD;
      occurred in 3.7 % in the Culotte study arm as compared to 4.3 in the Crush study arm (p&#xD;
      =0.87). Likewise, in the double stent study arm of the BBC One study the Crush-stenting was&#xD;
      used successfully (Hildick-Smith, TCT Late Breaking Trials 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is no data from randomized trials comparing T-stenting with&#xD;
      Culotte-stenting.&#xD;

      2. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective, randomized, single-center evaluation of the treatment in de novo&#xD;
      bifurcated coronary lesions comparing a technique of T-stenting with Culotte-stenting using&#xD;
      approved drug- eluting stents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is a comparison of T-stenting with Culotte-stenting with&#xD;
      respect to the maximal percent diameter stenosis within the bifurcation at 9 months. In&#xD;
      addition the study will assess various safety parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-hundred patients will be enrolled in the study at one investigational site and will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to T-stenting or to Culotte-stenting of the bifurcation lesion. Any&#xD;
      approved drug-eluting stent can be used. The choice of stent is left to the operator's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this study is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In large coronary bifurcation lesions (main vessel ≥2.5mm, side branch ≥2.25mm) including&#xD;
      significant ostial side branch disease, Culotte-stenting compared with T-stenting reduces&#xD;
      maximal percent diameter stenosis at the bifurcation at 9-month follow-upby 25 %, relative.&#xD;
      results in a lower restenosis rate than T stenting technique with a comparable long-term&#xD;
      safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1. Primary Study Endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoint is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Maximal percent diameter stenosis at the bifurcation at 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2. Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary endpoints will be evaluated in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary restenosis (≥ 50% diameter stenosis) rate at any segment of the bifurcation at 9&#xD;
           month post procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TLR of the main and side branch at 12 months post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Binary restenosis (≥ 50% diameter stenosis) in the main and side branch at 9 months post&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MACE defined as death, Myocardial infarction (Q wave and Non-Q wave), emergent cardiac&#xD;
           bypass surgery, or TLR at 30 days, 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Device success defined as attainment of &lt; 30% residual stenosis of the target lesion&#xD;
           using drug-eluting stent (DES)in the main and side branch&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Procedure time, radiation time and volume of used contrast medium&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Post-procedure thrombotic stent occlusion at 12 and 24 months according to the&#xD;
                Academic Research Consortium-criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stent thrombosis is classified by the ARC definition as definite, probable, or possible and&#xD;
      as early (0 to 30 days), late (31 to 360 days), or very late (&gt;360 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of definite stent thrombosis requires the presence of an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome with angiographic or autopsy evidence of thrombus or occlusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probable stent thrombosis includes unexplained deaths within 30 days after the procedure or&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction involving the target-vessel territory without angiographic&#xD;
      confirmation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible stent thrombosis includes all unexplained deaths occurring at least 30 days after&#xD;
      the procedure. Intervening target-lesion revascularization is defined as any repeated&#xD;
      percutaneous revascularization of the stented segment, including the 5-mm proximal and distal&#xD;
      margins, that preceded stent thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;

      is designed as a non-blinded, randomized, single-center trial. Patients will be allocated to&#xD;
      T-stenting or to Culotte-stenting using a computer-generated random sequence, set in blocks&#xD;
      of 20 stratified to the type of drug-eluting stent in clinical use. The size of the block and&#xD;
      the random sequence will be select by the statistician and will be unknown to the&#xD;
      investigators and medical staff caring for the patients. Randomization will be performed&#xD;
      immediately before catheter treatment of the bifurcation lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. PROCEDURES BY VISIT&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1. Patient Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      All potential subjects should be consented prior to performing any study related procedures.&#xD;
      The investigator or representative will explain the nature and scope of the study, potential&#xD;
      risks and benefits of participation, and answer questions for the patient and/or legally&#xD;
      authorized representative. If the patient agrees to participate, the informed consent must be&#xD;
      signed and dated; a copy must be provided to the patient or legally authorized&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data to be collected will include demographics , angiograophic and clinical&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.2. Laboratory Assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG prior to procedure and between 12 hours and 24 hours post-procedure or before&#xD;
           hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CK and CKMB and Troponin T prior to procedure and 8 hours, 16 hours and 24 hours&#xD;
           post-procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3. Concomitant Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects receive the medication regimen listed below. All medications administered should&#xD;
      be recorded in the subjects medical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to Procedure Aspirin At least 400 mg per os Clopidogrel 600 mg loading dose or&#xD;
      Prasugrel 60 mg loading dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Procedure IV Heparin For angioplasty bolus 100 I.U./ kg/ KG IC Nitroglycerin 100 - 200&#xD;
      mcg prior to baseline and post intervention angiograms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Procedure Aspirin At least 100 mg per day indefinitely Clopidogrel 75 mg per day for at&#xD;
      least 6 months or Prasugrel 10 mg or 5 mg/die for at least 6 months as per clinical&#xD;
      indication&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (Abciximab) can be used only for bail out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4. Coronary Angiography and Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.1. Angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using standard procedures for angioplasty, an introducer sheath of at least 6 French will be&#xD;
      introduced and the heparin bolus will be administered. After introduction of the guiding&#xD;
      catheter and following intra-coronary injection of nitroglycerin, baseline angiography of the&#xD;
      vessel will be performed in at least two best views that show the target lesion free of&#xD;
      foreshortening or vessel overlap, using a 6 French or larger guiding catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.2. Lesion / Vessel Pre-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      For any patients with multiple lesions requiring treatment at the time of the index&#xD;
      procedure, lesions outside the target vessel must be treated first successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target lesion in the main branch will be crossed with an intracoronary guide wire of&#xD;
      0.014 inch diameter and a second guide wire is passed into the side branch to protect the&#xD;
      access. The choice of the appropriate guide wires is up to the discretion of the operator.&#xD;
      After successful passage with the guide wires the lesion in the main branch should be&#xD;
      pre-dilated with an appropriately sized balloon. Predilatation of the side branch before&#xD;
      stenting of the main branch is up to the discretion of the operator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.3. Stenting Procedure and Stenting Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the many approaches to bifurcation stenting, we chose techniques that avoid non-stented&#xD;
      gaps at the orifice of the side branch with minimal stent distortion or stent overlap in the&#xD;
      carina region or the proximal segment of the main branch. Both techniques the provisional&#xD;
      T-stenting as well the Culotte-stenting provide complete coverage of the side branch ostium.&#xD;
      Final 'kissing balloon' dilatation should be performed in all patients irrespective of&#xD;
      whether they were assigned to T-stenting or Culotte-stenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stents should be selected long enough to cover the lesions completely. If more than one stent&#xD;
      is needed to cover the lesion in the main or side branch completely, it is recommended to&#xD;
      overlap the stents 1 - 2 mm. The aim should be to reach a diameter stenosis &lt; 10% without&#xD;
      proximal and distal dissections. Post dilatation may be performed at the operators&#xD;
      discretion. Pre or post dilatation technique should avoid balloon injury to any segment of&#xD;
      the vessel that will not be entirely covered by the drug eluting stent including the patients&#xD;
      with provisional side branch stenting following an unsatisfactory result after balloon&#xD;
      angioplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-stenting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both vessels have to be wired. Lesion preparation in the main vessel and side branch may be&#xD;
      undertaken according to operator preference. After lesion preparation, the main branch is&#xD;
      stented first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After placement of the stent in the main branch, rewiring and predilatation of the side&#xD;
      branch, the second stent in the side branch is advanced and an additional balloon is placed&#xD;
      in the main branch at the orifice of the side branch. Then, the stent in the side branch is&#xD;
      positioned, taking care that the marker band and about the first half millimetre of the stent&#xD;
      are within the main branch stent. When the optimal position of the side-branch stent is&#xD;
      achieved, the side-branch stent is deployedby a kissing balloon manoeuvre, first inflating&#xD;
      the side-branch balloon with the stent and immediately afterwards the main branch balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Culotte stent technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both vessels have to be wired. Lesion preparation in the main vessel and side branch may be&#xD;
      undertaken according to operator preference. After lesion preparation, the side branch have&#xD;
      be stented first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first stent is placed from main branch into the side branch side branch, covering the&#xD;
      entire diseased segment with a wire jailed in the main vessel. The main vessel is rewired&#xD;
      through the stent struts, and after removal of the jailed wire, is dilated with a balloon to&#xD;
      separate stent struts. The side branch wire is then removed (to prevent metal-to-metal jail)&#xD;
      and the main vessel is stented covering the proximal and distal segment. The side-branch is&#xD;
      re-wired and high pressure (e.g. 20 atm) individual inflations are made in each vessel at the&#xD;
      bifurcation point to ensure good stent strut separation. Finally a lower pressure kissing&#xD;
      inflation is made. For both the high pressure individual and lower pressure final kissing&#xD;
      inflations, balloon sizing should be in accordance with the diameter of the vessel itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further treatment to proximal or distal aspects of the main vessel or side branch can be&#xD;
      continued at the discretion of the operator. At any stage, proximal or distal dissections may&#xD;
      be treated as required with further stent implantations. At any stage, post-dilatations may&#xD;
      be undertaken to optimise stent expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Irrespective of the assigned treatment, glyceryl trinitrate is injected intra-coronarily at&#xD;
      the completion of the procedure and final angiography of the vessel is performed in the two&#xD;
      optimal views that were chosen at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4.4. Stent type&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any approved type of drug-eluting stent can be used at the operator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5. Follow-up Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients enrolled in the study will be required to complete 30 days, 6 months, one, two,&#xD;
      three and fiv -years follow-up to evaluate long-term results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5.1. 30 Days (± 5 days) Post Procedure (Telephone contact)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will include angina status (according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society&#xD;
      Classification of angina), all adverse events, all concomitant medications and any&#xD;
      interventional treatment that occurred since the the index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5.2. Angiographic Follow-Up 9 Months (± 14 days) Post Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of current routine clinical practice, all patients will undergo repeat angiography at&#xD;
      9 months after the index procedure. Angiographies will be performed as described in Section&#xD;
      5.4.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All films, including unscheduled angiograms, will be analysed to the angiographic core&#xD;
      laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      . 5.5.3. At 30 days, 6,12, 24. 36 and 60 Months (± 30 days) post Procedure (Telephone contact&#xD;
      or contact with family doctor)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment will include angina, all adverse events, all concomitant medications and any&#xD;
      interventional treatment that occurred since the previous contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5.4 Quantitave coronary angiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For quantitative coronary angiography, angiograms obtained at baseline, at completion of the&#xD;
      intervention and at 9 month follow-up will be analysed with using a computer based system&#xD;
      dedicated to bifurcation analysis (Qangio XA, version7.0, Medis, Leiden, Netherlands),&#xD;
      according to the standard operating procedure of our angiographic core laboratory.&#xD;
      Quantitative angiographic measurements will be obtained of the three segments of the&#xD;
      bifurcation lesion: the proximal and distal segment of the main branch and the side branch.&#xD;
      We will perform measurements in the stented portion of the vessel (in-stent) and in the&#xD;
      distal or proximal 5 mm margin (edge). In-segment analyses will comprise the in-stent and the&#xD;
      edge area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the bifurcation angle from the analysis system will be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. SAFETY ISSUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      All serious adverse events must be reported to the ethic committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These include any complication that:&#xD;
&#xD;
      results in death is life-threatening results in persistent and significant disability or&#xD;
      incapacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to have a 90% power to detect a 25% relative reduction of the primary&#xD;
      endpoint by Culotte technique as compared with T stenting at a significance level of 0.05.&#xD;
      Assuming percent diameter stenosis in the side branch of 30±23 % at follow-up (ref. 10), a&#xD;
      sample size of 133 patients in each arm is obtained. The study will include 150 patients in&#xD;
      each arm, to allow for losses to angiographic follow-up.&#xD;
