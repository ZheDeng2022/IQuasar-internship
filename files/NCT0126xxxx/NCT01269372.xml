      This pilot, multi center study will establish the effectiveness of Given PillCam® Platform&#xD;
      with the PillCam® Colon 2 Capsule as demonstrated by the identification of subjects with&#xD;
      polyps, compared to standard colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also use to evaluate the administrative feasibility and data management of&#xD;
      study design.&#xD;

        <description>PillCam® Colon 2 Capsule Endoscopy (CE) compared to standard colonoscopy in detecting subjects with polyps equal to or larger than 6 mm and 10 mm as measured by Specificity. A positive event was defined as per optical colonoscopy polyp size measurement. Standard colonoscopy is the gold standard.</description>
