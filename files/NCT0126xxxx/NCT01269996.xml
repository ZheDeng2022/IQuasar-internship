      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen of metformin plus sitagliptin&#xD;
      (Janumet) followed by a long-acting basal insulin (Lantus) treatment compared to the usual&#xD;
      treatment regimen of metformin followed by sulfonylurea and intermediate-acting basal insulin&#xD;
      in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes. The worldwide&#xD;
      prevalence of T2DM is increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microvascular and macrovascular complications are well known to cause significant morbidities&#xD;
      and shorten life expectancy in diabetic patients. T2DM is the leading cause of adult-onset&#xD;
      blindness, renal failure, limbs amputation, ischaemic heart disease and stroke in the&#xD;
      industrialized world. Progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure together with insulin&#xD;
      resistance underlie the pathogenesis of T2DM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycaemic control is essential and fundamental to the management of diabetes. Randomized&#xD;
      control trials have confirmed the long term benefits of achieving glycaemic control early in&#xD;
      the course of disease on future clinical outcomes. Long term follow up of The Diabetes&#xD;
      Control and Complications Trial Research Group (DCCT) and U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study&#xD;
      (UKPDS) cohorts showed that improving glycaemic control reduces the incidences of both&#xD;
      microvascular and macrovascular complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is generally agreed that HbA1c &lt;7% is a reasonable goal in adults to reduce risk of&#xD;
      diabetes complications. Subgroup analyses of DCCT and UKPDS and results of Action in Diabetes&#xD;
      and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE)&#xD;
      trial suggest a small but incremental benefit in microvascular outcomes with HbA1c values&#xD;
      closer to normal. In the subgroup analysis of the ACCORD study, subjects without history of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and attained HbA1c goal of 6.5% had lower risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      endpoints than those with HbA1c goal of 7%. Therefore, selected individual patients including&#xD;
      those with short duration of diabetes, long life expectancy and no significant cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, may benefit from a more stringent HbA1c goal of &lt;6.5%, a value close to normal&#xD;
      individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and the European Association for the&#xD;
      Study of Diabetes, lifestyle modification plus Metformin is a well-validated step 1 therapy&#xD;
      for patients with T2DM. Sulfonylurea or insulin treatment formed the step 2 therapy in those&#xD;
      who fail to achieve optimal glycaemic control after step 1 treatment. Sulfonylurea is an&#xD;
      insulin secretagogue. It acts in a glucose-independent fashion by increasing the insulin&#xD;
      concentration irrespective of the ambient glucose concentration. Despite its efficacy, it is&#xD;
      associated with increased risk of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incretins are gut-derived hormones that include Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and&#xD;
      Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). Incretins are released into the circulation&#xD;
      after a meal. Both GLP-1 and GIP stimulate endogenous insulin secretion in a&#xD;
      glucose-dependent fashion. They also inhibit glucagon secretion, delay gastric emptying and&#xD;
      induce satiety. The combined effect of incretins in augmenting insulin secretion and&#xD;
      suppressing glucagon reduces post-prandial glucose excursion. In animal models, GLP-1 has&#xD;
      also been shown to preserve pancreatic beta-cell mass by increased proliferation and&#xD;
      decreased apoptosis. In T2DM patients, the attenuated post-prandial GLP-1 secretion may&#xD;
      partially explain the increased post-prandial rise in glucose concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, incretins have very short half-lives of a few minutes. They are rapidly inactivated&#xD;
      by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) in the circulation. Inhibitors of the enzyme&#xD;
      DPP-4 can augment active incretin levels by delaying the clearance of the active incretins,&#xD;
      hence augmenting the incretin action with resultant improvement in glycaemic control in T2DM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In later stage of T2DM, progressive pancreatic beta-cell failure frequently results in&#xD;
      deterioration in glycaemic control despite oral drug treatment, necessitating supplementary&#xD;
      insulin therapy. New generations of once-daily, long-acting basal insulin may have better&#xD;
      safety profile in terms of less hypoglycaemic events compared with traditional&#xD;
      intermediate-acting basal insulin. Supplementary basal insulin, when titrated appropriately,&#xD;
      will almost always improve fasting blood glucose levels and HbA1c control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitagliptin is an orally active, potent and highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor which was&#xD;
      approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2006 as a new class of&#xD;
      oral drug treatment for T2DM. Sitagliptin is marketed as Januvia by Merck &amp; Co. In April&#xD;
      2007, the FDA approved an oral combination of sitagliptin and metformin marketed as Janumet&#xD;
      with preparations of 50/500mg and 50/1000mg dosage per tablet. Sitagliptin has been proved to&#xD;
      be effective in treating T2DM with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia together with additional&#xD;
      benefits on reducing glucagon, slowing gastric emptying and inducing satiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin glargine, marketed by Sanofi Aventis under the name Lantus, is a long-acting basal&#xD;
      insulin analogue. It has the advantage of a long action duration of 18 to 26 hours and a&#xD;
      peakless profile, which resembles basal insulin secretion of non-diabetic pancreatic&#xD;
      beta-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In T2DM patients, we proposed that a new treatment regimen consists of a combination of&#xD;
      DPP-IV inhibitor plus metformin followed by long-acting basal insulin may be more effective&#xD;
      in achieving good and sustained glycaemic control with less hypoglycaemic drawbacks compared&#xD;
      with the traditional regimen of metformin followed by sulfonylurea and finally&#xD;
      intermediate-acting insulin. This proposed new treatment regimen forms the basis of this&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this multicentre, randomized, open-label prospective study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of a new treatment regimen of metformin plus sitagliptin (Janumet)&#xD;
      followed by a long-acting basal insulin (Lantus) treatment compared to the usual treatment&#xD;
      regimen of metformin follow by sulfonylurea and intermediate-acting basal insulin in T2DM&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
