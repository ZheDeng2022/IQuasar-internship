      The purpose of this study is to examine the safety and tolerability of CA-18C3 in subjects&#xD;
      with hematologic malignancies, as well as look at the preliminary efficacy of IL-1alpha&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female subjects age ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have a relapsed/refractory leukemia for which no standard therapies are&#xD;
             anticipated to result in a durable remission. Subjects with previously treated&#xD;
             high-risk myelodysplasia (MDS) (Intermediate 2 or high-risk by IPSS) and chronic&#xD;
             myelomonocytic leukemia-2 (CMML-2 by WHO classification) are also candidates for this&#xD;
             protocol. Relapsed/refractory leukemias include acute non-lymphocytic leukemia (AML)&#xD;
             by WHO classification, acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia&#xD;
             (CLL), or chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in blast crisis. Subjects with&#xD;
             myelofibrosis are also eligible. Untreated patients with above diagnoses considered&#xD;
             unfit for standard therapy will also be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential (i.e., women who are pre-menopausal or not surgically&#xD;
             sterile) must use acceptable contraceptive methods (abstinence, intrauterine device&#xD;
             [IUD], oral contraceptive or double barrier device), and must have a negative urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 2 weeks prior to beginning treatment on this trial. Nursing&#xD;
             subjects are excluded. Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive&#xD;
             methods for the duration of time on study. Pregnant and nursing subjects are excluded&#xD;
             because the effects of CA-18C3 on a fetus or nursing child are unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the absence of rapidly progressing disease, the interval from prior treatment to&#xD;
             time of study drug administration should be at least 2 weeks for cytotoxic agents, or&#xD;
             at least 5 half-lives for non-cytotoxic agents. If the subject is on hydroxyurea to&#xD;
             control peripheral blood leukemic cell counts, the subject must be off hydroxyurea for&#xD;
             at least ¬48 hours before initiation of treatment on this protocol. Persistent&#xD;
             clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must not be greater than&#xD;
             grade 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have the following clinical laboratory values (unless out of range&#xD;
             values are considered to be the result of leukemic organ involvement):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x the upper limit of normal unless considered due to&#xD;
                  Gilbert's syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 3x the&#xD;
                  upper limit of normal unless considered due to organ leukemic involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated institutional review board (IRB)-approved informed consent before any&#xD;
             protocol-specific screening procedures are performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active heart disease including myocardial infarction within previous 3 months,&#xD;
             symptomatic coronary artery disease, arrhythmias not controlled by medication, or&#xD;
             uncontrolled congestive heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects receiving any other standard or investigational treatment for their&#xD;
             hematologic malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who at the time of evaluation for participation in the study have evidence of&#xD;
             active leukemic involvement in the brain or spinal cord (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit the understanding or rendering&#xD;
             of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects immunocompromised due to a process unrelated to leukemic disease or&#xD;
             treatment, including subjects known to be infected with human immunodeficiency virus&#xD;
             (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with detectable levels of endogenous antibodies to IL-1α at the time of&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
