      Our team is interested in what can be done to improve the functioning of patients who suffer&#xD;
      from glaucoma, a chronic and irreversible eye disease. Patients with vision loss as a result&#xD;
      of this disease may feel like they have been 'given up on', or lost to our medical system&#xD;
      when no further interventions can be offered to treat their eye disease. It is our intent to&#xD;
      investigate what alternatives we can provide our patients, instead of simply saying, 'nothing&#xD;
      more can be done'. We have learned from studies done on other chronic eye diseases, like age&#xD;
      related macular degeneration, that low vision rehabilitation can improve visual function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What exactly is low vision? It can involve a loss of visual acuity, making activities such as&#xD;
      reading or writing a challenge; it can involve loss of contrast sensitivity, making shapes&#xD;
      and edges hard to discern, like those of a stair edge, or person's face. It could also&#xD;
      involve a loss of peripheral, or side vision which is a symptom common to most glaucoma&#xD;
      patients. Whatever the cause of low vision, doing day-to-day activities can become&#xD;
      increasingly difficult, and many suffer from a loss of their independence and may even become&#xD;
      depressed. Low vision rehabilitation involves helping patients to use their remaining vision&#xD;
      in optimal, and sometimes even new, ways. This involves an assessment of a person's baseline&#xD;
      vision, and an idea of what their needs are. Patients are then given low vision aids (such as&#xD;
      magnifiers, telescopes, video screens which magnify images, and other tools) as well as&#xD;
      instructions and support for adapting to living and functioning with altered vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there currently exists no cure for glaucoma, and we are certainly not promising a&#xD;
      reversal of the damage done to the eyes from this chronic disease, we do believe that these&#xD;
      types of rehabilitation services may offer some hope and potential visual benefit to patients&#xD;
      living with vision loss. Our hypothesis is that the use of state-of-the-art low vision aids&#xD;
      in patients with advanced glaucomatous visual loss will provide an improvement in visual&#xD;
      tasks and thereby an improvement in quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Visual impairment, including both low vision and blindness, ranks among the ten most&#xD;
      prevalent causes of disability in North America (1). Leading causes of low vision are&#xD;
      diseases also associated with an aging population, including age related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (ARMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and optic neuropathies (1). Of these, irreversible&#xD;
      vision loss is most commonly caused by ARMD and glaucoma, diseases for which there exists no&#xD;
      cure (2). Quality of life and functional ability are negatively impacted by vision loss and&#xD;
      blindness (2). Loss of visual ability impairs both mental and physical functioning, limiting&#xD;
      activities of daily living (ADL) (eating, dressing, reading, writing, mobilizing,&#xD;
      interpersonal communication etc.) (3). Impedance on basic functioning secondary to visual&#xD;
      impairment can lead to loss of independence, low self-esteem or depression (3). When&#xD;
      pharmacological or surgical interventions prove futile in advanced vision loss, low vision&#xD;
      rehabilitation may be the only option for regaining lost function in patients. The goal of&#xD;
      low vision rehabilitation is to not restore lost vision but rather utilize the remaining&#xD;
      vision to its fullest potential thus enabling patients to reclaim their ADL and thereby their&#xD;
      independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study is based on the Veterans Affairs Low Vision Intervention Trial (LOVIT), a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial conducted by Stelmack et al (4-6). Their goal was to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of an outpatient low vision rehabilitation program for patients with moderate to&#xD;
      severe vision loss secondary to age related macular degeneration (ARMD). Their intervention&#xD;
      was effective in improving all aspects of visual function when compared with the control&#xD;
      group. There is very little evidence to support the use of low vision rehabilitation in&#xD;
      patients with chronic, irreversible visual loss secondary to glaucoma, and currently no&#xD;
      randomized trials have been done. Because the pattern of visual loss is different in ARMD and&#xD;
      glaucoma, it is not possible to extrapolate the ARMD data beyond the ARMD cohort. Yet, the&#xD;
      ARMD experience has established a proof of principal that can be used in the glaucoma&#xD;
      protocol design In patients with advanced glaucomatous optic neuropathy, functional loss&#xD;
      often begins with mobility and difficulty ambulating (7). In one study, patients with visual&#xD;
      field loss secondary to their glaucoma showed a diminished traffic gap judgement when&#xD;
      crossing the street, which lead to an increased risk of harm. As a whole, the group made 23%&#xD;
      more errors in identifying a gap as crossable when it was too short to be made safely (7).&#xD;
      Another researcher found that 25% of patients with visual field loss in both eyes reported a&#xD;
      moderate to severe restriction in their mobility activities overall. In another study, field&#xD;
      loss secondary to glaucoma lead to a lower vision-related quality of life score. When&#xD;
      examined collectively, these reports and others suggest that those with reduced visual fields&#xD;
      and glaucoma experience more falls, more motor vehicle accidents, greater overall difficulty&#xD;
      with mobility activities and an overall decreased quality of living (7). Visual acuity can&#xD;
      vary over a wide range among patients with moderate to severe glaucoma, but overall, central&#xD;
      vision reduction occurs late in the disease. Some studies do show mild central and diffuse&#xD;
      reduction in fields in the early stages of glaucoma. As the visual fields and visual acuity&#xD;
      decline, patients often note difficulty with glare sensitivity, leaving response times to&#xD;
      light and dark adaptations hindered. In summary, the problems most often experienced by&#xD;
      patients with advanced glaucoma are related to ambulation, reading, distance spotting and&#xD;
      glare. Low vision rehabilitation aims to maximize independence in patients' daily lives by&#xD;
      addressing these difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It would be difficult to argue that low vision aids and rehabilitation in patients with&#xD;
      visual loss do not have a positive impact on both patients and their families; however there&#xD;
      exists little in the way of randomized controlled clinical trials which evaluate efficacy of&#xD;
      outpatient low vision rehabilitation and interdisciplinary strategies to deliver such&#xD;
      services. Given the existing shortage of inpatient resources and the staff required to manage&#xD;
      such patients, an outpatient program could deemed more cost effective and practical in our&#xD;
      limited health care system. Moreover, most available data on the subject focuses on&#xD;
      rehabilitation in patients with ARMD. There is very little to support the use of low vision&#xD;
      rehabilitation in patients with chronic, irreversible visual loss secondary to glaucoma. As&#xD;
      our population ages, we can expect with certainty an increase in the prevalence of visual&#xD;
      loss secondary to glaucoma, beginning in the next ten years (12). An evaluation of the&#xD;
      efficacy of strategies to address 'untreatable' vision loss, such as those patients with 'end&#xD;
      of the line' glaucoma, would be of great significance as we see glaucoma and its devastating&#xD;
      effects on vision and subsequently on quality of life increase greatly in the near future.&#xD;
      Evidence based models of outpatient low vision rehabilitation programs are needed to support&#xD;
      the implementation and delivery of such services for patients suffering from moderate to&#xD;
      severe glaucoma, and its devastating impact on daily functioning.&#xD;
