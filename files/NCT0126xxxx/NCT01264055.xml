    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Bronchiectasis is a type of lung condition in which the lungs airways are abnormally&#xD;
      stretched and widened. This stretching and widening makes it difficult for mucus and other&#xD;
      substances to move out of the lungs, encouraging the growth of bacteria and leading to&#xD;
      breathing problems or infection. Bronchiectasis can be caused by genetic disorders or&#xD;
      diseases such as tuberculosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Researchers are interested in&#xD;
      developing better ways to diagnose and treat a lung problem called idiopathic or unexplained&#xD;
      bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better describe the physical characteristics, radiographic patterns, and airway&#xD;
      microbiology of unexplained bronchiectasis and to look for possible genetic links or risk&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a chronic cough and who have had a CT scan&#xD;
           that has revealed signs of bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current smokers or those who have smoked for at least 10 years, as well as individuals&#xD;
           who have known causes of bronchiectasis or who have had organ transplants, are not&#xD;
           eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one outpatient clinic visit for evaluation with a physical&#xD;
           examination including detailed body size measurements and medical history and for&#xD;
           collection of blood samples for routine lab tests and genetic analyses and a chest x-ray&#xD;
           if no recent one is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have tests of lung function, and measurement of a gas called&#xD;
           nitric oxide in the nose. Participants whose initial tests show abnormal results may&#xD;
           also be asked to have a nasal scrape to collect cell samples and/or a skin sweat test to&#xD;
           measure salt concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also have a sputum specimen collected during the visit and will be&#xD;
           asked to collect two additional early morning sputum samples and a mouth rinse at home&#xD;
           within 2 weeks of the clinic visit, and mail the sample collection materials to the&#xD;
           research team.&#xD;

      The Genetic Disorders of Mucociliary Clearance Consortium (GDMCC) is comprised of 6&#xD;
      geographically-dispersed clinical research sites designed to study chronic disorders of the&#xD;
      conducting airways associated with bronchiectasis. The first Clinical Center protocol&#xD;
      (06-I-0217) focused on airway diseases with a known genetic etiology: primary ciliary&#xD;
      dyskinesia (PCD), variant cystic fibrosis (vCF), and pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA). This&#xD;
      second GDMCC protocol will study adult patients with non-CF, idiopathic bronchiectasis, whose&#xD;
      genetic etiologies are not known. Patients will receive the same level of rigorous testing&#xD;
      that has allowed proper diagnosis of patients with PCD, vCF, and PHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Idiopathic bronchiectasis is reportedly more common in females with certain asthenic&#xD;
      morphotypes and associated with environmental organisms, such as nontuberculous mycobacterium&#xD;
      (NTM). Gender predilection due to referral bias is unclear. Other susceptibility factors&#xD;
      predisposing to bronchiectasis or acquisition of NTM are also unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will attempt to broaden the understanding of this disease by comparing&#xD;
      gender-associated factors and NTM status. A relatively equal number of both females/males and&#xD;
      NTM/non-NTM infected subjects will be accrued. Patients will be stratified by gender and by&#xD;
      the presence/absence of respiratory infection with NTM. Approximately 300 people may be&#xD;
      screened to find 260 eligible subjects since a small number (e.g., 40 patients) may be&#xD;
      diagnosed with PCD, vCF, or other known etiology as an explanation for the bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-visit protocol will use a systematic approach to characterize the clinical,&#xD;
      morphological, radiological, and microbiological phenotypes of idiopathic bronchiectasis.&#xD;
      Physical features, radiographic patterns, and associated lower airway microbial flora will be&#xD;
      assessed. There is no natural history of disease course follow-up component to this protocol.&#xD;
      The standard evaluation includes a quantitative assessment of body morphometrics, functional&#xD;
      assessments of pulmonary physiology, nasal nitric oxide measurement with subsequent detailed&#xD;
      assessment of ciliary structure and motility in selected patients, quantitative&#xD;
      immunoglobulins levels to screen for humoral immune defects, and selected genetic analysis of&#xD;
      candidate alleles, such as CFTR and A1AT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genotype/phenotype correlations will be researched and possibly defined. Careful evaluation&#xD;
      and characterization of these phenotypes will guide the genetic characterization of&#xD;
      idiopathic bronchiectasis, and likely lead to an improved diagnostic approach. Identification&#xD;
      of disease causing genes may provide new therapeutic targets.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The criteria for participants to enter the study mandates that each patient have received a&#xD;
        standard (current clinical practice) diagnostic evaluation that includes a CT scan of the&#xD;
        chest to document bronchiectasis, prior to enrolling in the Consortium study. To enter this&#xD;
        protocol, adults must have bronchiectasis and meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males or females, age greater than or equal to18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Chronic cough&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. An available CT of the chest (on a CD) that shows evidence of dilated airways&#xD;
             fulfilling radiographic criteria for bronchiectasis in more than one lobe&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability to provide informed consent, including HIPAA consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A participant should not be in the study if they have not had a standard clinical&#xD;
        evaluation to rule out other potential causes of chronic sino-pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with classic clinical presentation and elevated&#xD;
             sweat chloride levels and/or two known disease-causing CFTR mutations&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of tuberculosis or other known explanation for bronchiectasis, such as alpha&#xD;
             1-antitrypsin deficiency (ZZ or ZS), confirmed or probable PCD, inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren s syndrome, allergic bronchopulmonary&#xD;
             aspergillosis, or documented primary or acquired immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current smoker or &gt; 10 pack-year history of tobacco use&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Prior solid organ transplant&#xD;
