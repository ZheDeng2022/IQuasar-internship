      The study compares the risks of short- and long-term use of contraceptives containing&#xD;
      drospirenone (DRSP) or dienogest (DNG)/ethinylestradiol (EE) plus levomefolate calcium&#xD;
      (metafolin) with the risks of short- and long-term use of other established oral&#xD;
      contraceptives (OCs).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      New oral contraceptives (OCs) containing drospirenone (DRSP) or dienogest&#xD;
      (DNG)/ethinylestradiol (EE) plus levomefolate calcium (metafolin) have been recently&#xD;
      introduced and will be introduced in a number of countries in the near future. Although the&#xD;
      safety of OCs has improved over the last 50 years with reductions in the estrogen and&#xD;
      progestogen dose, special attention regarding oral contraceptive safety amongst women with&#xD;
      risk factors for venous and arterial thromboembolism as well as cancer is necessary. Folic&#xD;
      acid supplementation has been implicated in both the prevention and the promotion of several&#xD;
      cancers, including colorectal cancer (CRC). Chronic folate deficiency seems to be associated&#xD;
      with colorectal carcinogenesis, while high folic acid levels may have a tumor-promoting&#xD;
      effect. On balance an oral contraceptive containing folate may be advantageous for several&#xD;
      reasons. It may increase baseline folate levels with potential for protecting against some&#xD;
      malignancies and concurrently decrease the risk of neural tube defects in women who become&#xD;
      pregnant due to OC-failure, incorrect OC-use or after stopping the OC for a planned&#xD;
      pregnancy. Although unexpected, it is unclear whether combined oral contraceptives plus&#xD;
      metafolin in general and specifically DRSP/EE plus metafolin and DNG/EE plus metafolin will&#xD;
      alter the risk profile of established oral contraceptives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the safety of these new oral contraceptives with regard to&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes and colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INAS-FOCUS is a prospective, controlled, non-interventional cohort study with three study&#xD;
      arms: users of DRSP/EE/metafolin, users of DNG/EE/metafolin and users of OCs containing other&#xD;
      estrogen/progestogen combinations. The users will be grouped to starters (first-ever users),&#xD;
      switchers (women switching OC without a pill intake break) and restarters (women with a pill&#xD;
      intake break). Users of an OC are accrued by a network of prescribing physicians. Baseline&#xD;
      and follow-up information is collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Data analysis&#xD;
      will be based on life-table methods comparing the cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amendment, approved by the Safety Monitoring and Advisory Council on 13th May 2018:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During study recruitment, only one combined oral contraceptive was launched containing&#xD;
      metafolin (DRSP/EE+) and the planned third cohort arm (users of DNG/EE+) was rendered&#xD;
      obsolete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, early recruitment rates and exposure figures in INAS-FOCUS suggested that the&#xD;
      study would be inadequately powered to accurately assess the risk of colorectal cancer at 15&#xD;
      years. Interim reports were presented to the Safety Monitoring and Advisory Council (SMAC)&#xD;
      and in consultation with the funder, a decision made to discontinue INAS-FOCUS following&#xD;
      analysis of cardiovascular events (Part 1 of study). The current protocol reflects the&#xD;
      developments discussed above. The original three cohorts have been reduced to two (DRSP/EE+&#xD;
      and other OCs containing estrogen/progestogen) and Part II (long-term assessment of risk of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer) has been removed from the protocol. Colorectal cancer outcomes will be&#xD;
      analyzed as a secondary outcome for signal detection purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For historical accuracy and context, the introduction and background sections of the protocol&#xD;
      have been left unchanged.&#xD;
