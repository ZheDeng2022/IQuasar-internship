  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, single-center study to evaluate&#xD;
      stimulated C-peptide secretion after exogenous administration of mild immunosuppression and&#xD;
      growth-promoting factors to women with preexisting T1DM who had a decline in insulin&#xD;
      requirement or had detectable C-peptide during a previous pregnancy. Fifteen subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled and randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to either active treatment or placebo in a&#xD;
      parallel group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation for individual subjects will consist of an initial Screening Visit, a 2-week&#xD;
      baseline period, a Baseline Visit, visits at week 2 and 4 of the treatment period, a visit at&#xD;
      the end of the treatment period (week 6), and a follow-up visit 2 weeks after study treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive either active treatment or matching placebo of estradiol 1 mg every 8&#xD;
      hours; medroxyprogesterone 2.5 mg every 24 hours; hydrocortisone 2.5 mg every morning, 1.25&#xD;
      mg every afternoon, and 1.25 mg at bedtime each night; and growth hormone 2 mg once a day).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether women with preexisting T1DM who&#xD;
      showed a decline in insulin requirement, defined as a decrease in insulin requirement of 25%&#xD;
      or more, or a decrease deemed to be clinically significant by the investigator, with no other&#xD;
      medically determined reason, or who had detectable C-peptide during a previous pregnancy will&#xD;
      show a change in stimulated C peptide response when not pregnant and treated with exogenous&#xD;
      pregnancy-related hormones and growth factors (Estradiol, medroxyprogesterone,&#xD;
      hydrocortisone, GH) for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine whether the study treatment leads to a change in T1DM autoantibodies between&#xD;
           Baseline and Week 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the percentage of subjects experiencing a clinically significant decline in&#xD;
           total daily insulin requirement at Week 6, defined as a 25% decrease from Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Descriptively evaluate the association between serum levels of growth hormone, cortisol,&#xD;
           and prolactin and changes in C-peptide levels&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the safety of administration of the study treatments compared with placebo, as&#xD;
           measured by blood pressure, pulse, weight change, blood glucose, and adverse events&#xD;
           (AEs)&#xD;

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the Week 6 change from Baseline in stimulated C peptide response. It will be modeled as a function of treatment group and baseline stimulated C peptide using an analysis of covariance model.
