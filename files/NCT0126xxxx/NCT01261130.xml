      This two part study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of two formulations of&#xD;
      Na-GST-1, first in hookworm-naïve individuals using an open-label design, and then in adults&#xD;
      living in an area of endemic hookworm infection using a randomized, double-blind design. The&#xD;
      two formulations to be evaluated are Na-GST-1 adsorbed to an adjuvant, Alhydrogel®, and&#xD;
      Na-GST-1 adsorbed to Alhydrogel® and administered with GLA-AF.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Human hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminth infection caused by the nematode&#xD;
      parasites Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. It is one of the most common chronic&#xD;
      infections of humans, afflicting up to 740 million people in the developing nations of the&#xD;
      tropics. The largest number of cases occurs in impoverished rural areas of sub-Saharan&#xD;
      Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and the tropical regions of the Americas. Approximately 3.2&#xD;
      billion people are at risk for hookworm infection in these areas. N. americanus is the most&#xD;
      common hookworm worldwide, whereas A. duodenale is more geographically restricted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary approach to hookworm control worldwide has been the frequent and periodic mass&#xD;
      administration of benzimidazole anthelminthics to school-aged children living in&#xD;
      high-prevalence areas. In 2001, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution 54.19 which&#xD;
      urges member states to provide regular anthelminthic treatment to high-risk groups with the&#xD;
      target of regular treatment of at least 75% of all at-risk school-aged children. However, the&#xD;
      cure rates for a single dose of a benzimidazole varies with rates as low as 61% (400 mg) and&#xD;
      67% (800 mg) for albendazole and 19% (single dose) and 45% (repeated dose) for mebendazole&#xD;
      being reported. These concerns have prompted interest in developing alternative tools for&#xD;
      hookworm control. Vaccination to prevent the anemia associated with moderate and heavy&#xD;
      intensity hookworm infection would alleviate the public health deficiencies of drug treatment&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current strategy for development of Human Hookworm candidate vaccines is focused on&#xD;
      antigens expressed during the adult stage of the hookworm life cycle which play a role in&#xD;
      digesting the host hemoglobin, used by the worm as an energy source. These antigens are&#xD;
      relatively hidden from the human immune system during natural infection, and hence have a low&#xD;
      likelihood of inducing antigen-specific IgE in exposed/infected individuals, reducing the&#xD;
      potential for allergic reaction upon vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nutritional and metabolic requirements of the adult hookworm living in the human&#xD;
      intestine are dependent upon degradation of host hemoglobin that has been ingested by the&#xD;
      worm. N. americanus hookworms depend on host hemoglobin for survival. Following hemolysis,&#xD;
      adult hookworms use an ordered cascade of hemoglobinases to cleave hemoglobin into smaller&#xD;
      molecules. Following hemoglobin digestion, the freed heme generates toxic oxygen radicals&#xD;
      that can be bound and detoxified by molecules such as glutathione S-transferase-1 (GST-1).&#xD;
      GST-1 of N. americanus (Na-GST-1) is a critical enzyme that plays a role in parasite blood&#xD;
      feeding; when used as a vaccine, the investigators hypothesize that the antigen will induce&#xD;
      anti-enzyme neutralizing antibodies that will interfere with parasite blood-feeding and cause&#xD;
      parasite death or reduce worm fecundity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following its selection as a candidate antigen Na-GST-1 has been successfully manufactured&#xD;
      and tested in the laboratory and in animals with both Alhydrogel® (aluminum hydroxide&#xD;
      suspension)and Alhydrogel® plus Gluco-Pyranosylphospho-Lipid A Aqueous Formulation (GLA-AF).&#xD;
      Na-GST-1 has been shown to be pure, potent, and stable when administered as either of these&#xD;
      two formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Na-GST-1 vaccine formulations to be tested in this study consist of the 24 kDa&#xD;
      recombinant protein Na-GST-1 adsorbed to Alhydrogel® either with or without the addition of&#xD;
      GLA-AF. For the Na-GST-1/GLA-AF formulation, the GLA-AF will be added to the Alhydrogel®&#xD;
      formulation immediately prior to immunization. The active ingredient in both vaccine&#xD;
      formulations is the recombinant Na-GST-1 protein that is derived by fermentation of Pichia&#xD;
      pastoris yeast cells genetically engineered to express Na-GST-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this first-in-human study, the evaluation of the safety and immunogenicity of the Na-GST-1&#xD;
      and Na-GST-1/GLA-AF formulations will be conducted in two parts. First, healthy adults who&#xD;
      have not been infected with or exposed to hookworm will be enrolled in the urban center of&#xD;
      Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Hookworm in Brazil is primarily a rural disease and is uncommon in&#xD;
      developed urban areas such as Belo Horizonte. If no significant safety concerns are observed&#xD;
      in these volunteers, the study will proceed to enroll and vaccinate healthy adults in a&#xD;
      hookworm-endemic region of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The vaccine formulations will&#xD;
      be tested in both populations (i.e., non-endemic and endemic areas), given the possibility&#xD;
      that the safety profile of the vaccine formulations may be different in a population that has&#xD;
      been chronically exposed to the antigen contained in these vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part I of the study, 36 volunteers will be enrolled into one of six cohorts. In the first&#xD;
      cohort, 6 individuals will receive the 10 µg dose of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®; in the second&#xD;
      cohort, 6 individuals will receive the 10 µg dose of Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF; in the&#xD;
      third and fourth cohorts, 6 volunteers each will receive 30 µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® and&#xD;
      Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF, respectively; while in the fifth and sixth cohorts, 6 volunteers&#xD;
      each will receive 100 µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® and Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF, respectively.&#xD;
      Enrollment of these cohorts will be staggered by one-week intervals: Cohorts 2 and 3 will be&#xD;
      enrolled and begin vaccinations 1 week after Cohort 1, Cohorts 4 and 5 will be vaccinated 1&#xD;
      week after Cohorts 2 and 3, and Cohort 6 will be vaccinated 1 week after Cohorts 4 and 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part II of the study, 66 volunteers will be progressively enrolled into one of six dose&#xD;
      cohorts. In the first, third and fifth cohorts, volunteers will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® (n=8) or Butang® (n=2), while in the second, fourth and sixth&#xD;
      cohorts, volunteers will be randomized to receive either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® (n=2) or&#xD;
      Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF (n=10). Volunteers randomized to receive Na-GST-1 will receive&#xD;
      either the 10 µg, 30 µg or 100 µg dose. In order to ensure that the vaccine formulations will&#xD;
      be evaluated in individuals recently infected with hookworm, at least 4 individuals will be&#xD;
      enrolled into each of the Part II chohorts who were infected with hookworm based on the fecal&#xD;
      exam conducted during the screening for the study, or who had a documented infection within 3&#xD;
      months of the date planned for the first vaccination for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have chosen the Butang® hepatitis B vaccine (Instituto Butantan, Sao Paulo,&#xD;
      Brazil) as the comparator vaccine for five principal reasons: (1) it is likely to confer some&#xD;
      benefit to the participants receiving it, (2) it has an established safety record, (3) it is&#xD;
      a yeast-derived recombinant protein adsorbed to an aluminum-containing immunostimulant, (4)&#xD;
      it has the same physical appearance as Na-GST-1 immunostimulanted with Alhydrogel, and (5)&#xD;
      its dosing schedule permits easy incorporation into the study design. Furthermore, Butang® is&#xD;
      the most widely-used hepatitis B vaccine in Brazil, with over 15 million doses distributed&#xD;
      annually.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will recieve 3 doses of the assigned study agent given in 56 day intervals&#xD;
      (i.e. Day 0, Day 56 and Day 112). The trial is expected to last for a total of 24 months.&#xD;
      Each participant will be followed for 16 months from the time of the first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters will be monitored throughout both parts of the study. The primary&#xD;
      immunological endpoint for both parts will be the measurement of the antigen-specific&#xD;
      antibody response.&#xD;
