  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, kale and cabbage are particularly rich in a plant&#xD;
      chemical called sulforaphane (SFN) which boosts production of certain &quot;defense&quot; enzymes that&#xD;
      increase the activity of antioxidants. In animals, the chemical protection from SFN helps&#xD;
      prevent diseases associated with inflammation and cancer among others, and this is currently&#xD;
      being studied in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young broccoli sprouts have a particularly high level of SFN compared to other foods. The&#xD;
      purpose of this research study is to learn about short term responses to live attenuated&#xD;
      influenza virus (LAIV, administered to you via Flumist® vaccine) between smoking and&#xD;
      nonsmoking volunteers treated with broccoli sprout homogenates (&quot;shake&quot;) or a placebo&#xD;
      homogenate. This will be done by obtaining a series of &quot;nasal lavages&quot; or rinses of your nose&#xD;
      with salt water, as well as 3 superficial biopsies of the inside lining of your nose both&#xD;
      before and after you receive the vaccine. Using these samples, we will measure the amount of&#xD;
      virus and the amount of inflammation in your nose and compare how smokers and nonsmokers&#xD;
      respond to the vaccine when they are given a broccoli sprout homogenate (high in SFN) or a&#xD;
      placebo alfalfa spout &quot;shake&quot; which is low in SFN during each of 4 study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seen for a screening visit (inc. HIV test) and then randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive 1 of 2 homogenates. Broccoli sprout homogenate will be the the active treatment arm&#xD;
      while the placebo arm will be alfalfa sprout homogenate. Two to 4 weeks after screening,&#xD;
      subjects will return for 5 sequential visits (Monday-Friday). Monday-Thursday they will&#xD;
      receive the assigned homogenate. On Tuesday, they will receive the Flumist®vaccine. Subjects&#xD;
      will also be seen at 1 and 3 weeks post vaccine. Nasal lavage (NL), blood samples and nasal&#xD;
      biopsies will performed prior to and after study interventions.&#xD;

      Schedule of visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the screening visit, subjects will be asked to avoid cruciferous vegetables (list&#xD;
      will be provided to them), corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for&#xD;
      1 week prior to the initial visit and again for 1 week prior to all remaining visits. They&#xD;
      will to also be asked to avoid antioxidant vitamins as well as juices/drinks with added&#xD;
      vitamin supplements for 2 days prior to enrollment through study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline screening: obtain informed consent, review medical history, concomitant medications,&#xD;
      vital signs (VS's), urine collection for analysis of cotinine and SFN metabolites for all&#xD;
      subjects and urine pregnancy test for females of child bearing potential (all female subjects&#xD;
      unless they are s/p oophorectomy), physical exam by study MD, complete symptom scoring,&#xD;
      collect nasal lavage, and nasal biopsy (both nares), buccal swab collection and venipuncture&#xD;
      (up to 75 cc's) will be performed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test, baseline SFN&#xD;
      level, immune mediators and SFN-induced gene expression changes. Food diaries will be&#xD;
      provided with instructions for subjects at this visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      After successful completion of the screening, the subject will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      broccoli sprout homogenates or alfalfa sprout homogenates during the next 4 study visits.&#xD;
      Subjects will return 2-4 weeks after screening for 5 daily sequential visits (Monday through&#xD;
      Friday).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monday (Day -1): VS's, review of concomitant medications, urine collection for analysis of&#xD;

      prior.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

      dose, NL and continue food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thursday (Day 2): VS's, symptom/adverse event evaluation, review of concomitant medications&#xD;
      and observed ingestion of 4th dose. Two hours after ingestion, urine collection for analysis&#xD;
      of cotinine and SFN metabolites, venipuncture (up to 10 cc's for SFN level), nasal biopsy&#xD;
      (left nare) and NL will be performed. Continue food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Friday (Day 3): VS's, symptom/adverse event evaluation, review of concomitant medications,&#xD;
      urine collection for analysis of cotinine and SFN metabolites, NL, continue food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7 (+/- 1 day): VS's, symptom/adverse event evaluation, review of concomitant medications,&#xD;
      urine collection for analysis of cotinine and SFN metabolites, nasal biopsy (right nare), NL,&#xD;
      continue food diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 21 (+/- 1 week): VS's, symptom/adverse event evaluation, review of concomitant&#xD;
      medications urine collection for analysis of cotinine and SFN metabolites, NL, venipuncture&#xD;
      (up to 45 cc's) for immune mediators as well as SFN-induced gene expression changes and&#xD;
      anti-influenza antibody level, collect completed food diary&#xD;
