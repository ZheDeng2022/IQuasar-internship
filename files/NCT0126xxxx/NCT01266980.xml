      This study will assess the saftey of giving fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once&#xD;
      daily for 7 days to patients with severe renal imparement. The results of this study will aid&#xD;
      in deciding whether a FF/GW642444M doseadjustment is justified in subjects with severe renal&#xD;
      impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized study which will assess the pharmacokinetics and safety&#xD;
      following 7 days once daily dose of inhaled FF/ GW642444M (200/25mcg) in subjects with renal&#xD;
      impairment. Nine subjects with severe renal impairment (as defined by a Clcr&lt;30mL/min) will&#xD;
      be recruited along with healthy control subjects (as defined by a Clcr&gt;80mL/min matched to&#xD;
      the severe subjects based on gender, ethnicity, body mass index (±15%) and age (±5 years)).&#xD;
      All subjects will receive fluticasone furoate 200mcg/GW642444M 25mcg once daily for 7 days.&#xD;
      The results of this study will aid in deciding whether a FF/GW642444M dose adjustment is&#xD;
      justified in subjects with severe renal impairment and in estimating any such adjustments.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female between 18 and 70 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented&#xD;
                  tubal ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of&#xD;
                  spontaneous amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous&#xD;
                  follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;140&#xD;
                  pmol/L) (healthy subjects only) is confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement&#xD;
                  therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one&#xD;
                  of the contraception methods in Section 8.1 if they wish to continue their HRT&#xD;
                  during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
                  post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least&#xD;
                  2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this&#xD;
                  interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of their&#xD;
                  post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use&#xD;
                  of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Child-bearing potential and agrees to use one of the contraception methods listed&#xD;
                  in Section 8.1 for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
                  label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the&#xD;
                  risk of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception&#xD;
                  until completion of the follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. BMI within the range 19.0 - 33.0 kg/m^2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Single QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTcF &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to satisfactorily use the dry powder inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Healthy Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures or&#xD;
             outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is&#xD;
             acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Creatinine clearance &gt; 80mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation using serum&#xD;
             creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Renally Impaired Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. AST and ALT &lt; 2xULN; alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin ≤ 1.5xULN (isolated bilirubin&#xD;
             &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/min calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault equation using serum&#xD;
             creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects with renal insufficiency must have stable renal function defined as ≤ 25%&#xD;
             difference in creatinine clearance assessed on two occasions. Renal function will be&#xD;
             based on estimated creatinine clearance (CLcr) calculated by the Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
             equation using serum creatinine obtained on two occasions separated by at least 4&#xD;
             weeks within the last 3 months (historic data is permitted for the first measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;

             study: 30 days, 5 half-lives or twice the duration of the biological effect of the&#xD;
             investigational product (whichever is longer).&#xD;

             concurrent medications). In particular subjects taking medications that significantly&#xD;
             inhibit P450 CYP3A4 (e.g. ketaconazole) must not be included in this study.&#xD;
