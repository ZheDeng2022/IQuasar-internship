  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of sirolimus&#xD;
      or vorinostat that can be given in combination with hydroxychloroquine to patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancer. The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Drug Dose Level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of hydroxychloroquine and either sirolimus or vorinostat, based on when you joined this&#xD;
      study, availability of spots for each drug combination, and what your doctor thinks is in&#xD;
      your best interest. Up to 11 dose levels of the sirolimus and hydroxychloroquine combination&#xD;
      and 7 dose levels of the vorinostat and hydroxychloroquine combination will be tested. Three&#xD;
      (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants&#xD;
      will receive the lowest dose level of the study drug combination. Each new group will receive&#xD;
      a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will&#xD;
      continue until the highest tolerable dose of each drug combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose of each drug combination is found, up to 28 more participants&#xD;
      (14 per combination) will be given this dose. The study doctor will decide which drug&#xD;
      combination each participant is given, based on their tumor type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study &quot;cycle&quot; is 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take hydroxychloroquine and either vorinostat or sirolimus by mouth, 1 time a day,&#xD;
      every day. You should take the pills at about the same time each day with food and a cup (8&#xD;
      ounces) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about any health conditions you have, drugs you may&#xD;
      be taking, and if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weekly During Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Â° Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of each cycle beginning with 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have any muscle weakness or difficulty while moving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or PET/CT to check the status&#xD;
      of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, they will be performed more often.&#xD;
      If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 3 months, you will have an eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse or&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with a kidney transplant. Vorinostat is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Hydroxychloroquine is&#xD;
      FDA approved and commercially available to treat malaria. The use of these drugs combinations&#xD;
      is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 224 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
