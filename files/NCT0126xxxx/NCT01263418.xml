  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study will only include two types of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma and participants will be age 70 or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the safety of the treatment with the&#xD;
      drug ofatumumab to find out what effects, both good and bad this treatment has on lymphoma.&#xD;
      Ofatumumab is a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are being used to treat some types&#xD;
      of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of protein made in a laboratory that can bind&#xD;
      substances in the body including cancer cells. Ofatumumab binds to the protein called CD20,&#xD;
      which is found on B-cells and lymphoma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug, Ofatumumab, is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      (FDA) for treatment of other types of blood cancer and is not approved for use in patients&#xD;
      with non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. The use of ofatumumab in this study is considered investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to learning about ofatumumab, the researchers are interested in learning about&#xD;
      how this cancer treatment affects daily activities. Participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      Geriatric Assessment (GA). GAs are designed to gather information on memory, nutritional&#xD;
      status, mental health, and level of social support. This assessment will help the health care&#xD;
      team understand a participant's &quot;functional age&quot; as compared to a participant's actual age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers also want to collect blood samples to study molecules in follicular lymphoma&#xD;
      cells called 'biomarkers' to learn about how the lymphoma responds to therapy. A biomarker is&#xD;
      a molecule (for example, DNA or protein) found in the blood or tissues that is a marker for&#xD;
      disease. In this study, the investigators will measure the changes of the biomarker called&#xD;
      bcl-2. This biomarker research will only be in subjects with follicular lymphoma.&#xD;

      This multicenter Phase II clinical study will investigate the overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      after 2 months of therapy with weekly ofatumumab in older (≥70 years of age) patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated low or intermediate risk indolent NHL (n=37). Secondary objectives&#xD;
      include progression free survival (PFS) at 2 years, and an evaluation of the toxicity and&#xD;
      tolerability of ofatumumab in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also evaluate molecular response to ofatumumab by performing PCR analysis for&#xD;
      BCL2/IgH from the peripheral blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an exploratory analysis of the minimum observed serum concentration (Cmin) of&#xD;
      ofatumumab prior to the last dose and correlate this level with ORR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial includes administration of a Geriatric Assessment (GA) tool which patients will be&#xD;
      asked to complete serially during the trial.&#xD;
