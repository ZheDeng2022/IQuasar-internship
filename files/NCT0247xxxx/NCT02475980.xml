      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of comprehensive&#xD;
      contraceptive counseling intervention in a pediatric emergency department and to determine&#xD;
      the impact of comprehensive contraception counseling on initiation of contraception among&#xD;
      sexually active adolescents presenting to a pediatric emergency department.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent pregnancy is a crippling problem. Despite declines in adolescent birth rates,&#xD;
      adolescent pregnancies cost taxpayers a staggering $9.4 billion in 2010. New Mexico has one&#xD;
      of the highest rates of adolescent pregnancy in the country.(1) In New Mexico, nearly 1 in 5&#xD;
      adolescent females are not using any form of contraception.(2) Long-acting reversible forms&#xD;
      of contraception, including the subdermal contraceptive implant known as Nexplanon, are&#xD;
      increasingly popular among adolescents. Nonetheless, despite an increase from 0.3% in 2000 to&#xD;
      4.5% in 2013, few adolescents using any contraception are using a long-acting reversible&#xD;
      form.(1) The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists issued a policy statement in&#xD;
      late 2012 recommending long-acting, reversible forms of contraception as first line&#xD;
      contraception for adolescents.(3) Long-acting, reversible forms of contraception are highly&#xD;
      effective at preventing pregnancy and have rates of continuation among adolescents comparable&#xD;
      to older women.(4) Prior studies of adolescents have demonstrated that cost, access, and&#xD;
      education are the primary barriers to initiation of long-acting reversible forms of&#xD;
      contraception and that, if these barriers are removed, acceptance rates approach 75%.(5,6)&#xD;
      However, adolescents at highest risk of pregnancy have few opportunities to obtain&#xD;
      highly-effective contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The contribution of the proposed research is to demonstrate the feasibility of providing&#xD;
      comprehensive counseling about contraception for adolescents in a novel outreach setting, a&#xD;
      pediatric emergency department. This contribution will be significant because, if this&#xD;
      counseling intervention increases initiation of contraception through a pediatric emergency&#xD;
      department, unintended pregnancies among vulnerable adolescents may decrease. The term&#xD;
      vulnerable will be used throughout this application to refer to adolescent girls who seek&#xD;
      care for non-emergent complaints in emergency departments, are likely to be publicly insured&#xD;
      or uninsured, engage in risky behaviors, have co-morbid psychiatric disorders, or have&#xD;
      high-risk social characteristics such as interpersonal violence, substance abuse, or&#xD;
      poverty.(7-9) Vulnerable adolescents are at high risk of unintended pregnancy, yet are&#xD;
      difficult to reach through outpatient care settings. Initiation of contraception at the time&#xD;
      of pediatric emergency department encounter could reduce unintended pregnancy, reduce adverse&#xD;
      outcomes to the woman and her child associated with adolescent pregnancy, and reduce the&#xD;
      financial costs borne by society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, most contraception for adolescents is initiated through an outpatient encounter.&#xD;
      In New Mexico, adolescent girls aged 13 to 18 who present to an outpatient clinic for&#xD;
      contraception can be prescribed contraception or have a contraceptive device placed during&#xD;
      the clinic visit without parental consent under state law.(10) This approach has enjoyed&#xD;
      considerable success, with a 15-fold increase in the use of intrauterine or subdermal&#xD;
      contraceptive implants by adolescents seeking contraception over the past decade.(1) The&#xD;
      Contraceptive CHOICE study has demonstrated that adolescents have high acceptance of&#xD;
      long-acting, reversible forms of contraception.(5) Typically, providers of highly-effective&#xD;
      contraception are gynecologists, advanced practice physicians, and family practice&#xD;
      physicians. This has resulted in a scarcity of providers who can offer the long-acting,&#xD;
      reversible contraception to adolescents that is recommended by the American College of&#xD;
      Obstetricians and Gynecologists.(3,11) Additionally, not all adolescents are able to access&#xD;
      clinic-based, outpatient medical care by a gynecologist or family practitioner. Adolescents&#xD;
      who experience poverty, coercive sexual relationships, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, and&#xD;
      abuse are especially vulnerable to pregnancy.(12) These risk factors for adolescent pregnancy&#xD;
      mirror the characteristics of adolescents who utilize emergency departments for medical&#xD;
      care.(7-9,13) A prior survey of female adolescents and adults seeking care in an emergency&#xD;
      department felt it was acceptable to have contraceptive provision in the emergency&#xD;
      department. (14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known whether pediatric emergency medical providers can successfully initiate&#xD;
      contraception for adolescents in a pediatric emergency department. Adolescent girls who&#xD;
      present to the UNM Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) currently receive some contraceptive&#xD;
      and sexual health care, but the care delivered varies based on the provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a continuing education initiative at UNM, Dr. Nancy Sokkary, Adolescent Gynecologist, has&#xD;
      been providing educational sessions on current best contraceptive practices for adolescents&#xD;
      to pediatricians. Included in this education has been an FDA-approved procedural training in&#xD;
      the insertion of the subdermal contraceptive implant, Nexplanon. Pediatric residents and&#xD;
      attending physicians have begun to offer Nexplanon in the inpatient setting and in pediatric&#xD;
      clinics. As PED attending and fellow physicians, all of whom are board-certified&#xD;
      pediatricians, undergo this education, we anticipate increased knowledge on the part of PED&#xD;
      providers on current contraceptive recommendations. This proposed research capitalizes on an&#xD;
      opportunity to expand comprehensive counseling on contraception in the PED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited through the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) of the University&#xD;
      of New Mexico. Investigators will enroll adolescent girls 13 to 18 years of age who present&#xD;
      to the PED for non-emergent complaints and who are willing to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Adolescent girls who present to the PED during shifts staffed by an attending physician or&#xD;
      fellow trained in the study counseling intervention will be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
      Physicians who have completed Dr. Sokkary's continuing education on best practices in&#xD;
      adolescent contraception and the FDA-approved Nexplanon insertion training will be considered&#xD;
      trained in the counseling intervention. All consents and procedures will be performed in the&#xD;
      PED by a research coordinator or study investigator who will not be involved in the patient's&#xD;
      medical care during their emergency department encounter. All potentially eligible&#xD;
      participants will be approached by the research coordinator while their&#xD;
      parent/guardian/companion is outside of the patient room, as is routine for reproductive&#xD;
      health care in the PED. A unique study number will be assigned to each subject and noted on&#xD;
      all data collection forms containing only the study number. No patient identifiers will be&#xD;
      included on the data forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be offered clinical services regardless of their decision about&#xD;
      participating in the study. If a participant is withdrawn from the study either by her desire&#xD;
      or that of the PED provider, the PI of the study or the research staff, she may continue to&#xD;
      receive contraceptive care which will be up to the PED clinician providing clinical services&#xD;
      during the encounter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients can expect that participation will involve enrollment and a subsequent contraceptive&#xD;
      counseling intervention consisting of a handout, 10-minute DVD, and a one-on-one counseling&#xD;
      by a PED attending physician or fellow that will not total longer than one hour. For follow&#xD;
      up, all participants will be contacted by telephone by a study team member approximately 4&#xD;
      weeks after enrollment and will be administered a brief (approximately 10 minute) survey on&#xD;
      participant satisfaction with the counseling intervention and on any subsequent contraceptive&#xD;
      choices. Investigators will recruit participants during an 8-week pilot period. Investigators&#xD;
      anticipate recruitment to be completed by March of 2015 and preliminary analysis to be&#xD;
      complete by June 2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited through the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) at UNM.&#xD;
      Physicians in the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) are trained Pediatricians who provide&#xD;
      specialized care in Emergency Medicine. Sixty percent of PED attendings and fellows completed&#xD;
      training by Dr. Sokkary on best practices in adolescent contraception and in Nexplanon&#xD;
      insertion during September 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care for contraceptive counseling in the PED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common reason that adolescent girls present to the PED is persistent abdominal pain.&#xD;
      Other common reasons include urinary tract infections, concern for sexually transmitted&#xD;
      infections, pharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections, social stressors, and trauma. An&#xD;
      adolescent girl's first point of care in the PED is nurse triage. PED visits by adolescent&#xD;
      girls average a total duration of just over 4 hours. During nurse triage, a brief history of&#xD;
      the presenting complaint is taken, vital signs are collected, and medical care is initiated&#xD;
      based on nurse-driven protocols. During triage, female adolescent patients are routinely&#xD;
      interviewed privately with parent/guardian/companion outside of the room to screen for&#xD;
      pregnancy risk factors. They are provided with a urine specimen cup in anticipation of urine&#xD;
      pregnancy testing. Depending on the chief complaint, the triage nurse may privately screen&#xD;
      for other risk factors such as substance abuse or violence. After triage, the patient is&#xD;
      placed in one of 12 private patient rooms in the PED. They are evaluated by one to three&#xD;
      physicians in the PED depending on the staffing of the PED at that time. Medical evaluation&#xD;
      routinely consists of a medical history and a physical exam. In addition, routine care of&#xD;
      adolescents in the PED includes a social history that is obtained with the&#xD;
      parent/guardian/companion outside of the patient's room to protect confidentiality. During&#xD;
      the confidential portion of the medical encounter, most adolescents are asked about sexual&#xD;
      behavior, contraception, healthy relationships, and substance abuse. Currently, PED providers&#xD;
      offer contraceptive counseling on a case-by-case basis. If contraception counseling is&#xD;
      included as part of the confidential medical encounter, this is not a deviation from routine&#xD;
      care that the adolescent would receive in an outpatient clinic visit for simple chief&#xD;
      complaints. If adolescents express interest in initiating contraception or changing&#xD;
      contraceptive methods, PED providers are able to offer a range of contraceptive services. The&#xD;
      range of contraceptive services available in the PED include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emergency contraception (given in PED or as prescription);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prescription for contraception (including oral contraceptive pills, vaginal ring, dermal&#xD;
           patch);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate Depo-Provera injection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immediate subdermal contraceptive implant insertion (only available if patient seen by a&#xD;
           Nexplanon-trained provider); or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Referral to Adolescent Gynecology or Center for Reproductive Health for outpatient&#xD;
           initiation of contraception, including the IUD or subdermal contraceptive implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receiving contraceptive services in the PED are offered follow-up in Adolescent&#xD;
      Gynecology as an outpatient as usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research is a pilot study of a contraceptive counselling intervention,&#xD;
      administered by Pediatric Emergency Medicine providers for adolescent girls presenting to the&#xD;
      University of New Mexico Pediatric Emergency Department for non-contraceptive complaints. The&#xD;
      primary research question is: Is it feasible to initiate comprehensive contraceptive&#xD;
      counseling in a pediatric emergency department? The secondary research question is: What is&#xD;
      the impact of comprehensive contraceptive counseling on the initiation of contraception among&#xD;
      sexually active adolescents presenting to a pediatric emergency department?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall study design is a prospective cohort study. The two specific aims for the&#xD;
      proposed research reflect the two key perspectives of stakeholders in this proposed pilot&#xD;
      study. Specific aim #1, Determine the feasibility of comprehensive contraception counseling&#xD;
      in a pediatric emergency department, investigates the introduction of a contraceptive&#xD;
      practice within the existing time and resource constraints of emergency medical providers in&#xD;
      a busy emergency department. Specific aim #2, Determine the impact of comprehensive&#xD;
      contraceptive counseling on initiation of contraception among sexually active adolescents&#xD;
      presenting to a pediatric emergency department, elicits the effectiveness of providing&#xD;
      contraceptive counseling during an emergency department encounter from the perspective of&#xD;
      adolescents. Feasibility, as operationalized in this application, requires attainment of our&#xD;
      measurable, hypothesized outcomes by both participating emergency medical providers and&#xD;
      adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will include post-menarchal girls ages 13 - 18 who present to the&#xD;
      Pediatric Emergency Department for non-contraceptive complaints. Investigators will enroll&#xD;
      subjects during an 8-week period. Subjects will only be enrolled during a patient care shift&#xD;
      staffed by a Pediatric Emergency Medicine provider who has completed Dr. Nancy Sokkary's&#xD;
      contraceptive educational session and Nexplanon insertion training as part of continuing&#xD;
      education. Female adolescents will be screened for study eligibility at triage by a triage&#xD;
      nurse using a standardized set of criteria (see Appendix A and B). The eligibility criteria&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ages 13 to 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speaks English or Spanish&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has menstrual periods&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Has Medicaid insurance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is not seeking contraception as their primary complaint&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is not currently pregnant based on urine or serum pregnancy testing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does not have an IUD or contraceptive implant (Implanon/Nexplanon)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is not critically ill, hemodynamically unstable, altered mental status, developmentally&#xD;
           delayed, severe pain or distress, or have major trauma&#xD;
&#xD;
      The triage nurse will alert the Unit Clerk who will contact the on-call research coordinator&#xD;
      after verifying insurance eligibility criteria. The research coordinator will further&#xD;
      determine study eligibility. Per usual care in the Pediatric ED, most adolescent girls will&#xD;
      be screened for pregnancy by urine or serum testing as part of their routine medical care&#xD;
      initiated through triage. A small number of adolescent girls may not be screened for&#xD;
      pregnancy at triage or during their subsequent medical care according to usual care for their&#xD;
      specific presenting complaints. If girls are otherwise eligible for study participation but&#xD;
      have not undergone pregnancy testing as a routine part of their medical care in the PED,&#xD;
      these potentially eligible participants will be provided with a point-of-care urine pregnancy&#xD;
      test at no cost to the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patients are eligible and choose to participate in the research study, consent for&#xD;
      participation will be obtained. Under the requested waiver of parental consent, potential&#xD;
      participants will be consented and enrolled with the parents/guardian/companion outside of&#xD;
      the patient's room. The research coordinator/study investigator will explain the constraints&#xD;
      of confidentiality in accordance with the recruitment script (see Appendix C) and will&#xD;
      explain that while reproductive health care is confidential, any disclosures of intent to&#xD;
      self-harm, intent to harm others, or abuse perpetrated upon the participant will require&#xD;
      immediate disclosure to the participant's PED medical provider. At the time of enrollment,&#xD;
      the research coordinator/study investigator will administer a patient enrolment questionnaire&#xD;
      that contains questions about demographics and factors that increase risk of adolescent&#xD;
      pregnancy (Appendix D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be completed on the same day as the patient's emergency department&#xD;
      encounter by the research coordinator/study investigator and stored using REDCap. The REDCap&#xD;
      database will be stored on a secure server at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences&#xD;
      Center (UNM HSC), and the database will only be accessed by University of New Mexico's Human&#xD;
      Resources Protections Office (HRPO) approved co-investigators on UNM HSC password-protected&#xD;
      computers. Patients will fill out contact information on paper collection forms and the&#xD;
      information will then be entered into an Access database. Demographic characteristics and any&#xD;
      questionnaires will be collected on paper forms and entered into the REDCap database. All&#xD;
      data will be destroyed 7 years after HRPO completion date with patient information destroyed&#xD;
      via shredding of paper documents. Patient identifiers linked to the data will be destroyed by&#xD;
      removal of the file from the hard drive of the UNM computer used to store the information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention will consist of comprehensive contraceptive counseling through a&#xD;
      standardized bundle of services, including a 10-minute educational DVD, handouts on&#xD;
      contraceptive methods, and one-on-one contraceptive counseling by the PED physician. Patients&#xD;
      who are enrolled in the study will have a color-coded tag applied to their physical patient&#xD;
      chart and the door of their room at the time of enrollment. Emergency department ancillary&#xD;
      staff will bring the educational DVD developed specifically for this project by UNM Family&#xD;
      Planning and Adolescent Gynecology providers (see Appendix E) and the educational handouts&#xD;
      (see Appendix F) to the room at the time that the tag is displayed. Every room in the PED is&#xD;
      equipped with a combination DVD player/video display. All participating patients will also&#xD;
      receive one-on-one contraceptive counseling by one the of Pediatric Emergency Medicine&#xD;
      providers after watching the DVD.If study participants express interest to the PED provider&#xD;
      in initiating contraception or changing to a more effective method of contraception after&#xD;
      receiving the counseling intervention, participants will be offered all available options in&#xD;
      the PED for which they are medically eligible as per usual care All participants will be&#xD;
      contacted by telephone by a research coordinator approximately 4 weeks after enrollment and&#xD;
      administered a questionnaire (see Appendix G) regarding their satisfaction with receiving&#xD;
      contraceptive counseling in the Pediatric Emergency Department and any subsequent changes in&#xD;
      their contraceptive practices. Additionally, all participants will undergo a one-time chart&#xD;
      review at approximately 4 weeks post-enrollment to determine the rate of successful follow-up&#xD;
      with Adolescent Gynecology or Center for Reproductive Health for this group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 8 week intervention, the Pediatric Emergency Medicine providers who&#xD;
      participated in Dr.Sokkary's contraceptive educational session and the study intervention&#xD;
      will complete a short survey (see Appendix I: Provider Questionnaire) administered by the&#xD;
      research coordinator. This survey is to elicit the physicians' impressions regarding patient&#xD;
      throughput during the clinical intervention, as well as impact on physician workflow. No&#xD;
      personal or identifying information will be collected from the providers. We are requesting&#xD;
      for a waiver of written documentation of consent for this PED provider survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit adolescent girls presenting to the Pediatric Emergency Department.&#xD;
      Adolescents who seek care for non-emergent complaints in emergency departments may be an&#xD;
      especially vulnerable population, as prior research has demonstrated that these adolescents&#xD;
      are likely to be publicly insured or uninsured, engage in risky behaviors, have co-morbid&#xD;
      psychiatric disorders, or have high-risk social characteristics such as interpersonal&#xD;
      violence, substance abuse, or poverty (Melzer-Lange, 1996; Wilson, 2000; Ziv, 1998).&#xD;
      Adolescents who experience poverty, coercive sexual relationships, co-morbid psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders, and abuse are especially vulnerable to pregnancy (Klein, 2005). These risk factors&#xD;
      for adolescent pregnancy mirror the characteristics of adolescents who utilize emergency&#xD;
      departments for medical care. Investigators hope to improve access to contraceptive care for&#xD;
      this group of adolescents. However, to avoid coercion, no incentives for study participation&#xD;
      will be offered. Because adolescents who seek care in emergency departments are more likely&#xD;
      to have high-risk social characteristics, it is possible that participants may disclose&#xD;
      physical or sexual abuse, assault, commercial sexual activity, suicidality, or homicidality.&#xD;
      Any disclosures that qualify for mandated reporting that occur within the study will be&#xD;
      disclosed immediately to the attending PED provider so that appropriate child safety&#xD;
      authorities can be notified. Coordination of care with child safety authorities is routine&#xD;
      care in the PED and child safety authorities, including CYFD and law enforcement agencies,&#xD;
      are contacted by the PED daily in the course of routine care.&#xD;
