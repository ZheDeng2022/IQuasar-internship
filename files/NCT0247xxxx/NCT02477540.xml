    <textblock>
      If the participant voluntarily agrees to participate in the clinical trial before&#xD;
      registration, the investigator conducts a screening test to evaluate the participant's&#xD;
      suitability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant that satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria is assigned a test&#xD;
      group(2-time injection group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants conduct cell therapy within 30 days after bone marrow aspiration, and will&#xD;
      re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cells within 30 days after first injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will make a total of 5 hospital visits after registration, and Safety and&#xD;
      Efficacy will be evaluated based on a fixed procedure on every visit.&#xD;

Visual Analogue Scale(VAS):&#xD;
Using a ruler, the score is determined by mea-suring the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark, providing a range of scores from 0-100. A higher score indicates greater pain intensity.&#xD;
the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4 mm), mild pain(5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75-100 mm)</description>
