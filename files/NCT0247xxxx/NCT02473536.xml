      Stereotactic Ablative Radiation Therapy (SABR): 5 fractions of 8 Gy or 3 fractions of 12Gy.&#xD;
      The concept of stereotactic radiosurgery involves tightly conforming dose of therapeutic&#xD;
      radiation confined to a small region of the body. This results in eradication or ablation of&#xD;
      the target tumor with sparing of surrounding normal tissues. The largest experience with&#xD;
      stereotactic radiosurgery is for the treatment of intracranial tumors Neoadjuvant treatment&#xD;
      of IVC-TT with SABR may decrease local recurrences and lower the likelihood of embolic&#xD;
      complications and systemic metastasis.&#xD;

          7. Contraindication for contrast-enhanced MRI as defined by the standard operating&#xD;
             procedures of the Department of Radiology at UT Southwestern. Briefly, these include&#xD;
             medically unstable; cardiac pacemaker; intracranial clips, metal implants; metal in&#xD;
             the eyes; pregnant or nursing; claustrophobia; and impairment of the renal function&#xD;
