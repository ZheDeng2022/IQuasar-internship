  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus are seriously infectious diseases in children. Since using&#xD;
      of the adsorption diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis (DTwP), it greatly reduced&#xD;
      incidence of the three kinds of diseases. But the thallus of pertussis in the vaccine may&#xD;
      cause more side reactions after vaccination. Since 2000, the basic immunization DTwP vaccine&#xD;
      has been replaced by adsorption tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine in American.&#xD;
      In 1995, DTaP was successfully developed in China, and have been used in EPI at present.&#xD;
      Because of effective immunity and little side reaction, DTaP has been widely recognized and&#xD;
      accepted by the parents.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus are seriously infectious diseases for children. The world&#xD;
      health organization (WHO) included the adsorption diphtheria-tetanus-whole-cell pertussis&#xD;
      (DTwP) into the expanded program on immunization (EPI), as a basic immunization. Since using&#xD;
      the DTwP, it greatly reduced incidence of the three kinds of diseases. Thousands of children&#xD;
      have been saved since its application. Although the DTwP was productively in against&#xD;
      pertussis, diphtheria and tetanus, thallus of pertussis in the vaccine could cause more side&#xD;
      reactions after vaccination. Many individuals did not want to be vaccinated. However, there&#xD;
      was two large epidemics of pertussis during the period of 1977-1979 and 1981-1983. Since&#xD;
      2000, the basic immunization DTwP vaccine has been replaced by adsorption&#xD;
      tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP) vaccine in American. In 1995, DTaP was&#xD;
      successful developed in the investigators' country, and is used in EPI at present. Because of&#xD;
      effective immunity and causing little side reaction, DTaP has been widely recognized and&#xD;
      accepted by the parents. This clinical trial is planning to evaluate the immunogenicity and&#xD;
      safety of DTaP in 3-5 months infants .&#xD;
