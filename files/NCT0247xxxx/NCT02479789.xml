    <textblock>
      Intra operative Nerve Monitoring ( IONM ) is rapidly becoming the standard of care for&#xD;
      thyroid surgery to prevent injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. However the laryngo&#xD;
      tracheal reflexes need to be adequately suppressed to permit proper utilization of intra&#xD;
      operative nerve monitoring. Increasing the depth of anesthesia to achieve this often leads to&#xD;
      side effects. Intravenous lidocaine infusion has been shown to be effective in blunting these&#xD;
      reflexes. The planned study intends to look at the efficacy of intravenous lidocaine infusion&#xD;
      in decreasing the amount of anesthesia medications needed to suppress the reflexes. Also the&#xD;
      study looks at the analgesic and anti emetic properties of intravenous lidocaine infusion&#xD;
      post operatively by measuring these outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a double blinded randomized controlled trial with 30 subjects in the&#xD;
      group who will receive intravenous lidocaine during surgery and 30 subjects in the group who&#xD;
      will receive placebo. Blunting of the laryngo tracheal reflexes intra operatively will be&#xD;
      recorded as the primary outcome. The amount of anesthesia medications, the post operative&#xD;
      patient comfort level, pain control, usage of narcotic pain medications, nausea, vomiting&#xD;
      will be recorded as secondary outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intra Operative Nerve Monitoring ( IONM) is rapidly becoming a standard of care in many&#xD;
      institutions across the country. While the overall incidence of nerve palsy is low, when it&#xD;
      occurs it is a devastating lifelong handicap . Several studies have documented that routine&#xD;
      identification of the RLN with IONM has decreased the rates of permanent RLN palsy It is not&#xD;
      designed to visualize the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), but to allow intra-operative&#xD;
      assessment of RLN function as well as to establish a prognosis in patients developing RLN&#xD;
      paralysis. Complete functionality of the IONM depends on near total laryngeal relaxation and&#xD;
      reflex suppression without the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). The depth of&#xD;
      anesthesia required to meet that criteria often leads to hemodynamic instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the IONM signal is unchanged after the resection, the surgeon can be reassured that&#xD;
      postoperative vocal cord function is normal in 99.6% of cases. Where the IONM signal is&#xD;
      absent or abnormal, 30-45% of the patients will develop vocal cord dysfunction&#xD;
      postoperatively The successful deployment and data analysis from the IONM depends upon the&#xD;
      complete laryngeal relaxation and reflex suppression. The IONM causes strong contractions of&#xD;
      the vocal cords and is an independent cause of laryngeal alterations . The surgical procedure&#xD;
      is a strong factor of stress to the larynx with a potentially traumatic manipulation at the&#xD;
      level of the larynx . Complete functionality of the IONM constitutes before the full&#xD;
      electromyographic recovery of the NMB at the adductor pollicis muscle , as the laryngeal&#xD;
      muscles recover faster than the peripheral muscles . The anesthetic technique chosen should&#xD;
      ensure absolute laryngeal reflex suppression as the effect of the short acting depolarizing&#xD;
      muscle relaxant is wearing off immediately following intubation, until preferably the&#xD;
      extubation. Be it total intravenous anesthesia or inhalation-based anesthesia, the depth&#xD;
      required for reflex suppression can cause profound cardiovascular instability. While the&#xD;
      attempts to titrate down the anesthetic depth can cause resurfacing of the troublesome&#xD;
      laryngeal reflexes, attempts to counter the side effects with sympathomimetic agents can&#xD;
      themselves result in a myriad of undesirable hemodynamic consequences. The resulting&#xD;
      hemodynamic fluctuations can result in adverse outcomes in patients with significant&#xD;
      cardiovascular co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laryngoscopy with or without intubation, provokes a sympathoadrenal response. These events&#xD;
      are especially detrimental in individuals who have limited myocardial reserve because of age&#xD;
      or disease; these include geriatric population and those with significant coronary&#xD;
      arteriosclerosis as in diabetes mellitus, sustained hypertension, angina, ischemic heart&#xD;
      disease and cardiac dysrhythmias . IV lidocaine decreases the intracellular Ca2+&#xD;
      concentration in airway smooth muscle, decreases myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity and has been&#xD;
      shown to suppress coughing and prevent reflex broncho constriction. Injected intravenously,&#xD;
      lidocaine is variably effective in blunting the hemodynamic response to tracheal intubation .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV lidocaine has analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic and anti-inflammatory properties. Local&#xD;
      anesthetics can reduce the postoperative inflammatory response in several ways such as&#xD;
      blocking neural transmission at the site of tissue injury and thus attenuating neurogenic&#xD;
      inflammation. In addition because of anti-inflammatory properties of their own, they may&#xD;
      inhibit the migration of granulocytes and release of lysosomal enzymes, consequently leading&#xD;
      to a decreased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Pro-inflammatory cytokines can induce&#xD;
      peripheral and central sensitization, leading to pain augmentation (hyperalgesia)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of its plasma half life of 8 min, an IV bolus of 1 - 1.5 mg/kg lidocaine must be&#xD;
      followed by infusion of 1 - 4 mg/min in adults in order to maintain therapeutic levels of 1.5&#xD;
      - 4 μg/mL (15, 16). Lidocaine side effects have never been reported in its intended use,&#xD;
      probably because the first clinical signs of toxicity occur at considerably high blood&#xD;
      concentrations (&gt; 5 μg/mL), which did not occur even when IV lidocaine was given continuously&#xD;
      over 14 days . Lidocaine infusion at the rate of 1.5 mg/kg/h following a bolus of 1.5 mg/kg&#xD;
      has been employed in a newborn to perform an intra-operative wake-up test during neurosurgery&#xD;
      . It was also used during thyroidectomy in 60 y old patient with cardiac co morbidities This&#xD;
      will be a prospective double blinded randomized controlled trial done at Bronx Lebanon&#xD;
      Hospital Center. 60 consecutive patients undergoing thyroidectomy using nerve monitoring will&#xD;
      be randomized into two groups of thirty each. One group will receive IV Lidocaine infusion&#xD;
      during the surgery to facilitate the nerve monitoring. The other group will receive a&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nurse administrator in the General Surgery clinic will talk to all patients coming to the&#xD;
      clinic for thyroid surgery and will inform them about the study. A booklet explaining the&#xD;
      nature of the study, risks and benefits will be provided to the patients by the&#xD;
      administrator. Patients who are willing to participate in the study will be asked to convey&#xD;
      the same with the surgeon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this the patients will be sent for pre operative medical evaluation and testing. Based&#xD;
      on the history, physical examination, investigations and medical evaluation, they will be&#xD;
      included or excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent will then be taken from the patients willing to participate in the study and&#xD;
      those who meet the inclusion criteria. This consent will be separate from the surgical&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will come to ambulatory surgery after overnight fasting. Vitals will be checked&#xD;
      and the patient is seen by the anesthesiologist and surgeon in the ambulatory surgery unit.&#xD;
      There after the patient is wheeled into the operating room for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two days prior to the surgery, pharmacy will be notified of the case. The research pharmacist&#xD;
      will prepare the lidocaine or placebo vial according to the randomization chart. This will be&#xD;
      picked up and given to the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery is done in supine position with the head extended using a shoulder roll. Propofol&#xD;
      and Fentanyl are used for induction. Neuro muscular blockade which is routinely used in other&#xD;
      surgeries will not be used in this surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dragonfly Single Channel Laryngeal Surface Electrode (Electrode LSE 500Ms; Neurovision&#xD;
      Medical Products,Ventura, CA, USA) will be applied to a #7 cuffed ETT (Medline Industries,&#xD;
      Mundelein, Illinois, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The patient will be&#xD;
      pre-oxygenated and then induced with a bolus of midazolam 2 mg and fentanyl 1.25 μg/kg&#xD;
      followed by etomidate 0.25 mg/kg and succinylcholine 1.2 mg/kg intravenously. Direct&#xD;
      laryngoscopy is done and endotracheal intubation is done. The nerve monitoring apparatus is&#xD;
      set up and the placement of the electrode plates touching the vocal cords will be verified&#xD;
      under vision with a Glidescope®, after positioning the patient with the desired neck&#xD;
      extension or by impedence measurement. The patient will be cleaned and draped.The patients&#xD;
      will receive a bolus of 1 mg /Kg of IV lidocaine/Placebo ( 0.9% saline) followed by 1.5&#xD;
      mg/KG/h of IV lidocaine/Placebo ( 0.9% saline) infusion during the surgery which will be&#xD;
      stopped at extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esmolol in titrated boluses will be used to blunt the sympatho adrenal responses during the&#xD;
      intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with 50:50 mixture of air in oxygen and 1 - 2&#xD;
      minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane. IV infusion of propofol 50 μg/ kg/min will be&#xD;
      titrated to effect for maintenance. Intra operative nerve monitoring ( IONM) will be used to&#xD;
      identify the recurrenct laryngeal nerves. Dragonfly Single Channel Laryngeal Surface&#xD;
      Electrode [Neurovision Medical Products, Ventura, CA; Electrode LSE 500Ms] will be used as&#xD;
      part of the electromyography circuit to facilitate the neve monitoring. A Bispectral Index&#xD;
      (BIS) monitor (Aspect Medical Systems, Newton, MA; Model 1 A 2000) will be used to guard&#xD;
      against &quot;recall&quot; during lighter planes of anesthesia and a train of four (TOF) monitor [&#xD;
      Microstim Plus, Neurotechnology, Houston, Texas, USA ] will be employed to guard against&#xD;
      inadvertent neuromuscular blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed as a double blinded randomized controlled trial with 30 subjects in the&#xD;
      group who will receive intravenous lidocaine during surgery and 30 subjects in the group who&#xD;
      will receive placebo. The intended period of the study will be one year. Blunting of the&#xD;
      laryngo tracheal reflexes intra operatively will be recorded as the primary outcome. The&#xD;
      amount of anesthesia medications, the post operative patient comfort level, pain control,&#xD;
      usage of narcotic pain medications, nausea, vomiting will be recorded as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
