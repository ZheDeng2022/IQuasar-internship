      The purpose of this research study is to study the effect of fish oil and bicarbonate (baking&#xD;
      soda) on exercise. In this study fish oil, bicarbonate or both will be compared to placebo to&#xD;
      see if study participants increase exercise capacity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a high morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD). Both conditions are common in older patients. Reduced exercise&#xD;
      capacity predicts poorer outcomes in patients with CVD2 and CKD. Although exercise tolerance&#xD;
      is impaired in CKD4 limited improvement in these patients is possible. A critical gap in&#xD;
      knowledge is how to optimize exercise capacity in these patients to improve quality and&#xD;
      possibly length of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In CKD, both structure and function of skeletal muscle are deranged. In addition, energy&#xD;
      production by mitochondria which falls with age, and various diseases is also reduced in CKD.&#xD;
      Recent studies from our group have reported that differences in mitochondrial function are&#xD;
      associated with variances in physical ability, exercise capacity, and gait speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In preliminary data, patients entering our Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR) with Stage III CKD&#xD;
      [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2] had a decreased improvement in&#xD;
      exercise capacity compared to those with a normal GFR (Δ1.7 vs 2.7 Metabolic Equivalents of&#xD;
      Exercise or METs, p&lt;0.05) despite the same degree of adherence. Exercise capacity after CR in&#xD;
      patients with a reduced GFR was greater in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) users&#xD;
      than in non-users [Δ MET 2.0 (1.4-2.5) vs 1.4 (1.1-1.7), p&lt;0.05], suggesting that n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      with exercise may be better than exercise alone. With beneficial clinical effects in CKD, n-3&#xD;
      PUFA are now being extensively investigated in the dialysis population. In other patient&#xD;
      populations, including those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy daily ingestion/use of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) or fish oil&#xD;
      improves exercise capacity. This intervention is safe, simple and well-tolerated. Multiple&#xD;
      lines of evidence suggest muscle and mitochondrial function improve with exercise and n-3&#xD;
      PUFA supplementation.Such treatment may improve mitochondrial bioenergetics by various&#xD;
      mechanisms including up-regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and genes involved in&#xD;
      mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, as well as increase in mitochondrial content, and&#xD;
      function. Flow mediated vasodilation is impaired in CKD. It too may be improved by n-3 PUFA&#xD;
      supplementation which could be an alternative mechanism for improved oxygen delivery to&#xD;
      muscle in older patients with CAD and CKD as in the non-CKD population. A further possible&#xD;
      benefit of n-3 PUFA is suppression of inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current practice, however, is to enter patients with CAD and CKD into standard CR without&#xD;
      prescription of n-3 PUFA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental and epidemiological studies indicate that acidemia and metabolic acidosis are&#xD;
      associated with the development and progression of CKD and with increased mortality in these&#xD;
      patients. Metabolic acidosis associated with CKD also contributes to skeletal muscle atrophy&#xD;
      by activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome axis. Even slight correction of acidosis can&#xD;
      improve the anabolic state of muscle by downregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.&#xD;
      Clinically, bicarbonate supplementation may improve muscle function. This intervention is&#xD;
      also safe, simple and well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that muscular function is abnormal in CKD and that both n-3 PUFA and bicarbonate&#xD;
      supplementation have been shown to improve muscular function and exercise capacity, it is our&#xD;
      purpose in this investigation to study the effects of these substances on exercise capacity&#xD;
      in patients with CAD and CKD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 2x2 factorial&#xD;
      design, pilot study of n-3 PUFA and/or oral bicarbonate use in older (age &gt;60 years) CAD&#xD;
      patients with concomitant CKD enrolling in a standard, 3-month CR program. The investigators&#xD;
      will assess the effects of this intervention on exercise capacity, markers of inflammation&#xD;
      and serum bicarbonate concentration. The investigator's goal is to obtain 8 evaluable&#xD;
      patients per group. Exercise capacity will be measured by Oxygen (VO2) peak. Response to&#xD;
      bicarbonate will be monitored by serum bicarbonate concentration. Since CKD may adversely&#xD;
      affect muscle function both by acidosis and/or mitochondrial function, the investigator's&#xD;
      propose that these may be mechanisms for the poorer exercise capacity in these patients. The&#xD;
      investigator's overarching hypothesis is that exercise capacity response to CR in older&#xD;
      patients with CKD may be modifiable by concomitant n-3 PUFA and/or bicarbonate use to&#xD;
      suppress acidosis.&#xD;
