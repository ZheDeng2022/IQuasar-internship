  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip arthroscopy is a rapidly evolving procedure that has seen an exponential increase in the&#xD;
      number of cases performed yearly. With hip arthroscopy still in its infancy in relation to&#xD;
      knee and shoulder arthroscopy, there are still many questions yet to be answered. Axioms that&#xD;
      were once thought to be true regarding indications and treatment for hip arthroscopy are&#xD;
      continually being revised. As with the knee and shoulder before it, the hip is now graduating&#xD;
      into treatment avenues that were otherwise thought to only be possible through an open&#xD;
      surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Viscosupplementation in patients post arthroscopy with known articular cartilage injury has&#xD;
      been shown to be efficacious. The pathophysiology of hyaline degradation during the arthritic&#xD;
      process within the knee has been studied, and with this understanding has grown the&#xD;
      widespread usage of viscosupplementation. While questions still exist regarding the&#xD;
      effectiveness of viscosupplementation in non-weightbearing joints, it appears the benefits&#xD;
      seen in the weight bearing joints, such as the knee, are apparent&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Preoperative inclusion criteria will be made via x-ray and MRI evaluation. These criteria&#xD;
        shall include: 2 mm or greater joint space preservation of the hip on radiographs, absence&#xD;
        of acetabular subcortical bone cysts, Tonnis Score less than 2 on radiographs, and patient&#xD;
        age greater than 18.4 Intra-operative evaluation of the cartilage will be performed by the&#xD;
        surgeon on both the acetabular and femoral head sides. Patients shall be included if the&#xD;
        osteochondral defect meets Outerbridge Classification criteria of stage II or greater.&#xD;
        Furthermore the lesion shall be greater than 1cm in size (and thus not amenable to other&#xD;
        procedures such as microfracture). Subjects must be willing to sign the IRB-approved&#xD;
        informed consent and be older than 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All patients 55 years of age and older. All patients with previous hip surgery on a&#xD;
        concomitant side. Patients who present a history of radiculopathy or regional pain&#xD;
        syndrome. Patients with a worker's compensation claim or pending litigation claim. Patients&#xD;
        with Outerbridge Grade IV changes on either acetabular or femoral articular cartilage.&#xD;
