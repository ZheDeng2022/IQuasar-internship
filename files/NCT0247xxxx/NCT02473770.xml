      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Disasters like earthquakes, floods, and oil spills can give people health problems. Workers&#xD;
      who respond to a disaster (like police and firefighters) are directly exposed to contaminants&#xD;
      during the emergency response. So they could be at the greatest risk for these problems.&#xD;
      Researchers want to gather data about these workers before and right after they go to a&#xD;
      disaster. They hope this will help them understand the health effects of disasters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To answer questions about the health effects of disaster exposures. To create a participant&#xD;
      registry and collect biological samples and health data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People at least 21 years of age who are sent to a disaster area for an emergency response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 1 study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will answer questions about:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contact information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health, lifestyle, emotions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disaster response activities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Things they are exposed to in the environment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have blood collected from a vein in the arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may give biological samples. These may be urine, saliva, cheek cells, nail&#xD;
           clippings, or hair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a short physical exam. They may have their hip and waist measured&#xD;
           over their clothes. The amount of oxygen in their blood may be measured by a sensor on a&#xD;
           finger or ear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a lung function test. They will take a deep breath and exhale&#xD;
           strongly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked to agree to be contacted later to update contact data and&#xD;
           learn about future studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disasters are frequently associated with environmental exposures and socioeconomic&#xD;
      disruptions that may lead to short- and long-term health consequences. Disaster response&#xD;
      workers are potentially at the greatest risk for adverse outcomes due to direct exposure to&#xD;
      hazardous environmental contaminants during the emergency response process. The importance of&#xD;
      conducting disaster responder research in the immediate aftermath of disasters has become&#xD;
      widely recognized, but numerous barriers to doing so have also been recognized. The Rapid&#xD;
      Acquisition of Pre- and Post-Incident Disaster Data (RAPIDD) protocol aims to address this&#xD;
      gap by registering and characterizing a cohort of disaster response workers early in the&#xD;
      disaster response phase to obtain baseline characteristics. Disaster response workers&#xD;
      deployed to a disaster area to conduct emergency response activities will be targeted for&#xD;
      enrollment. Disaster responders may include police, fire, and emergency medical personnel, as&#xD;
      well as other responder groups such as public health personnel and workers involved in&#xD;
      environmental remediation and restoration activities. The primary objective of the RAPIDD&#xD;
      study is to create a research registry comprised of disaster response workers who are&#xD;
      rostered before or immediately after deployment to a disaster area. Important secondary aims&#xD;
      are to administer questionnaires and collect biological samples to characterize the cohort in&#xD;
      a manner that will allow for future prospective analyses of associations between disaster&#xD;
      exposures and health outcomes. In order to achieve these aims, we have developed a protocol,&#xD;
      operational manuals, questionnaires, data collection systems, training plans, and other tools&#xD;
      to reduce the time required to initiate disaster research. We will also obtain scientific and&#xD;
      regulatory approval of the protocol in advance of the disaster in hopes that expedited&#xD;
      amendments, with clarifications of the research, will minimize delays associated with various&#xD;
      review cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to characterize the cohort prior to their involvement with response activities that&#xD;
      could lead to disaster-related exposures, we will attempt to collect a wide range of&#xD;
      questionnaire data, clinical measurements and biological samples. Questionnaires may cover&#xD;
      topics including contact information, demographics, socioeconomic status, medical history,&#xD;
      current physical and mental health status, occupational exposures, alcohol and tobacco use&#xD;
      and other lifestyle factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological specimens collected may include the following: blood, urine, nail clippings,&#xD;
      saliva, buccal cells or hair. Clinical measurements may include vital signs, anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements and spirometry. By seeking IRB and other regulatory approvals for carrying out&#xD;
      this research in advance, we anticipate that we will be able to submit expedited amendments&#xD;
      to clarify the research plan for a specific disaster so that research can be initiated early&#xD;
      in the response phase. However, in the very early phases of some disaster situations, it may&#xD;
      not be safe or feasible to collect the data needed to fully characterize a cohort of response&#xD;
      workers. In these situations, data collection may be limited to rostering and limited&#xD;
      self-collection of biospecimens. As the response effort stabilizes and more becomes known&#xD;
      about potential exposures and related adverse health outcomes, we intend to expand our data&#xD;
      collection effort, and we will seek expedited regulatory approval to do so.&#xD;
