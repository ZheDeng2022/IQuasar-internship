  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, partially blinded, sequential cohort,&#xD;
      dose-escalation study designed to obtain preliminary data on the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      early efficacy of Q-Cells® transplantation in subjects with ALS. Following an initial cohort&#xD;
      receiving cell transplants unilaterally in the lumbar spinal cord, subsequent cohorts will&#xD;
      receive escalating doses transplanted unilaterally in cervical spinal cord. Subjects and&#xD;
      outcome measure assessors will be blinded to side of treatment. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      at sites with extensive clinical experience with the care of patients with ALS.&#xD;

      This study is a non-randomized, open-label, partially blinded, sequential cohort,&#xD;
      dose-escalation study designed to obtain preliminary data on the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      early efficacy of Q-Cells® transplantation in subjects with ALS. Following an initial cohort&#xD;
      receiving cell transplants unilaterally in the lumbar spinal cord, subsequent cohorts will&#xD;
      receive escalating doses transplanted unilaterally in cervical spinal cord. Subjects and&#xD;
      outcome measure assessors will be blinded to side of treatment. The study will be conducted&#xD;
      at sites with extensive clinical experience with the care of patients with ALS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to enroll up to 30 subjects over 24 months. Each subject will receive a&#xD;
      single time point administration of Q-Cells®: with 5 or 10 (dependent upon dose level)&#xD;
      transplantation foci targeted to the anterior horn in either the lumbar or cervical spinal&#xD;
      cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of Screening, Pre-operative/Treatment, and Post-treatment study periods.&#xD;
      The study data will be assessed for safety and efficacy after the last subject has completed&#xD;
      the 9-month study visit. Following the 9-month study period, subjects who consent will&#xD;
      continue to be followed for safety and efficacy long-term in a separate protocol.&#xD;
