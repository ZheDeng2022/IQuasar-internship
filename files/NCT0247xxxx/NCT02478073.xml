      Antibiotic dosing in critically ill patients poses a challenge for clinicians due to the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic changes seen in this population. Piperacillin/tazobactam is often used for&#xD;
      empirical treatment, and initial appropriate dosing is crucial for reducing mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), treated with piperacillin/tazobactam, had their&#xD;
      plasma concentration of piperacillin determined 1-3 times weekly. Patients received&#xD;
      piperacillin as intermittent bolus infusion 3 times daily or as continuous infusion (this was&#xD;
      up to the treating physician). Time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC)&#xD;
      estimated for each patient was evaluated against clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas&#xD;
      aeruginosa (16 mg/L). Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets evaluated were 100% f&#xD;
      T&gt;MIC (free piperacillin concentration maintained above the MIC throughout the dosing&#xD;
      interval) and 50% fT&gt;4xMIC (free piperacillin concentration maintained at a level fourfold&#xD;
      the MIC for at least 50% of the dosing interval).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Early appropriate antimicrobial therapy is of utmost importance for reducing mortality in&#xD;
      critically ill patients with sepsis and septic shock. Pathophysiological changes associated&#xD;
      with the septic process, such as changes in volume of distribution (Vd), drug clearance (CL),&#xD;
      decrease in plasma-protein concentration and organ dysfunction, lead to pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      changes that may alter the efficacy of the antimicrobial given. As a consequence, antibiotic&#xD;
      plasma concentrations are variable and hard to predict in these patients, which makes optimal&#xD;
      antibiotic exposure a challenge, especially in the early phase of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piperacillin/tazobactam is a β-lactam - β-lactamase inhibitor combination frequently used for&#xD;
      empirical treatment in the critically ill. It is a time-dependent antibiotic where&#xD;
      antibacterial activity is related to the time for which the free, unbound concentration of&#xD;
      the drug is maintained above the minimal inhibitory concentration (f T&gt;MIC). Maximizing f&#xD;
      T&gt;MIC both increases the therapeutic impact and reduces the risk of drug resistance&#xD;
      development. Because of the PK changes seen in the critically ill, standard dosing of&#xD;
      antimicrobials may result in subtherapeutic plasma-concentrations and it has been suggested&#xD;
      that current empiric dosing recommendations for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients are&#xD;
      inadequate and needs to be reconsidered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Piperacillin/tazobactam is generally administered either as 4g/0.5g every 8 hour (h) or as&#xD;
      12g given continuously over 24 hours.The aim of this study is to determine if this dosing&#xD;
      results in therapeutic plasma concentrations in septic patients. Patients treated with&#xD;
      piperacillin/tazobactam given as intermittent bolus infusion had piperacillin plasma&#xD;
      concentrations determined once a week. Patients treated with piperacillin/tazobactam given as&#xD;
      continuous infusion had piperacillin plasma concentrations determined three times a week.&#xD;
      Time above the minimal inhibitory concentration (T&gt;MIC) estimated for each patient was&#xD;
      evaluated against clinical breakpoint MIC for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 mg/L).&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) targets evaluated were 100% f T&gt;MIC (free&#xD;
      piperacillin concentration maintained above the MIC throughout the dosing interval) and 50%&#xD;
      fT&gt;4xMIC (free piperacillin concentration maintained at a level fourfold the MIC for at least&#xD;
      50% of the dosing interval).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unbound piperacillin plasma concentrations were determined using ultra high performance&#xD;
      liquid chromatography (UPLC). There was no intervention in the study.&#xD;
