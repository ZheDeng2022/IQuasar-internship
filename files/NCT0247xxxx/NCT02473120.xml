      The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency ESR1 mutations by Digital PCR in&#xD;
      patient with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Breast cancer is the most common cancer in woman. Aromatase inhibitors have demonstrated a&#xD;
      real efficacy however a resistance to treatment exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ESR1 mutations appear like involved in the mechanism of resistance to aromatase inhibitors&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine the frequency ESR1 mutations by Digital PCR in&#xD;
      patient with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance of the Digital PCR technique will be determined first in plasma issued from&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the initiation of aromatase inhibitors treatment patient with metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      will be included in the study. During their follow-up visit every 3 months), their status&#xD;
      towards their disease will be collected and a plasma will be collected too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient progress clinically or radiologically the plasma concomitant to this&#xD;
      progression will be analysed by Digital PCR to detect ESR1 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed during 2 years.&#xD;
