    <textblock>
      At present, widespread use of the human milk-based caloric supplement (cream) has not&#xD;
      occurred, particularly in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and further data are&#xD;
      needed to support its adoption as a standard care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that infants who receive an exclusive human milk (HM)-based&#xD;
      diet with the addition of a HM-derived cream caloric supplement (Cream group) will have a&#xD;
      shorter length of initial hospital stay compared to infants receiving the standard regimen of&#xD;
      an exclusive HM-based diet (Control group). The investigators hypothesize that the effects of&#xD;
      the cream caloric supplement will be greater in the subgroup of infants who develop BPD so&#xD;
      the relationship will be evaluated between Cream Supplement study group and postmenstrual age&#xD;
      (PMA) at discharge and the incidence of BPD. Investigators will also evaluate the&#xD;
      post-hospital discharge growth, body composition, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 to 24&#xD;
      months CGA of the infants 500-1250 grams BW who received an exclusive human milk diet&#xD;
      including cream supplement or control in the NICU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of the study is that infants who receive an exclusive HM-based diet&#xD;
      with the addition of a HM-derived cream caloric (Cream group) will have a shorter length of&#xD;
      initial hospital stay compared to infants receiving the standard regimen of an exclusive&#xD;
      HM-based diet (Control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized controlled trial in preterm infants (birth weight 500-1250g)&#xD;
      comparing the use of a human milk cream supplement added to an exclusive HM-based diet (Cream&#xD;
      group) to an exclusive HM-based diet without the use of a cream supplement (Control group).&#xD;
      Each study group will use mother's own milk, donor HM if needed (donor HM should be obtained&#xD;
      from a Human Milk Banking Association of North America (HMBANA) or Prolacta milk bank that&#xD;
      uses Holder method pasteurization and does not homogenize the milk) and a donor human&#xD;
      milk-derived fortifier (Prolact+ H2MF®) according to the study feeding protocol. Feeding will&#xD;
      be done by protocol in which fortification will begin when the baby is receiving 60 mL/kg/day&#xD;
      of enteral nutrition. The randomization will be performed in blocks (block size to remain&#xD;
      blinded) without the use of stratification variables except for study site. While blinding of&#xD;
      study groups is always desirable in randomized studies, because of the nature of the&#xD;
      interventions and the varying methods by which the nutrition is prepared and delivered in&#xD;
      different units, this will not be possible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of infants to be included in this study is based on the primary endpoint of a&#xD;
      reduction in the length of hospital stay in days by 12.1 days with a standard deviation of 31&#xD;
      days. With a two-tailed 5% significance level and 80% power, a sample size of 210 (n=105 per&#xD;
      group) is needed to demonstrate a difference of this magnitude between the 2 study groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study infants will be followed until discharge or transfer from the medical institution&#xD;
      or death (hospital stay is an expected average of 10 weeks). Infants will be transitioned&#xD;
      completely off an exclusive HM-based diet no earlier than 34 weeks PMA, however, infants will&#xD;
      be followed until hospital discharge (total of an estimated average of 10 weeks) to collect&#xD;
      anthropometric and study outcome data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study subject must meet all of the indicated inclusion criteria and none of the&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligibility of the infant is determined and informed consent is obtained from the&#xD;
      parent or legal guardian, infants will be randomized using a stratified (by study site) block&#xD;
      scheme noted above into either the group that will receive human milk cream (Cream&#xD;
      Supplement) or not (Control). All study infants will follow the study feeding protocol. The&#xD;
      use of fortifier, both the timing of initiation and advancing of feeds will be per study&#xD;
      protocol as tolerated. Study infants are to receive only an exclusive HM-based diet and they&#xD;
      are not to deviate from the protocol (receiving formula, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil,&#xD;
      liquid protein supplement, bovine fortifier, etc). Once breast milk (either mother's or&#xD;
      donor) fortification is initiated and infants reach feeds of at least 100 mL/kg/day, for&#xD;
      infants randomized to the cream group, they will start receiving the cream supplement per&#xD;
      protocol. HM cream supplement will be added to feeds to provide an additional 2 kcal/oz of&#xD;
      energy (amount of cream to add equals amount of unfortified milk x 0.04 rounded to the&#xD;
      nearest full mL). For example, 4 mL of cream would be added to 96 mL of unfortified milk and&#xD;
      then the fortifier is added to the milk-cream mixture. The Control group will not receive&#xD;
      cream and will be fed per Table 1. Infants will be followed and studied until discharge,&#xD;
      transfer to a non-study institution, removal from the study or death. Starting no sooner than&#xD;
      34 weeks PMA, infants will be transitioned over 5 days to either mother's milk with bovine&#xD;
      fortifier or transitional formula according to investigative site's standard of care. All&#xD;
      infants will have a brain MRI at &quot;term equivalent&quot; age (if this is routine practice at the&#xD;
      study site). Infants will also have body composition determined by dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA) scan (if available at the study site). One outpatient study visit will&#xD;
      occur at 18 to 24 months post discharge to obtain anthropometric data, interim medical&#xD;
      history, demographic and socioeconomic information, and nutrition history of the child since&#xD;
      discharge (formula, human milk, vitamins, and medications). A neurodevelopmental evaluation&#xD;
      (The Bayley Scales of Infant Development III) will also be performed by a certified tester&#xD;
      during this visit. In addition, data from NICU hospitalizations will be collected during this&#xD;
      visit. Data collection will include: demographics (gestational age, birth weight, gender, and&#xD;
      race), APGAR scores, nutrition and feeding related issues (parental nutrition and&#xD;
      constituents, feeding regimen, feeding intolerance), growth parameters (weight, length, and&#xD;
      head circumference), medications (caffeine, furosemide, chlorothiazide, hydrocortisone,&#xD;
      dexamethasone, insulin, and dopamine), nutrition related labs, and morbidities&#xD;
      (intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosus, necrotizing enterocolitis,&#xD;
      spontaneous intestinal perforation, episodes of sepsis, chronic lung disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each study site, designated study personnel (preferably no more than 3 consistent trained&#xD;
      personnel), will be responsible for weekly anthropometric measurements. The personnel will be&#xD;
      trained or will demonstrate proficiency in obtaining anthropometric measurements using proper&#xD;
      equipment. They will take weekly weights, lengths using only a study length board to be&#xD;
      provided, and head circumference measurements. Each measurement will be taken twice and the&#xD;
      average of the two will be recorded (for the weekly measurement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human Milk Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three times a week (on 3 separate days), samples of the human milk (either mother's own or&#xD;
      donor) per study infant will be obtained (4 mL in a syringe) and will be stored for future&#xD;
      macronutrient analysis after study completion. The samples should be stored at -20 degrees C.&#xD;
      The sample should be from a batch of unfortified human milk and should represent the milk to&#xD;
      be used to prepare 24 hours of feedings. Stored samples will be sent to the coordinating&#xD;
      study center for post-study analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiome Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all enrolled infants, tracheal aspirates (if intubated in the first 24 hours of life) and&#xD;
      stool for post-study evaluation of infants' airway and gastrointestinal microbiome will be&#xD;
      collected as feasible. A recent study by Lohmann et al showed that reduced diversity of the&#xD;
      microbiome may be an important factor in the development of BPD. In addition, studies have&#xD;
      shown that human milk positively affects the microbiome of premature infants. Tracheal&#xD;
      aspirates will be obtained per study protocol if infants are intubated at birth to 24 hours&#xD;
      of age, 48-72 hours of age, 7 days of age, and 28 days of age or at time of extubation if&#xD;
      sooner. Any tracheal aspirate obtained within this time frame is acceptable (samples are of&#xD;
      convenience with routine suctioning and care). Stool samples will be obtained per study&#xD;
      protocol at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks of life. The infants' first stool (meconium)&#xD;
      should be obtained. Samples will be collected and frozen at -80 degrees C and will be sent to&#xD;
      the coordinating study center for post-study microbiome analysis.&#xD;
