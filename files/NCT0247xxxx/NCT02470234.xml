    <textblock>
      To assess the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of Aptensio XR® (methylphenidate&#xD;
      hydrochloride extended-release) capsules under fed conditions in male or female children 4 to&#xD;
      under 6 years of age with ADHD.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a multi-center, open-label, single-dose, study to assess the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      Aptensio XR® (methylphenidate hydrochloride extended-release) capsules in male and female&#xD;
      children 4 to under 6 years of age with ADHD in fed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures: After obtaining written informed consent from parents, subjects will&#xD;
      undergo a complete medical and medication history, demographic data (including sex, age,&#xD;
      race, ethnicity, body weight (kg), height (cm), Body Mass Index (BMI) (kg/m2), physical&#xD;
      examination, vital signs evaluation (sitting blood pressure, pulse rate, respiration rate,&#xD;
      temperature and pulse oximetry), resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory&#xD;
      tests and concomitant medication within 28 days prior to receiving study drug. On Day 1:&#xD;
      subjects will receive a single oral dose of Aptensio XR®.&#xD;
