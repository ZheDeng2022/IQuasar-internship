      The purpose of the study is to investigate the process of symptom change in Cognitive&#xD;
      Behavioural Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP), and how the individual components of&#xD;
      the therapy affect this change in individuals with chronic depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A form of psychotherapy called Behaviour Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) has been&#xD;
      developed specifically to treat individuals suffering from chronic, long-standing depression.&#xD;
      There is a growing evidence base to suggest that CBASP is effective for these individuals,&#xD;
      especially when combined with anti-depressant medication. This evidence comes from case&#xD;
      series and randomised controlled trials that have compared CBASP with other forms of therapy&#xD;
      such as Interpersonal Psychotherapy and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, and with medication. The&#xD;
      evidence from these studies consistently shows CBASP to be effective, and it compares&#xD;
      favourably with other forms of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given these findings, it is important to understand how change happens in CBASP and how it is&#xD;
      affected by the components of the therapy. Understanding how individuals experience change&#xD;
      within CBASP will have important implications for how the therapy is delivered in the future.&#xD;
      For example if change is found to be non-linear it would be important to understand what&#xD;
      components of the therapy are associated with improvement. There could also be organisational&#xD;
      implications, for example relating to the optimal number of sessions to offer in order to&#xD;
      achieve acceptable change while balancing therapist time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims to investigate the process of psychological change in CBASP. This&#xD;
      will be done by providing CBASP to a small number of individuals and gathering outcome data&#xD;
      (rating of mood) at every therapy appointment. Session--by-session change will then be mapped&#xD;
      for each participant. The study will include two arms: CBASP; and CBASP without Disciplined&#xD;
      Personal Involvement (DPI). DPI involves specifically using the therapist--client&#xD;
      relationship to help the client to discriminate between previous maladaptive relationships&#xD;
      and other, positive ones. The reason for including this condition is to investigate whether&#xD;
      DPI affects the process of psychological change in CBASP, as it is a unique feature of the&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a single-case design, as the aim is to map change within each individual&#xD;
      participant in the context of the therapy. This design was deemed appropriate as the study&#xD;
      does not aim to make claims about the overall effectiveness of CBASP, but to provide an&#xD;
      analysis of individual psychological change for participants receiving CBASP.&#xD;
