      The purpose of this study is to give children with gastroenteritis with persistent vomiting&#xD;
      flavored intravenous ondansetron orally. The investigators test the palatability of the drug&#xD;
      and check the serum level of ondansetron at 4 hours .&#xD;

      This is a prospective pilot study for children,3-8 years of age presented to the Pediatric&#xD;
      Emergency Department in the state of Qatar between September 2014 and January 2015, with&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis with mild to moderate dehydration, more than 2 episodes of vomiting in&#xD;
      the last 24 hours, and who had failed oral rehydration trial in the department as per the&#xD;
      department oral hydration protocol. Acute gastroenteritis was defined as diarrhea and&#xD;
      vomiting for less than a week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hydration level was assessed for all patients on arrival, and eligible patients were enrolled&#xD;
      after obtaining an informed written consent.Enrolled patients received intravenous&#xD;
      ondansetron form orally after being flavored 1:1 with ORA-sweet, the dose of ondansetron was&#xD;
      determined based on the patient presenting weight. Palatability was evaluated by the primary&#xD;
      investigator within one minute fom drug administration applying taste scores for children and&#xD;
      recorded according to a specific scoring system. All patients were kept nil per oral for 30&#xD;
      minutes and then oral rehydration trial was started as per the department rehydration&#xD;
      protocol. If the drug was vomited within 30 min of administration, a similar second dose was&#xD;
      given. Blood level for ondansetron was collected 4 hours after the successful drug&#xD;
      administration and was sent to the department laboratory within 5 min. Patients were sent&#xD;
      home when they were ready for discharge as per the treating physician discretion. All&#xD;
      patients were followed by a telephone call after 24 hours to assess the safety and efficacy&#xD;
      of the orally taken ondansetron.&#xD;
