  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with locally advanced stage III non-small cell lung cancer, the probability of&#xD;
      local control remains low (about 17% at 1 year). Concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the&#xD;
      standard treatment. An increase in total radiotherapy dose (from 66 to 74 Gray) has been&#xD;
      proposed to improve local control, with contradictory results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant FDG-PET scan images can be acquired during radio-chemotherapy, with a demonstrated&#xD;
      prognostic impact and recently in a multicentre prospective study. A significant reduction in&#xD;
      FDG uptake / volume (metabolic response) suggests that the radiotherapy target volume could&#xD;
      be reduced during radiotherapy possibly improving organs at risk tolerance. Conversely, a&#xD;
      lack of metabolic response may justify treatment intensification before the end of&#xD;
      radiotherapy. The investigators hypothesis is to investigate the individual tumour&#xD;
      heterogeneity on FDG-PET during radio-chemotherapy to reduce the volume to a biological&#xD;
      target that could receive a higher total dose (personalized dose redistribution).&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators objective is to determine whether tumour radiotherapy dose escalated up to&#xD;
      74 Gy in 6.6 weeks can improve the disease Local Regional Control rate at 15 months (1 year&#xD;
      after completion of RCT) by adapting radiotherapy target volume to the metabolic response as&#xD;
      assessed on FDG-PET/CT performed at 42 Gy of concomitant radio-chemotherapy in stage III&#xD;
      non-small cells lung cancer and warrant more extensive phase III study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be allocated to one of 2 treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm A: Patients in the experimental arm will receive an individualized radiotherapy&#xD;
           prescription up to a total dose of 74 Gy given in 6.6 weeks if they have a positive&#xD;
           FDG-PET at 42Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm B: Patients in the standard arm will receive a single prescription of 66 Gy in 33&#xD;
           fractions in 6.6 weeks, with 2 Gy fractions given once daily, 5 days a week, without&#xD;
           target volume reduction or adaptation (whatever the FDG-PET result).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, all patients will undergo 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy (based platinum&#xD;
      salts) and a curative radio-chemotherapy. In both arms all fields must be treated daily.&#xD;
