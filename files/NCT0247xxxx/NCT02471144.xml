  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled (etanercept&#xD;
      in single blinded arm) study in pediatric subjects aged 6 years to less than 18 years with&#xD;
      severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Approximately 160 subjects aged 6 years to &lt;18 years were&#xD;
      enrolled, of which at least 30 were 6 years to &lt;12 years old. Subjects were enrolled at&#xD;
      approximately 70 study sites worldwide.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to demonstrate superior efficacy of secukinumab versus placebo&#xD;
      at Week 12, based on both PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response rates in children and&#xD;
      adolescents aged 6 to less than 18 years with severe chronic plaque psoriasis who had&#xD;
      inadequate control of symptoms with topical treatment, or failed to respond to or tolerate&#xD;
      previous systemic treatment and/or UV therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study assessed the long term safety and tolerability of secukinumab in this pediatric age&#xD;
      group and described the efficacy and safety of secukinumab compared to etanercept. This study&#xD;
      provided efficacy and safety data to support the extension of label of secukinumab to include&#xD;
      children and adolescents (6 years to &lt;18 years) with severe chronic plaque psoriasis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two age subgroups were studied in a staggered approach within this clinical study: 12 to less&#xD;
      than 18 years of age, and 6 to less than 12 years of age . Enrolment of children aged 6 to&#xD;
      less than 12 years began after a favorable recommendation by an independent external Data&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee (DMC) who reviewed data of approximately 80 adolescents. Adolescents&#xD;
      continued to be recruited while the data from the first 80 subjects was being collected and&#xD;
      analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects were randomized using a 1:1:1:1 ratio into one of the treatment arms: secukinumab&#xD;
      low dose, secukinumab high dose, etanercept or placebo. Subjects randomized to secukinumab&#xD;
      treatment arms (high dose and low dose) received dose based on the weight category (&lt;25 kg,&#xD;
      25 to &lt;50kg, ≥50 kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consisted of 5 periods: screening (up to 4 weeks), induction (of 12 weeks),&#xD;
      maintenance (of 40 weeks), extension treatment epoch (open-label of 184 weeks) and post-&#xD;
      treatment follow-up epoch (of 16 weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectiove of the study was to demonstrate the superiority of secukinumab (low&#xD;
      and high dose) in pediatric subjects with severe chronic plaque psoriasis with respect to&#xD;
      both PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (co-primary endpoints) at Week 12, compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <description>The CDLQI measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological disorders who are less than 18 years of age and it has been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The CDLQI is a simple, validated, self-administered 10-item questionnaire. The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., symptoms and feeling, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep and treatment). The questions are based on the preceding week to permit accurate recall. For the CDLQI, each question will be answered on a 4-point Likert scale scored from 0 to 3. Seven scores will be derived from the CDLQI: the total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI):Combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72(maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, Erythema,Thickening (plaque elevation, induration) &amp; Scaling(desquamation). Scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section(head: 0.1, upper limbs: 0.2 trunk: 0.3 lower limbs: 0.4). Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) will be assessed/calculated as per standard procedure. PASI 75 represents the percentage (or number) of patients who have achieved a 75% or more reduction in their PASI score from baseline.</description>

        <description>Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI):Combined assessment of lesion severity and affected area into a single score: 0 (no disease) to 72(maximal disease). Body is divided into 4 areas for scoring (head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs); each area is scored by itself and scores are combined for final PASI. For each area, percent of skin involved is estimated: 0 (0%) to 6 (90-100%), and severity is estimated by clinical signs, Erythema,Thickening (plaque elevation, induration) &amp; Scaling(desquamation). Scale 0 (none) to 4 (maximum). Final PASI = sum of severity parameters for each area* area score weight of section(head: 0.1, upper limbs: 0.2 trunk: 0.3 lower limbs: 0.4). Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) will be assessed/calculated as per standard procedure. PASI 75 represents the percentage (or number)of patients who have achieved a 75% or more reduction in their PASI score from baseline. PASI 100 indicates patients who have achieved a complete resolution of all disease.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (cDLQI) Score Up to Week 12 (Induction)</title>
        <description>The CDLQI measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological disorders who are less than 18 years of age and it has been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The CDLQI is a simple, validated, self-administered 10-item questionnaire. The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., symptoms and feeling, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep and treatment). The questions are based on the preceding week to permit accurate recall. For the CDLQI, each question will be answered on a 4-point Likert scale scored from 0 to 3. Seven scores will be derived from the CDLQI: the total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <title>Percentage Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (cDLQI) Score Up to Week 52 (Maintenance)</title>
        <description>The CDLQI measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological disorders who are less than 18 years of age and it has been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The CDLQI is a simple, validated, self-administered 10-item questionnaire. The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., symptoms and feeling, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep and treatment). The questions are based on the preceding week to permit accurate recall. For the CDLQI, each question will be answered on a 4-point Likert scale scored from 0 to 3. Seven scores will be derived from the CDLQI: the total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants Achieving a Children's DLQI Score of 0 or 1 Over Time up to Week 52 (Maintenance)</title>
        <description>The CDLQI measures functional disability of subjects with dermatological disorders who are less than 18 years of age and it has been utilized as a relevant clinical measure in atopic dermatitis, as well as other dermatitis clinical trials. The CDLQI is a simple, validated, self-administered 10-item questionnaire. The instrument contains six functional scales (i.e., symptoms and feeling, leisure, school or holidays, personal relationships, sleep and treatment). The questions are based on the preceding week to permit accurate recall. For the CDLQI, each question will be answered on a 4-point Likert scale scored from 0 to 3. Seven scores will be derived from the CDLQI: the total score of each of the six dimensions as well as the total score over all items. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were analyzed according to the treatment assigned at randomization. If the actual stratum was different to the assigned stratum in Interactive Response Technology (IRT), the actual stratum was used in analyses. Patients excluded from the randomized set were excluded from the FAS.</population>

        <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With Clinically Important Reduction in Disability as Evaluated by CHAQ Questionnaire Over Time at Week 12</title>
        <description>The CHAQ questionnaire is only done for children who in addition to psoriasis are also suffering from psoriatic arthirtis. The questionnaire is completed by parent or legal quardian. It consists of multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and other &quot;activities&quot;. The person completing the questionnaire chooses from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' to 'unable to do'. Additionally two visual analog scales (overall well-being and pain of patient) must be performed.</description>
        <time_frame>Week 12</time_frame>
        <population>No summary statistics were derived for CHAQ, due to the low number of subjects (11) who completed the CHAQ questionnaire: 4 from secukinumab low dose group, 3 from etanercept group, 2 from placebo - secukinumab high dose group and 1 each from secukinumab high dose group and placebo - secukinumab low dose group.

          <title>Number and Percentage of Participants With Clinically Important Reduction in Disability as Evaluated by CHAQ Questionnaire Over Time at Week 52</title>
          <description>The CHAQ questionnaire is only done for children who in addition to psoriasis are also suffering from psoriatic arthirtis. The questionnaire is completed by parent or legal quardian. It consists of multiple choice items concerning difficulty in performing eight common activities of daily living; dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, reaching, personal hygiene, gripping and other &quot;activities&quot;. The person completing the questionnaire chooses from four response categories, ranging from 'without any difficulty' to 'unable to do'. Additionally two visual analog scales (overall well-being and pain of patient) must be performed.</description>
          <population>No summary statistics were derived for CHAQ, due to the low number of subjects (11) who completed the CHAQ questionnaire: 4 secukinumab low dose, 1 secukinumab high dose, 3 Etanercept, who were evaluable at Week 52 Visit. 5 patients achieved CHAQ response (2 from etanercept group, 2 from secukinumab low dose group and 1 from placebo - secukinumab low dose)</population>
