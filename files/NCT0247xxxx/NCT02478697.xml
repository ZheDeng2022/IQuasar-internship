    <textblock>
      Previous findings indicate elevated risk for tobacco use among adults in California who are&#xD;
      unemployed and seeking work. In a pilot study, tobacco use was associated with a longer&#xD;
      duration of time out of work. This community-based participatory research study aims to&#xD;
      deliver and evaluate the impact of a web-based job seeker tailored tobacco cessation&#xD;
      intervention vs. a control group in the San Francisco Bay Area. This research investigates&#xD;
      whether an employment-centered tobacco treatment intervention is efficacious in supporting&#xD;
      abstinence and also associated with more timely engagement of employment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PLEASE NOTE: The grant for this project was approved under the title &quot;Tobacco Treatment for&#xD;
      Employable Californians,&quot; abbreviated &quot;TTEC.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, as this study is being run under the principles of community- based participatory&#xD;
      research, the Stanford team provided the community advisors and representatives of the&#xD;
      recruitment sites the opportunity to create a name they felt better conveyed the interests&#xD;
      and goals of the study to potential participants. As such, the term Total IMPACT Study is&#xD;
      used on all participant-facing materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Prochaska will oversee study procedures for participant recruitment, informed consent,&#xD;
      data collection, analysis, and dissemination. IRB approved study flyers and e-communications&#xD;
      will promote the study with a central study contact phone number and email address held by&#xD;
      the study coordinator. The study will follow the Dillman method for electronic communications&#xD;
      inviting and encouraging potential respondents to participate. For systematic data collection&#xD;
      and storage, all assessments will be conducted using Qualtrics or RedCap for online data&#xD;
      collection with data encryption for added security protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Face-to-face informed consenting procedures occur onsite at the employment agencies. Some&#xD;
      participants may call in and get preliminarily screened for eligibility over the phone, but&#xD;
      will be directed to meet with on-site staff to begin the consent process. Hired and trained&#xD;
      field research study staff will be recent job-seeking clients from the agencies who will&#xD;
      complete the informed consenting procedures with participants, obtain collateral contact&#xD;
      information for follow-up contacts, and provide participants with a study ID code and the&#xD;
      website URL for completing the online survey. The collateral contact information will be used&#xD;
      if research staff cannot reach the participant directly. Study staff may ask collateral&#xD;
      contacts for updated contact information as well as updated smoking and/or employment status&#xD;
      (e.g., &quot;Has [name] been smoking recently?&quot; &quot;Do you know if [name] is currently working?)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study eligibility will be defined as unemployed and job seeking at a participating America's&#xD;
      Job Centers of California (AJCC) organization and currently smoking 1 or more cigarettes&#xD;
      daily and at least 100+ cigarettes in one's lifetime with a carbon monoxide (CO) breath&#xD;
      sample of 10 ppm or greater. The CO sample will be taken prior to consenting potential&#xD;
      participants. Participants must be 18 years or older, English literate, able to provide at&#xD;
      least three collateral sources of contact for follow-up assessments, and not immediately&#xD;
      planning to relocate out of California (though researchers would continue to follow-up with&#xD;
      participants who move out of area, and the research team has demonstrated success with doing&#xD;
      so in prior studies). Dual use of e-cigarettes will not be an exclusion criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant meets all eligibility criteria, the baseline assessment will be completed&#xD;
      on-site at the employment agency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A computer-generated stratified random assignment program will randomize individuals based on&#xD;
      their recruitment location, heaviness of smoking (&gt; 1 pack/week), and stage of change, the&#xD;
      last two variables known to be related to outcomes and addressed by the intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will be given study materials appropriate to their assigned study condition&#xD;
      directly after completing the baseline survey on-site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The online surveys will not collect any personal identifying information. Assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted at baseline and 3- and 6-months follow-up. The surveys will take about 40 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. If participants cannot come in person to do the survey, research staff will send&#xD;
      them the URL link, complete it over the phone, or send a modified version in the mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of data collection, participants will be asked to provide a resume or curriculum&#xD;
      vitae at the baseline interview, either as a hard copy or by email, which will be&#xD;
      de-identified (participant name and address removed). The resumes will not be shared with&#xD;
      staff of the employment service facilities. In a more detailed manner than captured by the&#xD;
      self-report online survey, the resumes will provide useful information on prior employment (#&#xD;
      of jobs, industry, positions held, length of employment) and education as well as an&#xD;
      indication of participant communication/organization skills in self-presentation of&#xD;
      employment strengths. Participants will have the option to opt out of providing the resume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two study conditions are: Tobacco Intervention (n=180) and Usual Care Control group&#xD;
      (n=180).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tobacco treatment includes: (a) a Transtheoretical-model (TTM) tailored,&#xD;
      computer-assisted web-delivered program focused on increasing intrinsic motivation, (b) a&#xD;
      stage-tailored treatment manual with goal setting for quitting tobacco, and (c) education on&#xD;
      proper use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT, patch plus gum or lozenge) with guidance on&#xD;
      obtaining low-cost or free NRT through MediCal, private insurance plans, and community&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer program assesses stage of change and TTM constructs of temptations, decisional&#xD;
      balance, and processes of change. Repeat intervention contacts occur at baseline, 3- and&#xD;
      6-months follow-up, providing iterative computerized feedback reflecting prior responses with&#xD;
      encouragement for quitting smoking and relapse prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care: Participants complete the study assessments at baseline, 3- and 6-months and will&#xD;
      receive referrals to tobacco treatment in the community, including the state quitline, in&#xD;
      line with the public health &quot;Ask, Advise, Refer&quot; model of tobacco cessation intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Tobacco Outcome: At baseline and follow-ups, past 7-day use of conventional&#xD;
      cigarettes, alternative tobacco (smokeless, snus), and electronic nicotine devices (ENDS,&#xD;
      e.g., e-cigarettes) with details on cigarettes/day, frequency, brand, flavor, strength, and&#xD;
      quit attempts are assessed. For biochemical verification, participants reporting 7-day PPA at&#xD;
      follow-up will have an expired CO sample evaluated using a Bedfont Smokerlyzer. Participants&#xD;
      with CO &lt; 8 ppm indicating nonsmoking will provide a saliva sample for testing with of&#xD;
      cotinine with an Accutest® NicAlertTM test strip at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Salivary&#xD;
      cotinine levels &lt; 15 ng/ml will confirm nonsmoking. Additionally, participants reporting&#xD;
      being quit will be asked to provide a urine sample to test for the presence of anabasine (if&#xD;
      they have quit smoking but are still using nicotine replacement or another nicotine&#xD;
      containing product). Anabasine is an alternative indicator of tobacco exposure that is&#xD;
      separate from nicotine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants lost to follow-up or unable to return for biochemical verification, a saliva&#xD;
      cotinine test will be mailed, along with a prepaid envelope to return their results to study&#xD;
      staff in.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Tobacco Outcomes: 3-mo prolonged abstinence from the 3- to 6-mo assessment,&#xD;
      applying NHLBI's definition of relapse (i.e., smoking on 7 consecutive days or smoking at&#xD;
      least once each week over 2 consecutive weeks);42 reduction in cigarettes per week; and given&#xD;
      the uncertainty in the field with respect to how to treat ENDS, will examine the proportion&#xD;
      of the sample abstinent from conventional cigarettes and all tobacco, allowing for ENDS use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observational Personal Professional Presence (P3) checklist scale is currently being&#xD;
      pilot tested, and evaluation in relation to measured CO levels will be analyzed as an&#xD;
      indicator of treatment compliance and used as an instrumental variable in tobacco outcome&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employment Outcomes: The primary employment outcome of interest is how quickly participants&#xD;
      find employment, measured in weeks. Time out of work is assessed at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary employment outcomes of interest are: employment status at each follow-up and&#xD;
      employment secured at any point in time during the study assessed at 3- and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. Additional details are obtained on type of position, pay/salary, fit between the&#xD;
      secured and desired position, and changes in employment over time. The number of on-phone and&#xD;
      in-person interviews also are recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Measures. To describe the sample researchers will measure participant gender;&#xD;
      age; ethnicity/race; education (years); income; subjective social standing in one's&#xD;
      self-defined community and in the broader US; stability of housing; height/weight (BMI);&#xD;
      employment history, including days since last regular employment; job search strategies;&#xD;
      criminal history; home smoking rules; exposure to secondhand smoke; years of smoking;&#xD;
      Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence; Stage of Change categorized as precontemplation,&#xD;
      contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance; and Thoughts about Abstinence assessing&#xD;
      desire, expectancy of success, anticipated difficulty, and abstinence goal. Assessments of&#xD;
      co-occurring substance use and abuse include ASI items 30 day substance use, AUDIT, and DAST.&#xD;
      The staging health risk assessment assesses additional health risks and future behavioral&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, a social network stem question where participants are asked to identify up to 10&#xD;
      individuals (alters) in their social network who currently support them in their job search,&#xD;
      indicating the strength of the connection, the frequency of contact, and the individuals' job&#xD;
      and smoking status. Additional questions about the type of employment (field of employment&#xD;
      and position within company) each alter has will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process Measures. At baseline and each follow-up use of in-study and out-of-study cessation&#xD;
      methods including dose, duration, and formulation of NRT, varenicline, bupropion, written&#xD;
      materials, provider advice and counseling, quitlines, and other community cessation programs&#xD;
      will be assessed. Assessment of study treatment acceptability will be completed by&#xD;
      participants in both conditions with 5-items tapping relevance, usefulness, feasibility,&#xD;
      level of engagement, perceived fit measured on 5-point Likert scales.&#xD;
