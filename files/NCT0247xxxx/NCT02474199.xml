      This research study is for liver transplant recipients and their respective living donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To see if it is safe for liver recipients to receive one dose of donor reactive T&#xD;
           regulatory cells (Tregs)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To see if the Tregs allows a liver recipient to take less, or completely stop&#xD;
           medications normally taken after receiving an organ transplant.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Doctors give drugs called immunosuppressants (IS) to people who receive a liver transplant.&#xD;
      IS must be taken every day to prevent the body from injuring the transplanted liver by a&#xD;
      process called rejection. Liver transplant recipients usually have to take these drugs for&#xD;
      the rest of their lives. These drugs have harmful side effects. Researchers are looking for&#xD;
      ways to keep a transplanted liver working normally with as little IS medications as possible.&#xD;
      Finding a way to lower and then stop these medications will allow the liver recipient to&#xD;
      avoid unwanted side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another area of research looks at how blood cells work to reject or accept an organ&#xD;
      transplant. Studies show that some of the recipient's own cells, called T regulatory cells&#xD;
      (Tregs), may play a part in accepting the transplanted liver and preventing rejection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recipient's Tregs can be grown in the laboratory to increase their number. Exposing the&#xD;
      recipient's Tregs to the liver donor's cells will stimulate the Tregs that recognize the&#xD;
      liver donor to grow vigorously. Giving these &quot;donor reactive&quot; Tregs back to the transplant&#xD;
      recipient through a vein (intravenously) might allow a liver transplant recipient to take&#xD;
      lower doses of IS, or perhaps to stop them altogether, without rejecting the liver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study team will collect information about the Treg infusion, liver tests and drug doses&#xD;
      during IS withdrawal, and any problems that may arise in the study. Blood, liver tissue, and&#xD;
      buccal (cheek) cells will be collected for research tests.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants Who Experience at Least One Episode of Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection, Clinical Acute Rejection, or Chronic Rejection</measure>
    <time_frame>From initiation of immunosuppression withdrawal to 52 weeks after darTreg infusion</time_frame>
    <description>A participant was considered to have met this endpoint if they experienced at least one episode of biopsy proven acute rejection, clinical acute rejection, or chronic rejection based on local pathology.&#xD;
Biopsy proven acute rejection was assessed as Grade I or higher based on the Banff (1997) global criteria featuring the following grades:&#xD;
Indeterminate&#xD;
Grade I Mild Acute Rejection&#xD;
Grade II Moderate Acute Rejection&#xD;
Grade III Severe Acute Rejection.&#xD;
Clinical AR was determined based on the participant receiving treatment for rejection with or without biopsy confirmation of rejection.&#xD;
Chronic rejection was determined by the presence of abnormal total and direct bilirubin in the conjunction with liver pathology fulfilling the Banff (2000) criteria as outlined:&#xD;
Early Stage Chronic Rejection&#xD;
Late Stage Chronic Rejection.</description>

          <title>Count of Participants by Severity of Biopsy Proven Acute Rejection and/or Chronic Rejection</title>
          <description>Participants are counted in each grade of rejection they experienced; however, a participant is only counted once within a specific grade. Biopsy proven acute rejection and Chronic rejection were graded based on local pathology according to the Banff (1997 for Acute Rejection; 2000 for Chronic Rejection) global assessment criteria as outlined below.&#xD;
Biopsy proven acute rejection was assessed as Grade I or higher using the following grades:&#xD;
Indeterminate&#xD;
Grade I Mild Acute Rejection&#xD;
Grade II Moderate Acute Rejection&#xD;
Grade III Severe Acute Rejection.&#xD;
Chronic rejection was determined by the presence of abnormal total and direct bilirubin in the conjunction with liver pathology fulfilling the Banff criteria as outlined:&#xD;
Early Stage Chronic Rejection&#xD;
Late Stage Chronic Rejection.</description>
          <population>All participants who initiated immunosuppression withdrawal. Since both groups initiated immunosuppression withdrawal, the participants who received darTregs were combined with the participants who did not receive the darTreg infusion to form the pre-defined group for assessment of this outcome.</population>
