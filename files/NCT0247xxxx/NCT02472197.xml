  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrauterine pathologies are currently treated by hysteroscopic resection. In this surgical&#xD;
      procedure, the intrauterine pathology is resected by a transcervical approach in several&#xD;
      fragments using a mono or bipolar cove after distension of the uterine cavity and by&#xD;
      endoscopic control. The main risks of this surgery are: uterine perforation and OHIA&#xD;
      (operative hysteroscopy intravascular absorption) syndrome. Hysteroscopic morcellators are&#xD;
      new intrauterine devices, recently appeared on the French market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In comparison to classical resectors, morcellators have several theoretical advantages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A smaller instrument diameter with potentially a lower risk of uterine perforation and&#xD;
           cervical laceration during the dilatation procedure,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The use of physiological serum, eliminating the risk of neurological toxicity of&#xD;
           glycine,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The risk of electrical accident is canceled (internal or external burns due to leakage&#xD;
           current),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A decreased risk of air embolism, due to the absence of bubbles' production,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The instrument is always under visual control, the perforation risk by the active&#xD;
           instrument is therefore very limited,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The vision is not obscured by the fragments or by the bubbles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treatment of pre-ostial pathologies, not always easy in classical resections, could&#xD;
           be facilitated,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the absence of thermal effect, and therefore a potentially lower endometrial aggression,&#xD;
           is interesting in women with reproductive desire,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Absence of chips management, limiting the entry and exit movements in the uterine&#xD;
           cavity, improving the vision, reducing the infectious and traumatic risks, specially&#xD;
           uterine perforation and air embolism,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Morcellation could preserve tissues for histological analysis of possible malignancy&#xD;
           (compared to techniques using heat, coagulation, vaporization),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Easy learning in comparison to the time-consuming learning of classical hysteroscopic&#xD;
           resection,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generated additional cost could be partly amortized by reducing operating time and&#xD;
           complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It seemed useful to study this new technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose was to compare the time of hysteroscopic treatment of uterine polyps&#xD;
      between a hysteroscopic morcellator the UNIDRIVE S III / DrillCut-X II-GYN-Shaver (Integrated&#xD;
      Bigatti Shaver IBS), StorzÂ®, and a conventional resectoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary purposes were to compare the efficiency, complications and comfort of these&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
