      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People with neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and plexiform neurofibroma (PN) tumors often&#xD;
      have chronic pain that his hard to control. People usually take medicines for the pain, but&#xD;
      they may not work well and might cause side effects. A new strategy called Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Training (ACT) may help these people cope with chronic pain. ACT focuses on things&#xD;
      like values and living in the moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To see if Acceptance and Commitment Training improves pain coping in people with NF1 pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People age 16 34 who have NF1, 1 or more PN tumors, and pain that interferes with their&#xD;
      daily functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam, medical history, and questions about&#xD;
           their pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will fill out questionnaires about their pain and feelings. Their heart&#xD;
           rate will be measured via ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be divided into 2 groups randomly. One will wait 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The other will start training right away.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 2 two-hour sessions with an ACT trainer. They will learn&#xD;
           techniques for setting goals based on personal values and other ways to cope with pain.&#xD;
           They will get a workbook and a CD to take home for practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will do practice exercises at home between sessions. They will get weekly&#xD;
           emails with a practice exercise. They will join video chat sessions via home computer&#xD;
           with their trainer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will return to NIH after 8 weeks for questionnaires and an ECG. The&#xD;
           wait group will then start training. They will return 8 weeks later for questionnaires&#xD;
           and an ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six months later, they will complete questionnaires from home by computer.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in&#xD;
           3,500 individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A number of common clinical manifestations, including plexiform neurofibromas, can cause&#xD;
           frequent and significant pain and impact quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Often, NF1-related pain is not well-controlled with medication and many of the&#xD;
           medications cause significant side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To our knowledge, only one prior study (by our group) has examined the effectiveness of&#xD;
           a psychological intervention for chronic pain in adolescents and young adults (AYA) with&#xD;
           NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), a newer generation of cognitive-behavioral&#xD;
           therapy, focuses on encouraging individuals to engage in more adaptive ways of coping&#xD;
           with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The goal of ACT is not to eliminate the person s pain, but to optimize the person s&#xD;
           functioning despite their pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To compare pain interference mean score changes from baseline to 8 weeks between the ACT&#xD;
      intervention group and the waitlist (WL) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ELIGIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients 16 - 59 years of age with a confirmed diagnosis of NF1 and greater than or&#xD;
           equal to 1 plexiform neurofibroma (PN).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient must obtain a mean score of 2.0 or higher or a score of 3 on three or more&#xD;
           items on the Pain Interference Index, and report having pain that interferes with&#xD;
           functioning for at least three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient must have regular access to a computer or tablet with internet access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a psychological intervention study to determine the potential benefit of ACT on&#xD;
           pain interference, with patients randomized to the ACT intervention or a wait-list&#xD;
           control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will come to the NIH for a 2-day visit (Time 1). After baseline assessments&#xD;
           (questionnaires and ECG) are completed, participants in the ACT group will take part in&#xD;
           two 2-hour ACT training sessions. At home, this group will receive weekly emails through&#xD;
           week 8, and will participate in further ACT training/educational sessions via video chat&#xD;
           at weeks 2, 4, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients will return to the NIH at week 8 (Time 2) to complete follow-up&#xD;
           questionnaires and ECG. At this time, the WL group will cross over and receive the ACT&#xD;
           intervention (in-person sessions, weekly emails, and video chat sessions). All patients&#xD;
           will complete questionnaires again from home six months following the completion of the&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To detect a change of .68 standard deviation on the primary outcome measure between the&#xD;
           two groups at .80 power, 41 patients per group are needed.&#xD;

               1. Patients must be between 16 and 59 years of age at the time of the baseline&#xD;
                  assessment. Because the research on the effectiveness of ACT with younger&#xD;
                  children is still emerging, children 15 and younger will be excluded from the&#xD;
                  present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Diagnosis of NF1 through germline mutation OR clinical diagnosis; for the&#xD;
                  clinical diagnosis of NF1 all study subjects must have two or more diagnostic&#xD;
                  criteria for NF1 listed below (NIH Consensus Conference):&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Six or more cafe-au-lait spots (greater than or equal to 0.5 cm in&#xD;
                       prepubertal subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in postpubertal&#xD;
                       subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Greater than or equal to 2 neurofibromas or 1 plexiform neurofibroma&#xD;

                       thinning of long bone cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  A first-degree relative with NF1&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Participants must have documentation of a PN, based on either clinical exam or&#xD;
                  imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Patient must self-report having chronic pain for at least the past 3 months that&#xD;
                  has interfered with their daily functioning, as assessed by the Pain Interference&#xD;
                  Index (must get a mean score of 2.0 or higher, or score a 3 on three or more&#xD;
                  individual items).&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Patients must have regular access to a computer or tablet with internet access.&#xD;

&#xD;
               8. Subjects must be able to read and comprehend the English language, since the&#xD;
                  highly trained ACT therapists are not fluent enough to conduct the trainings in&#xD;

             behavioral, specifically for pain management.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects who began a medical intervention for treatment of their disease that has a&#xD;
             possible impact on pain (including MEK trials) will not be eligible until after one&#xD;
             year on the medical treatment; at that time, eligibility will be discussed with the PI&#xD;
             of the medical study to assess the stability of the patient s pain and whether further&#xD;
             pain-related changes due to the medical treatment are likely.&#xD;
