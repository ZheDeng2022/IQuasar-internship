      INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is characterized by deficiencies&#xD;
      in blood cell production that can lead to anemia, which may necessitate regular transfusions&#xD;
      of red blood cells (RBCs) as supportive therapy. While this treatment can be life-saving,&#xD;
      since the body has no natural means of removing the excess iron introduced through the intake&#xD;
      of RBCs, a consequence can be accumulation of excess iron, including labile iron, in the&#xD;
      plasma (as labile plasma iron, LPI, the pathological form of non-transferrin-bound iron) and&#xD;
      in cells. The cellular labile iron pool (LIP) is known to participate in biochemical&#xD;
      reactions that generate free oxygen radicals, resulting in oxidative stress and cell and&#xD;
      tissue damage. A certain percentage of patients with MDS develop signs and symptoms resulting&#xD;
      from iron overload، and oxidative stress markers have been observed in the blood cells of&#xD;
      such patients. Progressive iron overload can lead to organ toxicity and cardiac disease.&#xD;
      Reduction of LIP would reduce the generation of tissue-damaging free oxygen radicals and&#xD;
      thereby help prevent morbidity and mortality; however, iron chelation therapy has not been&#xD;
      part of the standard of care for this population. It should be noted that While the LPI level&#xD;
      provide a momentarily &quot;snapshot&quot; of the iron status and it rapidly changes due to nutrition,&#xD;
      transfusion or chelation, the LIP represent long-term accumulation. Both parameters&#xD;
      complement each other in analogy to hemoglobin A1C and glucose measurements in patients with&#xD;
      Diabetes mellitus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been some exploration of the use of the oral iron chelators deferasirox and&#xD;
      deferiprone in MDS patients , with indications of efficacy as assessed by iron reduction,&#xD;
      decreased need for transfusions, or increased survival. However, it is difficult to draw&#xD;
      clear conclusions from the literature as there was high variability in these investigations,&#xD;
      not only in type of chelator but in study design, severity of disease, and endpoints studied.&#xD;
      The safety profiles reported in the literature for MDS patients are similar to those seen in&#xD;
      thalassemia patients. However, for patients at later stages of the disease who are at high&#xD;
      risk of death from AML or other causes within 5 years, the benefit of chelation may be&#xD;
      minimal. What emerges from the literature is that because of the progression of the disease,&#xD;
      iron chelation is likelier to be of more benefit to patients with a less severe form of MDS&#xD;
      who have an expectation of 5 years or more of survival but who also have the likelihood of&#xD;
      long-term RBC transfusion dependency, with the accompanying risk of iron overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2 Deferiprone Deferiprone (active ingredient 3-hydroxy-1,2-dimethylpyridin-4-one) is a&#xD;
      bidentate iron chelator that preferentially binds trivalent iron (Fe3+) in a 3:1 (deferiprone&#xD;
      : iron) complex. Its effectiveness in the treatment of patients with iron overload has been&#xD;
      assessed by urinary iron excretion, sequential measurements of serum ferritin levels, iron&#xD;
      concentration in the liver and in the heart, and clinical outcomes such as the ability to&#xD;
      prevent iron-induced cardiac disease and prolong survival in transfused patients with&#xD;
      thalassemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2.1 Side effects of Deferiprone The safety profile of deferiprone in patients with&#xD;
      thalassemia has been extensively characterized in clinical trials. Based on the Summary of&#xD;
      Product Characteristics,apart from chromaturia, which is due to iron excretion and is&#xD;
      harmless, the most commonly reported adverse events seen in clinical trials have been nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, abdominal pain, increased alanine aminotransferase, arthralgia, and neutropenia,&#xD;
      defined as a confirmed absolute neutrophil count (ANC) less than 1.5×109/L. The most&#xD;
      significant serious adverse event (SAE) associated with deferiprone use is severe&#xD;
      neutropenia, also known as agranulocytosis, which is defined as a confirmed ANC less than&#xD;
      0.5×109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical trial in which 19 multi-transfused MDS patients were treated with the oral iron&#xD;
      chelator deferasirox for 3 months, a significant decrease in free iron species was observed&#xD;
      in the plasma and cells, which was associated with amelioration of the parameters of&#xD;
      oxidative stress. Another finding was a gradual increase in the levels of the iron regulatory&#xD;
      hormone hepcidin, which could also reflect amelioration of oxidative stress. However, many&#xD;
      MDS patients, particularly older ones, are unable to tolerate treatment with deferasirox,&#xD;
      mainly due to renal and/or gastrointestinal side effects. The proposed clinical trial is a&#xD;
      similar study that will look at the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in iron overloaded,&#xD;
      blood dependent MDS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 STUDY DESIGN This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center study in 20 patients with MDS.&#xD;
      All participants will be treated with deferiprone for up to 4 months. Patients will have&#xD;
      blood counts monitored weekly, and will visit the site monthly for assessments of safety and&#xD;
      efficacy. The schedule of study procedures is shown and details are provided in Section 5.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The daily dosage of deferiprone for each patient will be up to a maximum dose of 100 mg/kg,&#xD;
      divided into 3 equal doses (t.i.d.) of 33.3 mg/kg. To minimize the gastrointestinal side&#xD;
      effects that some deferiprone recipients experience when starting treatment, the initial&#xD;
      dosage will be a total of 50 mg/kg/day (16.7 mg/kg t.i.d. For patients responding to&#xD;
      treatment, there will be an option to continue the study drug for one more year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 STUDY POPULATION 3.1 Number of Patients A total of 20 MDS patients 3.2 Treatment&#xD;
      Interruptions Patients should be advised to immediately report any symptoms indicative of&#xD;
      infection such as fever, sore throat, or flu-like symptoms. If a patient develops&#xD;
      neutropenia, fever, or any type of infection, Deferiprone must be interrupted immediately and&#xD;
      neutrophil count should be obtained and monitored more frequently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Concomitant medications In general, concomitant medications and therapies deemed&#xD;
      necessary for the supportive care and safety of the patient are allowed. The administration&#xD;
      of any anticancer agents including chemotherapy and biologic agents is permitted. The use of&#xD;
      other concurrent iron chelating agents or iron supplements or investigational drugs is not&#xD;
      allowed. The use of blood products transfusions or erythroid growth factor is permitted at&#xD;
      investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Study treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following events will be considered as reasons for discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intolerable adverse effects that are judged by the investigator to be detrimental to the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation in another investigational drug trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss to follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient withdrawal of consent 4 STUDY TREATMENTS Deferiprone is provided as 500 mg&#xD;
           film-coated scored tablets, taken orally 3 times a day. It can also be provided as an&#xD;
           oral solution of deferiprone 100mg/ml. The drug can be taken with or without food, as&#xD;
           per the investigator's recommendation.&#xD;

&#xD;
      5.1.1 Oxidative stress parameters Blood samples for the assessment of oxidative stress&#xD;
      parameters will be collected at baseline and at each monthly visit. Samples will be taken at&#xD;
      similar times for all patients, prior to first morning dose of Deferiprone. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be collected into 2 test tubes, 2cc in each tube. One test tube with heparin and sent in&#xD;
      the same day or the day after in a temperature of 40c to the laboratory of Prof. Fibach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oxidative status (as well as LIP) will be analyzed using flow cytometry techniques. Red blood&#xD;
      cells (RBCs) and platelets will be analyzed for all tests of oxidative stress, while&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear leucocytes will be analyzed only for ROS and Iron Overload Iron overload&#xD;
      will be evaluated by measuring serum ferritin, LIP, LPI, and serum hepcidin.&#xD;
