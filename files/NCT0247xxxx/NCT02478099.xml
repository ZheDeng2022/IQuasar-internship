  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have demonstrated that&#xD;
      therapies focused on enhancing T cell responses against cancer can result in a significant&#xD;
      survival benefit in patients with Stage IV cancer. PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that&#xD;
      downregulates immune responses primarily in peripheral tissues through binding to its two&#xD;
      receptors PD-1 and B7-1. Interruption of the PD L1/PD-1 pathway by the PD-L1 targeting&#xD;
      antibody MPDL3280A, represents an attractive strategy to reinvigorate tumor-specific T cell&#xD;
      immunity. For PD1/PD-L1 pathway inhibition PD-L1 tumor surface expression was proposed as a&#xD;
      potential biomarker. In early clinical trials, PD-L1 expression has been associated with&#xD;
      response to PD1/PD-L1 inhibition. However, other clinical trials reported response to&#xD;
      PD1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors in a big patient groups who were PD-L1-negative assessed by a&#xD;
      single biopsy. Another obstacle to using PD-L1 expression as predictive biomarker might be&#xD;
      its potential heterogeneous expression and fast dynamics PD-L1 tumor expression and whole&#xD;
      body distribution, as well as baseline activation status of the immune system are being&#xD;
      assessed in three investigational imaging trials MPDL3280A-img-042015, 89Zr-CD8 imaging or&#xD;
      IL2-img--UMCG-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be able to evaluate the investigational imaging - 89Zr-MPDL3280A-PET, 89Zr-CD8 imaging and&#xD;
      18F-FB-IL2-PET - as complementary tools for selection of patients to be treated with&#xD;
      MPDL3280A, within this treatment trial we will assess safety, tolerability and anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of MPDL3280A in cancer patients, who have undergone investigational imaging.&#xD;
      Acquired data could lead to improved, more patient friendly, more easily accessible and&#xD;
      possibly less expensive procedures for patient selection. Subsequently, the efficacy of&#xD;
      (combinations of) checkpoint inhibition could also be improved, thus preventing unnecessary&#xD;
      toxicity and reducing health care costs.&#xD;

             anticipation that such a live attenuated vaccine will be required during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ● Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (example:&#xD;
             approximately October to March in the Northern Hemisphere). Subjects must not receive&#xD;
             live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g. FluMist®) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1,&#xD;
             Day 1 or at any time during the study treatment of within 5 months after the last dose&#xD;
             of MPDL3280A.&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the&#xD;
             interpretation of the results or render the subject at high risk from treatment&#xD;
             complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Prior treatment with CD137 agonists or immune checkpoint blockade therapies,&#xD;
             anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             ● Subjects who have had prior anti-CTLA-4 treatment may be enrolled, provided the&#xD;
             following requirements are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Minimum of 6 weeks from the last dose of anti-CTLA-4&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  No history of severe immune related adverse effects from anti-CTLA-4 (CTCAE Grade&#xD;
                  3 and 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
         27. Treatment with systemic immunostimulatory agents (including but not limited to IFNs,&#xD;
             IL-2) within 6 weeks or five half-lives of the drug, whichever is shorter, prior to&#xD;
             the first full dose of MPDL3280A.&#xD;
&#xD;
         28. Treatment with systemic immunosuppressive medications (including but not limited to&#xD;
             prednisone, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, thalidomide, and anti-tumor&#xD;
             necrosis factor agents) within 2 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects who have received acute, low-dose, systemic immunosuppressant&#xD;
                  medications (e.g. a one-time dose of dexamethasone for nausea) may be enrolled in&#xD;
                  the study after discussion with and approval by the sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The use of inhaled corticosteroids for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
                  mineralocorticoids (e.g. fludrocortisone) for subjects with orthostatic&#xD;
                  hypotension, and low-dose supplemental corticosteroids for adrenocortical&#xD;
                  insufficiency are allowed.&#xD;
