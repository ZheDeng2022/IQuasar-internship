      Administration of DPX-RSV(A), a Respiratory Syncytial Virus vaccine containing Respiratory&#xD;
      Syncytial Virus (RSV) SHe antigen and DepoVaxTM adjuvant to healthy adults ≥50-64 years of&#xD;
      age.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, First in Humans, randomized (2:2:1) observer blind, controlled, dose&#xD;
      ranging, multi-arm parallel-group clinical trial in healthy persons 50 to 64 years of age to&#xD;
      assess the safety and immunogenicity of two dose levels of a novel vaccine formulation&#xD;
      DPX-RSV(A) consisting of a synthetic Respiratory Syncytial Virus SHe antigen combined with a&#xD;
      novel adjuvant DepoVaxTM, compared to the antigen combined with the commonly used adjuvant&#xD;
      Aluminum hydroxide, and to a saline placebo control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will evaluate two different doses of DPX-RSV(A) and two doses of the RSV SHe&#xD;
      antigen with aluminum hydroxide (RSV(A)-Alum), and a placebo control. The study is&#xD;
      randomized, controlled, and observer-blinded in order that allocation to treatment is&#xD;
      concealed from the investigative team and the participant. The inclusion of comparator groups&#xD;
      (a placebo control group and the RSV(A)-Alum) allows for estimation of the attributable risk&#xD;
      of adverse events. Since the study vaccines are not identical in appearance, an unblinded&#xD;
      study nurse who has no other role in the study will administer the study vaccines.&#xD;

             considered clinically significant by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Transient mild laboratory abnormalities may be rescreened and the participant will be&#xD;
             deemed eligible if the laboratory repeat test is normal as per local laboratory normal&#xD;
             values and investigator assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any acute or chronic, clinically significant disease, as determined by physical&#xD;
