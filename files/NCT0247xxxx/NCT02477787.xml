    <textblock>
      This is a single center, open label, random comparison phase 2b study. The primary objective&#xD;
      of this study is, by random comparison, to assess the anti-leukemia effect of allogeneic,&#xD;
      donor-derived natural killer (NK) cells infused after HLA-haploidentical hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HCT) in patients with refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to assess the side effects of donor NK cell&#xD;
      infusion, effects of donor NK cell infusion upon HCT outcomes, as well as effects upon&#xD;
      post-HCT immune recovery.&#xD;
