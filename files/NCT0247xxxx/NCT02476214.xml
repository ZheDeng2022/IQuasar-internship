  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prenatal care is defined as pregnancy-related health care services provided to a women&#xD;
      between conception and delivery. Early, comprehensive prenatal care can promote healthier&#xD;
      pregnancies and can reduce the risk of some adverse birth outcomes by detecting and managing&#xD;
      preexisting medical conditions, by providing health behavior advice, and by offering a&#xD;
      gateway into the health care system for socially disadvantaged women . The customary approach&#xD;
      for prenatal care includes routine individual care, which is provided by nurses and&#xD;
      physicians in healthcare clinics and hospitals. Since 1995, citizens of Israel, have been&#xD;
      entitled to health care services according to the National Health Insurance Law . Israeli&#xD;
      citizens are covered by National Health Insurance, and get maternal and child preventive&#xD;
      services including prenatal care by local Mother and Child Health Clinics . The prenatal care&#xD;
      is individual. A nurse meets with every registered pregnant women, assess the medical and&#xD;
      emotional condition and provide guidance related to the pregnancy week of the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the 70, a number of group prenatal care intervention programs are described in the&#xD;
      literature. Group prenatal care is designed to answer the recommended content for prenatal&#xD;
      care for improving the quality of care and resulting in improved pregnancy outcome . The&#xD;
      group prenatal care includes three important components: risk assessment. Guidance and&#xD;
      support and combines them into the prenatal care22. Creation of the group provides a meeting&#xD;
      place for pregnant women. A safe place for sharing and learning from each other and to build&#xD;
      a community for mutual support .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that, relative to women who receive standard individual&#xD;
      prenatal care, the women who receive group prenatal care will be more likely to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Report higher levels of satisfaction. The investigators also anticipate higher levels of&#xD;
           staff satisfaction within the intervention group medical staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Higher levels of knowledge about pregnancy related issues (e.g., health behaviors during&#xD;
           pregnancy, tests during pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Higher levels of compliance for recommended prenatal care screening tests (e.g., GCT,&#xD;
           first and second trimester screening, US)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. have better perinatal outcomes: better health behaviors during pregnancy (e.g.,&#xD;
           nutrition, physical activity ext.'), better birth outcomes (e.g., preterm labor, low&#xD;
           birthweight,), and better postpartum indicators (e.g., increased breastfeeding);&#xD;

      evaluate feasibility and effectiveness of group Prenatal Care for low risk pregnancies. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that, relative to women who receive standard individual prenatal care, the women&#xD;
      who receive group prenatal care will be more likely to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Report higher levels of satisfaction. We also anticipate higher levels of staff&#xD;
           satisfaction within the intervention group medical staff.&#xD;

           nutrition, physical activity ext.'), better birth outcomes (e.g., preterm labor, low&#xD;
           birthweight,), and better postpartum indicators (e.g., increased breastfeeding); The&#xD;
           study is an open non-randomized community trial and will include 291 women. 73 of the&#xD;
           participants will be in the intervention group. Women who are at high risk pregnancy,&#xD;
           under 18 years old or does not speak Hebrew will be excluded. Every women that will&#xD;
           arrive to an OBGYN for the first time in the pregnancy, would be asked to join the&#xD;
           study. The women who agrees, will be offered either group prenatal care or individual&#xD;
           routine prenatal care, depends on their gestational age and the optional group's&#xD;
           gestational age. The women can also refuse to be in a group but still be in the control&#xD;
           group, if she chooses to. For both arms, data will be collected thru questioners that&#xD;
           will be answered at the beginning and at the end of the prenatal care. Data regarding&#xD;
           the birth outcomes will be collected from medical files after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group: groups of 8-12 women who are in similar week of pregnancy / due&#xD;
      date. The first group session will begin at 12-14 week (depends on gestational age at first&#xD;
      OBGYN visit). The group meetings will be held once a month until 28 weeks of pregnancy. From&#xD;
      28 weeks and until the end of pregnancy or 40 weeks, it will be held once every two weeks&#xD;
      (according to the Ministry of Health guidelines). The last session will be held approximately&#xD;
      6 weeks after birth. There will be about 10 group sessions. Each session will be around 90&#xD;
      minutes. At the beginning of every group meeting, the nurse will preform a short anamnesis&#xD;
      and measures in private, followed by discussion and guidance. At the end of the session, if&#xD;
      needed, women can have private time with the nurse.&#xD;
