      This is a Canadian randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo when used to treat&#xD;
      subjects with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee, and with clinical features of&#xD;
      inflammation, whose pain persists despite receiving maximum tolerated doses of conventional&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;

      This is a Canadian randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study designed&#xD;
      to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of adalimumab versus placebo when used to treat&#xD;
      subjects with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis of the knee, and with clinical features of&#xD;
      inflammation, whose pain persists despite receiving maximum tolerated doses of conventional&#xD;
      therapy. A total of 100 subjects will be entered into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized (1:1) at baseline to receive either adalimumab 40 mg every other&#xD;
      week or placebo for 16 weeks. The study drug will be self-administered via subcutaneous&#xD;
      injection. Efficacy will be assessed at week 16 while the safety of the study drug will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. At week 16 all subjects will begin to receive open label&#xD;
      adalimumab 40 mg every other week.&#xD;

    <description>At Baseline, subjects will be randomized (1:1) to receive study drug (Adalimumab or placebo). The study drug will be provided as a subcutaneous injection (pre-filled syringe) either Adalimumab (ADA) 40 mg/0.8 mL,every other week (EOW) or matching placebo for Adalimumab every other week for 16 weeks. Efficacy will be assessed at Week 16 while the safety of the study drug will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
At Week 16 all subjects will begin to receive open label ADA 40 mg EOW and will continue to receive open label ADA up to Week 50. An End of Study visit will be done at Week 52. A Telephone Follow-up will be done at Week 62 to review Adverse Events and Concomitant Medications.</description>
