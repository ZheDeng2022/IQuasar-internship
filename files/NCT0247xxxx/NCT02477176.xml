  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this 12-month, prospective, multicenter study is to investigate the effect of&#xD;
      annular defect size and other risk factors on reherniation and associated costs in primary&#xD;
      lumbar discectomy patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll up to 100 patients at select US (approximately 4-7) sites. Patients&#xD;
      that are scheduled for an L1-S1 discectomy and who meet the pre-operative eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will be considered for study participation. Patients will be divided into two arms&#xD;
      (small- and large-defect) based on the size of their annular defect as measured&#xD;
      intra-operatively; each arm will be capped at 50 patients. All patients included in the trial&#xD;
      will be followed for at least 12 months.&#xD;
