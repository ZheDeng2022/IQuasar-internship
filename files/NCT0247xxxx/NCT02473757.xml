      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Gene therapy is a way to treat or prevent disease using genes. It is monitored very closely&#xD;
      by regulators because there can be long-term, unexpected side effects. NIH is required to try&#xD;
      to contact people who have been treated with gene therapy at least annually for up to 15&#xD;
      years. This is to see if they have had any bad side effects. This trial does not include any&#xD;
      therapy and is only for patients previously treated on gene-therapy trials at the NCI Surgery&#xD;
      Branch who are no longer enrolled on their original gene therapy clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To collect of long-term follow-up data on people who have been in gene transfer studies.&#xD;
      This follow-up is required by regulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - People age 18 and older who have been in a previous NCI Surgery Branch gene therapy&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After they get the genetically modified cells, participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have blood drawn 3, 6, and 12 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Have an annual clinic visit for the next 4 years. They will have a physical exam. They&#xD;
           will answer questions about any signs of neurological, autoimmune, or blood disorders,&#xD;
           or any new cancers. Blood may be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be called or emailed annually for the next 10 years. They will answer health questions.&#xD;
           Blood samples may need to be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be asked for their current address and phone number. They will also be&#xD;
           asked for the address and phone number of 1 or 2 people who will know their whereabouts.&#xD;
           One of these should be a family member if possible,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the time of the participant s death, researchers will request permission from their&#xD;
           family for an autopsy.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -The National Cancer Institute Surgery Branch (NCI-SB) Branch investigator conducts clinical&#xD;
      trials utilizing gene transfer. The current U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#xD;
      requirements for long term follow up may be up to fifteen years for some products. As this&#xD;
      time period is frequently longer than studies are expected to be open, a long-term follow-up&#xD;
      protocol is necessary to ensure the follow up of these subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To facilitate collection of long term, follow up information on subjects who have&#xD;
      participated in gene transfer studies as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      and other regulatory groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Enrollment on a CAR T-cell treatment protocol for gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients will undergo physical exams; laboratory evaluation or phone follow up as required&#xD;
      by the treatment protocol and/or as clinically indicated.&#xD;
