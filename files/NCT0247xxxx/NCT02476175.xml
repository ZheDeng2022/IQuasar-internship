      The objective is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adding mirabegron to an&#xD;
      antimuscarinic to treat urinary incontinence in children with Overactive Bladder that are&#xD;
      refractory to antimuscarinics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overactive bladder (OAB) is a highly prevalent disorder in the pediatric population. This&#xD;
      condition comprises many urinary symptoms, such as urgency, increased daytime frequency of&#xD;
      micturition, urge incontinence and nocturia. These symptoms are especially troublesome for&#xD;
      the pediatric patients and their family since it causes embarrassment and it limits everyday&#xD;
      activities and impairs children's development. Furthermore, serious complications are seen if&#xD;
      this condition is not treated properly, as urinary tract infection, vesico-ureteral reflux&#xD;
      and dysfunctional voiding. Antimuscarinic agents are the current pharmacologic mainstay for&#xD;
      OAB. Many side effects are reported with the clinical use of antimuscarinics. Oxybutynin is&#xD;
      the most widely antimuscarinic agent used in the pediatric population and is the only&#xD;
      molecule approved by Health Canada for children with OAB. However, some patients have a&#xD;
      suboptimal response to antimuscarinic and many experience side effects. Children with OAB&#xD;
      therefore represent a disease population with a need for an alternative effective, safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated therapy to help manage the overactive detrusor, reducing or preventing&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mirabegron, a β3-adrenoceptor (β3-AR) agonist approved for the treatment of OAB symptoms in&#xD;
      the adult population, is the first of a new class of compounds with a different mechanism of&#xD;
      action. The recommended starting dose of mirabegron is 25mg, which can be increased to 50mg,&#xD;
      based on individual efficacy and tolerability. Side effects commonly reported with&#xD;
      antimuscarinics were not observed more often with mirabegron than with placebo (headache&#xD;
      2.0%, dry mouth 2.0%, constipation 1.6%). Several Phase II and III studies have shown&#xD;
      significant improvement in clinical OAB symptoms in adults treated with mirabegron with a&#xD;
      favorable tolerability profile. Mirabegron has not been studied yet for pediatric patients&#xD;
      and no recommendation with regards to its use has been issued by the manufacturer nor medical&#xD;
      regulatory bodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective open-label study, using an adjusted-dose regimen of mirabegron (25-50mg) added&#xD;
      to the existing antimuscanic treatment (dual treatment), including pediatric patients with&#xD;
      refractory urinary incontinence due to OAB. This protocol was approved by the investigators'&#xD;
      research ethics board. Patients without symptom improvement or with partial response under&#xD;
      intensive behavioural protocol and medical therapy (at least 2 different antimuscarinic&#xD;
      agents) will be recruited. Pprimary end-point is efficacy toward urinary continence and&#xD;
      secondary end-points are tolerability and safety. The patients/parents satisfaction will also&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 8 to 12 weeks on the new medication, the possibility of up-titration will be assessed.&#xD;
      Patients and parents will be questioned on compliance, tolerability and efficacy. If the&#xD;
      patient is taking the medication ≥80% of the time, does not have any significant side effects&#xD;
      and still has significant OAB symptoms, the investigators will offer a dose increase&#xD;
      (Mirabegron 50mg daily). If accepted, the medication will be provided with instructions to&#xD;
      report any new side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 3-day voiding diary prior to each medical visit to assess the&#xD;
      efficacy of the treatment and urotherapy. Visits will be done every 3 months.&#xD;
