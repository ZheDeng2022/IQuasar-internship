      -  Background : Edema of lower extremities is a concern ranging from 19 % to 60% of&#xD;
           palliative cancer patients. Lymphedema decreases mobility, induces pain, impacts daily&#xD;
           activities, esthetic and behavior. Usual treatment is based on diuretics and&#xD;
           physiotherapy but is often unsuccessful. In case of conventional treatment failure, in&#xD;
           palliative care, subcutaneous drainage can be discussed with the patients. The technique&#xD;
           is simple, easy to use but remains off the record. Since 2004, 23 cases were reported&#xD;
           with various methods. All the cases reported were undertaken with various technical&#xD;
           approaches and efficacy criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purpose : Investigator hypothesize that the subcutaneous drainage of edema (SDO) is&#xD;
           effective in case of refractory lymphedema of the lower limbs in palliative care and&#xD;
           leads to an improvement in QOL in terms of behavioral and autonomy.&#xD;

      • Abstract : In palliative care, lymphedema results from various associations of cancer,&#xD;
      hypoalbuminemia, electrolytic disturbances or organ failure. The lymphatic circulation cannot&#xD;
      be summarized by the Starling's equation and obstruction cannot explain everything. An&#xD;
      interstitial hypothesis underlines the role of the lymphatic pump and edema volume can be a&#xD;
      crucial point. The SDO, via the direct liquid removal, can restore the lymphatic pump&#xD;
      function. This volumetric effect can explain the long time effect of the SDO and the large&#xD;
      range of liquid amount reported in effective SDO. The superficial lymphatic system, in the&#xD;
      superficial layer of derma, drains 80 % of lymph flow. In edema, the increased volume leads&#xD;
      to the creation of subcutaneous interconnected lacunas. The subcutaneous site for drainage is&#xD;
      justified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After topic anesthesia, three subcutaneous channels are created on the ankle's medial face of&#xD;
      the edematous limbs and liquids are absorbed by pads. An additional drainage can be done on&#xD;
      the external face of the thigh with liquid collecting bags in bedridden patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes clinical examination, total and segmental bioelectrical impedance measured&#xD;
      at J0, J4 and on exit or at J7 at the latest and daily weight, umbilic abdominal perimeters&#xD;
      and segmental circumferences and QOL evaluation before and after SDO. Bioelectrical impedance&#xD;
      is collected from hand-foot, thigh root-foot and under patella calf - foot electrodes.&#xD;
      Segmental circumferences are collected at thigh, calf and ankle points identified from bone&#xD;
      relief distance.&#xD;
