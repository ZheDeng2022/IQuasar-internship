  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When Veterans with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from depression, they are more likely to&#xD;
      experience disease complications, interpersonal difficulties with caregivers, and poorer&#xD;
      quality of life. Unfortunately, depression in Veterans with PD is inadequately treated at the&#xD;
      current time. Treatment for depressed Veterans with PD will require the elimination of&#xD;
      geographical barriers to care and approaches that address the unique aspects of PD. The&#xD;
      proposed study will be the first to explore a novel and innovative, PD-informed psychotherapy&#xD;
      package for depressed Veterans with PD and their Caregivers, delivered through video-to-home&#xD;
      telehealth. If the results of this proposal are promising, a much needed treatment can be&#xD;
      made available to Veterans with PD and their Caregivers across the country, regardless of&#xD;
      geographical location.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Objective: There is a critical need for treatments that address depression and barriers to&#xD;
      mental health care among the nearly 100,000 Veterans with Parkinson's Disease (PD) served by&#xD;
      the VA. Depression in PD (dPD) is a major complicating factor in the movement disorder,&#xD;
      affecting several key functional outcomes such as motor disability, cognitive status, quality&#xD;
      of life, and caregiving relationships. The challenge to meeting the treatment needs of&#xD;
      Veterans with dPD centers on the lack of clinicians who are knowledgeable about the&#xD;
      interactions of PD and depression, the considerable transportation barriers faced by this&#xD;
      population, combined with the geographical dispersion of specialized services within the VA,&#xD;
      and the paucity of effectiveness research that informs treatments for dPD. The proposed study&#xD;
      seeks to overcome these challenges by using a telehealth delivery platform (i.e.,&#xD;
      video-to-home) to test the effectiveness of a 10-session cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT)&#xD;
      package that has been tailored to address the unique needs of depressed Veterans with PD. The&#xD;
      proposed treatment package also provides support and skills-training to the Veteran's&#xD;
      Caregiver (3 sessions). This HSR&amp;D proposal will be the first to: 1) to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of TH-CBT for improving Veteran outcomes in dPD, 2) to examine the impact of&#xD;
      TH-CBT for dPD on a variety of Caregiver outcomes, and 3) to assess Veteran and Caregiver&#xD;
      perspectives on TH-CBT using a mixed-methods sequential explanatory design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: A PD-informed, telehealth-administered cognitive behavioral therapy package (TH-CBT)&#xD;
      for dPD will be evaluated in a clinical effectiveness trial. 180 participants (90 Veterans&#xD;
      and 90 Caregivers) will be enrolled. Half of the sample will receive the study treatment&#xD;
      package (TH-CBT), in addition to their standard medical care. The other half will only&#xD;
      receive standard medical care. The two groups will be compared at baseline, midpoint (week&#xD;
      5), endpoint (week 10), and 1 and 6 months post treatment. Veterans will be assessed with&#xD;
      standard measures of depression, anxiety, quality of life, and motor function, while&#xD;
      Caregivers will be evaluated with measures of caregiver burden, empowerment, and&#xD;
      communication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact: Given the public health impact of improved depression treatment in Veterans with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease, the knowledge to be gained may be significant and the project could&#xD;
      directly impact clinical practice. The data gleaned from this study will guide the wide-scale&#xD;
      implementation of this remote care model within the VA for meeting the specialized needs of&#xD;
      Veterans with PD. Towards this goal, successful results for the proposed study will&#xD;
      facilitate a multisite initiative to further examine issues of dissemination, implementation,&#xD;
      and effectiveness, using a hybrid research design. Ultimately, these Health Science Research&#xD;
      &amp; Development (HSR&amp;D) data may support the development of a centralized care model, in which&#xD;
      highly specialized dPD providers, concentrated in a few locations, provide specialty care to&#xD;
      Veterans and Caregivers across the country.&#xD;

    <description>This measure uses the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) to express the average severity of depressive symptoms, with higher scores indicating greater depression. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) Score Min:0 and Max: 52. Higher scores mean a worse outcome.</description>

    <measure>Family Empowerment Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>10 weeks (endpoint) and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The Family Empowerment scale measures the degree to which caregivers feel empowered to help care for their Veteran. To obtain a score for each area, sum the item responses where &quot;Not at all&quot; is scoring as 1, &quot;Mostly not true&quot; is scored as 2, &quot;Somewhat true&quot; is scored as 3, &quot;Mostly true&quot; is scored as 4, and &quot;Very true&quot; is scored as 5 to produce a score ranging from 12-60. The items are scored in the same direction, i.e., no item scores are reversed, and a higher score indicates relatively more empowerment in each respective area. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>

TH-CBT: The TH-CBT group will receive the study intervention and standard care. The study treatment has been previously manualized and modified for remote administration, as described in the introduction to the revised application.12 PD Veterans will receive 10 weekly individual sessions (60 minutes each) of CBT, delivered via Video-to-home.&#xD;
Standard Care: Standard Care is defined as medical and psychiatric treatment provided by patients' personal doctors (e.g., neurologists, psychiatrists, therapists). Veterans will continue to receive routine clinical care and will remain on all depression treatments that they were receiving prior to their study (e.g., stable antidepressant medication, established psychotherapy, clinical monitoring).</description>

        <title>Family Empowerment Scale</title>
        <description>The Family Empowerment scale measures the degree to which caregivers feel empowered to help care for their Veteran. To obtain a score for each area, sum the item responses where &quot;Not at all&quot; is scoring as 1, &quot;Mostly not true&quot; is scored as 2, &quot;Somewhat true&quot; is scored as 3, &quot;Mostly true&quot; is scored as 4, and &quot;Very true&quot; is scored as 5 to produce a score ranging from 12-60. The items are scored in the same direction, i.e., no item scores are reversed, and a higher score indicates relatively more empowerment in each respective area. Higher scores mean a better outcome.</description>
        <time_frame>10 weeks (endpoint) and 6 months post-treatment</time_frame>
        <population>This assessment was only given to care partners not veterans. Some care partners did not complete the Family Empowerment Scale at 6-months post treatment.</population>

Standard Care: Standard Care is defined as medical and psychiatric treatment provided by patients' personal doctors (e.g., neurologists, psychiatrists, therapists). Veterans will continue to receive routine clinical care and will remain on all depression treatments that they were receiving prior to their study (e.g., stable antidepressant medication, established psychotherapy, clinical monitoring).</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>This study has several limitations that merit comment. This sample was 100% male, which may limit the generalizability of findings to females. In order to provide direct policy guidance on the additive value of V-CBT to VA's current standard of PD care, we utilized an existing-practice control (TAU). It is not possible to fully disaggregate effects of this V-CBT intervention from nonspecific factors (e.g., therapeutic relationship, attention) that contribute to all psychotherapy outcomes.</limitations_and_caveats>
