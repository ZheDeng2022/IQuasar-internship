      Introduction Pelvic-organ prolapse, in which the pelvic organs (uterus, bladder, and bowel)&#xD;
      protrude into or past the vaginal introitus, is a condition often treated with surgery1,2.&#xD;
      Women have an 11 percent risk of surgery for prolapse or urinary incontinence by 80 years of&#xD;
      age, and of this 11 percent, almost one third of the women have a second surgery3. This fact&#xD;
      points to the need for improved treatment of pelvic-floor disorders. Numerous surgical&#xD;
      procedures have been described for the management of POP. Vaginal surgery may be associated&#xD;
      with less postoperative pain and a more rapid return to daily living than abdominal&#xD;
      repair4,5. However, in a randomised study, sacrocolpopexy was twice as likely to result in&#xD;
      optimal anatomical outcome as vaginal surgery6. Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy provides the&#xD;
      potential to combine the success rates of an abdominal approach with the faster recovery&#xD;
      associated with a minimally invasive technique. Tissue dissection and mesh placement may also&#xD;
      be facilitated by the magnification and field of view permitted by the laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach7-10. These benefits must be balanced against a longer operating time from 150 to 250&#xD;
      minutes according to surgeons' experience. In addition, this procedure is often associated to&#xD;
      subtotal hysterectomy (LSH) for the reasons of prevention (post-menopause age) or uterine&#xD;
      diseases, which improve still more the operating time. Literature studies reports that the&#xD;
      use of electrosurgical loop decreased the time required for resection of the uterine cervix&#xD;
      during LSH for benign uterine conditions. Moreover LSH can be performed more easily with a&#xD;
      powered morcellator for removal of the uterus. These devices facilitate and increase the&#xD;
      safety of this procedure11,12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the available laparoscopic morcellators may be difficult to use (weight, ergonomics,&#xD;
      etc.) and there are potentially serious complications unreported in the medical literature13.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized pilot study is aimed to verify if the operative time of a&#xD;
      standard laparoscopic sacral colpopexy associated to subtotal hysterectomy for the treatment&#xD;
      of POP could be further reduced using PKS BILL: bipolar laparoscopic loop (a laparoscopic&#xD;
      loop using advanced bipolar energy) (Olympus Medical Systems Corp, Tokyo) and PKS PlasmaSORD&#xD;
      (Solid Organ Removal Device) vs. conventional monopolar hook and conventional mechanic&#xD;
      morcellator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endopoints of this comparison are incidence of intra- or postoperative&#xD;
      complications estimated blood loss, postoperative pain (evaluated by VAS), days of&#xD;
      hospitalization and costs for the health care system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis and Study Design This is a single Institution prospective randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial conducted at the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To have an imbalanced results and to reduce any bias, a randomization list has been checked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probability (p) values will be considered to be statistically significant at the &lt;0.05 level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be recruited 50 patients to treat using PK BiLL/PKS plasmasord and 50 patients to&#xD;
      treat with standard monopolar hook/standard morcellator comparing these two techniques in&#xD;
      terms of operative time, estimated blood loss and other intra- or post operative&#xD;
      complications, postoperative pain, days of hospitalization, costs. All patients will be&#xD;
      adequately informed and inserted in the study only after having read and signed an informed&#xD;
      consent. Diagnostic, clinical and surgical data of each patient will be prospectively&#xD;
      recorded. At the end of the procedure, a schedule will be compiled with intraoperative data.&#xD;
      All clinical and histologic data will be recorded prospectively using a database. Pain&#xD;
      associated with the procedure will be evaluated by a subjective assessment (analysis of VAS&#xD;
      scale values reported by patients at 8 and 24 hours after surgery). Post-operative&#xD;
      complications will be evaluated during the first 30 days after surgery according to Dindo's&#xD;
      classification14.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study procedures Standard sacral colpopexy with subtotal hysterectomy With the patient in the&#xD;
      Trendelenburg position (≥30°), after insertion of a 16F Foley urethral catheter, adequate&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum was induced. Uterine manipulator is used to move the uterus.A 10-mm&#xD;
      laparoscope was introduced through the umbilicus and two 5-mm trocars were placed 2 cm&#xD;
      medially and superiorly to the anterosuperior iliac spines. After thorough evaluation of the&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity and, if necessary, completion of adhesiolysis, an additional 5- to 12-mm&#xD;
      trocar was placed under visual control in the midline half way between the pubic symphysis&#xD;
      and umbilicus. In the case of obesity or short umbilicopubic length, the 5-to 12-mm trocar&#xD;
      was placed at the umbilicus and the 10-mm optical trocar was inserted in midline half way&#xD;
      between the xiphoid process and umbilicus. The first step of LSC consisted of locating useful&#xD;
      anatomic landmarks (outline of the promontory, iliac bifurcation, left common iliac vein,&#xD;
      right ureter) and exposing the longitudinal vertebral ligament covering the sacral&#xD;
      promontory. This was accomplished by opening the parietal peritoneum and gentle sharp and&#xD;
      blunt dissection of retroperitonal tissue. Median sacral vessels were pushed back inward&#xD;
      during dissection or coagulated if necessary. Then the peritoneal incision was prolonged&#xD;
      along the right pelvic wall up to the uterine isthmus, paying careful attention to the ureter&#xD;
      when mesh subperitonealization was scheduled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subtotal hysterectomy started now. The round ligaments are coagulated and cut to enter&#xD;
      the retroperitoneum. The broad ligaments/ovarian pedicles are sealed with bipolar diathermy&#xD;
      and divided with monopolar scissors. Anterior and posteriors leaves of the broad ligaments&#xD;
      peritoneum are divided with monopolar scissors. The incision is carried anteriorly. The&#xD;
      bladder peritoneum is incised distal to the cervicouterine junction. Paravescical and&#xD;
      pararectal spaces are developed. After both uterine arteries were coagulated using bipolar&#xD;
      diathermy and monopolar forceps and the bladder dissection was completed, supracervical&#xD;
      separation of the uterus wasperformed using a monopolar hook after removal of the uterine&#xD;
      manipulator. The uterus was then morcellated by drawing the specimen into the morcellator&#xD;
      (ROTOCUT G1 Morcellator, KARL STORZ GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pouch of Douglas was incised between the left and right uterosacral ligaments and the&#xD;
      rectovaginal space was dissected along the posterior vaginal wall. Margins of dissection were&#xD;
      the perineal body inferiorly and rectovaginal ligament laterally. To cover all the dissection&#xD;
      space without tension, an adequately shaped Prolene mesh (Ethicon, Inc) was placed and fixed&#xD;
      to the vaginal wall by five 3-0 nonabsorbable sutures. The first suture was applied in&#xD;
      midline at the perineal apex of the mesh. Two sutures for each side were applied on the&#xD;
      middle and upper portions of the posterolateral vaginal walls. The vesicouterine peritoneum&#xD;
      was opened and vesicouterine and vesicovaginal spaces were dissected along the uterine and&#xD;
      vaginal walls. Dissection limits were the trigonal region (emphasized by the Foley catheter)&#xD;
      inferiorly and bladder pillars laterally. Also in this case an adequately shaped Prolene mesh&#xD;
      covering all the dissection space without tension was inserted and fixed to the vaginal wall&#xD;
      with five 3-0 nonabsorbable sutures. The first suture was applied at midline at the vesical&#xD;
      apex of the mesh. Two sutures for each side were located on the middle and upper portions of&#xD;
      anterolateral vaginal walls. The peritoneum of the right broad ligament between the round&#xD;
      ligament-ovarian ligament superiorly and parametrial portion of uterine vessels inferiorly&#xD;
      was incised so as to rejoin the previous right peritoneal incision, and the anterior mesh was&#xD;
      passed through the incision. The two meshes were threaded up toward the promontory under&#xD;
      visual control from the vagina so as to lift the prolapse vaginal walls without excessive&#xD;
      tension. Meshes were fixed to the longitudinal vertebral ligament with one 0 non-absorbable&#xD;
      suture on a noncutting needle . The operation was completed by re-peritonealization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PKS BiLL technology Using PKS bipolar laparoscopic loop can simplify cervical amputation and&#xD;
      decreased the time required for the detachment of the uterine corpus, which many consider the&#xD;
      more difficult part of laparoscopic subtotal hysterectomy. In addition, the loop system&#xD;
      allows the supracervical separation of the uterus at or above the level of the coagulated&#xD;
      uterine vessels, therefore minimising the risk of slippage or retraction of the vessels. The&#xD;
      bipolar technology could add an ulterior advantage in terms of safety and operating procedure&#xD;
      time reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the same way the use of PKS plasmasord bipolar morcellator could reduce the risk of&#xD;
      injuries. The lightness of this instrument could increase the procedure feasibility.&#xD;
