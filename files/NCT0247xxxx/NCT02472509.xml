  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well established that hemolytic diseases predispose patients to the development of&#xD;
      pigment gallstones. Gallstones are noted in at least 5% of children under the age of 10&#xD;
      years, increasing to 40-50% in the second to fifth decades. The co-inheritance of Gilbert's&#xD;
      syndrome increases the risk of cholelithiasis four to five-fold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with chronic hemolysis, total bile lipid concentration is decreased and the total&#xD;
      bilirubin to total lipid ratio is increased. This suggests that the conjugating capacity of&#xD;
      hepatocytes is surpassed by the excessive amount of bilirubin resulting from hemolysis.&#xD;
      Increased bilirubin monoconjugate and unconjugated bilirubin can precipitate in bile and form&#xD;
      complexes with inorganic ions, mostly calcium, and develop into stones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with hemolytic disorders can also develop biliary sludge, a suspension of&#xD;
      precipitated particulate matter in bile dispersed in a viscous, mucin-rich liquid phase . The&#xD;
      chemical composition of the precipitates correlates well with the composition of the&#xD;
      associated stone and sludge often stands as a harbinger of future stone development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong data suggesting a benefit in treating cholelithiasis with UDCA and also in&#xD;
      preventing gallstone development in various high risk scenarios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several proposed mechanisms for the positive effect of UDCA in primary prevention&#xD;
      of pigment stones. Mucoglycoproteins are present in significant amounts in black pigment&#xD;
      stones and contribute to the matrix of gallstones. UDCA suppresses the secretion of protein&#xD;
      and decreases the levels of various proteins in bile . It has also been suggested that&#xD;
      increased colonic bile salt may solubilize unconjugated bilirubin and may prevent calcium&#xD;
      complexing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no published data at present on the role of UDCA in prevention and treatment of&#xD;
      cholelithiasis in hemolytic diseases. The investigators hypothesise that UDCA can be of&#xD;
      benefit to patients with hemolytic disorders in the primary prevention of pigment stones,&#xD;
      possible resolution of biliary sludge and existent stones, and reduction of symptomatic&#xD;
      episodes of cholelithiasis.&#xD;

      The research protocol extends for up to 12 months, during which the participant will attend 3&#xD;
      clinic visits at Shaare Zedek Medical Centre; one at study enrollment, one at 6 months and&#xD;
      one at 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients identified will have their medical records reviewed for previous clinical,&#xD;
      biochemical or sonographic evidence of gallstones.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo a baseline abdominal ultrasound to assess for biliary sludge,&#xD;
      gallstones, or evidence of previous cholecystitis (eg. Thickened gallbladder wall).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will also have blood tested for liver biochemistry, complete blood count,&#xD;
      hemolytic screen and fasting lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be commenced on UDCA 15mg/kg/day (maximum dose 900mg/day) in 2-3 divided&#xD;
      doses for 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are unable to tolerate tablet medication will be started on UDCA syrup at the&#xD;
      same dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the in-house visits will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. An explicit history taking and review of patient's notes, including review of symptoms,&#xD;
           blood tests and previous ultrasounds, other medical conditions and medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Physical examination - including measuring splenic size, assessing for right upper&#xD;
           quadrant abdominal tenderness&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Hemoglobin, WBC&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Liver biochemistry: ALT, AST, GGT, ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase), Bilirubin&#xD;
                (conjugated and unconjugated), Albumin&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Hemolytic screen: LDH, haptoglobin, reticulocytes&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Fasting lipids: LDL, HDL, Triglycerides&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeat abdominal ultrasound will be performed at 12 months. The US will specifically relate&#xD;
      to the following features in comparison to the baseline US:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Presence of biliary sludge&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Presence of gallstone: i.Size ii.Number&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presence of bile duct dilatation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Presence of gall bladder wall thickening&#xD;
