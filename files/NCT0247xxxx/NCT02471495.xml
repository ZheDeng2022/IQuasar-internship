    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, single-arm, phase 3 study will assess the proportion of&#xD;
      disease-free patients, starting from administration of the first study treatment to at least&#xD;
      12-months after the first treatment, and up to 2 years (the latter only in patients choosing&#xD;
      to participate in longer-term disease-free-survival data collection).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of three periods: 1) Screening; 2) Induction, and 3) Maintenance&#xD;
      treatment and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening period After signing informed consent, patients will be screened for study&#xD;
      eligibility by assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Screening procedures will&#xD;
      include collection of demographic data, medical history, physical examination, vital signs,&#xD;
      and laboratory evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Induction period Patients will receive 8 weekly treatments of RITE + MMC, using the Synergo®&#xD;
      System. Each treatment lasts about 60 minutes and consists of two 30-minute cycles with 40 mg&#xD;
      MMC/50 ml sterile water for injection each cycle. These 8 treatments will be followed by a&#xD;
      pause (see Table 1), after which a follow-up cystoscopy (first follow-up control) will be&#xD;
      conducted during Weeks 12-13 (from the first treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maintenance Treatment and Follow-up Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the maintenance period, patients will receive one Synergo® RITE + MMC treatment every&#xD;
      6 weeks. Each treatment lasts about 60 minutes and consists of two 30-minute cycles with 40&#xD;
      mg MMC/50 ml sterile water for injection each cycle. Maintenance treatments will be given&#xD;
      until the end of 12 months after the patient's first induction treatment, unless the&#xD;
      patient's participation in the study is terminated due to either:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. a lack of complete response (at 6 months) or worsening of disease (at 3 months; see&#xD;
           first and second follow-up control below), or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. recurrence/progression Patients will be assessed by cystoscopy, urine cytology and, if&#xD;
           required, subsequent biopsy or transurethral resection (TUR) of suspect areas every 3&#xD;
           months till the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two consecutive definite positive urine cytologies will be required to confirm persistent or&#xD;
      recurrent disease if visual and biopsy are negative. In such cases, investigation of&#xD;
      extravesical locations (CT-IVU, prostatic urethra biopsy) will be performed between the first&#xD;
      and second urine cytology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first follow-up control, i.e., 3 months after administration of the first study&#xD;
      treatment, patients will undergo a cystoscopy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients failing to achieve a disease-free state at the time of the first follow-up will&#xD;
      continue in the study, unless a new occurrence of a T1 and/or high-grade lesion is found or&#xD;
      any extra-bladder involvement is evident from pathological analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the second, i.e., 6-month, follow-up visit, patients will undergo biopsies of suspicious&#xD;
      areas and random bladder biopsies of the trigone, bladder dome, right, left, anterior and&#xD;
      posterior of the bladder wall. Upper tract washes will be performed in patients in whom urine&#xD;
      cytology will be positive with no pathological evidence of NMIBC lesions in the bladder or&#xD;
      the prostatic urethra. Patients failing to achieve a disease-free state at the time of the 6&#xD;
      month assessment and/or experiencing a new disease occurrence, demonstrated by cystoscopy and&#xD;
      biopsy, and/or in whom extra-bladder involvement is suggested by a positive upper tract&#xD;
      washes result will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper tract imaging (CT-IVU imaging is recommended, IVU if CT not available) will be&#xD;
      performed at 12 months from the first study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended treatment and follow-up period For longer-term disease-free-survival data collection&#xD;
      purposes, patients free of tumor at the end of the study will be offered to continue&#xD;
      receiving one Synergo® RITE + MMC treatment every 8 weeks. Each such treatment will last&#xD;
      about 60 minutes and will consist of two 30-minute cycles with 40 mg MMC/50 ml sterile water&#xD;
      for injection, each cycle. These treatments will be given until the end of 24 months after&#xD;
      the patient's first induction treatment. See table 2 for details on the extended treatment&#xD;
      and follow-up.&#xD;

                  maintenance or re-induction at 3 months due to either persistent or rapidly&#xD;
                  recurrent disease, or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  experience a worsening in NMIBC state following initial BCG therapy presenting&#xD;
                  with a new NMIBC instance, other than TaLG.&#xD;
