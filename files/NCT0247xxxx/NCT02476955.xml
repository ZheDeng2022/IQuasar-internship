  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1b, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 092 administered in&#xD;
      combination with carboplatin plus paclitaxel (Carboplatin Plus Paclitaxel Arm) or in&#xD;
      combination with paclitaxel alone (Paclitaxel Arm), in subjects with advanced, inoperable&#xD;
      metastatic and/or recurrent solid tumors, or in combination with anastrozole (Anastrozole&#xD;
      Arm) in subjects with ovarian or endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment in the Carboplatin plus Paclitaxel Arm and Paclitaxel Alone Arm is now closed.&#xD;
      Enrollment in the Expansion Cohort for the Anastrozole Arm continues for patients with&#xD;
      Endometrial cancer.&#xD;
