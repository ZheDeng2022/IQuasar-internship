  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BPI-9016M is a novel, highly potent and selective small-molecule inhibitor of c-Met/Axl&#xD;
      kinase. In preclinical studies, it demonstrated strong activity in vitro and in vivo against&#xD;
      c-Met/Axl kinase and its downstream signaling targets, and inhibited tumor cell growth. This&#xD;
      first-in-human study is conducted to assess the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and preliminary&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of BPI-9016M with single doses and multiple doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ia study, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation study of BPI-9016M&#xD;
      administered orally once daily (QD) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors.The study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      single dose and multiple doses of BPI-9016M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed up for adverse events during the study treatment and 28 days&#xD;
      after the last dose of study drug. Subjects of this study will be permitted to continue&#xD;
      therapy only when BPI-9016M is well tolerated, and tumor response or stable disease is seen.&#xD;
