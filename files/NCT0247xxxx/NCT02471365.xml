      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - In a lifetime, a person may encounter tens of thousands of chemicals used as ingredients in&#xD;
      the products they buy. It s not easy to measure them because the companies that sell the&#xD;
      products don t have to tell the exact chemical ingredients. Researchers want to compare how&#xD;
      existing methods (e.g., surveys and models) measure exposure to chemicals in personal care&#xD;
      and household products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To test and improve the ways that studies gather data about contact with chemicals found in&#xD;
      consumer products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy women volunteers ages 35 74 who use at least 15 consumer products a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, pregnancy test, smoking test, and&#xD;
           blood sample. They will answer questions about their homes and products they use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participation will last about 30 hours over 12 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Place air samplers inside and outside participants homes for 10 days. One sampler will&#xD;
           need to be plugged into an electrical outlet. It will make a low, continuous sound while&#xD;
           in operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect house dust samples and record all consumer products in the house.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit the house daily to collect samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Give a blood sample at a clinic twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collect all urine voids for 10 days. They will label it and put it in a special cooler.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Wear 4 small devices that measure air pollution, chemicals, location, and activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record what they eat and what consumer products they use. They will write these in a&#xD;
           diary and &lt;TAB&gt;photograph them on an iPhone provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On day 2 of the study, they will collect a duplicate sample of what they eat.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Take iPhone videos of their use of certain products.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Answer questions about chemical ingredients in their personal care products.&#xD;

      Research to advance the characterization of environmental and chemical exposures through&#xD;
      improved exposure assessments, at both the individual and population levels, is a research&#xD;
      priority identified in the Strategic Research Action Plan for the U.S. Environmental&#xD;
      Protection Agency (EPA) s Chemical Safety for Sustainability (CSS) program (EPA 2012) and the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) Strategic Plan for 2012-2017&#xD;
      (NIEHS 2012). Leading up to the Strategic Plan, specific research priorities related to&#xD;
      exposure assessment were identified in the 2011 NIEHS workshop Advancing Research on&#xD;
      Mixtures: New Perspectives and Approaches for Predicting Adverse Human Health Effects&quot;,&#xD;
&#xD;
      including the need to evaluate the utility of existing instruments that classify or quantify&#xD;
      exposures, develop better tools to improve exposure assessment, and to better understand the&#xD;
      nature of combined exposures (e.g., mixtures). This project will inform research priorities&#xD;
      identified in the NIEHS strategic plan and several specific research needs discussed during&#xD;
      the 2011 NIEHS workshop on mixtures, with a focus on assessing exposures from personal care&#xD;
      and household products:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate current exposure assessment technologies, including questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop better models that link source with behavior to predict exposure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analyze combined exposures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate usefulness of commercially available product use/marketing databases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate prediction models&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterize behavior that impact exposures using new technologies (iPad/internet use)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personal care products (PCPs) and other household/consumer products are of particular&#xD;
      interest because of the efficiency of their delivery and widespread use. Exposure to&#xD;
      chemicals in PCPs can result through either direct or indirect routes of contact depending on&#xD;
      the use of the product (Dodson 2012; Koniecki et al. 2011; Rudel et al. 2003; Schettler 2006;&#xD;
      Weschler and Nazaroff 2014). Health concerns exist about some chemicals found in PCPs and&#xD;
      household setting. Over the course of a lifetime, the average consumer may encounter tens of&#xD;
      thousands of chemicals used as ingredients in consumer products, many of which are&#xD;
      proprietary; thus, getting a complete picture of the human exposome is challenging. Given the&#xD;
      large number of co-occurring chemicals in these products, new strategies, tools, and&#xD;
&#xD;
      techniques need to be developed and evaluated for their utility in assessing exposure to the&#xD;
      multitude (tens of thousands) of chemicals representing the reality of exposure. Innovative&#xD;
      tools need to be evaluated for their potential contributions to exposure assessment through&#xD;
      rapid, cost-efficient methods which allow the simultaneous measurement of multiple chemical&#xD;
      agents and gathering of contextual information to inform exposure reduction. These integrated&#xD;
      tools and techniques can then be used to refine measurement and predictive modeling methods&#xD;
      that support high throughput chemical analysis and exposure assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research concept represents collaboration between NIEHS (Division of the&#xD;
      National Toxicology Program, Division of Intramural Research, and the Clinical Research Unit)&#xD;
      and the EPA Office ofResearch and Development (ORD). The partnership includes co- funding&#xD;
      with EPA, the sharing of equipment and expertise, and the use of EPA field teams for&#xD;
      extensive collection of exposure information.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Individuals must be a non-smoker living in a non-smoking home. Individuals who are&#xD;
             former smokers or live with a former smoker must be at least one year smoke free at&#xD;
             the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals must be non-pregnant and non-nursing at the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals will not be selected for specific preexisting health conditions but will&#xD;
             be excluded if any of the conditions described in Section 5.2 (EXCL 5) are present at&#xD;
             the time of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who spend a majority of their time in the home each day will be recruited&#xD;
             for this study. This includes individuals who work from home, are stay-at-home&#xD;
             caretakers, retired, unemployed, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals must use a high number of consumer products. A high consumer product user&#xD;
             is someone who uses more than a certain number of products (e.g., 15 or more products&#xD;
             a day). This number will be finalized following the completion of a separating&#xD;
             screening activity by NIEHS under a separate IRB protocol, and will be defined prior&#xD;
             to enrollment of participants in the study.&#xD;
