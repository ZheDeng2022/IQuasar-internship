    <textblock>
      In cases of permanent tooth avulsion, it is widely accepted that some necrosis always occurs&#xD;
      after avulsion injury. If the pulp tissue does not revascularize or if endodontic therapy is&#xD;
      not performed, the pulp space can become infected. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a second&#xD;
      generation platelet concentrate that allows the clinician to obtain fibrin membranes enriched&#xD;
      with platelets and growth factors from an anticoagulant-free blood harvest. Clinical&#xD;
      relevance of PRF and revascularization has been demonstrated in several case studies of&#xD;
      avulsion. To date no human clinical trials have been performed evaluating the effectiveness&#xD;
      of PRF on pulpal revascularization after reimplantation and its benefits in limiting&#xD;
      inflammation. The following study consists of two phases: Phase 1: An in vitro model&#xD;
      evaluating the effects of PRF in limiting inflammatory response of pdl cell cultures in the&#xD;
      presence of an inflammatory mediators. Phase 2: An in vivo model utilizing mature teeth&#xD;
      previously treatment planned for extraction, treating with PRF, reimplanting teeth and&#xD;
      following for three to four months before extracting and performing histological analysis. If&#xD;
      PRF is capable of promoting revascularization in mature teeth the potential benefits extend&#xD;
      to limiting the need for endodontic therapy following mature tooth avulsion, potential for&#xD;
      mature tooth transplantation in situations of congenitally missing teeth, and utilization of&#xD;
      PRF in endodontic revascularization therapy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      When a tooth is avulsed, it is separated from its socket causing damage to the attachment&#xD;
      apparatus. The periodontal ligament (pdl) is a group of specialized connective tissue fibers&#xD;
      that attaches the cementum of the root (outer layer) to the alveolar bone. Avulsion can cause&#xD;
      damage to the pdl and possible cemental tears. If the periodontal ligament is left attached&#xD;
      to the root and minimal time lapse occurs damage to the tissues is usually limited. In these&#xD;
      cases, reimplantation is a widely accepted treatment; however the long term success of an&#xD;
      avulsed tooth is dependent on various factors. When excessive drying occurs prior to&#xD;
      re-implantation, a severe inflammatory response is elicited directly on the root surface&#xD;
      which may result in osseous replacement or replacement resorption. Some necrosis always&#xD;
      occurs after avulsion injury, and while the necrotic pulp is of little consequence, this&#xD;
      necrotic tissue is at high risk for bacterial contamination. If the pulp tissue does not&#xD;
      revascularize or if endodontic therapy is not performed, the pulp space can become infected.&#xD;
      It has been suggested that treatment strategies should attempt to limit peri-radicular&#xD;
      inflammation therefore promoting favorable cemental healing and limiting unfavorable osseous&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is a second generation platelet concentrate that allows the&#xD;
      clinician to obtain fibrin membranes enriched with platelets and growth factors from an&#xD;
      anticoagulant-free blood harvest and without the addition of artificial biochemical&#xD;
      modification. PRF has demonstrated clinical relevance through its ability to stimulate cell&#xD;
      proliferation of osteoblasts, gingival fibroblasts, and periodontal ligament (PDL) cells. In&#xD;
      addition, PRF has been shown to limit epithelial cell growth therefore promoting connective&#xD;
      tissue and alveolar bone regeneration and inhibiting epithelial proliferation. These&#xD;
      properties make it a favorable product for surgical procedures requiring micro&#xD;
      vascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro studies with PRF and canine dental pulp cells demonstrate PRF's ability to promote&#xD;
      chemotaxis and proliferation of the pulp cells and contributed to pulp repair. When PRF was&#xD;
      combined with human dental pulp cells derived from extracted third molars it did not&#xD;
      interfere with vitality and stimulated proliferation and differentiation. Additionally it&#xD;
      upregulated the expression of osteoprotegerin and alkaline phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Animal models evaluated PRF granules combined with human pdl stem cells and placed them on&#xD;
      the root surface of freshly extracted canine teeth. The teeth were then reimplanted and&#xD;
      evaluated histologically after a healing phase. A regeneration of the PDL-like tissue and&#xD;
      reduction in ankylosis and inflammation were noted in animals with the PRF granules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance of PRF and revascularization has been demonstrated in several case studies&#xD;
      of avulsion. These case studies utilized a general protocol of minimally instrumenting the&#xD;
      avulsed tooth. One study performed a 3 mm resection of the root apex followed by minimal&#xD;
      instrumentation of the canal. Blood is then drawn from the patient and PRF is prepared via&#xD;
      Choukroun's method. The PRF is then placed on the root surface and condensed into the canal.&#xD;
      The tooth was then reimplanted, splinted, and the patient followed for up to 24 months. The&#xD;
      tooth tested vital to thermal and percussion testing and radiographically did not show signs&#xD;
      of replacement resorption or inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date no human studies have been performed evaluating the effectiveness of PRF on pulpal&#xD;
      revascularization after reimplantation and its benefits in limiting inflammation.&#xD;
      Additionally, only histological evidence of the benefits of PRF has been demonstrated in&#xD;
      animal models. If PRF is capable of promoting revascularization in mature teeth the potential&#xD;
      benefits extend to limiting the need for endodontic therapy following mature tooth avulsion,&#xD;
      potential for mature tooth transplantation in situations of congenitally missing teeth, and&#xD;
      utilization of PRF in endodontic revascularization therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following research would consist of two phases: Phase 1. An in vitro model evaluating the&#xD;
      effects of PRF in limiting inflammatory response of pulp and pdl cell cultures in the&#xD;
      presence of an inflammatory mediators. Phase 2. An in vivo model utilizing mature teeth&#xD;
      previously treatment planned for extraction, treating in accordance to the procedure&#xD;
      documented by one group, reimplanting teeth and following for three to four months before&#xD;
      extracting and performing histological analysis.&#xD;
