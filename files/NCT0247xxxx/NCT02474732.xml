      FDA requires that the user's guide be provided with any over-the-counter (OTC) medical&#xD;
      device. It is beneficial to demonstrate that the user's guide for a new medical device is&#xD;
      broadly comprehensible where the device will be provided without prescription and direct&#xD;
      physician counseling. Therefore, a population of subjects will be tested to determine whether&#xD;
      they can properly use the BeActive Brace device after reading the user's guide.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the ability of approximately 40&#xD;
      literate adults to understand the label instructions for deploying the Beactive(r) Brace&#xD;
      device as described in the user's guide, without physician direction. The primary endpoint of&#xD;
      this clinical trial is the successful completion of all essential tasks required for&#xD;
      Beactive(r) Brace deployment by a subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be seated at a table facing a video camera, so Investigators and the Sponsor&#xD;
      may observe the subject via closed circuit television. Subjects will be given the user's&#xD;
      guide for the Beactive(r) Brace device. The subject will then be asked to deploy the&#xD;
      Beactive(r) Brace device according to their understanding following the user's guide. For&#xD;
      this clinical trial, deploying is defined as completing the following two tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Applying the Beactive(r) Brace device to the knee area according to the user's guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correctly positioning the pressure pad according to the user's guide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tasks can be completed with no intervention, the subject would be judged to have a&#xD;
      &quot;comprehensive&quot; level of success. If intervention was required and helpful, and the subject&#xD;
      was able to complete all essential tasks, the level of success would be judged &quot;sufficient.&quot;&#xD;
      The steps where intervention took place will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention will be allowed and documented if subjects have difficulty with a specific task.&#xD;
      The subject will raise their hand and a technician will be available for assistance. The&#xD;
      frequency and type of intervention will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Study Coordinator will complete an observer questionnaire for each subject based on their&#xD;
      observation of each subject's ability to use the Beactive device correctly. Each subject will&#xD;
      complete a user questionnaire, which will confirm their understanding of the user's guide and&#xD;
      give them the opportunity to provide feedback and suggestions for improving the user's guide.&#xD;
