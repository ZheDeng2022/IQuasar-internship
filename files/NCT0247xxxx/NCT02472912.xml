      Double-Blind, 3-Way Parallel Study to Compare the Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, 3-way parallel study in 270 healthy adult&#xD;
      male and female subjects. During this study, the PK bioequivalence of BMO-2, containing 40 mg&#xD;
      adalimumab, will be compared to EU licensed Humira® (EU-Humira® ) (40 mg) and US licensed&#xD;
      Humira® (US-Humira® ) (40 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by body weight (weight categories of 60.0-79.9 kg and&#xD;
      80.0-95.0 kg). After randomization, subjects will receive one of the following treatments: a&#xD;
      single sc injection of 40 mg BMO-2, an equivalent sc injection of EU-Humira® (40 mg), or an&#xD;
      equivalent sc injection of US-Humira® (40 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers participation in the study is expected to finish with the follow-up visit,&#xD;
      scheduled 70 days after the injection of study drug.&#xD;
