  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study seeks to gain new knowledge about the addition of a carefully targeted&#xD;
      &quot;boost&quot; dose of radiation as a possible treatment for recurrent or metastatic head or neck&#xD;
      cancer. The name of the study intervention involved in this study is stereotactic body&#xD;
      radiotherapy, which is a way of delivering radiation in a more precisely targeted way and&#xD;
      with a higher dose than conventional radiotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational&#xD;
      intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational&#xD;
      intervention to use for further studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the intervention is&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation was developed as imaging and treatment capabilities on radiation&#xD;
      treatment machines became more accurate and more precise. Like standard radiation therapy,&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation kills tumor cells by causing small breaks in the DNA of these&#xD;
      cells. In this research study, the investigators are looking for the highest dose of the&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation that can be given safely either alone, or as a 'boost dose' in&#xD;
      combination with standard radiation and chemotherapy. Because stereotactic radiation is so&#xD;
      precise, the investigators are testing whether it can be used to increase the dose to the&#xD;
      primary tumor without significantly increasing the side effects; the goal is to improve the&#xD;
      likelihood of killing the tumor and, in some cases, to complete the course of radiation in a&#xD;
      shorter amount of time.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must meet the following criteria on screening examination to be eligible&#xD;
             to participate in the study:&#xD;

          -  Participants must have a pathologic cancer diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No other active malignancy within the past 2 years, except for non-melanoma skin&#xD;
             cancers or carcinoma in situ of the cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Only patients 18 years and older are eligible. There is no upper age limit but the&#xD;
             patients must be able to medically tolerate the regimen. Adverse event data are&#xD;
             currently unavailable on the use of SBRT for participants &lt; 18 years of age, and thus&#xD;
             children are excluded from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤2 (see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 1 (reirradiation in patients with head and neck cancers with gross unresectable&#xD;
             disease):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of radiation to the head and neck area (defined as above the clavicles)&#xD;
             greater than 6 months previous&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathologically proven recurrent disease or a second primary (squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the head and neck, nasopharyngeal cancer, salivary gland cancer, or thyroid cancer)&#xD;
             within the head and neck region, deemed to be unresectable or resected with gross&#xD;
             residual disease remaining (determined by either operative/pathology report or&#xD;
             post-surgical imaging)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL (microliter)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; ↓1,500/mcL (microliter)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥100,000/mcL (microliter)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  aspartate aminotransferase (AST (SGOT))/alanine aminotransferase (ALT (SGPT)) ≤&#xD;
                  2.5 x institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine &lt; 2 x upper limit of normal (ULN) or creatinine clearance ≥45&#xD;
                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels above institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2 (patients with metastatic disease with targetable lesions within the head and&#xD;
             neck):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pathologically proven solid tumor (lymphomas excluded) with evidence of&#xD;
                  metastatic disease (including nodal disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Measurable disease within the head and neck region, defined as at least one&#xD;
                  lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
                  diameter to be recorded) as ≥10 mm and &lt; 60 mm with neck CT scan. See section 10&#xD;
                  for the evaluation of measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be&#xD;
             eligible for admission into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SBRT target size &gt; 6 cm in maximum diameter (or greater than 100 cc in volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because radiotherapy has the potential for&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with SBRT,&#xD;
             breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the&#xD;
             following circumstances: if they have been disease-free for at least 2 years and are&#xD;
             deemed by the investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; or if&#xD;
             diagnosed and treated within the past 2 years for cervical cancer in situ or basal&#xD;
             cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because&#xD;
             of the potential for interaction between conventional radiotherapy, SBRT and&#xD;
             antiretroviral medications. In addition, these individuals are at increased risk of&#xD;
             lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies&#xD;
             will be undertaken in participants receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are planned to receive the following medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Granulocyte stimulating factor (G-CSF)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bevacizumab&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cyclosporine&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Anti-tumor necrosis factor agents&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amifostine&#xD;
