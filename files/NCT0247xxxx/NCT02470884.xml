      A prospective multi-center, single arm feasibility study to assess the safety and performance&#xD;
      of the Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold is a device/drug combination product&#xD;
      providing a mechanical structure for vascular lumen support (the scaffold component) and a&#xD;
      pharmacological agent (everolimus) targeted toward reducing the injury response that leads to&#xD;
      restenosis after scaffold implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Boston Scientific Fully Absorbable Scaffold is intended to improve the luminal diameter&#xD;
      in subjects with ischemic heart disease due to de novo native coronary artery target lesions&#xD;
      ≤ 12 mm in length with reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.75 mm and ≤ 3.25 mm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are candidates for PCI for the treatment of a de novo native coronary artery&#xD;
      lesion will be screened according to the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria. Subjects&#xD;
      will be considered enrolled once they have signed the informed consent form and an attempt&#xD;
      has been made to implant the fully absorbable study scaffold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the index procedure 1 target lesion in a de novo native coronary artery may be&#xD;
      treated. Up to 1 non-target lesion in a separate epicardial vessel may be treated with a&#xD;
      commercially approved DES&#xD;
