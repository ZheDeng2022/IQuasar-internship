    <textblock>
      Several studies were searched the preventive measures of bed sores. Although repositioning is&#xD;
      the mainstay in most preventive measures, there is no evidence to recommend specific turning&#xD;
      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to comparative the impact of the two points repositioning in lateral&#xD;
      lying position on the right and left versus the traditional three points repositioning on the&#xD;
      right, back, and left in the occurrence of bed sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted on 150 patients admitted to the critical care department of&#xD;
      Alexandria Main University Hospital after obtaining an informed consent from their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators excluded patients who: have active or healed bed sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided into two groups by allocated randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: traditional three points rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: two points rotation.&#xD;

      Several studies were searched the preventive measures of bed sores. Although repositioning is&#xD;

      regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study was designed to evaluate the comparative impact of the two points&#xD;
      repositioning in lateral lying position on the right and left versus the traditional three&#xD;
      points repositioning on the right, back, and left in the occurrence of bed sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was conducted on 150 patients admitted to the critical care department of&#xD;
      Alexandria Main University Hospital after obtaining an informed consent from their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators excluded patients who: have active or healed bed sores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided into two groups by allocated randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1: traditional three points rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: two points rotation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied patients were subjected to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete history taking, physical examination, primary ICU diagnosis, routine laboratory&#xD;
      investigation and recording Glasgaw coma scale (GCS), use of sedation, vasopressors and&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in group 1 nursed by traditional protocol [ two hours on the right side in 30 degree&#xD;
      lateral position, two hours on the back and two hours on the left side in 30 degree lateral&#xD;
      position] Patients in group 2 nursed in lateral position with 30 degree two hours on the&#xD;
      right and two hours on the left with elevation of the head of bed by 30 degree in the two&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      both groups were monitored for bed sores incidence, timing and sites of occurence&#xD;
