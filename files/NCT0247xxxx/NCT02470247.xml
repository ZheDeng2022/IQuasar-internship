  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic imaging for vascular investigations and endovascular procedures frequently require&#xD;
      the use of contrast medium. Besides contrast medium-induced hypersensitivity, an acute kidney&#xD;
      injury can appear: the contrast-induced nephropathy (NPCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NPCI is associated with an increase of patients' morbidity and mortality. One of the&#xD;
      conventional methods proposed to limit this NPCI is an oral administration of&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) associated with hydration performed 12 hours before and 12 hours after&#xD;
      the injection. However, in some patients this method cannot be performed due to a high risk&#xD;
      of heart failure although they are generally at high risk of NPCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown, in a randomized trial, that remote ischemic preconditioning&#xD;
      (several cycles of upper-arm ischemia-reperfusion with a pressure cuff inflator) associated&#xD;
      with hydratation and NAC reduced the occurrence of NPCI after a coronary angiography as&#xD;
      compared with NAC and hydration only. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesized that the use of RIPC in patients at high risk of NPCI and who cannot receive&#xD;
      NAC and hydratation (e.g. patients with aortic stenosis and eligible for Transcatheter Aortic&#xD;
      Valve Implantation (TAVI)) could be promising.&#xD;

      Study design :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, single-center, randomized, controlled, single-blind, with RIPC procedure&#xD;
      (Pre-CI) versus &quot;SHAM&quot; ischemic preconditioning (SHAM Pre -CI) (control). This test will&#xD;
      follow the CONSORT Statement (http://www.consort-statement.org/).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind trial, assessing the incidence of NPCI (after&#xD;
      a CTA ) between two group of patients, one receiving RIPC procedure and the other group&#xD;
      receiving a &quot;SHAM&quot; RIPC (control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIPC is accomplished by performing 4 cycles of alternating 5-minute inflation and 5-minute&#xD;
      deflation of a standard upper-arm blood pressure cuff, to induce transient and repetitive arm&#xD;
      ischemia and reperfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RIPC will be started just before the CTA, and the time between the last inflation cycle and&#xD;
      the beginning of the CTA will be less than 45 minutes. The &quot;SHAM&quot; RIPC will be carried out&#xD;
      with the same number of cycles that the RIPC but cuff will be inflated to the diastolic&#xD;
      pressure of the subject and the cuff will be deflated to10 mmHg in order to maintain a non-&#xD;
      ischemic compression (blind patient protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) in preventing&#xD;
      contrast-induced nephropathy (NPCI) after injected CT scanner in patients at high risk of&#xD;
      NPCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effects of RIPC on a second marker of renal failure (Cystatin C ) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the RIPC (role of oxidative&#xD;
           stress ; for the first 40 patients) ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the effect of RIPC on renal function after a second injection of&#xD;
           contrast-medium during coronary angiography performed 2 to 4 days after the injected CTA&#xD;
           ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess the tolerance of RIPC procedure ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the impact on mortality at 6 months.&#xD;
