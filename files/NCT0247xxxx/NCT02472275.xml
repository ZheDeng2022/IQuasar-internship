    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of multitargeted tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor PLX3397 (PLX3397) when given together with radiation therapy and antihormone&#xD;
      therapy in treating patients with prostate cancer that is at intermediate or high risk of&#xD;
      spreading. Multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth, and may also help the radiation&#xD;
      therapy work better. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Androgens&#xD;
      can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as leuprolide&#xD;
      acetate, goserelin acetate, or degarelix, may lessen the amount of androgens made by the&#xD;
      body. Giving multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 with radiation therapy and&#xD;
      antihormone therapy may be a better treatment for prostate cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To conduct a phase I, dose escalation trial with a primary objective of establishing the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting toxicity (DLT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the effects of radiation therapy (RT), androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), and&#xD;
      PLX3397 (at its MTD) on tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the prostate biopsy after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor PLX3397 orally (PO) twice daily&#xD;
      (BID) for 6 months, undergo radiation therapy for 2 months daily (Monday-Friday) beginning at&#xD;
      month 3, and undergo ADT with leuprolide acetate, goserelin acetate, or degarelix injections&#xD;
      in any month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 20-30 days and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks thereafter.&#xD;
