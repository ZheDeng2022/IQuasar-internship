    <textblock>
      Youth depression is a debilitating disorder that exacts enormous social, economic and&#xD;
      personal cost. Unfortunately, treatments which are conventionally used to treat adult&#xD;
      depression have often modest to no efficacy in youth and have side effects. Thus, there is a&#xD;
      tremendous imperative to develop new treatments for youth depression. Investigators propose&#xD;
      to examine the efficacy of a short form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) for youth depression and examine its biological targets. This will be the first study&#xD;
      examining the efficacy of a short rTMS protocol in youth diagnosed with depression who fail&#xD;
      responding to or are intolerable to antidepressants. If the results are positive,&#xD;
      investigators will have identified a novel treatment that may be both more efficacious,&#xD;
      better tolerated and more acceptable treatment for youth depression. Finally, identifying the&#xD;
      biological mechanisms leading to treatment efficacy will lead to more personalized treatments&#xD;
      for youth depression and will be groundbreaking vis Ã  vis understanding the mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in this illness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The highest rates of depression are reported in youth 16-24 years of age and youth depression&#xD;
      is a significant source of burden to the individual, their families, and to society.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, current treatments (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), which are&#xD;
      conventionally used to treat depression often have modest and sometimes no efficacy in youth.&#xD;
      Also, accumulating evidence suggests that these medications may increase suicidal thoughts in&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults below the age of 24. In addition to pharmacological treatments,&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used alone or in combination with medications for&#xD;
      treating depression in this age group. Although randomized controlled trials and practice&#xD;
      guidelines support the use of CBT alone and CBT with an antidepressant medication for&#xD;
      adolescent depression, a large minority of adolescents do not respond to either treatment&#xD;
      approaches.Thus, there is a tremendous imperative to develop new treatments for youth&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators propose to examine the efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (rTMS) for youth depression. There are several reasons for pursuing this treatment: 1) rTMS&#xD;
      applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a cortical region implicated in&#xD;
      pathophysiology of depression, is a safe and FDA approved treatment for adults with&#xD;
      medication-resistant depression; 2) Young age is suggested to be a good predictor of response&#xD;
      to rTMS treatment; 3) rTMS trials in adolescence and youth with medication resistant&#xD;
      depression provide evidence that rTMS is a safe efficacious and well tolerated treatment for&#xD;
      adolescents that does not increase suicidal thoughts. Additionally, recently rTMS parameter&#xD;
      developments such as theta burst stimulation (i.e., TBS) provide compelling evidence for&#xD;
      efficacy in less of the time it takes to administer conventional rTMS, thus lowering the&#xD;
      overall costs and increasing the number of patients that can be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is imperative that research investigate treatment related biological mechanisms, such that&#xD;
      increases in understanding can lead to enhanced efficacy. Investigators will utilize a novel&#xD;
      and powerful in vivo brain mapping technique of TMS combined with electroencephalography&#xD;
      (TMS-EEG) that permits non-invasive assessment of inhibitory, connectivity and plasticity&#xD;
      mechanisms from the DLPFC. The pathophysiology of depression has been linked to impairment in&#xD;
      neural plasticity and connectivity and neural and behavioral inhibition - mechanisms that can&#xD;
      be measured through TMS-EEG and maybe changed by TBS treatment. Therefore, investigating the&#xD;
      association between TBS-related changes in plasticity, connectivity and inhibition may be key&#xD;
      to understanding both the treatment mechanisms involved in youth depression and predictors of&#xD;
      treatment response in this disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the specific aims in this study are twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To examine the efficacy of TBS applied to the DLPFC for youth depression, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify biological targets and predictors of response to TBS applied to the DLPFC&#xD;
           for youth depression.&#xD;
