      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relative bioavailability and&#xD;
      absorption/kinetic profile of red raspberry polyphenols consumed with a meal and further to&#xD;
      determine the relationship of these findings on meal-associated metabolic- oxidative- and&#xD;
      inflammatory- responses in relatively insulin sensitive and insulin resistant individuals.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, 3-arm, diet-controlled, cross-over study using a&#xD;
      multi-sampling postprandial paradigm to evaluate the relative bioavailability and&#xD;
      absorption/kinetic profile of red raspberry polyphenols consumed with a typical American&#xD;
      breakfast meal and further to determine the relationship of these findings on meal-associated&#xD;
      metabolic- oxidative- and inflammatory- responses in relatively insulin sensitive and insulin&#xD;
      resistant individuals. A planned sample size of 24 will be recruited into the study. This&#xD;
      study will require one initial screening visit, 1 pre-study visit, and 3 study visits. This&#xD;
      study will take 4-6 weeks per subject to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will initiate with a screening visit, which will last for about 1-1.5 hours and&#xD;
      include measuring subjects' height, weight, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate as well as collecting&#xD;
      general eating, health and exercise habits via questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If willing and eligible to participate, a 3-day food record (2 weekdays and 1 weekend) will&#xD;
      be given to be completed over the following week to assess subject's baseline dietary intake&#xD;
      patterns. Information will be used to help subjects adopt a relatively low polyphenolic diet&#xD;
      over the course of the study. Prior to each postprandial study visit, a dinner meal will be&#xD;
      provided the day before the study visit to help control for visit to visit variability in due&#xD;
      to differences in meals the night before the study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will arrive at the center in a fasting state for at least 10 hours, well hydrated&#xD;
      and rested (with normal sleep). Each study visit will require blood draws throughout the&#xD;
      visit. After evaluation of subject's health status (via anthropometric, vital sign and blood&#xD;
      glucose measurements and in-person interview), a qualified health professional will place a&#xD;
      catheter in subject's arm for the purpose of multiple blood sample collections and take the&#xD;
      initial blood draw in the fasting state. Each subject will be randomized to receive 1 of 3&#xD;
      meal treatments: Control meal (0 g red raspberry), red raspberry meal 1 [~125 g fresh weight&#xD;
      (1 cup equivalent)] or red raspberry meal 2 [~250 g fresh weight (2 cup equivalent)], based&#xD;
      on randomization sequence on 3 Study Day Visits. At each Study visit, after the first blood&#xD;
      draw (0 h), subjects will be served with the standard breakfast meal (a moderate to high&#xD;
      fat/carbohydrate) along with fruit variable based on the order randomly selected by computer&#xD;
      generated sequence. From this point forward, blood collection will occur at the following&#xD;
      time points: 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, 4 h, 5 h, 6 h, 6.5 h, 7 h, 8 h and 24 h to test for&#xD;
      polyphenol metabolites and other metabolic markers. After the 6h blood draw, a standardized&#xD;
      lunch meal (polyphenol free) will be provided to subjects. After the 8 h blood draw, the&#xD;
      catheter will be removed from subjects arm. Subject will be provided with a dinner meal (low&#xD;
      polyphenol) to take home and asked not to consume anything else other than the provided&#xD;
      dinner meal except plain water. Subject will be scheduled to come back the next morning for&#xD;
      the 24 h blood sample collection.&#xD;
