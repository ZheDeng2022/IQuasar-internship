      Besides maternal hyperglycemia, a strong link between maternal pregravid weight/maternal&#xD;
      triglyceride(Tg) levels and fetal growth/childhood obesity/metabolic syndrome in offspring&#xD;
      has been demonstrated in largely Caucasian populations. This study aims to explore the link&#xD;
      between maternal hypertriglyceridemia and offspring health in Asians.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) worldwide is increasing, with&#xD;
      accelerated rates of obesity in women of child-bearing age, increasing maternal age and&#xD;
      improved survival of very low and high birth weight (BW) female offspring in modern times.&#xD;
      GDM prevalence rates are known to be higher in some Asian populations compared with Western&#xD;
      populations. The incidence rate amongst South Indians in India, and Malaysians in an urban&#xD;
      tertiary centre in Kuala Lumpur are 14 and 11.4% respectively while in Western populations&#xD;
      GDM only accounts for 2-9% of all pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now well-established that exposure to an intrauterine diabetic milieu, in both pregnant&#xD;
      women with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and those with GDM, imparts increased future risk of&#xD;
      diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease in offspring. Besides&#xD;
      maternal hyperglycemia, a strong link between maternal pregravid weight/maternal triglyceride&#xD;
      (Tg) levels and fetal growth/childhood obesity/metabolic syndrome in offspring has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in largely Caucasian populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanisms of the developmental origins of adult disease however are poorly understood.&#xD;
      The in utero environment via changes to the epigenome that do not involve alterations in DNA&#xD;
      sequence can exert stimulatory or inhibitory effects on fetal growth and adiposity6. It has&#xD;
      been proposed that a pathological metabolic milieu in utero results in fetal epigenetic&#xD;
      changes such as DNA methylation and histone modification, thus modulating biological&#xD;
      processes related to intrauterine development, such as gene expression, chromatin&#xD;
      accessibility, DNA replication, imprinting and human disease patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipotoxicity in adults is well-established to result in the development of insulin resistance&#xD;
      and pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction. Much emphasis has already been given to management of&#xD;
      maternal hyperglycemia during pregnancy. It is possible however that maternal&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia on the other hand will soon become a therapeutic target in the fight&#xD;
      against childhood diabetes and obesity. Normal pregnancy is associated with a physiological&#xD;
      increase in Tg from 10 weeks gestation onwards; with a 2-3 fold increase in serum Tg levels&#xD;
      by the 3rd trimester. These elevations can be attributed to enhanced hepatic production of&#xD;
      VLDL, increased intestinal absorption of dietary lipids, reduced clearance of Tg due to&#xD;
      decreased extra-hepatic lipoprotein lipase activity and reduced insulin sensitivity during&#xD;
      pregnancy. Even so, Tg levels during pregnancy are known to be higher in women with T2DM and&#xD;
      GDM when compared with healthy pregnant controls. Maternal hypertriglyceridemia independent&#xD;
      of maternal glucose has been linked with increased BW and fetal adiposity in offspring of&#xD;
      Caucasian women. This association has been shown to hold true in women with GDM as well as&#xD;
      those with Normal Glucose Tolerance (NGT) but risk factors for GDM. Maternal&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia has even been linked with pre-eclampsia. Indeed, the fact that Langer et&#xD;
      al, has demonstrated that insulin therapy results in lower macrosomia rates in obese GDM&#xD;
      women than diet therapy despite equivalent glycemic control seems to indicate that some other&#xD;
      metabolic target besides glucose which is modulated by insulin therapy is in play. It is&#xD;
      highly likely that this 'invisible' metabolic variable is maternal triglyceride.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining early predictors of development of metabolic syndrome (MS) in offspring will&#xD;
      enable targeted childhood intervention programs. In Western populations it has been&#xD;
      established that pregravid maternal BMI is a strong independent predictor of childhood&#xD;
      obesity/MS whereas birth weight and GDM alone are poor correlates of offspring obesity and&#xD;
      risk of metabolic syndrome. In Boney et al's cohort of Caucasian offspring who were evaluated&#xD;
      from age 6, for example, combination of large for gestational age (LGA) status and maternal&#xD;
      GDM was associated with OR of 10.4 of insulin resistance in offspring at age 11yrs and&#xD;
      increased prevalence of MS at any age. However the prevalence of MS in offspring was not&#xD;
      significantly different between offspring of mothers with NGT whether LGA/average for&#xD;
      gestational age (AGA), and AGA offspring of GDM mothers. Neither were maternal GDM alone and&#xD;
      LGA at birth independently associated with insulin resistance. Maternal obesity alone however&#xD;
      independently conferred an approximate increase in hazard of MS of 2-fold by 11 years of age&#xD;
      whereas GDM status alone did not. The risk of developing MS in GDM offspring diverged between&#xD;
      those with LGA and AGA status at age 7, so that by the time these children were 11 years old&#xD;
      the risk was 3.6 fold greater in LGA compared with AGA offspring of GDM mothers. Alarmingly&#xD;
      50% of GDM offspring who had LGA status at birth had at least 2 out of 4 criteria of MS at&#xD;
      any age-point between the ages of 6-11 years. These associations and relationships however&#xD;
      are less well-delineated in Asian populations. In addition, much of these data, including&#xD;
      those of Boney et al's are based on diagnostic definitions of GDM that have altered since the&#xD;
      evidence obtained from the HAPO study. It is possible that Malaysian GDM offspring may&#xD;
      develop a higher risk of metabolic syndrome at an age younger than 7 years and therefore&#xD;
      require intervention programs before the age of school attendance. Hence the need for studies&#xD;
      evaluating metabolic health in GDM offspring in the local Malaysian setting based on current&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria of GDM that will enable more effective intervention programs tailored to&#xD;
      the local setting and based on local data. There is also evidence in Caucasian and Hong Kong&#xD;
      Chinese offspring that in utero hyperinsulinemia is an independent predictor of abnormal&#xD;
      glucose tolerance in childhood. In Hong Kong Chinese offspring, cord blood insulin was very&#xD;
      predictive of abnormal glucose tolerance in children aged 8 years (OR 6.12) whereas BW &gt; 4kg&#xD;
      was not, indicating perhaps that in Asians as well, BW is a poor early predictor of risk of&#xD;
      metabolic dysfunction. Evidence indicates that dyslipidemia precedes development of&#xD;
      dysglycemia in offspring of GDM mothers but that there are subtle differences between&#xD;
      Caucasians and Asians with regards to which component of the lipid profile is impaired.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that hypertriglyceridemia is more prevalent than dysglycemia in Caucasian&#xD;
      GDM offspring aged 7-11 years , whereas low HDL is more common in Hong Kong Chinese GDM&#xD;
      offspring aged 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leptin is an established candidate gene for the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. It is&#xD;
      secreted by adipocytes and placental tissue and is involved in energy metabolism and insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity control. Leptin levels are increased in obesity, diabetes and pregnancy. 2hr&#xD;
      post-OGTT glucose levels have been shown to correlate with placental leptin gene methylation&#xD;
      levels in pregnant women with impaired glucose tolerance and increased placental leptin gene&#xD;
      methylation is associated with decreased fetal leptin gene expression. 2 hour plasma glucose&#xD;
      however only explains between 19-28% of DNA methylation variability at the leptin gene locus.&#xD;
      The relationship between maternal hypertriglyceridemia and placental leptin gene&#xD;
      methylation/leptin gene expression however has not been as well studied. It is possible that&#xD;
      maternal triglyceride levels are also associated with alterations in placental leptin gene&#xD;
      methylation thus leading to increased fetal adiposity. These changes in leptin gene DNA&#xD;
      methylation adaptations are potentially important as they may be part of the mechanism&#xD;
      whereby the in utero diabetic milieu results in fetal programming i.e. the induction of&#xD;
      permanent changes in cellular structure or function in offspring that result in adult&#xD;
      metabolic dysfunction/obesity. Plasma leptin is known to play an important neurotrophic role&#xD;
      in hypothalamic development. It has been hypothesized that alterations to leptin homeostasis&#xD;
      in utero may disrupt neuronal connections between nuclei that control energy balance and&#xD;
      appetite in the hypothalamus perhaps leading to obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance is a key feature of T2DM and has been implicated in the early pathogenesis&#xD;
      of the disease. Micro-RNA 29 has been implicated in the development of insulin resistance in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes in vitro. Micro-RNAs are small untranslated/non-coding RNAs that negatively&#xD;
      regulate mRNA translation. MiRNAs are involved in biological functions such as cell growth&#xD;
      and proliferation, development, differentiation, organogenesis and metabolism and therefore&#xD;
      have been linked to the pathogenesis of diabetes. In vitro studies with adipocyte cell lines&#xD;
      have shown that genetic upregulation and overexpression of the miRNA 29 (a,b,c) family occurs&#xD;
      in in the presence of hyperglycemia and that this blocks insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by&#xD;
      the adipocyte by inhibiting insulin signalling via the Akt pathway (and hence expression of&#xD;
      GLUT4 on the surface of the cell membrane). MiRNA 29 is also upregulated in skeletal muscle&#xD;
      in a rat model of insulin resistance. There is also evidence that miRNA 29 is elevated in the&#xD;
      presence of high NEFA levels and that this leads to skeletal muscle insulin resistance&#xD;
      (unpublished data, personal communication, Zierath IDF 2013). Skeletal muscle is the primary&#xD;
      site of glucose uptake postprandially, accounting for 75% of insulin-mediated glucose removal&#xD;
      from plasma. Elevated miR29 is also associated with reduced insulin secretion. Human in vivo&#xD;
      evidence linking miRNA 29 to insulin resistance and elevated NEFA is however lacking.&#xD;
      Pregnancy is a meta-inflammatory state that is associated with markedly elevated levels of&#xD;
      triglyceride, cytokines and NEFA in obese and dysglycemic women. It is possible that fetal&#xD;
      exposure to high NEFA levels in women with gestational diabetes will result in elevated fetal&#xD;
      miRNA 29 at birth which would be positively correlated with measures of insulin resistance&#xD;
      such as HOMA2-%S. Removal from this glucolipotoxic milieu with parturition could result in a&#xD;
      reduction in miRNA 29 with time and reduced insulin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is however a dearth of prospective large studies examining the relationship between&#xD;
      pregravid BMI/maternal hypertriglyceridemia in Asian mothers with GDM, and the metabolic&#xD;
      health of offspring at birth and during childhood. Limited data on Korean women with GDM and&#xD;
      Japanese pregnant women with NGT but positive diabetic screens is available but little&#xD;
      research has been carried out in Southeast Asia. In addition these Asian studies only&#xD;
      examined the link between maternal triglyceride and BW but not offspring body composition.&#xD;
      Maternal hypertriglyceridemia has been associated with increased BW and adiposity at birth,&#xD;
      but very few studies have looked at the association between maternal hypertriglyceridemia and&#xD;
      body weight/ adiposity during childhood in either Asian or Caucasian populations. There is no&#xD;
      consensus, even in western populations, on normal ranges of maternal triglyceride levels at&#xD;
      different stages of pregnancy. Given the well-established fact that adult adiposity is&#xD;
      greater in Asians compared with Caucasians of the same BMI, one could hypothesize that the&#xD;
      association between maternal hyperlipidemia and offspring adiposity and metabolic health will&#xD;
      be stronger in Asians. Asian mothers are known to be twice as likely to have GDM at a lower&#xD;
      BMI. Indeed there is already some evidence that the correlation between maternal triglyceride&#xD;
      levels and birth weight is stronger in Asian-born GDM women compared with Australian and&#xD;
      European-born mothers. It is also possible Malaysian mothers with BMI considered to be in the&#xD;
      non-obese range for Caucasian mothers i.e. 23-30 kg/m2 might have offspring with metabolic&#xD;
      dysfunction. These associations have not been studied in Malaysian GDM offspring of Malay,&#xD;
      Chinese and Indian descent. In recent times the trans-generational impact of maternal&#xD;
      nutrition, via fetal epigenetic changes, on the metabolic health of offspring has been&#xD;
      recognized. Given the differences, both current and historical, in socioeconomic development&#xD;
      that impact on population health/wealth between Western Europe/North America and countries&#xD;
      such as India, China and Malaysia it would be reasonable to postulate that maternal&#xD;
      hypertriglyceridemia may have a larger impact on the health of offspring in developing&#xD;
      nations with the sudden transition from poverty to relative wealth. It is worth evaluating&#xD;
      the relationship between maternal metabolic characteristics during pregnancy, and offspring&#xD;
      metabolic health, growth and development in Chinese and Indian Malaysians as these&#xD;
      relationships may differ from those derived from studies done in Korea, Japan, Hong Kong,&#xD;
      China and India given the markedly different historical trajectories of socio-economic&#xD;
      development amongst even Asian countries. Very little work has also been done amongst mothers&#xD;
      with GDM of Malay descent as this ethnic group is mainly only found in South-east Asia i.e.&#xD;
      Malaysia and Indonesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind, we designed a prospective observational longitudinal cohort study to&#xD;
      examine the associations of pregravid BMI and maternal hypertriglyceridemia in Asian GDM&#xD;
      mothers with placental epigenetic changes to the placental leptin gene and offspring&#xD;
      adiposity/metabolic function at birth/during childhood. We also aimed to evaluate cord blood&#xD;
      miRNA29 at birth and 6 months of age. This study will also evaluate 2nd and 3 rd trimester&#xD;
      serum triglyceride ranges in lean and obese Asian pregnant women with Normal Glucose&#xD;
      Tolerance. The study will require participation of researchers from 5 disciplines:&#xD;
      obstetrics, genetics, neonatology, paediatric endocrinology and adult endocrinology.&#xD;
