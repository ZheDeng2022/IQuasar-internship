    <textblock>
      Severe Alcoholic hepatitis, defined by modified Maddrey's Discriminant Function (DF) ≥32, is&#xD;
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality.(1,2) Of the various treatment modalities&#xD;
      evaluated for treatment of Severe Alcoholic hepatitis, corticosteroids have been the most&#xD;
      extensively studied.(1) Five out of 13 randomized controlled trials, and four out of 5&#xD;
      meta-analysis have shown a survival benefit with corticosteroids, especially in patients with&#xD;
      DF ≥32 and/ or encephalopathy.(1-4) However, the role of corticosteroids in Severe Alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis still remains controversial.(5-6) Corticosteroid therapy is not considered the&#xD;
      ideal option by most authors because their beneficial effect seems to be confined to a highly&#xD;
      select minority group in which the inhibitory effect of corticosteroids on liver inflammation&#xD;
      is not outweighed by side effects such as weakened defence against infections, anti-anabolic&#xD;
      effects, and possible ulcer promoting effects.(6) Corticosteroids are usually contraindicated&#xD;
      in those with DF &gt; 54 or MELD &gt;24 (7) .Also corticosteroids are contraindicated in those with&#xD;
      renal failure, gastro-intestinal bleed, pancreatitis and active sepsis. Therefore, there have&#xD;
      been constant efforts to evaluate new therapies for Severe Alcoholic hepatitis (SAH). In a&#xD;
      recent trial, combination of glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine was found to improve one&#xD;
      month survival in patients with Severe Alcoholic hepatitis, compared with glucocorticoids&#xD;
      alone. However, the 6 month survival similar in both the groups.(8) Human colostrum and&#xD;
      bovine colostrum are rich in protein, immunoglobulin, lactoferrin and growth factors. Recent&#xD;
      studies suggest that colostrum components, immunoglobulin and growth factor benefits&#xD;
      physically active person as well as in the treatment of autoimmune disorders. It is used for&#xD;
      the treatment of a wide variety of gastrointestinal conditions, including non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drug-induced gut injury, Helicobacter pylori infection, immune deficiency&#xD;
      related diarrhea as well as infective diarrhea.(9,10,11) It has also been sucessfully used to&#xD;
      significantly decrease the level of Endotoxemia - lower levels of Lipopolysaccharides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to compare the efficacy of bovine colostrum versus Placebo (Pasteurized milk powder)&#xD;
      alone in treatment of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Bovine Colostrum is rich in protein,&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, lactoferrin and growth factors. Recent studies suggest that Colostrum&#xD;
      components, immunoglobulin and growth factor benefits physically active person and in&#xD;
      treatment of autoimmune disorders. It is used for the treatment of a wide variety of&#xD;
      gastrointestinal conditions, including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced gut&#xD;
      injury, H pylori infection, immune deficiency related diarrhea as well as infective&#xD;
      diarrhea.(9) The guidelines by American College of Gastroenterology (10) and other authors&#xD;
      (11) have suggested that a combination of Corticosteroids and other drugs, which have&#xD;
      different mechanisms of action, may be more beneficial for reducing mortality in severe&#xD;
      alcoholic hepatitis. Hence, the investigators plan to compare the efficacy of combined&#xD;
      therapy of Corticosteroids and Bovine colostrum versus Corticosteroids alone in treatment of&#xD;
      severe alcoholic hepatitis.&#xD;

      Diagnosis: The diagnosis of Alcoholic hepatitis is made by the following criteria (12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Chronic active alcohol abuse - &gt;80 grams in males and &gt; 60 grams in females for &gt; 5 years&#xD;
      for developing Alcoholic Cirrhosis (13) Alcohol use will be evaluated with the AUDIT score&#xD;
      (EASL guidelines (14) II. Duration of jaundice &lt; 3 months III. Serum Bilirubin &gt;5 mg/dl IV.&#xD;
      AST/ALT &gt; 2:1 V. AST &lt;300 IU/L VI. Prolonged PTI/INR VII. Neutrophilicleucocytosis VIII.&#xD;
      Liver biopsy (Percutaneous or Transjugular). [Optional]&#xD;
&#xD;
      IAssessment of Severity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maddrey's Discriminant Function (15)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discriminant Function Index (DFI) was originally described by Maddrey and colleagues in a&#xD;
      placebo controlled study to assess the benefit of corticosteroids in patients with AH. The&#xD;
      original formula was 4.6 x prothrombin time (seconds) + serum Bilirubin (mg/dl). It was&#xD;
      observed that patients with a DFI &gt;93 and treated with placebo had a 28 day survival of 25%,&#xD;
      whereas those with a DFI &lt; 93 had a 100% survival. Subsequently this score was modified in&#xD;
      1986 and called Modified Discriminant Function (MDF). MDF = 4.6 x (Patient's PT - Control PT)&#xD;
      + serum bilirubin (mg/dl). Untreated patients with MDF &gt;32 had a survival of 68%. The&#xD;
      American College of Gastroenterology9 recommends that patients with MDF &gt; 32 and / or&#xD;
      Encephalopathy should be treated. The prothrombin time varies greatly depending on the&#xD;
      sensitivity of the thromboplastin reagent used for the test. This is the drawback of the MDF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MELD score (16)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The model for end stage liver disease (MELD) score predicts survival in patients with&#xD;
      cirrhosis and is used to prioritize patients for liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MELD score = (0.957 x log serum creatinine + 0.378 x log serum bilirubin + 1.120 x log INR +&#xD;
      0.643) x 10. The advantage of MELD score is the use of INR in place of PT. The INR is&#xD;
      comparable and uniform across laboratories worldwide. The American Association for Study of&#xD;
      Liver Diseases recommends that a MELD score &gt;20predicts SAH and should be the criterion for&#xD;
      initiating treatment. Serial monitoring of MELD score with a change of 2 or more points over&#xD;
      the first week on treatment has independently predicted mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GAHS score (17)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glasgow Alcoholic Hepatitis Score (GAHS) includes age, peripheral Total Leucocyte Count,&#xD;
      serum Bilirubin (at days 1 and 6-9), blood urea nitrogen and PT. It is a better predictor of&#xD;
      mortality at 28 days than MDF. GAHS score &gt; 9 has an extremely poor prognosis unless treated&#xD;
      with Corticosteroids. The drawback is lack of international validation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LILLE'S model (18) It is not traditionally used for predicting mortality of SAH. However, it&#xD;
      helps to predict mortality at 7 days of SAH patients on Corticosteroids .If the score is more&#xD;
      then 0.45 then Corticosteroids should be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis is made by the following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MDF&gt;32, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MELD&gt;20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Abstinence from alcohol This is the most important factor in predicting the outcome&#xD;
      after surviving the acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH) episode. The incidence of recidivism after&#xD;
      recovery from the first episode of AH varies from 10 - 70 %. Abstinence will be reinforced by&#xD;
      giving patient oral/enteral Baclofen (GABA B receptor agonist)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral nutrition is the preferred mode for supplemental nutrition. It is cheap, maintains&#xD;
      gut mucosal integrity. This in turn decreases the risk of bacterial and endotoxin&#xD;
      translocation resulting in less infections and endotoxemia. Pooled data from 5 RCT's of AH&#xD;
      have demonstrated improved nutritional status compared to standard dietary intake, but&#xD;
      without improving survival rates.19 The patient will be given 40k cal/kg diet along with&#xD;
      1.5gm/kg protiens, emphasizing breakfast and a night time snack with regular oral diet.&#xD;
      Frequent interval feeding will be given to improved nitrogen balance. B complex multivitamins&#xD;
      supplementation will be provided to all patients (EASL guidelines (14)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy of Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids&#xD;
&#xD;
      Corticosteroids are the most extensively used treatment for Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis. 6/13&#xD;
      Randomized Controlled Trials and 4/6 meta-analysis have supported the use of Corticosteroids&#xD;
      in Severe Alcoholic Hepatitis. The last meta-analysis of individual patient data from 5 high&#xD;
      quality Randomized Controlled Trials using Corticosteroids forSevere Alcoholic Hepatitis&#xD;
      concluded that Corticosteroids confers a 50% relative survival benefit at 1 month (85% versus&#xD;
      65% survival amongst those treated with Corticosteroids versus untreated patients). The&#xD;
      number of patients needed to treatedis 5 to reduce one death. Oral Prednisolone 40mg daily or&#xD;
      parenteral methylprednisolone (for patients unable to take orally) 32 mg intravenously daily&#xD;
      for 4 weeks is the standard therapy. A Lille score of &gt;0.45 after 7 days of treatment with&#xD;
      Corticosteroids is an indication of non-response, increased susceptibility to infections and&#xD;
      diminished survival (20). The Corticosteroids should be stopped if the Lilli score is &gt;0.45.&#xD;
      The most recent STOPAH trial was unable to show a significant improvement in mortality of SAH&#xD;
      patients treated with Corticosteroids. There was a trend in favour of Corticosteroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It is given orally in the dose of 400mg&#xD;
      thrice a day for 28 days. In a pivotal study of 101 patients of SAH21, it was associated with&#xD;
      survival benefit of 50%. In another study, it was found to be superior to Corticosteroids&#xD;
      (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study involving 50 patients at our center (23), we found that 20% vs 40%&#xD;
      mortality in patients treated with Pentoxifylline versus controls, after 4 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment. Acute kidney injury was the cause of death in 20% compared to 70% patients in&#xD;
      Pentoxifylline group versus controls. Pentoxifylline induces recovery of renal &amp; hepatic&#xD;
      functions with a trend towards increased survival. However, a metanalysis of 5 Randomized&#xD;
      Controlled Trials failed to show any benefit with Pentoxifylline24.In a large recent trial&#xD;
      Corticosteriods plus Pentoxifyllinefor 4 weeks treatment with compared with prednisolone&#xD;
      alone, did not result in improved 6-month survival.25 The major adverse effects include&#xD;
      vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and skin rash.&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-Acetylcyteine&#xD;
&#xD;
      N-acetylcysteine could have value as an antioxidant in the treatment of acute alcoholic&#xD;
      hepatitis,because the thiol group in N-acetylcysteine is able to reduce levels of free&#xD;
      radicals. Administration of N-acetylcysteine might reconstitute the glutathione stocks of the&#xD;
      hepatocytes. At present, N-acetylcysteine is used in the treatment of acetaminophen induced&#xD;
      hepatitis. Intravenous acetylcysteine is most often used as an antidote for acetaminophen&#xD;
      overdose due to its ability to increase levels of glutathione; however, it is also used to&#xD;
      treat non-acetaminophen-induced acute liver failure (NAI-ALF) and severe alcoholic hepatitis&#xD;
      and to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Although the i.v.and oral formulations of&#xD;
      acetylcysteine have been evaluated for these indications, most studies have examined the&#xD;
      i.v.form. I.V. acetylcysteine is used in the treatment of NAI-ALF to improve oxygenation to&#xD;
      the liver. A trial to evaluate the efficacy of glucocorticoids plus N-acetylcysteine, as&#xD;
      compared with glucocorticoids alone, in patients with severe acute alcoholic hepatitis.(26)&#xD;
      reported improved one month survival in the combined treatment group. However the 6 month&#xD;
      survival was not different in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bovine colostrum&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human colostrum is the first milk produced after birth and is particularly rich in&#xD;
      immunoglobulin, antimicrobial peptides (lactoferrin and lacto peroxidase) and other bioactive&#xD;
      molecule, including growth factors which are important for nutrition, growth and development&#xD;
      of newborn infants and also for passive immunity. Bovine colostrum is produced by the cows&#xD;
      during the first one day post parturition. This &quot;early&quot; milk has nutrient profile and&#xD;
      immunological composition substantially different from 'mature' milk. It contains&#xD;
      macronutrient like proteins, carbohydrate, oligosaccharides, fats and micronutrients like&#xD;
      vitamins and minerals, also growth factors, anti-microbial compounds and immune regulating&#xD;
      constituents either not present in mature milk or present substantially in lower&#xD;
      concentration.(27,28) Bovine colostrum used in the treatment of HIV-positive patients with&#xD;
      chronic diarrhea,(29) and rotavirus diarrhea in children.(30) Available evidence suggests a&#xD;
      beneficial effect of supplementation of bovine colostrums in improving body composition,&#xD;
      aspects of athletic performance, diarrhea in persons with immune-deficiency syndromes,&#xD;
      NSAID-induced gastrointestinal ulcers, and aspects of the acute phase response that occurs&#xD;
      secondary to surgery. Specific hyperimmune bovine colostrums, produced to have high&#xD;
      neutralizing titer activity against Cryptosporidia, H. pylori, measles, rotavirus, and&#xD;
      Shigella sp., appear to have clinical utility in conditions associated with these infectious&#xD;
      organisms (31) Historically colostrum has been used for various illnesses in India as well as&#xD;
      abroad for thousands of years. Ayurvedic physicians of India have used bovine colostrum for&#xD;
      both medicinal and spiritual purposes since cows were first domesticated. By the late 18th&#xD;
      century, Western medicine started to take an interest in colostrum and study it for its&#xD;
      potential health benefits. As a consequence, it was prescribed for many conditions, including&#xD;
      immune system enhancement. Interestingly, until the development of penicillin and other&#xD;
      artificial antibiotics in the 20th century, colostrum was commonly used for fighting&#xD;
      bacterial infections. In the early 20th century it was noted that antibody levels in the&#xD;
      first milk produced after birth were much higher than levels found in the milk that was&#xD;
      produced 72 hours later.There are now over 2000 published scientific articles that document&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of using colostrum. This seemingly perfect food has been shown to be&#xD;
      non-species specific (32). In 2005, it was reported that is safe and effective in repair of&#xD;
      tissues as well as for enhancing immunity.(33) The use of bovine colostrum as dietary&#xD;
      supplement has increased substantially over the past decades. Bovine colostrum is harvested&#xD;
      within first few hours of calving from dairy animals. The herds of cows are kept under close&#xD;
      supervision in good state of hygiene without exposure to antibodies, pesticides and&#xD;
      anthelmintics. The colostrum collected within 24 hours contains maximum substances but less&#xD;
      in amounts, colostrum collected later will be more in quantity but contain less&#xD;
      immunoglobins.(33) Colostrum contains the growth factors that help build lean muscle,&#xD;
      including insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I &amp; IGF-II) and growth hormone (GH). IGF-I, which&#xD;
      is found naturally in colostrum, is the only natural hormone capable of promoting muscle&#xD;
      growth by itself. The IGFs in humans and cows are identical, but bovine colostrum actually&#xD;
      contains a greater concentration of IGF-I than human colostrum. This fact makes bovine&#xD;
      colostrum attractive to bodybuilders, athletes and others seeking to gain muscle mass.&#xD;
      According to a study conducted in Finland, IGF-1 induces protein synthesis, which leads to an&#xD;
      increase in lean muscle mass without a corresponding rise in adipose (fat) tissue. The growth&#xD;
      factors in colostrum &quot;shift fuel utilization from carbohydrate to fat. It mean that body will&#xD;
      burn more fat, including fat made from the carbohydrate and protein that are consumed,&#xD;
      producing fuel more efficiently.(34) Bovine has hormone factor like gastrin which plays a&#xD;
      role as a trophic factor for mucosal growth with in stomach. GLP-2 has shown a general&#xD;
      trophic response with in the gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peptide growth factors in colostrum can influence the maintenance of mucosal mass and&#xD;
      integrity. EGF stimulates cell proliferation and also influences crypt fission.(25) Human&#xD;
      colostrum has higher concentration of growth factors as compared to bovine colostrum. The&#xD;
      tables and figure below indicate how HC and BC differ in their nutrient content,&#xD;
      immunological factors and growth factors (9,35,36)&#xD;
&#xD;
      While BC are considered a rich source of IgG, growth factors, and lactoferrin, currently no&#xD;
      specific standards exist that define BC dietary supplements with respect to actual&#xD;
      constituents or amounts of constituents. The following constituents are generally present in&#xD;
      bovine colostrums: macronutrients; vitamins; minerals; Ig (IgG, IgM, and IgA - including the&#xD;
      secretory form); cytokines including interleukin-1beta (IL-1β), interleukin- 6 (IL-6), tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interferon-gamma (INF-γ); growth factors including&#xD;
      insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I and II, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), and&#xD;
      epidermal growth factor; lactoperoxidase; and lactoferrin. Depending on the health of the&#xD;
      cows, feeding practices followed, collection period, and the processing/concentration&#xD;
      practices utilized by specific manufacturers, the actual range and quantities of specific&#xD;
      macro- and micronutrients, Ig, cytokines, growth factors, and other compounds might vary&#xD;
      considerably.(37,38,39)&#xD;
&#xD;
      BC contain relatively high amounts of Ig. Typically, Ig in general, and IgG specifically,&#xD;
      constitutes the largest contribution to protein content in BC, with lactalbumin and casein&#xD;
      contributing lesser amounts. Mean percentages of fat, protein, and lactose in colostrum were&#xD;
      6.7, 14.9, and 2.5, respectively.40 Other reports have estimated Ig concentrations from&#xD;
      bovine mammary secretions with ranges for IgG1 (52-87 g/L), IgG2 (1.6-2.1 g/L), IgM(3.7-6.1&#xD;
      g/L), and IgA (3.2-6.2 g/L).41,42 As a rule, the Ig contribution will decline substantially&#xD;
      in any BC collected more than 24 hours post-parturition and the amount of lactalbumin and&#xD;
      casein will increase proportionately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed research plan (Materials and Methods)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and setting&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be Double blind Randomized Placebo controlled Trial. We are planning a study of 2&#xD;
      independent groups in the ratio of 1:1. The correct dose appears to be 60 grams and the&#xD;
      number of patients required to be randomized should be more than 40 patients (10,11). We plan&#xD;
      to enroll 250 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use an uncorrected chi-squared statistic to evaluate this null hypothesis.&#xD;

      Endotoxin level estimation, alpha TNF,IL6&amp; IL8 will be done at baseline and at end of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests for etiologic evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Etiology of cirrhosis will be taken as alcohol if there is a history of significant alcohol&#xD;
      intake (20 gm/day for females, and 80 gm/day for males for 10 years or more). Each patient&#xD;
      will be tested for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and Anti-hepatitis C (HCV) antibody&#xD;
      using a third generation commercial ELISA. Wherever indicated, autoimmune hepatitis will be&#xD;
      diagnosed using antinuclear antibody, anti-smooth muscle antibody and anti-LKM; and&#xD;
      hemochromatosis using serum iron, TIBC, ferritin and transferrin saturation. Each patient&#xD;
      shall have an abdominal ultrasonography. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy would be done, if&#xD;
      indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascitic Fluid analysis:Ascitic Fluid analysis will be done on 1st day and 5th day of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and endpoints Primary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival at 3 month&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Survival at 1 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Change in mDF levels/ MELD will be measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in Endotoxin levels will be measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Change in Cytokines levels will be measured at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Number of episodes of sepsis (bacteremia, Pneumonia, SBP, Cellulitis, UTI)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Liver related death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Liver Transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Death due to other causes&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Complication of Disease (GI Bleed, Renal failure, Sepsis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring for Adverse Events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any adverse event will be recorded specifying the time of onset, the duration, the severity&#xD;
      and the relationship to the test medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tolerability of the study drug will be assessed by comparison of full blood cell count, liver&#xD;
      function tests and renal function tests at baseline and at end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up All patients will be followed up to 3 months or until death. The status alive or&#xD;
      dead will be assessed by telephoning a family member or by contacting the death registry at&#xD;
      patients at birth place or place of residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons will be made with the Wilcoxon or t test for continuous variables according to&#xD;
      the normality of distribution, and the χ2 test or Fisher exact test for qualitative&#xD;
      variables. All results of continuous variables were expressed as means and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals (CIs) for continuous variables and as the frequencies, percentages, and 95% CIs for&#xD;
      categorical variables. The primary results will be presented for all analyses as unadjusted.&#xD;
      The cumulative incidence of death will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method in each&#xD;
      treatment group. The statistical significance of hazard ratio (HR) for treatment allocation&#xD;
      will be tested using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. The potential&#xD;
      heterogeneity in the treatment effect according to different study centers will tested by&#xD;
      adding an interaction center × treatment in the Cox proportional hazards regression model.&#xD;
      Potential risk factors will be first tested by the Cox proportional hazards regression model&#xD;
      in univariate analysis. Prognostic variables with a significance at a level of less than 0.10&#xD;
      in univariate analyses will be included in a multivariable Cox proportional hazards&#xD;
      regression model after removing variables showing a high degree of co - linearity. Factors&#xD;
      included in a composite score will not be included in multivariable analysis to avoid bias&#xD;
      related to the effect of co - linearity. All statistical analyses were performed in the&#xD;
      intention- to-treat population as well as per-protocol population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning a study of 2 independent groups in the ratio of 1:1. Prior data indicates&#xD;
      that when 40 patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery were randomized and given 56 g&#xD;
      daily of Bovine Colostrum for 3 days preoperatively) or placebo and the course of the plasma&#xD;
      endotoxin levels and the endotoxin neutralization capacity (ENC) were measured daily up to&#xD;
      the 10th postoperative day10. The results showed that the LPS-levels in the LC1-group,&#xD;
      expressed as AUC, were significantly lower than those in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). The&#xD;
      difference between the two groups was apparent on the day of the operation and the day after.&#xD;
      The fall in endotoxin neutralizing capacity (ENC) was significantly lower in the patients&#xD;
      treated with the BCC and the return to initial values was faster than in the control group (p&#xD;
      &lt; 0.006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second randomized study, 40 gms of Bovine Colostrum were given perioperatively to 60&#xD;
      open heart surgery patients without any decrease in LPS levels or fall in the ENC.(11) The&#xD;
      correct dose appears to be 60 grams and the number of patients required to be randomized&#xD;
      should be more than 40 patients (10,11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:The Survival rate of patients in standard medical treatment arm was 22% (Am J&#xD;
      Gastroenterol 2014; 109:1417-1423). There is no contemporary Randomized controlled trial on&#xD;
      the such type of patient (mDf &gt;60, MELD &gt;30). We consider a 20% increase in survival rate to&#xD;
      clinically meaningful and sufficient to change practice. To detect a 20% increase in survival&#xD;
      (from 22% to 42 %) in 3 month, The sample size based on survival at a fixed time point (22%&#xD;
      vs 42% at 3 months), we require 79 per group + 10% drop outs. The total sample size required&#xD;
      for the study is 174.&#xD;
