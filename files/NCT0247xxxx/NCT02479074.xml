      In this study the investigators wish to explore the difference in 24 hr. cough counts&#xD;
      measured using the Hull Automated Cough Counter (HACC), from baseline and after two weeks&#xD;
      treatment with either montelukast or prednisolone in patients with an NO measurement of ≥30&#xD;
      ppb at screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients attending the unit as part of their normal outpatients' appointment will be&#xD;
      approached with regards to whether interested in taking part in the study. During an&#xD;
      outpatients appointment all new chronic cough patients undertake Demographics assessment,&#xD;
      full blood count, spirometry test, FeNO measurement and concomitant medication as part of&#xD;
      their standard medical care. If a patient decides to take part in this study then at this&#xD;
      visit they will have further tests outside their standard medical care including, sputum&#xD;
      induction, completion of Leicester cough questionnaire, cough challenge and 24 hr cough&#xD;
      monitoring at the screening visit. All the data collected in terms of the clinic visit and&#xD;
      additional tests will be analysed in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 patients with chronic cough and a FeNO≥30 ppb will be enrolled in to the High FeNO&#xD;
      Treatment Groups. They will be randomised on a 1:1 ratio to receive either: Montelukast 10 mg&#xD;
      daily for four weeks or Prednisolone 20 mg daily for two weeks followed by two weeks&#xD;
      Montelukast 10 mg. 20 subjects with chronic cough and a FeNO≤20 ppb will be enrolled in low&#xD;
      FeNO Treatment Group will receive montelukast 10 mg for 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of five visits to the unit. The first visit will be combined with the&#xD;
      patients scheduled clinic appointment. During this visit the investigators will carry out&#xD;
      some preliminary assessments such as checking medical history, physical examination, full&#xD;
      blood count and vital signs. Demographics assessments, spirometry test, FeNO measurement and&#xD;
      concomitant medication will be recorded as per their scheduled clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further testing will be conducted with regards to the study, these tests include: sputum&#xD;
      induction, cough challenge, Hull Airways Reflux Questionnaire (HARQ), Leicester Cough&#xD;
      Questionnaire (LCQ) and 24h cough monitoring all these tests will be operated at baseline and&#xD;
      after 2 weeks and 4 weeks treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also pregnancy test for women of child bearing potential is required in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of visit 1, patients will receive 14 or 28 days' supply of the randomised study&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 (13th day) and visit 4 (27th day): Participants will be asked to come to the unit&#xD;
      where The Hull Automated Cough Counter will be applied to measure their cough frequency for&#xD;
      24 hours at the end of their treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3 (14th day) and visit 5 (28th day): Patients will be assessed for any adverse events&#xD;
      and any changes in concomitant medication use during the trial and also their vital signs&#xD;
      will be checked. After that the FeNo measurement, Pulmonary Function Tests, cough challenge,&#xD;
      sputum induction, 24h cough monitoring, Hull Airways Reflux Questionnaire (HARQ) and&#xD;
      Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) will be repeated to compare with the first assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study all patients will be reviewed by a chronic cough registrar/consultant&#xD;
      as per the standard care as a clinic patient.&#xD;
