    <textblock>
      Children with newly diagnosed cancer and their parents will be contacted and invited to&#xD;
      participate. Upon agreement, children will be interviewed, both parents will fill out&#xD;
      questionnaires and be additionally interviewed. Using a 3-wave longitudinal design, mainly&#xD;
      self-reported parental we-appraisals and we-disease-appraisals, couple dyadic coping (DC) and&#xD;
      parent-child DC during a course of 12 months will be examined. Additionally, during brief&#xD;
      separate interviews, the parents' speech will be coded for we-appraisals and expressed&#xD;
      emotion regarding the other partner and the child. Findings will provide information on how&#xD;
      family variables affect child QoL over 12 months.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers and clinicians alike have been calling for family-oriented and longitudinal&#xD;
      research on child cancer (CC). The reason for this is threefold. First, parents are the most&#xD;
      influential context on child development. Second, CC can be considered a &quot;we-family disease&quot;,&#xD;
      that is, a stressor that affects the patient, their parents and the interaction within all&#xD;
      family members and subsystems, since they are an interdependent unit. Third, the higher&#xD;
      survivals rates and increased chronicity of CC demand an ongoing adaptation from the whole&#xD;
      family to the illness-related stress. As such, several studies have found associations&#xD;
      between family and child variables during and after cancer treatment, and few studies suggest&#xD;
      a causal relationship of family functioning on child adjustment and quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, (1) which family dimensions related with the process of stress, appraisal and&#xD;
      coping with CC, (2) how changes and (3) divergences within those dimensions predict child QoL&#xD;
      over time, remain answered. Research on stress and coping in couples has identified two&#xD;
      crucial dimensions for better relational and health outcomes that have the potential to&#xD;
      provide those answers. &quot;We-Appraisals&quot;, which is the process how individuals tend to evaluate&#xD;
      what happens to them as a couple, i.e., in a more relational-oriented way (&quot;we&quot; problem) or&#xD;
      in a more individual way (&quot;I/you&quot; problem); and Dyadic Coping, i.e., the process how couples&#xD;
      cope together with stress. Therefore, the aim to expand and understand these dimensions in&#xD;
      the context of families coping with CC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a three-wave longitudinal design, the investigators aim to examine (1) the role that&#xD;
      parental we-appraisals and we-disease appraisals, couple and parent-child dyadic coping have&#xD;
      for a child's QoL over time, (2) how these variables change over time and how these changes&#xD;
      predict changes in a child's QoL, (3) how congruence or discrepancies within we-appraisals&#xD;
      and we-disease-appraisals, couple and parent-child dyadic coping predict changes in child's&#xD;
      QoL over time, and (4) how observed parental we-appraisals, partner's and parental ex-pressed&#xD;
      emotion predict child' QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that higher scores on parents' variables will predict positive&#xD;
      changes on child QoL during the first 12 months after cancer diagnosis (T2 and T3). The&#xD;
      investigators expect that changes and discrepancies within parents' variables over time will&#xD;
      predict changes in child QoL at T2 and T3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred children with newly diagnosed cancer and their mothers and fathers will be&#xD;
      recruited from the University Children's Hospitals in Zurich and Berne and assessed three&#xD;
      times during 12 months. The children will be interviewed at all time points. The parents will&#xD;
      complete several paper-pencil questionnaires assessing the variables of interest and will be&#xD;
      interviewed at T2 (6 months) and T3 (1 year). Latent change score models with three factors&#xD;
      (i.e. mother, father, child) and multilevel analysis will be used to test our hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance&#xD;
&#xD;
      By providing precursor information about the role that key family dimensions play on&#xD;
      explaining better child QoL over time, this study will enable health-care professionals to&#xD;
      know which family resources and members should be targeted during cancer treatment, improve&#xD;
      interventions and, ultimately, to improve child QoL.&#xD;
