      This is a prospective, consecutive series, multicenter clinical study of clinical outcomes&#xD;
      following total hip arthroplasty with the SMF stem.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the study device.&#xD;
      This study will document any device-related, surgical or post-operative complication and&#xD;
      adverse radiographic observations. Improvement in pain, function, and health economic data&#xD;
      will be compared with improvements documented with other joint systems. Outcome measures will&#xD;
      be quantified through statistical analysis of study device , HOOS questionnaire, radiographic&#xD;
      assessments, Harris Hip Score, and adverse event reports.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The study was prematurely terminated by S+N due to business reasons. After an extensive review&#xD;
    of all ongoing studies with the focus on which studies are still required for regulatory&#xD;
    obligations S+N took the decision to close the SMF S&amp;E study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient presents with non-inflammatory degenerative joint disease including&#xD;
             osteoarthritis, traumatic arthritis, avascular necrosis, rheumatoid arthritis of or&#xD;
             any of it's composite diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is of legal age to consent, is skeletally mature and at least 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is willing to consent to participate in the study by signing and dating an&#xD;
             IRB-approved consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is in stable health and is free of or treated and stabilized for cardiac,&#xD;
             pulmonary, hematological or other conditions that would pose excessive operative risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has poor bone stock and would make the procedure unjustifiable: A) patients&#xD;
             which are under medical care for osteoporosis (taking hormones, Calcitonin or&#xD;
             biphosphates) or for other metabolic pathologies, which could influence the quality of&#xD;
             the bone (for example hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyreoidismus and osteomalacie) will&#xD;
             be excluded from the study. B) patients suffering from Morbus Paget (osteodystrophia&#xD;
             deformans) will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has conditions that tend to place increased loads on implants such as weight,&#xD;
             chargot joint, muscular deficiencies and activity level, which are incompatible with a&#xD;
             satisfactory long-term result: A) patients with a BMI &gt; 40 will be excluded from the&#xD;
             study B) patients participating in high-impact sports like baseball, basketball,&#xD;
             football, handball, hockey, karate, racquet-ball, running, soccer, water skiing or&#xD;
             similar impact sports will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is over the age of 75.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Skeletal immaturity: patients must be at least 18 years at the time of the operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has an active, local infection that would lead to increased bone resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mental or neurological conditions that tend to pre-empt the patient's ability or&#xD;
             willingness to restrict activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known sensitivity to materials of the implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is pregnant or plans to be come pregnant during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is a prisoner.&#xD;
