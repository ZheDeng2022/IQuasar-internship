  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy while using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning to help avoid&#xD;
      radiation to normal tissue in patients with prostate cancer. Stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy is a specialized radiation therapy that sends x-rays directly to the tumor using&#xD;
      small, high doses of radiation over several days and may cause less damage to normal tissue.&#xD;
      This treatment schedule allows for a higher dose of radiation to be administered over a&#xD;
      shorter overall treatment period in comparison to standard radiation therapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the incidence of genitourinary (GU) and gastrointestinal (GI) acute and late&#xD;
      toxicity for patients treated with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with&#xD;
      simultaneous integrative boost, urethral ring sparing, and enhanced prostate localization&#xD;
      (magnetic resonance imaging [MRI\-computed tomography [CT] fusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To also evaluate the incidence of GU and GI acute and late toxicity for patients treated&#xD;
      with prostate stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with a more conventional and uniformly&#xD;
      delivered dose of 7.25 Gy/fraction to the prostate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Disease-free survival: disease-free failure events include local progression, distant&#xD;
      progression, biochemical failure as defined by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG)&#xD;
      Phoenix definition, and death from any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Evaluate patient quality of life (QOL) using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite&#xD;
      26 (EPIC-26) for evaluation of the QOL for up to 3 years after the completion of SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Participants unable to undergo&#xD;
      MRI, whose MRI proves technically inadequate for delineating needed anatomic structures, or&#xD;
      who decline to enroll on Arm A are assigned to Arm B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: (n = 120) Participants undergo 5 fractions of moderate dose SBRT with simultaneous&#xD;
      integrated boost (SIB) every other day for 10 days following urethral-sparing IMRT planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: (n = 40) Participants undergo 5 fractions of uniform dose SBRT every other day for 10&#xD;
      days following undergo urethral-sparing IMRT planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks, at 4, 8, and 12&#xD;
      months, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then every 12 months&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
