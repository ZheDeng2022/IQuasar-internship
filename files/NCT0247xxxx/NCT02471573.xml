      To compare the effectiveness of freeze-all and subsequent frozen embryo transfer (freeze all&#xD;
      protocol) with fresh embryo transfer (fresh ET).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) will be treated with GnRH antagonist&#xD;
      protocol. Recombinant Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) will be given on day 2 or day 3 of&#xD;
      menstrual cycle for 5 days. The starting dose is individualized for each patient based on the&#xD;
      following criteria: Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) &lt; 0.7 ng/ml, dose 300 IU/day, AMH 0.7 -2.1&#xD;
      ng/ml, dose 225 IU/day, AMH &gt; 2.1 ng/ml, dose 150 IU/day. After that, investigators can&#xD;
      titrate the dose based on their clinical judgment. Follicular development will be monitored&#xD;
      by ultrasound scanning and measurement of estradiol, progesterone starting on day 5 of&#xD;
      stimulation. Scanning and hormonal measurement will be repeated every 2 to 3 days, depending&#xD;
      on the size of follicles. Antagonist is routinely used on day 5 until the day of Human&#xD;
      chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). Criteria for recombinant hCG (6,500 IU) administration is the&#xD;
      presence of at least three leading follicles of 17 mm. Oocyte retrieval is performed 36 hours&#xD;
      after recombinant hCG administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will measure progesterone levels during stimulation on the day 5 and day 7, as well as on&#xD;
      the day of oocyte triggering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insemination will be performed by using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, 3 - 4 hours after&#xD;
      oocyte retrieval. Only matured oocytes are inseminated. Fertilization are performed under&#xD;
      inverted microscope at period of 16-18 hours after insemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On day 3, endometrium thickness will be measured and embryo evaluation will be performed at&#xD;
      fixed time point 68±1 hours after fertilization, using Istanbul consensus. After grading&#xD;
      embryo, eligible patients will be invited to participate in the study. Written consent will&#xD;
      be obtained from each patient for participation into the study. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      into 2 groups fresh embryo transfer and freeze-all. Randomization will be done by third party&#xD;
      via telephone, using a computer-generated random list, with block size of 2, 4, 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Freeze all group&#xD;
&#xD;
      All grade 1 and grade 2 embryos were cryopreserved using vitrification method. In the next&#xD;
      cycle, endometrium will be prepared by using estradiol orally, starting from day 2-3 of&#xD;
      menstrual cycle. When endometrium thickness reaches 8mm or more, patients start to use&#xD;
      progesterone vaginally. Embryo transfer is performed 3 days after using progesterone. On the&#xD;
      day of embryo transfer, maximum two embryos will be thawed. Two hours after thawing,&#xD;
      surviving embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound guidance. Luteal-phase&#xD;
      support is done with estradiol 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day until 7th week of&#xD;
      gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh ET group&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fresh ET group, maximum 2 embryos will be transferred into the uterus under ultrasound&#xD;
      guidance. The remain grade 1 and 2 embryos will be frozen. Luteal phase support is done with&#xD;
      estradiol 8mg/day and vaginal progesterone 800mg/day until 7th week of gestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both of groups, serum hCG was measured 2 weeks after embryo transferred, and if positive,&#xD;
      an ultrasound scan of the uterus was performed at gestational weeks 7 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      At IVFMD, the current ongoing pregnancy rate (with 2 embryos transferred) is 30%. To show an&#xD;
      improvement in the freeze-all group of 10% (from 30% to 40%), it was calculated that 712&#xD;
      couples (356 in each group) would be needed (power 0.80, alpha-error 5%, two-sided test). To&#xD;
      account for an estimated loss to follow-up rate of 10%, the number of patients needed was&#xD;
      defined as 780 (390 patients per group).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Peripartum increased blood loss (≥1000 mL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT INFORMED CONSENT A review of patient information should be done prior to enrolment to&#xD;
      determine preliminary eligibility according to patient inclusion and exclusion criteria. When&#xD;
      a patient signs an informed consent she is considered to be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WITHDRAWAL OF INDIVIDUAL PATIENTS Patients can leave the study at any time for any reason if&#xD;
      they wish to do so without any consequences for their treatment. The investigator can decide&#xD;
      to withdraw a subject from the study or urgent medical reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event rates will be calculated for dichotomous endpoints. These will be compared by&#xD;
      calculating relative risk and 95% confidence interval values. Between-group differences in&#xD;
      non-continuous variables will be assessed using the Fisher exact test. Continuous variables&#xD;
      will be reported as mean values ± standard deviation (SD) or as percentages. Between-group&#xD;
      differences in continuous variables will be assessed with the Student's t-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a secondary analysis we will assess whether the biomarkers progesterone at triggering day&#xD;
      and endometrial thickness on day 3 after oocyte pick up can be used to identify patients in&#xD;
      whom the freeze all strategy is particularly effective. To do so, we will look for&#xD;
      interaction between progesterone or endometrial thickness and treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A p-value &lt;0.05 is defined as indicating a statistically significant difference. The analysis&#xD;
      will be done with R statistical package (R version 3.3.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERIM ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim analysis will be performed after recruitment of the first 400 patients. An&#xD;
      independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will evaluate the data. A specific&#xD;
      stopping rule will not be formulated, but continuation of the study will depend on the advice&#xD;
      of the DSMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY REPORTING&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will inform the subjects and the reviewing accredited medical research&#xD;
      ethics committee; if anything occurs, on the basis of which it appears that the disadvantages&#xD;
      of participation may be significantly greater than was foreseen in the research proposal. The&#xD;
      investigator will take care that all subjects are kept informed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS All observed or volunteered adverse events, regardless of&#xD;
      treatment group or suspected causal relationship to intervention, will be recorded. Adverse&#xD;
      events are defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a subject during a clinical&#xD;
      trial, whether or not considered related to the intervention. All adverse events reported&#xD;
      spontaneously by the subject or observed by the investigator or his staffs will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results&#xD;
      in death;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life threatening (at the time of the event);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a congenital anomaly or birth defect;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is a new event of the trial likely to affect the safety of the subjects, such as an&#xD;
           unexpected outcome of an adverse reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND CONSENT The subject should be given the time to read and understand the&#xD;
      statement herself before signing her consent and dating the document. The subject should&#xD;
      receive a copy of the written statement once signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIVACY ASPECTS Participating subjects will be registered by a 5-digit number. This personal&#xD;
      code will be on all forms retrieved from participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BENEFITS AND RISKS ASSESSMENT, GROUP RELATEDNESS There is insufficient evidence for a&#xD;
      rational policy in between the 2 strategies, freeze all or fresh ET. The potential benefits&#xD;
      of freeze all are higher pregnancy rate, with a lower incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation&#xD;
      syndrome (OHSS) and/or ectopic pregnancy. The potential harm would be time-consuming.&#xD;
