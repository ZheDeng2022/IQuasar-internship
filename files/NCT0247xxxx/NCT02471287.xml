      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research has identified some of the genes involved in inherited eye diseases. But for many of&#xD;
      these diseases, the genes are not yet known. Researchers want to try to find these genes.&#xD;
      They also hope to learn more about how symptoms differ in people with similar gene changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about genes involved in eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have a known or suspected inherited eye disease, and their relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will have a medical history, physical exam, and eye exam. They may have&#xD;
           blood taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with an eye disease may have eye cell samples taken using a swab or biopsy&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a skin biopsy. A (Omega)-inch piece of skin will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have blood drawn and the red blood cells removed. The remaining serum&#xD;
           will be made into an eye drop solution for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may provide samples of tears, urine, saliva, stool, hair, or inner cheek&#xD;
           cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a retina test. They may also have a test that uses light to&#xD;
           measure retina thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have an eye movement test. Electrodes will be placed on the skin next&#xD;
           to both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have a fluorescein angiography. A dye will be given through an&#xD;
           intravenous line in the arm. A camera will take pictures of the dye as it flows through&#xD;
           the eyes blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have microperimetry. They will sit at a computer screen and press a&#xD;
           button when they see a light.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants may have an eye movement test. They will wear contact lenses or goggles and&#xD;
           watch a series of spots on a computer screen.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular genetics and genomics are revolutionizing the delivery of medicine in general and&#xD;
      ophthalmology in particular. New treatment and prevention strategies rely on a detailed&#xD;
      understanding of the genetics and molecular pathogenesis of vision-threatening disease. In&#xD;
      addition, in order to determine whether an intervention is therapeutic, we must first have&#xD;
      some understanding of what the best clinical outcome variables are for measuring a treatment&#xD;
      effect. Because our ultimate goal is to develop disease-specific protocols for specific&#xD;
      inherited conditions, establishing this protocol will help us establish an initial critical&#xD;
      mass of patients and of knowledge to write such protocols; as such, this protocol will be&#xD;
      hypothesis generating. A secondary aim of this protocol is to provide a mechanism for&#xD;
      obtaining research samples from subjects that may be used for laboratory investigations; in&#xD;
      this case, the basic research may be both hypothesis generating and/or hypothesis testing.&#xD;
      Lastly, the Ophthalmic Genetics Branch, as a leader in the field and a sponsor of a clinical&#xD;
      training program, should have the ability to serve as a tertiary referral center for the&#xD;
      nation in the area of undiagnosed genetic eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nine-hundred twenty-five (925) individuals with inherited eye diseases and 325 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (the unaffected relatives of affected participants) will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a combined evaluation/treatment protocol and a genetic repository study. In general,&#xD;
      participants will undergo a complete, age-appropriate, baseline examination and provide a&#xD;
      blood sample. Some participants may undergo more specialized ophthalmic and/or&#xD;
&#xD;
      systemic testing, if clinically indicated by the investigator. The data and images obtained&#xD;
      from these tests may be used for determining eligibility into another NEI protocol.&#xD;
      Additionally, the collection of these data will help meet the primary research objectives of&#xD;
      this study. In a small number of cases, collection of blood, readily available biospecimens&#xD;
      and body fluids (e.g., urine, saliva, tear fluid, stool, hair or cheek swab samples),&#xD;
      conjunctival swab or lacrimal gland biopsy, impression cytology, and/or a punch skin biopsy&#xD;
      may also be performed for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the breadth of ages and disease processes covered under this protocol, we will not&#xD;
      systematically obtain any single outcome variable beyond visual acuity on research subjects.&#xD;
      However, detailed, disease-specific findings will be collected through the NEI electronic&#xD;
      medical record. Findings from systemic testing and from outside exams may be tabulated in a&#xD;
      separate, secure database in the laboratory of the Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will be eligible if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a known or suspected inherited eye disease OR are an unaffected (usually first&#xD;
             degree) relative of a participant with a known or suspected inherited eye disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have the ability to cooperate with an age-appropriate eye exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have the ability to understand and sign an informed consent or have a parent/legal&#xD;
             guardian to do so if they are minor children or have a legally authorized&#xD;
             representative if they are adults without consent capacity. Unaffected adult relatives&#xD;
             of a participant should be able&#xD;
&#xD;
        to provide consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will not be eligible if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They are unwilling or unable to be followed as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They have a clear, non-genetic disease etiology (unless they are an unaffected&#xD;
             relative).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Their participation would not contribute to the NEI research mission, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for MRI (if applicable)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Participants will not be eligible for optional MRI procedure if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. They have metal in their body which would make having an MRI scan unsafe, such as&#xD;
             pacemakers, stimulators, pumps, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses, artificial heart&#xD;
             valves, cochlear implants or shrapnel fragments, or if they were a welder or metal&#xD;
             worker, since they may small metal fragments in the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. They have claustrophobia and would feel uncomfortable in the MRI machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. They are not able to lie comfortably on their back for up to one (1) hour.&#xD;
