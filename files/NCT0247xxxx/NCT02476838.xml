  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if an investigational surgery that transfers tissue from&#xD;
      a non-living donor to living individual will help restore greater function, appearance, and&#xD;
      sensation to the hand and forearm areas of individuals who have suffered traumatic injury to&#xD;
      the hand and forearm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This procedure is called a hand allotransplantation or &quot;hand transplant&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will also collect data on how patients do during and after having a hand&#xD;
      transplant from a nonliving donor. Recovery and outcomes will be observed through clinical&#xD;
      exams, x-rays, blood and tissue tests, and other associated evaluations at all follow up&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;

      The subject will be selected as a possible participant in this study because s/he has&#xD;
      suffered traumatic amputation to the hand and s/he has identified that s/he is interested in&#xD;
      having a hand transplant as an alternative to continued care using conventional prostheses.&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate subjects between the ages of 18 and 60 who are missing tissue&#xD;
      from an area of the hand and forearm. After obtaining consent, several pre-transplant&#xD;
      screening procedures and evaluations will be completed. This data will be utilized to&#xD;
      determine recipient eligibility and selection for placement onto the transplant waiting list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data and information gathered during the pre-transplant screening procedures will be&#xD;
      evaluated and discussed by members of the Participant Selection Committee (PSC) and consensus&#xD;
      will be reached to nominate (or not) for transplantation. All screening procedures will be&#xD;
      re-evaluated on a yearly basis while the subject remains on the list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transplant Waiting List Procedures After all data is evaluated, the subject's information&#xD;
      will be presented to the Patient Selection Committee for final reviews. Some subjects&#xD;
      evaluated may NOT be deemed eligible for the protocol. While on the waitlist, serum samples&#xD;
      will be provided every month to perform cross-match with a current sample in the case of a&#xD;
      potential donor candidate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation for Transplantation When a matched donor is identified, any screening procedures&#xD;
      that need to be repeated will be done prior to the hand transplant surgery, which is&#xD;
      consistent with the standard of care at this institution. Once subject has been cleared for&#xD;
      surgery, the transplant will be scheduled and performed. The duration of the surgery will be&#xD;
      approximately 18-24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will have a PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line started in the&#xD;
      limb that will not be operated on. If the patient is to have bilateral transplants, a central&#xD;
      line will be placed by the anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An infraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block using 0.25% bupivacaine and mepivacaine&#xD;
      without epinephrine would be performed on the recipient's upper extremity with an indwelling&#xD;
      catheter for intra and post-operative pain control and vasodilatation by chemical&#xD;
      sympathectomy. Cephalosporin 2 g or equivalent will be given IV preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-transplant clinical monitoring procedures and post-operative care The transplanted&#xD;
      tissue will be monitored closely per the hand surgeon's standard free flap postoperative&#xD;
      protocol. Additionally, free flap treatment guidelines will be provided to hospital&#xD;
      supportive staff such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalization length The subject's expected length of time in the hospital floor is&#xD;
      approximately 4 weeks. After that the subject will be moved to Rehabilitation Unit until post&#xD;
      operative day (POD) 90 If there are complications, the subject may remain longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Occupational therapy The subject will need to have occupational therapy for about twelve to&#xD;
      24 months after their surgery. During the immediate 90 day in-patient stay, the patient will&#xD;
      have hand therapy a minimum of five days a week for 1-3 hours each session. At these visits,&#xD;
      a series of exercises aimed to improve strength and active and passive range of motion will&#xD;
      be performed with additional modalities added as tolerated. Early controlled motion will be&#xD;
      introduced to reduce the chance of adhesions. Appropriate wound dressings and splints would&#xD;
      be fashioned to aid with proper positioning, healing and safe exercising. The caregiver must&#xD;
      also learn the prescribed exercises and proper use and care of any other equipment that the&#xD;
      subject will need to use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits After the subject is discharged from the hospital, s/he will have at least&#xD;
      six follow-up visits within the first year with the multi-disciplinary team. The subject will&#xD;
      have at least two visits yearly thereafter. The reconstructive surgeon, the transplant&#xD;
      surgeon, and other physicians the subject's doctor suggests will see the participants and&#xD;
      provide follow up care at their offices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring tests/procedures The subject will undergo monitoring tests and a number of&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Candidates may be male or female patients between the ages of 18 and 60 who are&#xD;
             missing all or part of one or both hands and forearms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be HIV negative at the time of transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Crossmatch is negative between donor and recipient&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are of child bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (urine&#xD;
             test is acceptable) within 48 hours of transplant and agree to use reliable&#xD;
             contraception for one year following transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must give written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who are poor candidates for prosthesis and eligible for hand transplant -&#xD;
             prosthesis failure or non acceptance/poor satisfaction with trial of prosthesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled infection or severe concomitant diseases which would exclude the&#xD;
             recipient from transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substance abuse disorders not currently under control (as determined by the Michigan&#xD;
             Alcohol Screening Test)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active severe psychiatric illness such as Psychosis or Depression&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body Dysmorphic disorder (see Appendix K for screening tool). Less severe psychiatric&#xD;
             conditions are addressed on a case by case basis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Co-existing medical or psycho-social problems relevant to tissue allotransplantation:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Positive serology for HIV; Hepatitis B/C Antigen&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with any cognitive deficits related to a TBI (traumatic brain injury)&#xD;
                  and or any organic neurological disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active malignancy within 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Unstable social situation as evidenced by lack of stable housing and/or lack of a&#xD;
                  supportive significant other&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Recent history of medical nonadherence&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other psychological status that would hinder the success or safety of the&#xD;
             transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Level of amputation proximal to mid-humerus: some presence of proximal muscles is&#xD;
             required to motor a functioning hand&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital Abnormalities: co-existent absence/atrophy/agenesis of any tissue may&#xD;
             affect post transplant results&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of amputation of less than six months: subject must be allowed to attempt&#xD;
             prosthetic use prior to hand transplantation. This can be waived in cases where the&#xD;
             recipient requires amputation/revision of the transplant site at the time of&#xD;
             transplantation. However, if at all possible it is highly encouraged that the patient&#xD;
             has ruled out prosthetics as an alternative to transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Blindness: blind amputees may be poor candidates because sensory return in the hand&#xD;
             may not provide sufficient protective sensation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy&#xD;
