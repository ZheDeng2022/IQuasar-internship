  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well donor cytotoxic T lymphocytes work in treating patients&#xD;
      with malignancies with BK and/or JC virus. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes are made from donated&#xD;
      blood cells that are grown in the laboratory and are designed to kill viruses that can cause&#xD;
      infections in transplant patients and may be an effective treatment in patients with&#xD;
      malignancies with BK and/or JC virus.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the efficacy, feasibility and safety of administering most closely human&#xD;
      leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched BK specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) lines (BK-CTLs)&#xD;
      generated by ex vivo expansion to mediate antiviral activity in patients with any type of&#xD;
      malignancies, and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&#xD;
      (AIDs), and/or history of solid organ transplant with BK and JC infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the persistence of the administered BK-CTLs generated by ex vivo expansion in&#xD;
      patients with any type of malignancies, and/or HIV/AIDs, and/or history of solid organ&#xD;
      transplant with BK and JC infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive allogeneic BK-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes intravenously (IV) over 30&#xD;
      minutes. Patients achieving partial response, stable disease, or progressive disease are&#xD;
      eligible for 7 additional infusions of CTL occurring at least 2 weeks after the previous CTL&#xD;
      infusion if they meet the eligibility criteria for subsequent therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 12 months.&#xD;
