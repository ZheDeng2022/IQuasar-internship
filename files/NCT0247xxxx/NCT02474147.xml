      The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare effects of two isocaloric meals (processed meat hamburger vs. vegetarian&#xD;
           sandwich) in response to the postprandial period by using functional brain imaging of&#xD;
           reward circuitry implicated in food motivation and energy balance in patients with type&#xD;
           2 diabetes (T2D), obese subjects and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize some of the pathophysiological mechanisms of action of different meals in&#xD;
           obese and T2D subjects vs. in healthy controls (serum concentrations of glucose, FFA,&#xD;
           IRI, C-peptide, gastrointestinal hormones, oxidative stress markers)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The mesolimbic dopaminergic system of the brain, which converges on the nucleus accumbens&#xD;
      (part of the striatum), plays a central role in reward and craving, and this system appears&#xD;
      to mediate hedonic food responses. In rodent studies, extracellular concentrations of&#xD;
      dopamine and its metabolites in the nucleus accumbens increased more after the consumption of&#xD;
      highly palatable food than standard rodent feed pellets. Furthermore, microinjections of&#xD;
      opiate into the nucleus accumbens increased food intake and the reward value of food.&#xD;
      Clinical studies that used functional brain imaging have reported greater activation in the&#xD;
      nucleus accumbens or other regions of the striatum in obese than lean individuals after they&#xD;
      viewed or consumed palatable, high-calorie food. Of particular interest, striatal dopamine D2&#xD;
      receptor availability was significantly lower in obese individuals than in nonobese matched&#xD;
      controls, which raised the possibility that overeating may compensate for low dopaminergic&#xD;
      activity. The recurrent activation of the striatum may down-regulate dopamine availability&#xD;
      and further heighten the drive to overeat. However, the information on the exact effect of&#xD;
      different foods and nutrients on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary findings that lead to the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive association between high consumption of total and red meat, especially processed&#xD;
      meat, and incidence of T2D has been demonstrated. Previous studies support the concept that&#xD;
      increased oxidative stress may play an important role in T2D manifestation. Dietary fat&#xD;
      quality has been proposed to be a critical factor. Several studies have suggested that a high&#xD;
      intake of saturated fatty acids naturally present in meat contributes to the risk of glucose&#xD;
      intolerance. In an intervention study, humans suffering from metabolic syndrome who were&#xD;
      consuming a diet rich in saturated fats displayed higher oxidative stress markers&#xD;
      postprandially. It is not clear if saturated fatty acids per se or via increased oxidative&#xD;
      stress markers may activate the mesolimbic dopaminergic system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, some intervention trials (including ours) demonstrated a greater improvement in&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity, glycemic control and a reduction in oxidative stress markers in T2D&#xD;
      patients consuming a vegetarian diet compared to a conventional diabetic diet. The effect of&#xD;
      a vegetarian diet on the mesolimbic dopaminergic system has not been studied yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and priorities of the project&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare effects of two isocaloric meals (processed meat hamburger vs. vegetarian&#xD;
           sandwich) in response to the postprandial period by using functional brain imaging of&#xD;
           reward circuitry implicated in food motivation and energy balance in patients with type&#xD;
           2 diabetes (T2D), obese subjects and healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Characterize some of the pathophysiological mechanisms of action of different meals in&#xD;
           obese and T2D subjects vs. in healthy controls (serum concentrations of glucose, FFA,&#xD;
           IRI, C-peptide, gastrointestinal hormones, oxidative stress markers)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obese and T2D subjects relative to lean healthy controls will show greater activation in&#xD;
           the gustatory cortex and in somatosensory regions in response to the intake of processed&#xD;
           meat hamburger (vs. a vegetarian sandwich). However, they will also show decreased&#xD;
           activation in the caudate nucleus in response to consumption of processed meat hamburger&#xD;
           (vs. a vegetarian sandwich).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Changes in serum concentrations of glucose, FFA, IRI, C-peptide, gastrointestinal&#xD;
           hormones and oxidative stress markers will be involved in gut-brain axis signaling. The&#xD;
           investigators hypothesise to find an association between postprandial changes in serum&#xD;
           concentrations of FFA and postprandial changes in activation in the gustatory cortex and&#xD;
           in somatosensory regions of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The actual need for this study The pandemic of obesity and diabetes especially in western&#xD;
      countries calls for high-quality research and relevant action. A better understanding of the&#xD;
      pathophysiological mechanisms of the stimulation of brain regions involved in reward and&#xD;
      craving in response to processed meat, one of the most significant present risk factors for&#xD;
      obesity and type 2 diabetes, is needed in order to develop more effective preventive and&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
