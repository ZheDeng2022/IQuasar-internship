  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The bone marrow mononuclear cell fraction has been used as therapy after myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and in dilated cardiomyopathy in adults. The absence of adult co-morbidities may&#xD;
      enhance the potential effectiveness of pediatric stem cells.This study is a randomized,&#xD;
      crossover, placebo controlled pilot study to primarily determine the safety and feasibility&#xD;
      of stem cell intracoronary therapy in children. Secondary end points are MRI measurements and&#xD;
      NTproBNP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten children (mean age 7.2 years, range 2.2-14.1, 6 male) with dilated cardiomyopathy (NYHA/&#xD;
      Ross Classification 2-4) will be recruited. Bone marrow aspiration MRI and cell injection are&#xD;
      performed under the same anaesthetic. Patients will be crossed over at 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is of a randomized, crossover, placebo controlled design. The Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement was used to guide the development of the&#xD;
      protocol. Ethical Approval was obtained for this project in April 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A CONSORT flow diagram was produced and a project plan for a crossover study designed.&#xD;
      Although the primary end point of the study was safety and feasibility the investigator aimed&#xD;
      to look at functional outcome as a secondary endpoint. Statistical review of the available&#xD;
      literature indicated a 3% change in ejection fraction (EF) as measured by magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) would represent a meaningful change and calculated 10 patients would be&#xD;
      sufficient to detect this mean change in EF, assuming a SD of difference of 3% with 80% power&#xD;
      and 5% significance. For all calculations it was assumed that the distribution of differences&#xD;
      was Normal. Calculation of a sample size for the crossover study required a definition of the&#xD;
      minimum difference to be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged 1 year to 16 years at review, either attending Heart Failure Clinic at Great&#xD;
      Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) or referred for admission and management of their heart failure&#xD;
      at GOSH will be invited to participate in the study. The lower age limit was selected to&#xD;
      permit coronary artery catheterisation to be feasibly performed taking into account the size&#xD;
      of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On recruitment all patients have impaired systolic function as determined by reduced&#xD;
      shortening fraction on echocardiogram (more than 2 SD below normal). The functional status of&#xD;
      the recruited patients was class 2-4 as defined by the NYHA or Ross classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were the need for high dependency or intensive care and congenital heart&#xD;
      disease, viral infection that would preclude the use of hospital Cell Therapy Laboratory&#xD;
      facilities, active malignancy and unstable cardiac drug therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential patients will be identified from case notes, and they and their families approached&#xD;
      either by telephone or following clinic review to evaluate their interest in participation.&#xD;
      Any patients who appeared interested in participating in the study will be given age and&#xD;
      language appropriate written information; and also given a contact telephone numberso that&#xD;
      additional information could be supplied if required. Each family will be given the&#xD;
      opportunity to discuss the study with the research team before consent for inclusion was&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ten patients who met the eligibility criteria will be recruited for this study. Each patient&#xD;
      is randomized at entry to the study to determine whether they would receive stem cells at&#xD;
      Period One or Period Two of the protocol. Randomisation was performed using a&#xD;
      computer-generated random number table, Graph pad.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following recruitment and randomisation, patients have their individual admission time-line&#xD;
      planned. Those patients who are to receive stem cells at their first study admission are&#xD;
      reviewed within the 28 days preceding that date. At this review, screening for infection, as&#xD;
      per our hospital Cell Therapy Laboratory protocol (including HIV and hepatitis B and C) will&#xD;
      be performed, following full written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the procedure the patient will be admitted to the cardiac day-care facility for&#xD;
      baseline observations and clinical assessment. The study procedure will be performed in the&#xD;
      Cardiac MRI theatre under general anaesthetic. Blood samples will be taken at the time of&#xD;
      anaesthesia for routine investigation (full blood count, urea, electrolytes, liver function&#xD;
      and NTproBNP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients receiving intracoronary stem cells at this admission have 20mL of bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirated from the posterior iliac crest under aseptic conditions immediately after induction&#xD;
      of anaesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspiration technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients on anticoagulation therapy are highlighted in advance of all procedures and&#xD;
      admissions, and optimal coagulation management implemented prior to, during and following the&#xD;
      bone marrow aspiration. All bone marrow processing is undertaken at the Great Ormond Street&#xD;
      Hospital cell therapy processing facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following anaesthetic induction and the securing of a stable airway the patient is positioned&#xD;
      to permit bone marrow aspiration. Full aseptic conditions are observed throughout the&#xD;
      procedure. A volume of 20 mL of bone marrow is aspirated from a single needle puncture site&#xD;
      using heparinized 10mL syringes attached to the bone marrow needle following removal of the&#xD;
      central trocar. The aspirated bone marrow is transferred to sterile heparinized universal&#xD;
      specimen bottles. Immediately after aspiration the bone marrow sample is taken to the cell&#xD;
      therapy laboratory for mononuclear cell separation using standard techniques of gradient&#xD;
      centrifugation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mononuclear cell separation protocol takes approximately 90 minutes to complete. The bone&#xD;
      marrow sample is processed to provide 1mL for intra-coronary injection and 1mL to be&#xD;
      cryogenically frozen for further phenotypic analysis at a later date. A small aliquot of stem&#xD;
      cell suspension is analysed to obtain total mononuclear cell counts per millilitres. This&#xD;
      cell count represents the total number of mononuclear cells injected via intra-coronary&#xD;
      catheterisation. In addition cell viability was also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst waiting for the prepared stem cells, the cardiac MRI scan is performed using a breath&#xD;
      hold protocol for image acquisition. Following the MRI scan the patient is transferred by&#xD;
      means of the mechanized sliding table back into the angiography suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On return to the angiography suite the patient is maintained under general anaesthesia until&#xD;
      notice is given by the stem cell laboratory that the stem cell processing is nearing&#xD;
      completion. Following contact with the stem cell laboratory an arterial sheath is placed in&#xD;
      the femoral artery of the study patient and advanced until its tip is sited in the left main&#xD;
      coronary artery. Partial occlusion of the coronary artery was observed as demonstrated by ST&#xD;
      segment changes and damping of the pressure trace is routinely monitored during such&#xD;
      procedures. The 1mL volume is slowly injected via the coronary artery catheter into the left&#xD;
      main coronary artery followed by a 1mL 0.9% saline flush over a period of 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the intracoronary injection of stem cell suspension the cardiac catheter is removed&#xD;
      and haemostasis at the skin entry site achieved. The patient is then woken and recovered in a&#xD;
      standard manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are admitted to the cardiac ward overnight with routine monitoring of the arterial&#xD;
      catheterisation access site and bone marrow aspiration site; cardiac care observations are&#xD;
      continued throughout. Patients are discharged the following day and electively reviewed in&#xD;
      the outpatient's clinic at three months post-procedure or advised to contact the Research&#xD;
      Fellow sooner if any concerns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cross-over of interventions occurs at six months with the stem cell group receiving placebo&#xD;
      via the cardiac catheterisation (no bone marrow harvest is required for the placebo arm of&#xD;
      the study) on the second occasion. The same admission, monitoring and follow up will be&#xD;
      arranged as for the stem cell stage of the study. The placebo used for the intracoronary&#xD;
      injection used is 1mL 0.9% saline, consistent with the placebo solution used in adult&#xD;
      studies. The 1mL of placebo is followed with a 1mL 0.9% saline flush for correlation with the&#xD;
      stem cell arm of the study. An interim clinic review is again arranged at three months post&#xD;
      procedure and a follow up cardiac MRI scan at six months. The time scale was chosen after&#xD;
      review of the available adult literature which showed that effects on the left ventricle were&#xD;
      usually seen within 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients randomly allocated placebo at stage one of the study cross over to receive&#xD;
      stem cells at stage two. Interim and final follow up arrangements are the same for the stem&#xD;
      cell and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia was standardized for all patients and the same anaesthetist used for all&#xD;
      procedures. Bone marrow preparation was also standardized and performed by the same scientist&#xD;
      in each case. Computer data entry will be double-checked. Patient identifiers are removed&#xD;
      from the anonymous images to allow blind analysis later on; in this way unbiased image&#xD;
      analysis is performed. A single researcher using Osirix software performs off-line analysis&#xD;
      of the data. As a second check of these data the researcher's results are evaluated, again&#xD;
      blind to patient identifiers, by a second analyser. The key to the blinding of the MRI data&#xD;
      is devised, applied and stored securely by a clinician not otherwise involved in the study.&#xD;
      Indexed values correct the data for age, sex, height and weight and permit true comparisons&#xD;
      to be made between the series of studies of the same individual and between different&#xD;
      individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measures were freedom from death and transplantation or any complication&#xD;
      which could be considered related to bone marrow injection or anaesthesia&#xD;
      (infection/malignancy/anaphylaxis/renal deterioration). A safety monitoring committee,&#xD;
      including a cardiologist from Great Ormond Street Hospital not involved in the trial, an&#xD;
      external cardiologist and a lay representative, will be established. Any adverse events will&#xD;
      be reported to the committee which was empowered to halt the trial at any time if concerns&#xD;
      arose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ejection fraction, left ventricular volumes and mass are derived from cardiac MRI. Blood is&#xD;
      taken for NT proBNP. In addition functional status is assessed by the New York Heart&#xD;
      Association classification or the Ross classification in younger children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient has a cardiac MRI under general anaesthetic. The anaesthetist and anaesthesia&#xD;
      protocol are the same for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All images are obtained with a 1.5-T MR scanner (Avanto, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) using a&#xD;
      12-element phased-array coil for signal reception and the body coil for signal transmission.&#xD;
      A vector ECG system is used for cardiac gating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left ventricular (LV) volumes are measured from contiguous short-axis steady state free&#xD;
      precession cine covering both ventricles (7-13 slices, depending on the size of the child).&#xD;
      Each slice is acquired in a single 10- to 15-second breath hold as previously described. All&#xD;
      image processing is performed using in-house plug-ins for the open-source Osirix DICOM&#xD;
      (digital imaging and communications in medicine) software. The LV end-diastolic volume (EDV)&#xD;
      and end-systolic volume (ESV) are measured by manual segmentation of the endocardial borders&#xD;
      in the short-axis data. Careful segmentation of the basal slices in conjunction with&#xD;
      4-chamber and LV long-axis views is performed to overcome problems with delineating the&#xD;
      mitral valve. Ventricular stroke volume (SV) was the difference between the EDV and ESV, and&#xD;
      ventricular ejection fraction (%) was (SV/EDV)×100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the secondary end points, EDV, ESV and EF, comparisons between treatments are&#xD;
      made on an intention to treat basis. A crossover analysis on post treatment measures is&#xD;
      conducted using an analysis of variance model, considering sequence, period and treatment&#xD;
      effects. Carry-over effect is tested first and where there is no evidence of a significant&#xD;
      effect, the treatment effect is tested. A subsequent generalized estimating equation (GEE)&#xD;
      model was fitted which allowed for an adjustment for baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where the distribution of the data was clearly non-Normal the investigators use a logarithmic&#xD;
      transformation. Stata is used for all statistical analyses and all tests were two-sided. A P&#xD;
      value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
