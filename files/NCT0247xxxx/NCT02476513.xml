    <textblock>
      In this study,the investigators will evaluate participants that have clinical features&#xD;
      associated with an increased risk of esophageal disorders.The investigators will also see if&#xD;
      there is a positive association of esophageal disorders in men,40-60 with or without&#xD;
      abdominal obesity in the diagnosis of the following diseases; Gastroesophageal reflux&#xD;
      disease, Barrett Esophagus and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma. The investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      most obese patients referred for Esophagogastroduodenoscopy will exhibit esophageal&#xD;
      disorders. Since currently the rates of obesity and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus have&#xD;
      increased significantly over the past 15 years, the investigators hope to find biochemical&#xD;
      markers (i.e. pro-inflammatory mediators) in the esophagus. The investigators hope these&#xD;
      samples will lead us to a differential expression of molecular markers and inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators in the varying degrees of esophageal disorder&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with elevated central adiposity have an increased risk of esophageal disorders; we&#xD;
      will correlate central adiposity with advanced esophageal pathologies (BE and EAC). This will&#xD;
      be done by comparing body mass and fat distribution to tissue abnormalities found by&#xD;
      pathology review of EGD biopsy. It is anticipated that the group of men in this study will&#xD;
      have an increased likelihood of histopathologic alteration, which we will fit into our scale&#xD;
      (0-no inflammation, 1-inflammation or BE, 2-BE with dysplasia, and 3-carcinoma) according to&#xD;
      the referral pattern at UAB's outpatient gastroenterology clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the molecular level, there is also a relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and&#xD;
      obesity, which may contribute to esophageal disorder [28]. Metabolically active fat cells&#xD;
      secrete cytokines exclusive to adipose tissue (adipokines, leptin/adiponectin) as well as the&#xD;
      more classic signaling molecules, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±); interleukins (IL)-1,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10; monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1); and macrophage&#xD;
      inflammatory protein 1 (MIP 1) [29-33]. Obesity-triggered pro-inflammatory molecules may&#xD;
      promote tissue injury, leading to metaplasia and dysplasia in BE and, subsequently, to&#xD;
      carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, by measuring these pro-inflammatory markers in our prospective patient population, it&#xD;
      will be determined if patients with elevated levels exhibit pathologic disorders in the&#xD;
      esophagus and if the differential expression of these molecular markers correlates with&#xD;
      degree of esophageal disorder. We will analyze samples collected from men for adipocytokines&#xD;
      and for inflammatory mediators that are released with tissue injury. Additionally, we will&#xD;
      examine molecular markers that correlate with more advanced esophageal disorders (BE with&#xD;
      high grade dysplasia and EAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent stimulation is needed to cause stepwise progression from the early stages of&#xD;
      esophageal injury, to BE, to carcinoma. Since the molecular events that lead to this&#xD;
      transformation are not known, our goal is to profile biopsy tissues collected from the&#xD;
      prospective cohort of 60 men, analyzed by IHC for p53, Ki67, cyclin D1, IL-6, IL-8, Cox-2,&#xD;
      DKK-1, CD44, leptin, and adiponectin. These molecules are known to be involved in&#xD;
      transformation of normal esophageal epithelium to EACs via progression from metaplasia and BE&#xD;
      to low-grade dysplasia and high-grade dysplasia. [34]. The clinical outcome measurements will&#xD;
      be correlated with the levels of these molecules, determined by IHC, with metaplasia, degree&#xD;
      of dysplasia in BE, and stage of EAC. For BE tissues, there is a correlation between the&#xD;
      extent of p53 staining and aggressive clinical features. Our preliminary findings on six BEs,&#xD;
      selected from the patient population at UAB, indicate that a high proportion of p53 staining&#xD;
      directly correlates with high-grade lesions&#xD;

      The H&amp;E sections of all biopsy specimens will be reviewed by a GI diagnostic pathologist,&#xD;
      Leona Council, MD, for histopathologic parameters including histologic grade and type. The&#xD;
      histology will be characterized according to the scale depicted in figure 1, where 0&#xD;
      represents the earliest possible injury and 3 represents malignancy. All specimens will be&#xD;
      processed in the typical manner, but reviewed by Dr. Council in the pathology department.&#xD;

        The goal of the study is to further clarify the relationship among esophageal disorders,&#xD;
        obesity and inflammatory mediators that may identify a high risk patient profile that would&#xD;
        warrant more frequent screening. We will accrue 60 men between the ages of 25 and 75 who&#xD;
        are referred for upper endoscopy for the first time or subject who have had a normal upper&#xD;
        endoscopy in the last 10 years. It is anticipated that some of the participants will not&#xD;
        have symptoms of reflux or dyspepsia. Due to the pattern of referral, however, most will&#xD;
        exhibit risk factors of esophageal disorders.&#xD;
