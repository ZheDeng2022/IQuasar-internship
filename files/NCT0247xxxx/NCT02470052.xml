  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter,single-arm,open-label study designed to evaluate improvement of lung&#xD;
      function and safety after treatment with OL-BF-001 for severe emphysema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OL-BF-001 consists of a bronchial valve, deployment catheter, loader and airway sizing kit. A&#xD;
      bronchial valve is a small, umbrella-shaped, one-way valve that is placed inside the airways&#xD;
      of one lung. It is used to redirect air from the less healthy to the more healthy parts of&#xD;
      the lung. This helps to reduce over-inflation and may improve overall lung function and&#xD;
      quality of life for people living with emphysema.&#xD;

          -  Subject must have severe dyspnea which is defined as a mMRC ≥ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject's obstructive disease is severe as defined by following post-bronchodilator&#xD;
             spirometry values: FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% and 20% of predicted ≤ FEV1 &lt; 50% of predicted&#xD;
