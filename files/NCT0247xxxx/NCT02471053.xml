    <textblock>
      As the numbers of cancer survivors grow, the long-term adverse effects of cancer therapy are&#xD;
      becoming increasingly apparent. Most prominent are the toxic effects on the heart&#xD;
      (cardiotoxicity) which may lead to cardiac dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD). The investigators hypothesize that an individualized aerobic training program&#xD;
      for cancer patients receiving active treatment will be both feasible and safe and will result&#xD;
      in improvements in overall levels of physical activity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating the recruitment, adherence and attrition rates,&#xD;
      along with program safety. Efficacy will be assessed by evaluating changes in health-related&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

      As the numbers of cancer survivors grow, the long-term adverse effects of cancer therapy are&#xD;
      becoming increasingly apparent. Most prominent are the toxic effects on the heart&#xD;
      (cardiotoxicity) which may lead to cardiac dysfunction and increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease (CVD). Of note, data indicate that the magnitude of CVD risk for long-term survivors&#xD;
      may exceed the risk of a secondary malignancy, which is a known complication of primary&#xD;
      cancer therapy. While long-term follow-up data in adult cancer survivors is lacking, study of&#xD;
      adult survivors of childhood cancers shows that these individuals are 15 times more likely to&#xD;
      develop congestive heart failure (CHF), 10 times more likely to develop CVD, and 9 times more&#xD;
      likely to suffer a stroke compared individuals who have not had cancer. Thus, it is clear&#xD;
      that the long-term cardiotoxic effects of cancer therapy represent a significant concern for&#xD;
      cancer survivors. The mechanisms responsible for the damaging effects of cancer therapy are&#xD;
      not fully understood, however there is a need to maximize the benefits of treatment while&#xD;
      minimizing long-term damage. Recent animal studies suggest that aerobic exercise training may&#xD;
      offer a protective effect against chemotherapy-induced heart disease. However, to the&#xD;
      investigator's knowledge, no study to date has examined the potential cardioprotective&#xD;
      benefits of exercise training for patients receiving cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, the purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a&#xD;
      12-week supervised exercise program based on the principles of cardiac rehabilitation for&#xD;
      patients receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating three outcomes, recruitment rate, adherence rate&#xD;
      (i.e. exercise class attendance records), attrition rate, and safety (i.e. number of adverse&#xD;
      events).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy will be assessed by evaluating changes in health-related outcomes to assess if these&#xD;
      changes are equal to or better than what was measured at baseline. The health-related&#xD;
      outcomes include cardiac function and biological markers of cardiotoxicity.&#xD;

    <description>Exercise sessions will be held twice-weekly and will begin with a group warm-up activity, followed by 45 minutes of aerobic activity and ending with a cool down. All aerobic exercise will be performed at a moderate intensity, defined as exercise that elicits a heart rate (HR) between 40-60% of heart rate reserve (HRR). Prior to the initial exercise session target heart rates will be calculated for each subject based on the maximum HR achieved during their baseline stress test.</description>
