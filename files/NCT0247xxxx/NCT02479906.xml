      Deep TMS in conjunction with brief trauma exposure will be compared to sham treatment in&#xD;
      conjunction with brief trauma exposure, in a multicenter, randomized, controlled study for&#xD;
      the treatment of PTSD. Study duration is 9 weeks, consisting of 4 weeks of treatment and a 5&#xD;
      week and 9 week follow-up visit. Subjects will be randomized to real or sham treatment&#xD;
      stratified by site. The design is meant to demonstrate that the device shows superiority&#xD;
      compared to sham treatment at the 5 week follow-up visit and at the 9 week follow-up visit, 1&#xD;
      month post-treatment.&#xD;

    The results did not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit induced specifically by the active&#xD;
