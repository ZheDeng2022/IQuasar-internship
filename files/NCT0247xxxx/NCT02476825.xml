    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, single-blind, controlled, single centre bronchoscopy study designed to&#xD;
      assess the effects of fluticasone propionate on airway gene expression and cellularity in&#xD;
      healthy adult controls without asthma. This study will allow a more accurate assessment of&#xD;
      the changes in gene/protein expression and cellularity that drive severe treatment-resistant&#xD;
      asthma by allowing for the effects that are due to corticosteroids rather than the disease to&#xD;
      be considered. This improved mechanistic understanding is important to identify novel&#xD;
      therapeutic targets in severe asthma, and to support the development of novel therapeutics.&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the corticosteroid-inducible gene expression pattern in healthy&#xD;
      airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 30 healthy adult subjects (age 18-65) will be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to one&#xD;
      of two study groups: i) patients will receive fluticasone propionate 500 mcg b.i.d. via&#xD;
      Accuhaler for 4 weeks (n=20), or ii) patients will receive no treatment for 4 weeks (n=10).&#xD;
      Bronchoscopy will be performed in all patients at baseline, prior to the start of the&#xD;
      treatment period and at the end of week 4. The PI, Genentech and Leicester laboratory support&#xD;
      staff will be blinded to treatment allocation. A control arm is included to assess the&#xD;
      repeatability of the planned analyses, the stability of the gene expression profiles measured&#xD;
      during this study period, and to provide a comparator to the treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing&#xD;
      any study-specific tests or evaluations. Consent will be obtained at the screening visit. At&#xD;
      screening, important co-morbidities will excluded . Patients will also be randomised at this&#xD;
      screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure there are sufficient data for analysis, if a subject withdraws before completion of&#xD;
      the study, they will be replaced with another subject.&#xD;
