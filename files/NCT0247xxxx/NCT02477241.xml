      Overactive Bladder syndrome (OAB) is a medical condition with symptoms of urgency, with or&#xD;
      without incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, with no proven infection or&#xD;
      obvious pathology 1. This study will explore the relationship between OAB, obstruction and&#xD;
      the micro contractions as well as the brain areas involved in both normal desire to void and&#xD;
      urgency, gaining a better understanding of the bladder pathophysiology and in the future&#xD;
      allowing better strategy of treatment options for patients suffering from OAB.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Overactive Bladder Syndrome The International Continence Society (ICS) has defined Overactive&#xD;
      Bladder syndrome (OAB) as a medical condition with symptoms of urgency, with or without&#xD;
      incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia, with no proven infection of obvious&#xD;
      pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OAB has an overall prevalence in Western Europe and the United States of 16% to 17%.&#xD;
      Epidemiological evidence indicates that symptoms of OAB are common and likely to affect up to&#xD;
      50-100 million persons worldwide. In the EPIC study which was conducted in 5 countries in &gt;&#xD;
      19000 men and women aged &gt; 18 years, using the ICS definitions for OAB, the prevalence of OAB&#xD;
      was 10.8% in men and 12.8% in women, and its prevalence increased with age. The prevalence in&#xD;
      women for storage was 59.2%, in voiding 19.5% and in post micturition symptoms 14.2%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental symptom is urgency, which is widely considered to be the driver of other&#xD;
      urological symptoms. Urgency is a sudden compelling desire to pass urine, which is difficult&#xD;
      to defer. The urological symptoms can have a considerable negative impact on quality of life,&#xD;
      typically resulting in embarrassment and loss of dignity, which might affect relationships,&#xD;
      intimacy and self-image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional urodynamic test Diagnostic testing of lower urinary tract function by performing&#xD;
      urodynamic investigations is currently widely accepted. The aim of the clinical urodynamics&#xD;
      is to produce symptoms whilst making precise measurements in order to identify underlying&#xD;
      causes for the symptoms and to quantify the related pathophysiological processes. Urodynamics&#xD;
      allows direct assessment of lower urinary tract function by the measurement of physiological&#xD;
      parameters (e.g. voiding pressure parameters; minimal urethral opening detrusor pressure and&#xD;
      urethral resistance factor), micturitions volume and leakage volume).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urodynamics cannot be performed as an automated protocol due to current limitations of&#xD;
      urodynamic equipment and the lack of consensus on the precise method of measurement, signal&#xD;
      processing, quantification, documentation and interpretation. The Good Urodynamic Practices&#xD;
      developed by ICS provides guidelines regarding the strategy for urodynamic measurement,&#xD;
      equipment set up and configuration, signal testing, plausibility controls, pattern&#xD;
      recognition, and artefact correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During cystometry, involuntary detrusor contractions can only be found in 40% to 60% of&#xD;
      patients with OAB symptoms. Detrusor overactivity contractions can occur either during&#xD;
      filling or at the end. Conventional urodynamic remains the gold standard for investigating&#xD;
      lower urinary tract dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI is an imaging modality that has recently been&#xD;
      further developed to study the different parts of the human body through blood flow changes.&#xD;
      In close collaboration with Maastricht University, Scannexus has made multiple 7 Tesla MRI&#xD;
      scans available for our study in order to gain further insight into brain functioning areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder Sensations Most of the understanding on the experience of bladder sensation during&#xD;
      filling in normal individuals is based upon the work of Wyndaele and De Wachter. The&#xD;
      sensation scoring system developed seek to determine the underlying reasons an individual&#xD;
      patient usually void and is not meant to serve as an index of urgency or severity. The&#xD;
      4-point scoring scale ranges from voiding out of convenience (no urgency=0) to desperate&#xD;
      urgency score=3) to capture perception of urgency on a continuum rather per se. The condition&#xD;
      is recognised clinically as the 'Overactive Bladder (OAB) Symptom Complex'. It is associated&#xD;
      with increased sensations to void which result in an increased voiding frequency, as&#xD;
      determined from voiding diaries. OAB is further characterised during cystometric&#xD;
      investigation by the occurrence of involuntary contractions of the bladder during the filling&#xD;
      phase and, typically in the 'full bladder' by a strong sensation described as 'urgency' (a&#xD;
      strong compelling desire to void that cannot be deferred which is more intense than a normal&#xD;
      urge to void).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is associated with episodic increased bladder sensations to&#xD;
      void, which result in increased in voiding frequency. During cystometric investigations, OAB&#xD;
      is also characterised by the occurrence of involuntary bladder contractions during the&#xD;
      filling phase and typically in the full bladder, a strong sensation described as urgency&#xD;
      (described as a strong compelling desire to void that cannot be deferred and is more intense&#xD;
      than the normal urge to void). It is during these urgency episodes that leakages (urgency&#xD;
      incontinence) sometimes occur. In 46% of patients with the sensation of urgency, it is&#xD;
      associated with bladder contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies investigated the link between patient reported sensations and bladder properties&#xD;
      using standard rapid fill cystometry. This leads to the concept that bladder sensation is&#xD;
      episodic. These episodic sensations are supposedly greater in patients with OAB and occur in&#xD;
      lower bladder volumes, thus generating the sensation of urgency and more frequent voiding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described in literature sensations associated with bladder filling were different from&#xD;
      those of imminent voiding. The sensations during filling were associated with a generalised&#xD;
      feeling in the lower abdomen while the more intense sensations of imminent pre-void were&#xD;
      located deeper down in the urethra. This anatomical variation may reflect different&#xD;
      sensations and different underlying mechanisms. This supports that there are two systems&#xD;
      generating sensation: 'continuous sensation' associated with the early filling phase and&#xD;
      intense phasic sensations associated with the urethra.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An alternative view of bladder sensation was formulated many years ago. It proposes that the&#xD;
      information from the bladder is generated continuously and that an awareness of bladder&#xD;
      volumes is available through the entire filling phase. This is supported by&#xD;
      neuro-physiological data demonstrating an almost continuous afferent outflow from the bladder&#xD;
      receptors as the bladder fills. As a conclusion the physiological bases of the sensation or&#xD;
      &quot;urge&quot; or &quot;urgency&quot; is still unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, patients with OAB with or without detrusor overactivity (DO) on urodynamics all&#xD;
      have in common that they have a sense of urgency. This sense is described as a sudden,&#xD;
      compelling desire to void, which cannot be postponed. Affected individuals have the fear to&#xD;
      loose urine (incontinence) and some even actually do. It is still not known if the same brain&#xD;
      areas are involved in a normal desire to void in controls, as in OAB patients both with and&#xD;
      without DO when they feel urgency. In our study we would like to answer this question by&#xD;
      conducting simple urodynamics during an fMRI scan while the patient's bladder is filled&#xD;
      through normal diuresis and their sense of urgency is registered through a push button.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past a few studies have been conducted with the fMRI of the central nervouse system in&#xD;
      relation to bladder control. Poor bladder control has been reported to be specifically&#xD;
      associated with inadequate activation of orbitofrontal cortex. Clinically, frontal cortical&#xD;
      lesions are known to cause bladder control problems.. In addition, urinary urgency in&#xD;
      patients with OAB was shown to be associated with increased activation of the limbic cortex&#xD;
      through fMRI studies in women with OAB. A more recent study with fMRI showed that there were&#xD;
      significant and vast changes in the brain's functional connectivity when bladder is filled,&#xD;
      suggesting that the central process responsible for the increased control during the full&#xD;
      bladder state appears to largely rely on the how distributed brain systems. In all these&#xD;
      studies, a 3 Tesla fMRI has been used. The 7 Tesla fMRI which is intended to be used in our&#xD;
      study will enable us to study brain areas that are more difficult to assess with 1,5 and 3&#xD;
      Tesla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, none of the previous studies have included a protocol to measure bladder pressure,&#xD;
      bladder sensation and fMRI scans of the brain simultaneously.&#xD;
