  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to describe in depth the CNS, CNS HIV reservoir and CNS viral rebound in&#xD;
      consenting SEARCH 019 subjects prior to, during and after the SEARCH 019 study intervention&#xD;
      (VHM + ART or ART only), at 1) baseline, 2) end of study intervention and start of ART&#xD;
      interruption, 3) viral rebound (if occurring) or mid-way during observed ART interruption,&#xD;
      and 4) at the end of ART interruption. Study SEARCH 026 itself does not employ any&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions. However, consenting subjects will participate in lumbar puncture,&#xD;
      non-contrast MRI + MRS, and neuropsychological testing at at least three and at most four&#xD;
      time points. Any of the 15 subjects to be enrolled in SEARCH 019 may consent to study SEARCH&#xD;
      026 participation and hence a maximum of 15 subjects may enroll. As this is a sub-study, data&#xD;
      will be shared from study SEARCH 019 and no interventions (venipunctures) will be repeated&#xD;
      unnecessarily.&#xD;

      1. Clinical 1.1 Neurological exam: SEARCH employs the AIDS Clinical Trials Group&#xD;
           (ACTG)-derived HIV macroneurological examination, a physician rated symptoms assessment&#xD;
           of cognitive features typical of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) and&#xD;
           peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Neuropsychological assessments: SEARCH employs the HIV neurocognitive battery&#xD;
           originally developed by Maj et al. designed to minimize cultural bias and tested in&#xD;
           Bangkok. All subjects will have the full SEARCH battery as previously published,&#xD;
           avoiding evaluations following invasive procedures. All testing is completed by&#xD;
           certified nurse-psychometrists. Data are compared to a normative set of 500&#xD;
           HIV-negative, healthy, community dwelling Thais and stratified by age and educational&#xD;
           attainment to define standardized z-scores. A psychiatric inventory mirrors that used&#xD;
           for RV254 and has broad Thai validity data, and research nurses perform a functional&#xD;
           assessment based on the Clinical Dementia Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3 Lumbar puncture: Lumbar punctures are completed per standard clinical procedures&#xD;
           using a SprotteÂ® (pencil-point) needle to minimize complications. Standard assessments&#xD;
           of CSF and serum, protein and cell count are completed and approximately 20cc are&#xD;
           collected and ultra-centrifuged. Cell pellets of CSF will be cryopreserved for future&#xD;
           potential studies, with subject consent. Supernatants are divided into 0.5cc aliquots,&#xD;
           and frozen to -80oC on the same day. CSF VDRL/RPR will be assessed at baseline for those&#xD;
           with positive serology in SEARCH 019 and in follow-up if a new positive serology is&#xD;
           reported in SEARCH 019 or if subject was CSF positive at baseline. Participant&#xD;
           hospitalization for any research-related adverse events requiring admission will be&#xD;
           arranged, if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4 Neuro-imaging: Imaging studies will be performed at the Chulalongkorn University&#xD;
           Hospital which is 100 meters from the TRCARC in Bangkok. These studies will take up to&#xD;
           one hour maximum MRI scanner time for each subject and may include brain MRI, MRS, DTI&#xD;
           and resting state functional MRI (fMRI). MRI and MRS are non-invasive methods to detect&#xD;
           brain pathology (MRI) and to determine the in-vivo concentration of brain metabolites&#xD;
           (MRS). DTI is a sensitive non-invasive magnetic resonance technique to analyze the&#xD;
           three-dimensional diffusion of water within brain tissue. The diffusion of water within&#xD;
           the brain is highly dependent on the underlying micro-architecture of the surrounding&#xD;
           tissue, which is affected by both normal physiological processes (such as aging) as well&#xD;
           as local neuropathological disease processes, such as those seen with HIV infection.&#xD;
           Resting state functional MRI (fMRI) reveals patterns of activation of brain networks and&#xD;
           is a sensitive measure of brain function prior to structural and anatomical changes&#xD;
           detected by other methods. Gadolinium will not be used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Laboratory (all pertaining to CSF)&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Measurement of soluble markers: Commercial ELISA kits (Human Quantikine ELISA kits; R&amp;D&#xD;
      Systems, Inc.) and Millipore Luminex assays will be used following manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions at the Yale Immune Monitoring Core Laboratory. Soluble biomarkers associated&#xD;
      with immune activation and neurocognitive impairment will be measured, including CSF&#xD;
      neopterin, MCP-1, sCD14, IL-6, sCD163, and IP-10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 CSF virology Assays: HIV RNA standard quantitation will be completed using the Roche&#xD;
      COBAS/Amplicor HIV-1 Viral Load v2.0 assay, with a lower limit of quantitation of 20cps/mL.&#xD;
      Single Copy Assay (SCA) HIV RNA quantitation in the setting of ART will be performed using&#xD;
      5-10 ml of CSF. In addition, cell associated HIV-DNA (total, integrated and 2LTR circles in&#xD;
      total CD4+ T cells will be assessed at CRC-CHUM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 TCR repertoire and avidity of HIV-specific CD8+ T cells in CSF: These may be measured in&#xD;
      a subset of samples at VGTI Florida. For the repertoire assay, CSF cell pellets will be&#xD;
      polyclonally expanded, and the TCR repertoire will be determined followed by TCR sequencing&#xD;
      as previously described. For TCR avidity, T cell clones corresponding to the dominant&#xD;
      clonotypes will be generated in vitro to measure their functional sensitivity. The&#xD;
      HIV-specific CD8+ T cells clones generated by expansion in the presence of PHA, IL-2 and&#xD;
      irradiated feeders will be sequenced for their TCR and will be tested for their TCR&#xD;
      functional sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Management of Subjects Resuming ART: If the decision is made to reinitiate ART as per&#xD;
      SEARCH 019 ART resumption criteria, then the study visit before ART resumption will be&#xD;
      considered this study's final visit and all procedures scheduled for end of study will be&#xD;
      conducted at that visit.&#xD;
