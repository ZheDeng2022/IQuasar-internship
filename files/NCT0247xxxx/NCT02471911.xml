  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the addition of selinexor (KPT-330) to RICE chemotherapy in the&#xD;
      treatment of relapsed and refractory aggressive B-Cell Lymphoma, with the goal of improved&#xD;
      response rates (as compared to RICE chemotherapy alone).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although aggressive B-cell lymphomas are potentially curable with front-line chemotherapy, at&#xD;
      least one-third of patients experience progression or relapse. Second-line regimens such as&#xD;
      rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (RICE) are administered with the goal of&#xD;
      cytoreduction prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in eligible patients.&#xD;
      However, half of patients who receive salvage treatment and ASCT are still not cured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selinexor is a Selective Inhibitor of Nuclear Export / SINE compound, which is a new class of&#xD;
      molecule. SINE compounds have been shown to induce apoptotic cell death in pre-clinical&#xD;
      models of AML, CLL, T-ALL, and Ph+ ALL as well as B and T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.&#xD;
      Preliminarily, selinexor has demonstrated promising single-agent clinical activity in&#xD;
      patients with previously treated NHL including DLBCL, warranting further investigation. Based&#xD;
      on promising preclinical and clinical data, selinexor is currently under evaluation in&#xD;
      combination with chemotherapy for solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that the combination of selinexor plus RICE will be&#xD;
      well-tolerated and clinically active in participants with previously treated aggressive&#xD;
      B-cell lymphomas and propose a phase I trial to evaluate this combination. Moreover,&#xD;
      Investigators will evaluate primary patient samples before and after selinexor to investigate&#xD;
      the mechanisms of action of selinexor, including the mechanisms by which selinexor sensitizes&#xD;
      cells to chemotherapy, and evaluate other novel drug combinations in aggressive B-cell&#xD;
      lymphomas.&#xD;
