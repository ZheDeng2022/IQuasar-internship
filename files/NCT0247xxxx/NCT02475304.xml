  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether FP187 is effective in the treatment of&#xD;
      mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled proof-of-concept trial to&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of FP187 compared to placebo over 24 weeks of treatment&#xD;
      in patients with mild to moderate psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The daily dose levels in the&#xD;
      FP187 arm will be 500 mg. After completion of the double blind treatment of 24 weeks, all&#xD;
      patients irrespective of their treatment arm will be switched to an additional 24 week&#xD;
      open-label treatment phase with 500 mg / day FP187. Patient who do not complete the 24 week&#xD;
      double blind part of the study as scheduled will not be eligible for participation in the&#xD;
      open-label part.&#xD;
