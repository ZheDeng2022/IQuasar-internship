      Excessive tiredness (fatigue) is a common problem in cancer patients and can affect quality&#xD;
      of life negatively. There is limited knowledge about the physical mechanisms that cause&#xD;
      fatigue, and there is no medical treatment. Physical activity can reduce the inconvenience,&#xD;
      but the investigators need to learn more about the type and intensity of exercise that works&#xD;
      the best as well as how to motivate patients to exercise. The overall aim, is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and cost-effectiveness of individually tailored high (H) and low/medium (LM)&#xD;
      intensity physical training, with or without behavioural medicine (BM) support strategies,&#xD;
      during adjuvant oncological treatment on; Cancer Related Fatigue (CRF),Quality of Life (QoL),&#xD;
      mood disturbance, adherence to the cancer treatment, adverse effects, disease outcome, return&#xD;
      to a daily life after completed treatment and return to work. The investigators will also&#xD;
      describe changes in inflammatory markers and cytokines related to physical training and gene&#xD;
      expressions following training to investigate whether these serve as mediators for the&#xD;
      effects of physical training on CRF and QoL. This will be evaluated in newly diagnosed&#xD;
      breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients during adjuvant therapy at three different&#xD;
      centres in Sweden; Uppsala, Lund/Malmö and Linköping. A 2x2 factorial design will be used,&#xD;
      600 patients will be randomised to H, H+BM, LM or LM+BM. Patients will train two times per&#xD;
      week during 6 months. This project will give; new knowledge about aspects for individuals to&#xD;
      gain improved well-being and quality of life, facilitated return to work, and possibly&#xD;
      reduced risk of cancer recurrence. This in turn would result in lower burden on the health&#xD;
      care system, reduced societal costs and have a positive impact on public health.&#xD;
      Implementation of the results into clinical practice will be facilitated by the close&#xD;
      collaboration between researchers and clinicians, and the fact that the study is performed in&#xD;
      clinical settings.&#xD;

      Purpose and Aims The main aim is to determine the effects of high or low intensity physical&#xD;
      training with or without integrated behavioral medicine support strategies to prevent and&#xD;
      minimize cancer related fatigue (CRF), improve health related quality of life (QoL) and to&#xD;
      understand the role of inflammation and cytokines in the development and maintenance of CRF,&#xD;
      as well as to increase knowledge with respect to cost-effectiveness of rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs. This will be evaluated in newly diagnosed breast, colorectal and prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients during adjuvant therapy at three different centers in Sweden; Uppsala, Lund/Malmö&#xD;
      and Linköping and one in Norway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More specifically, the investigators' objectives are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigate the effects of high intensity training compared to low intensity training on&#xD;
           patient reported outcomes (CRF as primary endpoint), chemotherapy/radiation completion&#xD;
           rates, medical (oncology) adverse effects, physical activity and daily function, during&#xD;
           adjuvant treatment and at long-term-follow up. In addition, effects on the course of&#xD;
           disease (e.g time to relapse).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Investigate if supplemental behavioural medicine support strategies increase adherence&#xD;
           to exercise during adjuvant therapy and further if they increase the maintenance of&#xD;
           physical activity behaviours and decrease sedentary time in the long run.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Explore the role of changes in inflammatory markers and cytokines related to physical&#xD;
           training and following training to investigate whether these serve as mediators for the&#xD;
           effects of physical training on CRF and QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pursue the investigation of a direct role of cytokines secreted from the working&#xD;
           muscles, in inhibiting cancer cell growth and inducing apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Evaluate health economic issues; cost effectiveness of the interventions, health&#xD;
           production and individual wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phys-Can, the investigators will implement rigorously designed and adequately powered&#xD;
      randomized longitudinal multicenter clinical trials, with physical training and behavioral&#xD;
      medicine support interventions. The highly multi- and interdisciplinary and international&#xD;
      consortium behind this proposal is in an excellent position to perform international and&#xD;
      interdisciplinary competence- and network-building activities to generate valid, high quality&#xD;
      data covering all areas included in the project, from basic biomedical data to patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes (PROs), i.e. from bench to bedside. This is unique in health care sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design A 2x2 factorial design will be used. With this design the investigators can&#xD;
      study main effects and interactions between factors (groups). Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      one of the following groups; A) individually tailored high intensity training twice a week&#xD;
      with (H+BM) or without behavioral medicine support strategies (H) or B) individually tailored&#xD;
      low intensity training twice a week with (L+BM) or without behavioral medicine support&#xD;
      strategies (L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample/procedure Patients, who are recently diagnosed with breast cancer, colorectal&#xD;
      cancer or prostate cancer and scheduled for adjuvant therapy at Uppsala, Lund/Malmö,&#xD;
      Linköping and Haukeland University hospitals will be consecutively included in the study.&#xD;
      Based on the power calculation, 612 patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will exercise twice a week during 6 months which is equal to the most extensive&#xD;
      adjuvant treatment period. It is also an optimal period to achieve physical training effects&#xD;
      and to establish physical activity behavior. Physical training under the guidance of trained&#xD;
      coaches will be offered twice a week. Training intensity is 40-50% (low intensity group) or&#xD;
      80-90% (high intensity group) of maximal cardiorespiratory fitness/muscular strength.&#xD;
      Physical training sessions consist of both cardiorespiratory and resistance exercise. Every&#xD;
      four week, progress from resistance training is evaluated by means of a strength test, and&#xD;
      absolute intensity is adjusted accordingly Motivational and self-regulatory behavioral&#xD;
      medicine support strategies (motivational and self-regulatory strategies) will be provided&#xD;
      for the H+BM and the L+BM groups i.e. strategies to enhance engagement in the high and low&#xD;
      intensity exercise programs respectively, and to maintain health enhancing physical activity&#xD;
      after the completion of the programs.&#xD;
