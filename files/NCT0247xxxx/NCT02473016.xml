    <description>All subjects will receive both Active (Carbon Dioxide Drug Delivery System) and Placebo. This is a single-blind study so subjects will not know the order. Subjects will receive 3 doses of active and 3 doses of placebo. One dose is a 60 second delivery of CO2 or placebo. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects may receive up to 3 additional doses of CO2.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female, 18 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of classical trigeminal neuralgia with or without persistent background facial&#xD;
             pain, not secondary, as defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders&#xD;
             (ICHD), third edition, beta version (ICHD-3 beta, Cephalalgia 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia (TN) for at least 60 days prior to enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Experience pain with a score of at least 5 on a 0-10 scale during a typical TN episode&#xD;
             as reported by subject. Note: Prior to treatment pain score must a 5 or greater on a&#xD;
             VAS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of unilateral typical TN pain predominantly in the V2 branch of the trigeminal&#xD;
             nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absence of a significant structural lesion (e.g., a tumor) as the cause of pain as&#xD;
             shown in at least one neuro-imaging study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  On stable dose of all medications, including those for the treatment of TN&#xD;
             prevention/prophylaxis, for at least 14 days prior to baseline (including, but not&#xD;
             limited to, verapamil, lithium, melatonin, any anticonvulsant, any systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroid or steroid injection, occipital nerve block, other cranial or&#xD;
             extracranial nerve block, or any neurostimulation treatment). Note: Subjects are&#xD;
             allowed to use their usual standard of care for the acute/abortive treatment of&#xD;
             trigeminal neuralgia attacks 60 or more minutes after the initial dose, provided it is&#xD;
             approved by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of completing a diary.&#xD;
&#xD;

             respiratory diseases, heart disease, etc.) that precludes participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant nasal disorder (deviated septum, presence of polyps, evidence&#xD;
             of significant congestion, rhinitis, or other nasal abnormalities) that prevents&#xD;
             unrestricted breathing through each nostril.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently on anticoagulants or have a diagnosis of a bleeding disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of fibromyalgia, temporomandibular disorders (TMD), odontogenic pain&#xD;
             or other orofacial pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Surgery for treatment of TN within 30 days prior to screening. Note: Investigator must&#xD;
             ensure that patients who have had surgery have recovered and are not experiencing any&#xD;
             side effects from surgery for treatment of TN&#xD;
