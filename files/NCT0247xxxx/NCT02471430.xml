      This study is a prospective, open-label, randomized, three-arm, dose-escalation exploratory&#xD;
      pilot clinical trial involving HIV-1 infected participants treated with suppressive&#xD;
      combination antiretroviral combination therapy (cART). The study will test whether combined&#xD;
      treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat and the immunomodulatory&#xD;
      cytokine Interferon-alpha2a can reduce the residual reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells that&#xD;
      persist during treatment with currently available antiretroviral drugs.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, triple-arm, randomized, open-label, dose-escalation exploratory&#xD;
      clinical trial involving HIV-1 infected participants treated with suppressive combination&#xD;
      antiretroviral combination therapy (cART). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      a new strategy for reducing the residual reservoir of HIV-1 infected cells that persists&#xD;
      despite treatment with current HIV drugs. The clinical trial is conducted in the Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Clinical Trials Unit (CTU) at the Massachusetts General Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medication includes two agents: panobinostat is an oral tablet that can reverse&#xD;
      HIV-1 latency and awaken HIV from a &quot;sleeping&quot; condition during which it is protected from&#xD;
      the human immune system. The second drug is pegylated interferon-alpha2a (IFN-alpha2a), an&#xD;
      injectable cytokine that activates the immune system. The combined use of both agents may&#xD;
      lead to immune-mediated elimination of HIV-1 infected cells in which viral latency has been&#xD;
      reversed by panobinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to receive a treatment course with panobinostat alone (Arm A,&#xD;
      4 participants total), panobinostat in combination with pegylated IFN-alpha2a (Arm B, 10&#xD;
      participants total), or pegylated IFN-alpha2a alone (Arm C, 4 participants total).&#xD;
      Participants receiving panobinostat will undergo one week of treatment (15mg, dosed every&#xD;
      second day on Monday, Wednesday, Friday), followed by three weeks off-treatment. Subcutaneous&#xD;
      injections with pegylated IFN-alpha2a will be administered at the start of the week-long&#xD;
      treatment course (simultaneously with the first dose of panobinostat for Arm B). ART will be&#xD;
      continued during the entire treatment duration in all study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo close monitoring for side effects during the entire time of study&#xD;
      participation. The total study duration will be 2 months.&#xD;
