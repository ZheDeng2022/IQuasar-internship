  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in&#xD;
      HIV-positive adults who were virologically suppressed and who were on antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ruxolitinib is a medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat&#xD;
      myelofibrosis, a disorder in which bone marrow is replaced by scar (fibrosis) tissue. Many of&#xD;
      the cytokines affected by myelofibrosis are also affected by HIV. Because of this,&#xD;
      ruxolitinib may also be a possible treatment for HIV. The purpose of this study was to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of ruxolitinib in HIV-positive adults who were on ART&#xD;
      and who were virologically suppressed. Researchers evaluated the effect ruxolitinib had on&#xD;
      inflammation and immune activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study enrolled HIV-positive adults who were on select ART regimens and who had viral&#xD;
      suppression. ART was not provided by the study; participants continued to receive ART from&#xD;
      their own health care providers. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either&#xD;
      ruxolitinib (Arm A) or no study treatment (Arm B) in 2:1 ratio. Participants in Arm A&#xD;
      received ruxolitinib twice a day for 5 weeks. All participants attended study visits at entry&#xD;
      (Day 0) and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 12. These visits included physical examinations,&#xD;
      clinical assessments, blood collection, adherence assessments, oral swab collection, and&#xD;
      pregnancy testing for female participants. At Weeks 1 and 4, participants in Arm A took part&#xD;
      in pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling, which involved having blood drawn several times over 6 to 8&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;

          <title>Fold Change in the Level of Soluble CD14 (sCD14)</title>
          <description>All values were log10 transformed prior to calculating change and conducting analyses and back transformed for presentation.&#xD;
Baseline is defined as the geometric mean of the Pre-entry and Entry values. Week 4/5 is defined as the geometric mean of the Week 4 and Week 5 values. Fold change was calculated as the value at Week 4/5 divided by the value at Baseline, the value at Week 12 divided by the value at Baseline, and the value at Week 12 divided by the value at Week 4/5.</description>

Fold change was calculated as the value at Week 5 divided by the value at Entry and the value at Week 12 divided by the value at Entry.</description>
          <population>Analysis was done in the as-treated population (had data at baseline and week 4/5; for the Ruxolitinib arm, remained on study treatment through week 4/5 and missed no more than 6 doses cumulatively; did not change ART, use prohibited medications, or have confirmed virologic failure through week 4/5; not found to be ineligible after randomization).</population>
