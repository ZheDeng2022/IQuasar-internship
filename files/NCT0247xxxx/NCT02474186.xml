      1. To induce immunity-mediated tumor response outside the radiation field (abscopal effect)&#xD;
           after chemo-radiation of a metastatic site in a pilot study of metastatic breast and&#xD;
           other metastatic solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To monitor the induction of a T cell response in patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To explore the role of PET scanning to assess tumor response/abscopal effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible are women with metastatic breast cancer and patients with other metastatic solid&#xD;
      tumors who have achieved stable disease or have disease progression after systemic therapy&#xD;
      and have at least three separate measurable sites of disease. Extent of metastatic disease is&#xD;
      recorded both at CT and PET scanning. Radiation is given during systemic therapy to one of&#xD;
      the lesions, 35 Gy in ten fractions over a two week interval, conformally to maximally spare&#xD;
      normal tissue. GM-CSF treatment is given daily for fourteen days. At day 22 radiation is&#xD;
      re-started and the same radiation dose is delivered to a second metastatic site, again with&#xD;
      GM-CSF. Abscopal response is evaluated by assessing clinical and PET response in the&#xD;
      non-irradiated measurable metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum&#xD;
      two-stage Phase II Simon design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be&#xD;
      treated in Stage one; if there are no abscopal responses, the trial will be terminated. If&#xD;
      there are one or more abscopal responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an&#xD;
      additional 19 patients.&#xD;
