      Hypothesis : At hospital discharge for home, the medical prescription of ONS according to the&#xD;
      official criteria of SSNC and the legal regulations (completed prescription according to&#xD;
      health's insurance and homecare delivery) dictates the compliance of the patient and the&#xD;
      reimbursement of the ONS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Rationale : At hospital admission, patients with an acute or chronically impaired nutritional&#xD;
      balance are at nutritional risk. These patients can be identified by the Nutritional Risk&#xD;
      Score 2002 (NRS 2002). Oral Nutritive Supplements (ONS) represent the first line of nutrition&#xD;
      intervention. ONS are frequently prescribed during the hospital stay, and should be continued&#xD;
      or discontinued after the hospital discharge. This latter decision should be based on&#xD;
      officials criteria, defined by the Swiss Society for Clinical Nutrition (SSNC). To allow ONS&#xD;
      reimbursement according to the legal regulations, all required administrative actions should&#xD;
      be completed at the time of ONS prescription until the end of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Center : Geneva University Hospital (HUG), site of Cluse-Roseraie.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design : Quality control prospective observational survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population : Hospitalized adults patients with Oral Nutritive Supplements (ONS). Four hundred&#xD;
      patients to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration : Inclusion from April to December 2015 (9 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : At hospital discharge for home, the medical prescription of ONS according to the&#xD;
      official criteria of SSNC and the legal regulations (completed prescription according to&#xD;
      health's insurance and homecare delivery) dictates the compliance of the patient and the&#xD;
      reimbursement of the ONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims : The primary aim is to document the existence of an ONS medical prescription during the&#xD;
      hospitalization and at hospital discharge for home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims are to describe :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NRS 2002 score when prescribing ONS during the hospitalization, at hospital discharge&#xD;
           for home and one month after hospital discharge for home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Indications for ONS prescription at hospital discharge for home according to the&#xD;
           official criteria of SSNC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of ONS prescription at hospital discharge for home&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of ONS consumed one month after hospital discharge compared to prescription at&#xD;
           hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Timing of the discontinuation of the ONS treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reasons for stopping the ONS intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods : Included are all hospitalized adults patients with ONS prescription at the HUG.&#xD;
      Excluded are patients with ONS delivery by a homecare before the admission at the HUG or&#xD;
      patients refusing to consume ONS or patients with major disorders of consciousness (ex :&#xD;
      dementia) or patients unable to consume ONS (ex : dysphagia, dysfunction of upper limbs,&#xD;
      etc.) or patients refusing to participate to the survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion, the comorbidities will be assessed by the Charlson Comorbidity Index. ONS&#xD;
      prescription and nutritional risk by the NRS 2002 score will be described at hospital and at&#xD;
      hospital discharge for home. One month after hospital discharge for home, patient's&#xD;
      compliance to ONS will be assessed as nutritional risk by the NRS 2002 score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics : Data will be presented as mean Â± standard deviation or as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages according to the relevance, and analyzed using Chi-squared test or unpaired&#xD;
      t-test as required.&#xD;
