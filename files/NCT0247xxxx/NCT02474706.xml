      Background Information: Infections caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing&#xD;
      Escherichia coli are becoming increasingly common owing to incorrect use of antibiotics and&#xD;
      cross-transmission in healthcare establishments. These give rise to major problems in&#xD;
      standard clinical practice: penicillins and cephalosporins cannot be used, and resistance to&#xD;
      the other classes of antibiotics normally used, such as fluoroquinolones or cotrimoxazole, is&#xD;
      very frequently observed. The current therapeutic strategy involves the use of a carbapenem,&#xD;
      which represents the last effective solution on an individual level. However, the growing use&#xD;
      thereof is contributing, collectively, to the development of resistance due to the production&#xD;
      of carbapenemases, which will become a major public health problem, with a potential&#xD;
      therapeutic dead-end. This observation is particularly worrying due to the very small number&#xD;
      of antibiotic agents currently in development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infectious disease specialists and microbiologists are thus examining alternative agents to&#xD;
      carbapenems in the management of infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli. One of the&#xD;
      avenues which could be developed is the use of known agents, already on the market, which are&#xD;
      active in vitro on ESBL-producing E. coli, but which are not currently recommended for this&#xD;
      indication in standard practice due to the lack of conclusive studies. Cefoxitin, an&#xD;
      antibiotic belonging to the cephamycin group, could thus represent an alternative of&#xD;
      particular interest in the treatment of infections caused by ESBL-producing E. coli, and help&#xD;
      limit the use of carbapenems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The implementation of a prospective, randomized, non-inferiority study on ertapenem and&#xD;
      cefoxitin is of the most interest from a methodological perspective. It will enable&#xD;
      recommendations to be drawn up, with a high level of evidence, very long-awaited in the&#xD;
      field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To evaluate the bacteriological non-inferiority of cefoxitin versus&#xD;
      imipenem in the treatment of non-severe urinary tract infections (other than cystitis) caused&#xD;
      by ESBL-producing E. coli susceptible in vitro to cefoxitin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the clinical non-inferiority of cefoxitin versus imipenem in the treatment&#xD;
           of non-severe urinary tract infections (other than cystitis) caused by ESBL-producing E.&#xD;
           coli susceptible in vitro to cefoxitin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the impact of cefoxitin and imipenem on the emergence of multiresistant&#xD;
           bacteria in the gut flora.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commensal enterobacteriaceae of the digestive tract, mostly represented by E.coli, can cause&#xD;
      a wide range of infections such as urinary tract infections or severe bacteraemia. For&#xD;
      several years now, the misuse of antibiotics and cross-transmission in hospitals have led to&#xD;
      the emergence of Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL). The&#xD;
      rising prevalence of ESBL is estimated at 8.2% in healthcare settings and at 6.2% in the&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carbapenems are considered the reference treatment for ESBL-producing E.coli (EESBL)&#xD;
      infections. They often remain the last effective treatment on an individual level. But on a&#xD;
      larger scale, their increasing use contributes to the emergence of resistance that might soon&#xD;
      become a major public health issue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the prevalence of ESBL remains low, the rate of ESBL epidemics in French hospitals&#xD;
      has increased hugely since 2004. This could become a cause of concern especially because very&#xD;
      few antibacterial agents are currently in development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So infectiologists and microbiologists have to consider alternatives to carbapenems to treat&#xD;
      infections caused by EESBL, which is stipulated in the new recommendations from the French&#xD;
      High Council for Public Health and the Infectious Disease Society of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older and well-known molecules that have proved to be effective in-vitro against EESBL may be&#xD;
      an option. However due to a lack of conclusive studies, they're still not recommended in&#xD;
      these cases. Cefoxitin, a cephamycin antibiotic, may be a good alternative treatment for&#xD;
      EESBL infections and contribute to spare the use of carbapenems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality and innovation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies of cephamycins have shown encouraging results, but they were mostly cohort&#xD;
      trials with retrospective data or subsets of non-randomized studies. So a randomized&#xD;
      prospective non-inferiority study comparing ertapenem and cefoxitine is necessary. If the&#xD;
      results show non-inferiority of cefoxitine versus ertapenem, immediate clinical application&#xD;
      should ensue and lead to new recommendations, highly anticipated by the infectiologists who&#xD;
      support this project via their clinical research network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project feasibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pace of inclusions has been calculated based on recent data on cefoxitine,&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin sensitivity EESBL, 68% of EESBL are&#xD;
      susceptible to céfoxitine and resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin.&#xD;
      In 2011, 16 French laboratories, involved in the EARSS network, isolated 582 EESBL strains&#xD;
      from blood culture. In the university hospital of Nancy, 205 EESBL strains were isolated from&#xD;
      urine cultures in 2012. The challenge of including 250 patients with ESBL E.coli positive&#xD;
      urine culture, in 18 months and in about 20 participating French centers, seems highly&#xD;
      feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent data showed that 68% of EESBL are susceptible to céfoxitine and resistant to&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ciprofloxacin. In the university hospital of Nancy, 205&#xD;
      EESBL strains were isolated from urine cultures in 2012. The challenge of including 250&#xD;
      patients with ESBL E.coli positive urine culture, in 18 months and in about 20 participating&#xD;
      French centers, seems highly feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits for patients and/or public health Immediate benefits are expected, on an&#xD;
      individual level and on a wider scale. Indeed for the patient, the use of narrow-specturm&#xD;
      antibiotics, but with an equivalent efficacy, decreases the risk of selecting even more&#xD;
      highly resistant bacteria than EESBL in the digestive tract, such as carbapenemase-producing&#xD;
      enterobacteriaceae (CPE). A patient colonized with CPE is at high risk of developing a CPE&#xD;
      infection and the rates of recovery are low because of the small number of antibiotics that&#xD;
      remain effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the community level, the main challenge is the preservation of carbapenems (one of the&#xD;
      last families of antibiotics still effective in the treatment of ESBL infections), and the&#xD;
      restriction of its usage to the treatment of severe infections only. The increasing use of&#xD;
      carbapenems generates a high selection pressure on enterobacteriaceae which results in a&#xD;
      worrying increase of the prevalence of CPE. Moreover, the few remaining effective&#xD;
      antimicrobials induce high rates of side effects. The assessment of the non-inferiority of&#xD;
      older, well-known and active molecules such as cefoxitin is a highly anticipated and&#xD;
      encouraging research area, especially because the molecules currently under development are&#xD;
      far from being on the market.&#xD;
