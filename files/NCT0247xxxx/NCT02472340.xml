  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In recent years, evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction plays an important role in&#xD;
      the development of age-related muscle decline that may lead to frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During aging, there is a progressive reduction in the cell's capacity to eliminate its&#xD;
      dysfunctional elements by autophagy, as evidenced by the accumulation of oxidative damage and&#xD;
      mutations in mitochondria and by the decrease in autophagic flux. In fact, it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that dysfunctional mitochondria can be specifically targeted for elimination by&#xD;
      autophagy, a process that has been termed mitophagy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major challenge in the clinic today is in the lack of validated tools, including&#xD;
      biomarkers, to assess the decline in mitochondrial health associated with an impairment in&#xD;
      muscle function. In the present study, the investigators will employ a battery of established&#xD;
      and exploratory tests (clinical, physiological and molecular) to assess in vivo mitochondrial&#xD;
      function and more specifically, the levels of mitophagy and autophagy, in the muscle of&#xD;
      healthy and pre-frail elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is anticipated that the results of this study will facilitate the rapid translation of&#xD;
      interventions targeting mitophagy and autophagy for the improvement of muscle function.&#xD;
