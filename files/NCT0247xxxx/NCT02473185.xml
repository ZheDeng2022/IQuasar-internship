      Aim: The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of medication, placebo and&#xD;
      expectation on objective and self-rated performance of ADHD core signs during the Quantified&#xD;
      Behavior Test in patients with untreated ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Participants are 40 consecutive patients remitted to a neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      investigation at the Dependence Clinic Västmanland, Västerås, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The&#xD;
      study is taken place during four hours on two investigating days, separated by a 4 days&#xD;
      wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients participate on two occasions: In one session they receive the Methylphenidate&#xD;
      (MPH) condition, and in the other session they receive the placebo condition. MPH and placebo&#xD;
      conditions are counterbalanced across subjects such that half of the participants receive MPH&#xD;
      first, and the other half of the participants receive placebo first. Neither the participant&#xD;
      nor the research assistant is aware when the participant receive the MPH condition or the&#xD;
      placebo condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each investigating day the participant accomplish Questionnaires (Visual Analogical&#xD;
      Scales) concerning; (a) expectation, (b) self-rated performance, (c) exhausting exercise, (d)&#xD;
      perceived help from the pill and (e) self-rated symptoms. In addition the participant&#xD;
      completed A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) and two separate Quantified Behavior Test&#xD;
      Plus (QbTest) without medication vs MPH/Placebo. QbTest aims to provide objective information&#xD;
      regarding core-symptoms of ADHD; hyperactivity on the basis of motor-activity measured with&#xD;
      the camera, and inattention and impulsivity on basis of the CPT-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quantized Behavior Test (QbTest) can be included as part of an neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      investigation. QbTest measures the three core signs of ADHD, hyperactivity, inattention and&#xD;
      impulsivity. QbTest is a computer-based test that combines a test of attention ability with a&#xD;
      movement analysis based on an infrared measurement system. The test results are presented in&#xD;
      a report and compared with norm data fromm a group of the same sex amd age who do not have&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction During the last decade, neuropsychiatric impairments in adults have more often&#xD;
      been observed. Requests for neuropsychiatric investigations, especially concerning Attention&#xD;
      Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has increased. The core ADHD symptoms in adults include&#xD;
      a frequent and persistent pattern of inattention/distractibility and/or&#xD;
      hyperactivity/impulsivity (Adler 2004; Adler &amp; Chua 2002; McGough &amp; Barkley 2004). In a&#xD;
      Swedish study, 22 % of the outpatients in general psychiatric care, were diagnosed with ADHD&#xD;
      (Nylander et al 2009).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals with ADHD also have an increased risk for other psychiatric disorders, e.g. major&#xD;
      depressive episodes, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and antisocial personality disorder&#xD;
      (Rasmussen &amp; Levander 2009; Torgersen, Gjervan &amp; Rasmussen 2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' expectation can influence the outcome of a treatment (Bingel et al 2011). Linde et&#xD;
      al showed that patients with high expectations before the acupuncture treatment, achieved&#xD;
      better treating result than the patients who had lower expectations of treatment (Linde,&#xD;
      Fässler &amp; Meissner 2011). A person's expectation is an important part of the so-called&#xD;
      placebo effect . The placebo effect is well known and clinically important phenomenon in the&#xD;
      patient's treatment. Extensive research has been conducted to elucidate this (Meissner et al&#xD;
      2011; Collocca et al 2013; Enck et al 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacotherapy, mainly with central stimulant medication, is considered to be the treatment&#xD;
      of choice for ADHD. In addition, there are patients who request an ADHD diagnosis to obtain&#xD;
      drug treatment (Harrison, Edwards &amp; Parker 2007). Some of these patients have often learned&#xD;
      to deal with awkward and difficult life situations using drugs (Whalen &amp; Henker 1976; Pelham&#xD;
      &amp; Lang 1993). This may increases the risk that the person receives a low confidence in their&#xD;
      own ability to solve critical situations without drugs. Therefore, it is important to&#xD;
      identify those patients in order to give them a treatment specialized to their need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to investigate whether the patient's expectation of their own ability to&#xD;
      solve problems increases when they take a drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The purpose of the study is to examine the effects of medication, placebo and expectation&#xD;
      on objective and self-rated performance of ADHD core signs during the Quantified Behavior&#xD;
      Test in patients with untreated ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This leads to the following questions ;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does the participant's self-rated expectation of future performance change in the&#xD;
           presence of active drug or placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the participant's self-rated performance change in the presence of active drug or&#xD;
           placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Does the participant's perception of exertion change in the presence of active drug or&#xD;
           placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Does the participant's performance on the core signs, Hyperactivity, Inattention and&#xD;
           Impulsivity on the QbTest change in the presence of active drug or placebo ?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Does the participant's experience of the tablet's efficacy change in the presence of&#xD;
           active drug or placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The study is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. The&#xD;
      study is taken place during four hours on two investigating days, separated by a 4 days&#xD;
      wash-out period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects Participants are 40 consecutive patients remitted to a neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      investigation at the Dependence Clinic Västmanland, Västerås, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments The Quantized Behavior Test (QbTest) can be included as part of an&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric investigation. QbTest measures the three core signs of ADHD, hyperactivity,&#xD;
      inattention and impulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The QbTest combines a Continuous Performance Test (CPT) installed as a software program on a&#xD;
      PC with measures of attention and impulsivity and an activity test with measures of&#xD;
      motor-activity during 20 minutes. While performing the CPT-test on the computer, movements of&#xD;
      the participant are recorded using an infrared camera following a reflective marker attached&#xD;
      to a head-band. The CPT-test involves rapid presentations of figures with various shapes&#xD;
      (square or circle) and colors (red or blue) and the participant are instructed to press a&#xD;
      handheld button when a stimuli subsequently repeats itself (a target) and not to press the&#xD;
      button when the stimulus varies relative to the previous one (a non-target). The stimuli are&#xD;
      presented at a pace of one per two seconds, each one visible for 200 milliseconds, and the&#xD;
      total number of stimuli is 600, presented with a 25% target probability (Knagenhjelm &amp;&#xD;
      Ulberstad 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical documentation for QbTest is extensive. Lis et al demonstrated that patients with&#xD;
      ADHD were significantly different in the variables of attention and activity from a control&#xD;
      group of healthy individuals (Lis et al 2010). Edebol showed that QbTest has a sensitivity of&#xD;
      83 % and a specificity of 57% to detect ADHD in adults (Edebol et al 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The discriminative validity was tested and the results show that QbTest differ not only&#xD;
      between those with ADHD and healthy controls , but between clients with ADHD and other&#xD;
      clinical groups (Söderström, Pettersson &amp; Nilsson 2014; Edebol, Helldin &amp; Norlander 2012).&#xD;
      QbTest has also shown good results as an objective method for monitoring drug treatment with&#xD;
      methylphenidate (Ginsberg, Hirvikoski &amp; Grann 2012; Edebol, Helldin &amp; Norlander 2013;&#xD;
      Bijlenga &amp; Henker 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Quick Test measure processing speed and automaticity of naming shapes and colours,&#xD;
      Cognitive shifts between visual dimensions and semantic fields and Activation of working&#xD;
      memory for processing and monitoring. AQT's objective measures are based on clocked&#xD;
      total-naming time. Highly reliable (r = .88 - 96) over time and consistent over repeated&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure All patients participate on two occasions: In one session they receive the&#xD;
      Methylphenidate (MPH) condition, and in the other session they receive the placebo condition.&#xD;
      MPH and placebo conditions are counterbalanced across subjects such that half of the&#xD;
      participants receive MPH first, and the other half of the participants receive placebo first.&#xD;
      Neither the participant nor the research assistant is aware when the participant receive the&#xD;
      MPH condition or the placebo condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each investigating day the participant accomplish Questionnaires (Visual Analogical&#xD;
      Scales) concerning; (a) expectation, (b) self-rated performance, (c) exhausting exercise, (d)&#xD;
      perceived help from the pill and (e) self-rated symptoms. In addition the participant&#xD;
      completed A Quick Test of Cognitive Speed (AQT) and two separate Quantified Behavior Test&#xD;
      Plus (QbTest) without medication vs MPH/Placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analyses In this study, hyperactivity has been operationalized with the parameter called&#xD;
      &quot;distance&quot;, i.e., the length of the path in metres describing the movement of the headband&#xD;
      reflector during the test period. Inattention is operationalized on the basis of omission&#xD;
      errors. An omission error occurs when no response is registered when the stimulus was a&#xD;
      Target, i.e. the button was not pressed when it should have been. Impulsivity is&#xD;
      operationalized on the bases of commission errors. A commission error occurs when a response&#xD;
      is registered when the stimulus was a Non-Target, i.e. the handheld button is pressed when it&#xD;
      should not have been pressed.&#xD;
