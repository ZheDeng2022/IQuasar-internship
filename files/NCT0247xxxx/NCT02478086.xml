      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The preterm newborn of extremely low birth weight (PNELW), endures adverse nutritional&#xD;
      conditions to mimic intrauterine growth. It´s known that amino acids contribute to protein&#xD;
      synthesis, but also intervene in weight gain. Most newborns receive amino acids throw&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition at a doses of 3.5gr/k/day, that doses its unable to reach the birth&#xD;
      weight when discharged, so the weight its below the 10th percentile, which rises the risk for&#xD;
      presenting alterations in neurodevelopment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare a higher doses of parenteral amino acids vs. standard doses, expecting an&#xD;
      increased weight gain in the high amino acid doses group, meanwhile following the renal&#xD;
      function security profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomize, single blind clinical trial, carried on, in the Neonatology Service of Unidad&#xD;
      Medica de Alta Especialidad Numero 48 of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social, in the&#xD;
      city of Leon, Mexico. Between the period of 1st August 2012 to 31 January 2013. A standard&#xD;
      doses of amino acids was administered (3.5gr) to a control group and a high doses (4gr) to an&#xD;
      experimental group. Weight, urea, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured&#xD;
      weekly. In the study were included all preterm newborns (PN) weighting less than 1500 grs and&#xD;
      with less than 32 weeks of gestational age that match all the inclusion criteria. Statics&#xD;
      Analysis: descriptive statistics were calculates, also chi2 test and Fisher Exact test were&#xD;
      applied to categorical variables, t-student test to continuous variables, and ANOVA in&#xD;
      multiple groups.&#xD;

      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Types of study: randomized single-blinded clinical trial. Time and place of development:&#xD;
      Neonatology Service (NICU, Neonatal Ward and Premature Ward) in the Unidad Medica de Alta&#xD;
      Especialidad Número 48, of Instituto Mexican del Seguro Social in Leon, Mexico, in the period&#xD;
      between 1st of August 2012 and 31st of January 2013. This study was approved by local ethical&#xD;
      committees of the hospital and University of Guanajuato. Informed consent was requested in&#xD;
      writing to parents to include their children into the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Preterm infant of less than 32 gestational weeks and weighting less than 1500g.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preterm infant with severe congenital malformation&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with acute kidney failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inform consent form not signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology For the accomplishment of the present trial all premature patients weighting less&#xD;
      than 1500g and less than 32 weeks of age were included, and also the patients referred by the&#xD;
      other units in less than 24h after birth. Randomization was carried out using closed&#xD;
      envelopes with the assigned amino acid doses, constituting two groups: group A with an&#xD;
      initial doses of 2.5 g/kg/day with daily increments of 0.5 g/kg/day until reaching 3.5&#xD;
      g/kg/day; group B with an initial doses of 2.5 g/kg/day with daily increments of 0.5 g/kg/day&#xD;
      until reaching 4 g/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amino acids administered are from Pisa Laboratory (Levamin Nomo 10%, ®), with the&#xD;
      following composition in every 100 ml: 511 mg of L-isoleucine, 725mg of L-leucine, 934 mg of&#xD;
      L-licina, 396 mg of L-methionine, 724 mg of L-phenylalanine, 514 of L-threonine, 180mg of&#xD;
      L-tryptophan, 668 mg of L-valine, 1025 mg of L-arginine, 443 mg of L-histidine, 1469 mg of&#xD;
      L-alanine, 40 mg of L-Sistine, 1198 mg of Glycine, 590 mg of L-proline, 500 mg of L-serine,&#xD;
      235 mg of L-aspartic acid, 309 mg of L-glutamine acid and 36mg of L-tyrosine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study of renal function baseline urea, creatinine and BUN were measured within 24 h&#xD;
      after birth in order to avoid any alteration cost by mother alter kidney function, afterwards&#xD;
      the same markers were measured at the day 7, 14, 21 and 28. These markers were measure using&#xD;
      orto-clinical diagnostic series 50-0278 USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anthropometric measurements were assessed weekly by the same person to avoid bias&#xD;
      (cephalic perimeter and height); weight was measured weekly using the same scale (SECA model&#xD;
      3741321009, Germany). All anthropometric and lab results were kept in a collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of sepsis was diagnosed using clinical signs of systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      and a positive blood culture, necrotizing enterocolitis was diagnosed using Bell's criteria&#xD;
      and permeable artery duct was defined by a connection between the aorta and the pulmonary&#xD;
      artery with a left to right shunt; death was also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The sample size was calculated for 24 patients in each group as necessary to&#xD;
      detect a delta of 15% in the weight variable (beta error of 20 % and alpha error of 5%). 10%&#xD;
      losses were assumed, resulting in a total of 28 needed patients per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Central tendency measures were used for all variables and also chi square test for&#xD;
      qualitative variables were applied, T-student test for continuous variables ad for multiple&#xD;
      measurements ANOVA Test was applied. The software used was NCSS v. 8.0 (Kaysville, Utah USA)&#xD;
