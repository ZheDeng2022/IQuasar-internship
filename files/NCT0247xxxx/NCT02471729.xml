    <textblock>
      Management of chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major public health problem. It is associated&#xD;
      with high mortality, frequent hospitalization and represents a large cost to the health care&#xD;
      system. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention haven't shown to be&#xD;
      effective in reducing morbidity and mortality of these patients when able to modulate the&#xD;
      activity of neuro-hormonal systems among them the sympathetic nervous system. Recent data&#xD;
      have emphasized the potential role of sympathetic renal denervation in patient with&#xD;
      hypertension. CHF per se but even more CHF associated with comorbity lead to significant&#xD;
      increase level of sympathetic tone. This is largely induced by autonomic dysfunction such as&#xD;
      chemo or baroflex abnormalities. These patients usually suffer from conditions which do not&#xD;
      allow upgrading and adapting drugs to their sympathetic condition. Hence CHF patient with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease, anemia or both have markedly high sympathetic activity and cannot be&#xD;
      exposed to higher level of RAS Blockers or beta blocker due to their renal dysfunction, they&#xD;
      thus remain with an elevated sympathetic activity worsening symptoms and prognosis. Chronic&#xD;
      heart failure affects around 100 million people worldwild imposing a significant burden on&#xD;
      health care system throughout the world. Even though symptoms are improved by heart failure&#xD;
      therapy, they remain significantly disabling for many patients. Chronic over activation of&#xD;
      the sympathetic nervous system is a major component of heart failure and involves efferent&#xD;
      and afferent pathways between brain and many organs. A new therapy directly targeting nerve&#xD;
      traffic-renal artery denervation- has been shown to be effective in drug resistant&#xD;
      hypertension, with an average drop in blood pressure of 33/12 mm hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cardiologists team of the private hospital Arnault Tzanck is willing therefore to conduct&#xD;
      a study in 12 patients with chronic systolic heart failure undergoing bilateral renal&#xD;
      denervation with an intensive protocol of observation and assessment compring a 3 day&#xD;
      hospital stay post procedure 3 and 6 months of regular outpatient follow-up.&#xD;

      Renal denervation is a new interventional cardiology technique that involves using a catheter&#xD;
      and a femoral artery, inserting an RF probe that will destroy the nerve fibers in contact&#xD;
      with the wall of the renal artery with a very small electric current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method utilizes the energy emitted by a miniaturized device positioned at the end of a&#xD;
      catheter. This catheter is positioned in the arteries going to the kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sympathetic overactivation, is reduced by renal denervation in drug-resistant hypertension.&#xD;
      Several studies conducted in patients without heart failure showed that renal denervation&#xD;
      reduces left ventricular hypertrophy beyond its only effect on blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic over activation of the sympathetic nervous system is a major component of heart&#xD;
      failure and involves efferent and afferent pathways between brain and many organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this Clinical investigation is to evaluate the safety and performance of the&#xD;
      EnligHTN™ Renal Denervation System in the treatment of patients with chronique heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be on stable maximal tolerated pharmacological therapy for HFC prior to&#xD;
      denervation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the procedure all patients will be monitored as inpatients for 3 days so that&#xD;
      hemodynamic disturbances could be identified. Baseline measurements, including BNP, echo&#xD;
      Doppler VO2 and six minutes walk test will be repeated before discharge from hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge patients will be followed up weekly for 4 weeks and then after 3 and 6&#xD;
      months. At the end of the study, bnp, echo Doppler Vo2 and six minutes walk test will be&#xD;
      repeated, they also will be asked to categorize themselves as feeling worse, the same, or&#xD;
      better in comparison to their preprocedural state.&#xD;
