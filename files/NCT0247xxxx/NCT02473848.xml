  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The substance ingenol mebutate (IM) is registered in Switzerland and many countries worldwide&#xD;
      for the treatment of actinic keratosis (AK). There is no data on the use of IM in organ&#xD;
      transplant recipients, a population highly affected by AK and skin cancer at large. The&#xD;
      investigators want to study the use of IM against AK in this high-risk group of patients and&#xD;
      assess its safety. The investigators are hoping to prove that IM is safe to use in AK of&#xD;
      organ transplant recipients, allowing its use in the clinical routine treatement of AK also&#xD;
      in this subset of patients with AK.&#xD;

      Ingenol mebutate gel, 0.05%, commercially supplied in a box of 2 single use, unit dose tubes&#xD;
      for topical application for each 25cm2, four conjunctive 25cm2 areas (100cm2) will be&#xD;
      treated. If the 100 cm2 area is not cleared at Day 57 (+/- 3 Days), a second treatment cycle&#xD;
      will be initiated with commercially supplied drug in a box of 2 single use, unit dose tubes&#xD;
      for topical application for each 25cm2 and four conjunctive 25cm2 areas (100cm2 ) will be&#xD;
      treated. In total for the first cycle, 4 commercially supplied boxes (8 unit dose tubes) will&#xD;
      be used, and for the second cycle an additional 4 commercially supplied boxes (8 unit dose&#xD;
      tubes) will be used (in total 8 boxes, 16 unit dose tubes per patient).&#xD;
