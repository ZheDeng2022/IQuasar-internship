  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The immune response to kidney damage during acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important&#xD;
      contributor to the prolonged lack of renal function and progression of kidney injury. Most&#xD;
      data related to intrarenal and interorgan pathways in AKI stem from animal research with&#xD;
      sometimes conflicting results. Accurate evaluation of these processes in humans and&#xD;
      identification of early diagnostic tools are critical for the development of strategies to&#xD;
      prevent and attenuate AKI-related morbidity and mortality in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate immune function and miRNA expression in hospitalised&#xD;
      patients with and without AKI.&#xD;

      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overriding pro-inflammatory immune response underlies AKI in humans which contributes to&#xD;
      dysfunction of non-renal organs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Is AKI in humans associated with a predominantly pro-inflammatory immune response?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does AKI affect the phenotypic characterisation and function of neutrophils?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does severity of AKI lead to differences in phenotypic characterisation and function of&#xD;
           neutrophils?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What are the differences in cytokine profiles between AKI patients with and without&#xD;
           systemic inflammation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What are the differences in cytokine profiles between AKI patients with systemic&#xD;
           inflammation and patients with systemic inflammation without AKI?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is there a correlation between microRNA levels in patients with AKI and degree of AKI,&#xD;
           renal recovery and patient outcome?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational non-interventional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with AKI stage II or III * and systemic inflammation without sepsis 30 patients&#xD;
      with AKI stage II or III * and no systemic inflammation 30 patients with systemic&#xD;
      inflammation and normal renal function 30 patients after major surgery who do not have an&#xD;
      infection, SIRS or AKI&#xD;
&#xD;
      * AKI will be defined by the KDIGO criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome Detection of measurable phenotypic characteristics and function of leukocytes&#xD;
      that are specific of patients with AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Differences in phenotypic characterisation and function of neutrophils between patients&#xD;
           with AKI stage II and III.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Differences in phenotypic characterisation and function of neutrophils between patients&#xD;
           with and without AKI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Differences in cytokine profiles between patients with AKI and systemic inflammation and&#xD;
           patients with AKI without systemic inflammation&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Differences in cytokine profiles between AKI patients with systemic inflammation and&#xD;
           patients with systemic inflammation without AKI&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlation between microRNA levels in patients with AKI and renal recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Correlation between microRNA levels in patients with AKI and patient outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Differences in cytokine profiles between AKI patients without systemic inflammation and&#xD;
           patients without AKI and without systemic inflammation / infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of laboratory variables that describe the immunological phenotype, standard&#xD;
      statistical methods will be applied. 1) When the normal distribution assumption is met,&#xD;
      groups will be compared using ANOVA and the corresponding contrasts for group by group&#xD;
      comparisons; 2) In the absence of normality or for ordinal variables, Kruskal Wallis will be&#xD;
      applied for multi-group comparisons, and Wilcoxon for two-groups analysis. We will apply&#xD;
      multiple testing correction via Benjamini-Hochberg FDR control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of miRNA array data, we will first follow the protocol quality control&#xD;
      measures appropriate for the platform of choice, and subsequently will carry out statistical&#xD;
      analysis using the SAMr and LIMMA packages from Bioconductor, via the R software. Similarly,&#xD;
      for the analysis of PCR data, the package HTqPCR from bioconductor will be used for quality&#xD;
      control. Depending on the distribution of the final data, either non-parametric statistics,&#xD;
      or a moderated t-test will be applied for statistical comparisons, with the corresponding&#xD;
      multiple testing corrections as above.&#xD;
