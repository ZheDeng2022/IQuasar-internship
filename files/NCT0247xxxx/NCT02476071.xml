  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study, funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, will test a novel demand&#xD;
      generation strategy, &quot;Stylish Man&quot;, to increase uptake of safe voluntary male circumcision&#xD;
      (VMC) for HIV in Rakai, Uganda. With President's Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)&#xD;
      funds, the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) provides VMC in Rakai District, Uganda. The&#xD;
      investigators' ongoing 54 village Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS), with community HIV&#xD;
      prevalence ranging from 6% to 42%, provides longitudinal data on rates of VMC coverage and on&#xD;
      HIV incidence. The investigators have preliminary evidence that VMC is reducing HIV incidence&#xD;
      in Rakai, but coverage remains suboptimal (as elsewhere in Africa), reducing program impact.&#xD;
      The investigators' data suggest that VMC &quot;supply&quot; is not the limiting factor, but that there&#xD;
      is a &quot;deficit in demand&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on extensive qualitative research, the investigators have developed and piloted an&#xD;
      innovative male-focused VMC demand generation strategy, the &quot;Stylish Man Program&quot; (SMP). The&#xD;
      VMP strives to &quot;demedicalize&quot; VMC by de-emphasizing health-focused messages and instead&#xD;
      stressing &quot;taking charge of your life&quot;. The SMP has two distinct but related elements: (1)&#xD;
      mass media (MM) via radio and posters; and (2) community-level mobilization via the &quot;Stylish&#xD;
      Man Event&quot; (SMEvent) which includes multimedia media (the Stylish Van, videos, music, health&#xD;
      promoters) into which the investigators have embedded VMC promotion, and immediate access to&#xD;
      services. In this study, the investigators will conduct a one year cluster randomized trial&#xD;
      of MM plus SMEvents (intervention arm) compared to MM alone (control), in 20 RCCS&#xD;
      communities, half randomzied to the intervention and half to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be intent-to-treat community-level rates of VMC coverage by arm,&#xD;
      ie., the percentage of non-muslim men in each arm who accept and adopt MMC. (Over 95% of&#xD;
      Muslim men in Rakai already receive male circumcision in infancy.) As secondary outcomes, we&#xD;
      will also monitor rates of key behaviors and HIV incidence, and compare them between arms and&#xD;
      to rates observed in communities in each arm prior to study initiation.&#xD;

      Assessment strategy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial of the effects of MM+SMEvent&#xD;
      (intervention) versus MM alone (control) on VMC coverage. In addition, RCCS data from before&#xD;
      and after trial initiation will provide data on trends in VMC coverage, HIV incidence and key&#xD;
      behaviors in both arms before and during the trial. In the trial control communities this&#xD;
      will provide an assessment of the effects of mass media alone. The &quot;pragmatic&quot; approach&#xD;
      allows modification of the SMP components based on feedback and iterative assessments, as&#xD;
      would be the case in normal program practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cluster randomized trial component:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  20 Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) communities will be randomized into the&#xD;
           intervention arm and into the control arm (10 communities in each arm). The clusters&#xD;
           will be stratified by community characteristics (e.g., fishing villages, main road hubs,&#xD;
           agrarian villages), and randomized within strata.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention arm: ~ ten clusters will be randomly assigned to receive the SMEvent activities&#xD;
      once during the one year study, in addition to the ongoing district-wide MM. The SMEvents&#xD;
      will include the community mobilization as described above, carried out in conjunction with&#xD;
      mobile service camps conducted at the time of the SMEvent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other ~10 communities (control arm) will be exposed to MM over the year, but will not&#xD;
      receive an SMEvents. All control communities will receive VMC through a standard mobile&#xD;
      service camp, in order to enhance comparability of services in both arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Services in both arms will be offered per Uganda CDC PEPFAR guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-post component:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MM campaign on radio which covers a large proportion of the population of Rakai cannot be&#xD;
      randomized. However, the RCCS provides longitudinal information on population-level rates of&#xD;
      VMC coverage since the service was introduced (7+ years ago), as well as data on behaviors&#xD;
      (condom use, numbers of partners, etc…) and HIV incidence. Thus, within control arm&#xD;
      communities, the investigators have data required to determine what proportion of the&#xD;
      population are exposed to the mass media, and whether the MM is associated with increased VMC&#xD;
      demand and adoption. The rate of service uptake in the RCCS has essentially plateaued for&#xD;
      over the past 3 RCCS rounds, so an upward inflection following MM startup will suggest&#xD;
      program effects. The investigators will also conduct a pre-post comparison in the SMEvent+MM&#xD;
      arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As described below, the investigators will add questions to the RCCS to enhance the SMP&#xD;
      evaluation. VMC uptake will also be assessed through service statistics, since the RHSP/MOH&#xD;
      collaboration is the primary provider of VMC in RCCS communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The annual RCCS community survey will be used to collect data from a random sample of 70&#xD;
           resident non-Muslim men aged 18-49 per community ~700 men per arm, or ~1,400 men in&#xD;
           all).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The RCCS will continue to collect detailed data on VMC adoption, sociodemographics,&#xD;
           behaviors (including numbers and types of partners, condom use). The investigators will&#xD;
           add a module in the RCCS to evaluate exposure to the SMP (mass media, SMEvent),&#xD;
           perceptions of components of the SMP (both positive and negative), perceptions of VMC&#xD;
           services and the degree to which they are acceptable within the respondent's family,&#xD;
           peer group and community; whether the respondent has had conversations with partners,&#xD;
           family and/or peers about VMC. whether an individual accepted VMC as a result of the&#xD;
           campaign, and if so, what was (were) the main influence(s) (i.e., information, found out&#xD;
           peers were using services, friends or spouses encouraged uptake as a result of the&#xD;
           campaign, easier access to the service, etc….. ) The reported utilization will be&#xD;
           validated against clinic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although HIV incidence is not a primary study outcome, HIV testing will be conducted&#xD;
           within the RCCS (as is the standard practice) using a three rapid test algorithm,with&#xD;
           EIA and/or PCR confirmation of all newly identified HIV+ in-migrants and all new&#xD;
           seroconverters. Serum samples from the RCCS will be archived at -80 C for future studies&#xD;
           such as community viral load, under future grants.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will conduct the RCCS survey approximately 2-3 months after the&#xD;
           SMEvent in intervention communities. The RCCS will be conducted at approximately the&#xD;
           same time in the matched control communities, to enhance comparability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Process data:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Records will be kept of each SMP activity: radio spots and interviews, scheduling of&#xD;
           SMEvent activities, etc. SMEvent process data will include estimates of the number of&#xD;
           participants each day, with photos taken to assist with the count. Approximately 12&#xD;
           short anonymous &quot;spot interviews&quot; will be conducted daily at the SMEvent site daily with&#xD;
           younger and older men, to gauge interest in the activities, positive and negative&#xD;
           perceptions, and suggestions for improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinic-based evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both at the mobile SMEvent services and in the standard mobile clinics in control&#xD;
      communities, records will be kept of all services by client's age, venue and date. (Client&#xD;
      medical records will include the individual's name, but will be retained separately from&#xD;
      research records.) Clients will be asked what motivated them to accept a service (some SMP&#xD;
      component, other people were getting services, encouragement from someone influenced by the&#xD;
      SMP, factors unrelated to the SMP, etc…)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do not propose a formal cost benefit analysis. However, the cost of the&#xD;
      campaign will be closely tracked (cost of each radio spot, personnel/materials for the&#xD;
      SMEvent, fuel, administrative and support costs, additional cost to PEPFAR of extended&#xD;
      evening service hours, etc…). The focus will be on service-related costs, with research&#xD;
      outlays tracked separately.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Please note: in this community randomized trial, there are no inclusion or exclusion&#xD;
             criteria for exposure to the mass media or the Stylish Man Events; anyone in the&#xD;
             community may hear the messages or attend the Stylish Man Event.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Criteria for interview: This intervention will be evaluated via interviews with 70 men&#xD;
             in each of 10 intervention and 10 control villages (total n = 1,400).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Criteria for interview include being male, non-Muslim, resident in the study&#xD;
             community, being aged 18-49, and being able and willing to sign or put a fingerprint&#xD;
             on an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-residence in the community; inability or unwillingness to sign a written consent&#xD;
             for interview, age in years below 18 or above 49.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Please note: the question &quot;Accepts healthy volunteers&quot; does not apply here; there is no&#xD;
        logical way of answering it in this study. We are not testing any medical or individual&#xD;
        level intervention; all community members can be exposed to our mass media and community&#xD;
        HIV prevention program, the Stylish Man Program. Interviews will be conducted with anyone&#xD;
        healthy enough to comprehend and sign/fingerprint a consent form, but otherwise there are&#xD;
        no health criteria.&#xD;
