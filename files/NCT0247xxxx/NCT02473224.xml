    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, randomized, double blind, as well as partially blinded (for Cohort 4),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled safety, illness, and infection study of a new experimental human challenge&#xD;
      stock of the Norovirus genogroup II, genotype 2 (GII.2) isolate designated Snow Mountain&#xD;
      virus (SMV). The study duration is 24 - 36 months. The primary objectives are to: 1) evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and reactogenicity of the GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus challenge stock and 2)&#xD;
      determine a safe and optimal challenge dose of GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus to achieve&#xD;
      illness in a high proportion (= / &gt; 75%) of subjects.&#xD;

      This is a phase I, randomized, double blind, as well as partially blinded (for Cohort 4),&#xD;
      placebo-controlled safety, illness, and infection study of a new experimental human challenge&#xD;
      stock of the Norovirus genogroup II, genotype 2 (GII.2) isolate designated Snow Mountain&#xD;
      virus (SMV), administered to healthy adults 18-49 years of age. Groups of 11 subjects each&#xD;
      will be admitted to the inpatient hospital research unit, challenged with live SMV or placebo&#xD;
      by oral administration, and remain in isolation in the unit for at least 4 days following&#xD;
      challenge. The study duration is 24 - 36 months. Subjects will be followed post-challenge for&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity, and illness (primary objectives), and secondary or exploratory&#xD;
      objectives including infection and immune responses. There will be multiple clinical&#xD;
      assessments and collection of blood, emesis, saliva, and stool specimens. The primary&#xD;
      objectives are to: 1) evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of the GII.2 Snow Mountain&#xD;
      norovirus challenge stock and 2) determine a safe and optimal challenge dose of GII.2 Snow&#xD;
      Mountain norovirus to achieve illness in a high proportion (= / &gt; 75%) of subjects. The&#xD;
      secondary objectives are to: 1) determine the rate of infection in study participants after&#xD;
      norovirus GII.2 challenge, 2) determine the quantity and duration of virus shedding in stool&#xD;
      by RT-qPCR, 3) estimate the median time to cessation of shedding, 4) determine the modified&#xD;
      Vesikari score as a measure of gastroenteritis severity, 5) determine GII.2 Snow Mountain&#xD;
      norovirus-specific Immunoglobulin titers by ELISA before and after the challenge, 6)&#xD;
      determine the effect of pre-existing GII.2 Snow Mountain norovirus-specific immunoglobulin in&#xD;
      serum and saliva on the rate of infection, 7) determine total and GII.2 Snow Mountain&#xD;
      norovirus-specific IgA- and IgG-Secreting Cells in circulation by ELISpot assay, 8) once the&#xD;
      optimal challenge dose is determined in secretor positive subjects: investigate the safety&#xD;
      and illness rate using that dose of the GII.2 challenge stock in secretor negative subjects.&#xD;
