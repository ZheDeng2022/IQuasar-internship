      Study includes two treatment periods: period 1 is single dose of PF-06372865 given alone&#xD;
      followed by at least 5-day washout out. The period 2 is 200 mg QD itraconazole given for 8&#xD;
      days with PF-06372865 single dose co-administered on day 4 (1 hour later than itraconazole&#xD;
      dose). The PK and safety will be assessed and compared for single dose of PF-06372865 in&#xD;
      period 1 and period 2.&#xD;
