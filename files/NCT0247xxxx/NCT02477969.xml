    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III clinical study&#xD;
      that will enroll approximately 564 T2DM patients who before screening have inadequately&#xD;
      controlled blood glucose （7.0%≤HbA1c≤10.5% at randomization）despite at least 8 weeks of&#xD;
      metformin monotherapy at stable doses（≥1500 mg/day).&#xD;

      Subjects will be randomized to receive either PEX168 100μg, 200μg or PEX 168 Dummy Injection&#xD;
      as add-on to metformin hydrochloride. The baseline HbA1c level （HbA1c≤8.5% or HbA1c&gt;8.5）is&#xD;
      designed as the stratification factor based on which a dynamic randomization will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study consists of 4 periods： Period 1：Up to 3 weeks of screening period. Period 2：A&#xD;
      4-week PEX168 dummy injection run-in period. Period 3：A 52-week treatment period (including a&#xD;
      24-week core treatment period and a 28-week extended treatment period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period 4: A 30-day safety follow-up period.&#xD;
