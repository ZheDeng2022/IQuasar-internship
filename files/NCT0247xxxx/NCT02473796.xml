      Melghat is poorly developed tribal area in India with very high child mortality &amp;&#xD;
      malnutrition prevalence (grossly inadequate medical facilities). Important health problems.&#xD;
      Malnutrition , Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, Anaemia, Malaria, Diarrhoea, Premature and L. B. W.&#xD;
      babies, Neonatal sepsis, Feeding problem, Birth asphyxia. The investigators developed a Home&#xD;
      Based Child Care (HBCC) model to reduce neonatal mortality rate (NMR), infant mortality rate&#xD;
      (IMR), under 5 mortality rate (U5MR) and severe malnutrition(SM) in this region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melghat.&#xD;

      Need of project :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melghat is known for highest U5MR in Maharashtra. Overall aims and importance of the&#xD;
      research:. The results obtained in this area will be applicable for reducing children&#xD;
      mortality and malnutrition in other parts of Melghat and all other tribal areas of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: RCT-Home based child care (HBCC) by trained village health workers .(ARI,&#xD;

           residents population of 17000 (from 19 villages in tribal area of Melghat ) over a&#xD;
           period of 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To reduce the IMR from existing 90 (year 2004) to 52.65 per 1000 live births in above&#xD;
           area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To reduce the U5MR from existing 140 (year 2006) to 72.1 per 1000 live births in above&#xD;
           area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To reduce the prevalence of severe malnutrition (under 5 children ) from existing 9.5%&#xD;
           (year 2004) to 4.55% in above area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Detailed research plan. I. Study design: Randomised Control Trial. The Melghat area was&#xD;

      &lt;2000g; 7 mg for birth weight 2000-2500 gm or as per gentamicin chart for 7 days for normal&#xD;
      term &amp; weight ) by intramuscular injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute respiratory infection was treated with co-trimoxazole syrup BID (2.5 ml for age 1-2&#xD;
      months, 5 ml for age 2 months - 1 year, 7.5 ml for age 1 - 5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diarrheal illness was treated with ORS, furoxone (5 ml 8 hourly for 3 days) and metronidazole&#xD;
      syrup (5 ml 8 hourly for 7 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malaria was treated with Syrup chloroquine (for 1 month to 1 year- 5 ml first dose , 2.5 ml&#xD;
      after 6 hours, 2.5 ml after 12 hours , 2.5 ml after 12 hours). Syrup paracetamol was given&#xD;
      2.5 to 5 ml 8 hourly depending upon the body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Comparator: control The control arm included population where the HBCC was not&#xD;
