      Brief Summary: This cohort study aims to compare thoracoscopic left atrial appendage excision&#xD;
      plus atrial fibrillation ablation versus oral anticoagulants for secondary prevention of&#xD;
      stroke and non-central nervous systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation and&#xD;
      thromboembolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed Description: BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is one of the most common cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias and has been shown to be an important cause of stroke. AF is responsible for 15%&#xD;
      of all strokes. Most strokes in AF are caused by cardioembolism. The left atrial appendage&#xD;
      (LAA) is the dominant source of cardioembolism. The greatest priority in treating AF is&#xD;
      stroke prevention. There are now 3 main approaches for prevention: (1) oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      (OAC), (2) eradication of AF, and (3) exclusion of the LAA from the systemic circulation. OAC&#xD;
      therapy, including warfarin and novel oral anticoagulants, effectively reduces the risk of&#xD;
      stroke in AF and is currently the first line of treatment in patients with AF and one or more&#xD;
      risk factors. Despite the advancements in medical therapy, the risk of stroke in patients&#xD;
      with AF who undergo optimal anticoagulation therapy still remains between 2% and 5% per year,&#xD;
      regardless of the agent used. The limitations of OAC include (1) patient unsuitability for&#xD;
      OAC, (2) increased risk of bleeding, (3) need for monitoring optimal international normalized&#xD;
      ratio (INR) levels (with warfarin), and (4) patient noncompliance. Percutaneous methods of&#xD;
      ablation are widely used to attempt to eliminate AF. Approximately 20% of patients who&#xD;
      underwent ablation had AF recurrence. It is because of this well-demonstrated occurrence that&#xD;
      the guidelines do not recommend discontinuation of warfarin or equivalent therapies after&#xD;
      ablation. Since at least 90% of all left atrial thrombi are found within the LAA, it is&#xD;
      plausible that its occlusion will lead to a decreased risk of stroke in patients with AF.&#xD;
      However, the evidence for surgical excision is extremely limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM OF THE STUDY: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate whether thoracoscopic&#xD;
      LAA excision plus atrial fibrillation ablation for the purpose of prevention of&#xD;
      thromboembolism in patients with AF and thromboembolism is more effective and safer compared&#xD;
      with OACs for reducing the composite endpoint of stroke, TIA and systemic embolism. The&#xD;
      primary end point was the composite of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism/transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack (TIA), major bleeding, or all-cause mortality. The secondary end point is defined as&#xD;
      ischemic strokes, all strokes (including ischemic and hemorrhagic), major and fatal bleeding&#xD;
      events, minor bleeding complication, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular death, and&#xD;
      hospitalization due to cardiovascular or cerebral diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a single-center prospective cohort study. Adult patients with&#xD;
      non-valvular AF and a previous history of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism/ TIA are eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion of this study. Approximately 300 patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF and&#xD;
      previous thromboembolic events will receive novel oral anticoagulant or warfarin treatment&#xD;
      with a targeted INR between 2.0 and 3.0 or surgical LAA excision plus AF ablation. Follow-up&#xD;
      for these patients includes visits at 3 m, 6 m, 9 m, 12 m, and every additional 6 months&#xD;
      there after.&#xD;
