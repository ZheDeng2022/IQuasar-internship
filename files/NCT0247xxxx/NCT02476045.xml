      Open label, randomized, multicenter, phase II study to compare the efficacy, in terms of&#xD;
      non-inferiority of progression-free survival (PFS), of maintenance with panitumumab alone&#xD;
      (arm B) as compared to panitumumab with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin (LV) (arm A)&#xD;
      following induction treatment with 5-fluorouracil + leucovorin+oxaliplatin (FOLFOX-4) and&#xD;
      panitumumab in patients with RAS wild-type, metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves an induction phase with panitumumab as 1 hour intravenous infusion at the&#xD;
      dosage of 6 mg/kg, given every two weeks, plus FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy as standard guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before start of FOLFOX-4 plus panitumumab, at the time of enrollment, patients will be&#xD;
      immediately randomized electronically 1:1 to one of the two maintenance arms. Induction&#xD;
      treatment with FOLFOX-4 plus panitumumab will continue until progressive disease,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal, or for up to 8 cycles. At the end of&#xD;
      induction treatment, in presence of complete or partial response, or stable disease,&#xD;
      non-progressing patients will be allocated to one of the two pre-assigned maintenance arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) 5-FU/LV (De Gramont regimen) plus panitumumab given at 6 mg/Kg every two weeks until&#xD;
      progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal B) Panitumumab&#xD;
      alone given at 6 mg/Kg every two weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      informed consent withdrawal Imaging studies (thorax and abdominal CT or MRI scan) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline (4 weeks prior enrollment) and every 8 weeks (4 cycles) during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      First-line treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer should be administered according to the&#xD;
      individual situation, patients' needs, therapeutic preconditions (e.g. neurotoxicity&#xD;
      following adjuvant oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy), biomarkers and aggressiveness of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OPTIMOX1 trial showed an equivalent duration of disease control for a de-escalation /&#xD;
      maintenance / reintroduction strategy compared with a treatment until progression strategy&#xD;
      for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. Continuation of &quot;lightened&quot; fluoropyrimidine-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy and bevacizumab represents a standard of care in the maintenance setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panitumumab with FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy represents a standard of care in the treatment of RAS&#xD;
      wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The question whether the maintenance strategy might&#xD;
      apply also to panitumumab in combination with chemotherapy is unknown at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the continuation of chemotherapy plus panitumumab until disease progression was foreseen&#xD;
      in the hallmark &quot;PRIME&quot; trial, the question is whether a de-escalation of treatment intensity&#xD;
      will not be inferior with respect to resulting time with tumor control, but allow patients a&#xD;
      period with less toxicity and gain of quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, no data are available at present regarding the optimal maintenance treatment with&#xD;
      anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies when used in association&#xD;
      with first-line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open label, randomized, multicenter, phase II study to compare the efficacy, in&#xD;
      terms of non-inferiority of progression-free survival (PFS), of maintenance with panitumumab&#xD;
      alone (arm B) as compared to panitumumab with 5-FU/LV (arm A) following induction treatment&#xD;
      with FOLFOX-4 and panitumumab in patients with RAS wild-type, metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety (according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events -CTCAE- v 4.03). All&#xD;
           Adverse events will be reported according to National Cancer Institute Criteria. The&#xD;
           incidence of adverse events will be summarized according to the primary system-organ&#xD;
           class (SOC) and within the category defined in the CTCAE v4.03. The summaries will be&#xD;
           overall (severity grades 1-4) and for grade ≥3 events and will also report the actions&#xD;
           taken in terms of treatment discontinuation. Similar summaries will be made for serious&#xD;
           adverse events. The safety set will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life (patients reported outcomes).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Response rate (RR), duration of response (DR), time to progression (TTP), time to&#xD;
           treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exploratory endpoints: Archival tumor tissue samples will be collected at baseline.&#xD;
           Samples will be sent at Pathology Department of Fondazione IRCCS Istituto Nazionale dei&#xD;
           Tumori for exploratory biomarkers substudy A representative formalin-fixed,&#xD;
           paraffin-embedded (FFPE) diagnostic tumor specimen, as a tissue block that must have&#xD;
           been reviewed by a pathologist to confirm that it contains adequate tumor tissue. In&#xD;
           alternative, fifteen 5-micron unstained slides are allowed. Next-generation sequencing&#xD;
           (Ion-Torrent) and in-situ hybridization techniques will be performed to identify&#xD;
           potential biomarkers of primary resistance. Since the availability of blood-based&#xD;
           biomarkers could be particularly useful for prediction of treatment efficacy or acquired&#xD;
           resistance to panitumumab, in this study we will collect blood samples (optional) in&#xD;
           individual patients (before treatment, every 8 weeks during treatment and at&#xD;
           progression) to analyze circulating tumor DNA by digital Polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
           (ddPCR) or next generation (NGS) approaches. Moreover, pharmacogenetic studies to&#xD;
           predict panitumumab and chemotherapy toxicity are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment involves an induction phase with panitumumab as 1 hour intravenous infusion at the&#xD;
      dosage of 6 mg/kg, given every two weeks, plus FOLFOX-4 chemotherapy as standard guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before start of FOLFOX-4 plus panitumumab, at the time of enrollment, patients will be&#xD;
      immediately randomized electronically 1:1 to one of the two maintenance arms. Induction&#xD;
      treatment with FOLFOX-4 plus panitumumab will continue until progressive disease,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal, or for up to 8 cycles. At the end of&#xD;
      induction treatment, in presence of complete or partial response, or stable disease,&#xD;
      non-progressing patients will be allocated to one of the two pre-assigned maintenance arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) 5-FU/LV (De Gramont regimen) plus panitumumab given at 6 mg/Kg every two weeks until&#xD;
      progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or informed consent withdrawal B) Panitumumab&#xD;
      alone given at 6 mg/Kg every two weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      informed consent withdrawal Imaging studies (thorax and abdominal CT or MRI scan) will be&#xD;
      performed at baseline (4 weeks prior enrollment) and every 8 weeks (4 cycles) during&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is calculated on the basis of a non-inferiority hypothesis of median PFS with&#xD;
      panitumumab alone as compared to 5-fluorouracil/leucovorin and panitumumab, taking into&#xD;
      account a median PFS of 10 months observed in the PRIME trial. An overall sample size of 224&#xD;
      subjects (112 in the control group and 112 in the study group) achieves 90% power to detect a&#xD;
      probability of 50% in the control group and a maximum difference of 15% in the study group,&#xD;
      with a significance level of 0.1. The drop-out rate is 15%. The accrual pattern in the two&#xD;
      groups is uniform (allocation 1:1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study lasts for 24 months of enrollment and 12 months of follow-up&#xD;

             patients with platinum induced neurotoxicity greater than or equal CTCAE Grade 2&#xD;
             should be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Is a pregnant or lactating female, or is planning to become pregnant during treatment&#xD;
             and within 2 months after the end of treatment with panitumumab. Women of&#xD;
