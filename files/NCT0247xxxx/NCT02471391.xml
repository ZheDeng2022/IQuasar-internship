  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research will test the combination of two new drugs, called ibrutinib and ABT199, taken&#xD;
      together in the treatment of Mantle Cell Lymphoma. Other studies have indicated the potential&#xD;
      for these drugs to be used in the treatment of participants with Mantle Cell Lymphoma. In&#xD;
      this study, the investigators will test the combination of the two drugs together, in order&#xD;
      to determine what effects (good and bad) it has on mantle cell lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two phases. The first phase is the Primary Evaluation Phase and will closely&#xD;
      monitor the effects of ibrutinib and ABT199 for a period of 13 months. Participants who&#xD;
      complete 13 months of treatment and continue benefiting from the study treatments will be&#xD;
      allowed to continue both drugs until progression or intolerance in the Continuation Phase.&#xD;
      The purpose of this phase is to provide patients with continuing access to both ibrutinib and&#xD;
      ABT199. Patients will receive routine care from clinician, who will record any sideeffects&#xD;
      that may be experienced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is one of the first trials in the world to study the combination of ibrutinib and ABT199&#xD;
      together. Therefore the effectiveness of the combination of the study drugs will be assessed,&#xD;
      as will how they affect mantle cell lymphoma and how it develops resistance to the&#xD;
      treatments. The investigators also do not know whether combining the two drugs together will&#xD;
      cause unexpected side effects. Therefore, the study will monitor patients closely and perform&#xD;
      scans, blood tests, bone marrow biopsies and other tests at regular intervals.&#xD;
