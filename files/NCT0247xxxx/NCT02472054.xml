  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to study the number of surviving patients until hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cell transplantation (HSCT) after first line treatment of hemophagocytic&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) by Alemtuzumab&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) or lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome is an&#xD;
      inflammatory condition caused by a uncontrolled proliferation of activated lymphocytes and&#xD;
      macrophages secreting an excess of inflammatory cytokines. Familial hemophagocytic&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytosis (FHL) is a rare disorder of the immune system, which is invariably fatal&#xD;
      when untreated. Treatment requires the achievement of remission of HLH prior to allogeneic&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, the only curative therapy to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite significant progress in the treatment, mortality remains high and an important number&#xD;
      of patients will die before being eligible for HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better understanding of the pathophysiology of FHL has opened new avenues for&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Based on previous observations concerning the utilization of&#xD;
      Anti-thymoglobulins (ATG) for the treatment of patients with FHL, the protocol propose a new&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy using Alemtuzumab in association with steroids as first line treatment&#xD;
      in FHL. This proposition is based on the hypothesis that Alemtuzumab, capable of killing T&#xD;
      lymphocytes efficiently in vivo, should be better tolerated than ATG. In fact, in contrast to&#xD;
      the mechanism of action of ATG, Alemtuzumab does not activate T lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A better tolerance and efficacy of Alemtuzumab is expected in the treatment of the&#xD;
      hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytic syndrome. This may have a positive impact not only on&#xD;
      survival until HSCT, but also on overall survival and quality of life with regard to&#xD;
      long-term neurological sequelae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, open, phase I/II, non-comparative, non randomized study. Patients are&#xD;
      recruited by the investigators during hospitalization for a first episode of&#xD;
      lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome requiring specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several visits (including the final visit) are scheduled within the trial over a period of&#xD;
      approximately 10 months for all patients, from the signature of the consent up to 6 months&#xD;
      after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period will be 48 months; the total period of the study is 58 months. The&#xD;
      treatment consists in an intravenous administration of CAMPATH®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the research purpose, investigators will collect specific samples for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  biobank (Cytokine dosage) at the inclusion visit and the day prior to the conditioning;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  pharmacokinetics of CAMPATH® : at every cure of CAMPATH® and every week. Also diagnostic&#xD;
           lumbar puncture at the inclusion visit, day 14 is required to document the response to&#xD;
           treatment and to determine the result of the therapeutic care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the treatment will be measured to Day14, Day21 and Day28. All adverse events&#xD;
      must be reported in the e-Case Report Form (e-CRF)&#xD;

                  defined by the &quot;Histiocyte Society&quot; ) :&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Fever&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Splenomegaly&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Cytopenia (affecting at least two cell lineages : Hemoglobin &lt;9.0 g / dl,&#xD;
                  Platelets &lt;100.000/μl, Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1.000/µl)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Hypertriglyceridemia and / or hypofibrinogenemia (Fasting triglycerides ≥ 3 mmol&#xD;

               -  Haemophagocytosis found in a histological specimen (without evidence of a&#xD;
                  malignant process and rheumatic disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Decreased or absent NK function (&lt;10% of the laboratory standard)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Ferritin ≥ 500μg / l&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Soluble CD25 ≥ 2.400U/ml or presence of activated T cells in the immune&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient without prior specific treatment of lymphohistiocytic activation syndrome or&#xD;
             under treatment with corticosteroids and / or ciclosporin.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient beneficiary of a health insurance scheme&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Holder (s) of parental authority who signed the informed consent&#xD;

          -  Man or woman in reproductive age willing to take reliable contraceptive measures&#xD;
             during the treatment and 6 months after the end of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Specific situation of patients with neurological involvement :&#xD;
&#xD;
        Most patients with neurological involvement caused by a HLH will meet the inclusion&#xD;
        criteria. However some patients may present an isolated neurological involvement as the&#xD;
        first manifestation of familiar lymphohistiocytosis as described in the literature. These&#xD;
        patients do not always present all the inclusion criteria. However their clinical condition&#xD;
        may justify their inclusion prior to the confirmation of a genetic diagnosis and/or the&#xD;
        detection of all required diagnostic inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the absence of the required 5 out of 8 diagnostic criteria, the eventual inclusion of&#xD;
        patients with predominant neurological involvement will be evaluated by a scientific&#xD;
        committee to judge their inclusion or not in the study. The remaining inclusion and&#xD;
        exclusion criteria must be fulfilled. A written report will be established.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously treated with Anti-Thymoglobulin (SAL), etoposide (VP16) or&#xD;
             Alemtuzumab.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Contraindication (s) to the administration of Alemtuzumab :&#xD;
&#xD;
