    <textblock>
      This phase Ib trial studies the side effects and best dose onalespib when given together with&#xD;
      paclitaxel in treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other&#xD;
      places in the body and usually cannot be cured or controlled with treatment (advanced).&#xD;
      Onalespib works by blocking proper processing of proteins that are important for cancer&#xD;
      growth. This results in inability of these proteins to work properly. Paclitaxel kills breast&#xD;
      cancer cells by interfering with their ability to divide. Giving onalespib together with&#xD;
      paclitaxel may be better than giving either one alone in treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of onalespib (AT13387) in combination&#xD;
      with paclitaxel in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the toxicity profile (based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse&#xD;
      Events [CTCAE] version [v.]5.0) of the combination of AT13387 in combination with paclitaxel&#xD;
      in patients with advanced TNBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the effect of AT13387 on pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel in the study patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the effect of paclitaxel on pharmacokinetics of AT13387 in the study patient&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To observe anti-tumor activity determining the overall response rate (partial response +&#xD;
      complete response), response duration and progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY RUN-IN: Patients receive onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day -7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1, 8, and 15. Patients also&#xD;
      receive onalespib IV over 1 hour beginning on days 8 and 15 of cycle 1 and on days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      15 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

             oophorectomy or hysterectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of AT13387 on the developing human fetus are unknown; for this reason and&#xD;
             because paclitaxel are known to be teratogenic; women of child-bearing potential and&#xD;
             men must agree to use adequate contraception prior to study entry, for the duration of&#xD;

             should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is&#xD;
             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or&#xD;
             mitomycin C) prior to entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 4 weeks or 5&#xD;
             half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of the study regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of the study regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients in whom prior treatment related toxicities have not recovered to grade 1 or&#xD;
             less (except for alopecia)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recent initiation of bone modifying therapy with a bisphosphonate or denosumab unless&#xD;
             it has been started more than 4 weeks prior to the first dose of the study regimen;&#xD;
             patients who are already enrolled in this study can initiate bone modifying therapy&#xD;
             after the first set of re-staging scans (&gt;= 8 weeks from cycle 1, day 1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with AT13387 or another HSP90 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events;&#xD;
             however, patients with previously treated and stable brain metastases are eligible as&#xD;
             long as they are no longer requiring steroids, completed radiation therapy more than 2&#xD;
             weeks prior to the first dose of study regimen and have no seizures or worsening&#xD;
             neurologic symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of grade 3-4 immediate hypersensitivity reaction to paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant allergic reactions attributed to compounds of&#xD;
             similar chemical or biologic composition to AT13387 or paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Based on investigator's brochure, AT13387 has no significant effects on inhibition or&#xD;
             activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP), including 1A2, 3A4, 2D6, 2C9, and 2C19 at the&#xD;
             half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) &gt; 10 uM. Preclinical studies indicated&#xD;
             that AT13387 is only a modest inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp). Paclitaxel is a&#xD;
             substrate of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4. The use of CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers while&#xD;
             not prohibited in this study, is discouraged whenever feasible; concurrent use of&#xD;
             strong CYP2C8 and CYP3A4 inhibitors/inducers should be documented and the principal&#xD;
             investigator (PI) of the study shall be notified prior to dosing; as part of the&#xD;
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patients will be counseled on the risk of&#xD;
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be&#xD;
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-the-counter medicine or herbal&#xD;
             product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because paclitaxel is a class D agent with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with AT13387 and paclitaxel, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother&#xD;
             is treated with AT13387 and paclitaxel&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive on highly active&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) will be excluded from the study because of the&#xD;
             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with AT13387; in addition, these patients&#xD;
             are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive&#xD;
             therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to understand and sign informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other medical or psychiatric condition that in the opinion of the investigator&#xD;
             would make the study therapy unsafe for the patient&#xD;
