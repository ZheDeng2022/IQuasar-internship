    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory clinical study to presume the optimum usage and dosage for a&#xD;
      therapeutic confirmatory study by evaluating the efficacy and safety of Avanafil 50mg, 100mg,&#xD;
      200mg or placebo administered orally in patients with erectile dysfunction. In conclusions,&#xD;
      Patients with erectile dysfunction (ED) were administered placebo, Avanafil 50mg, 100mg or&#xD;
      200mg 30 minutes before sexual intercourse for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      1. Study design: Prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, therapeutic&#xD;
      exploratory clinical study Usage &amp; period One capsule was administered 30minutes before&#xD;
      sexual intercourse.It was administered only once a day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Evaluation endpoints]&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety: ① Laboratory tests: Hematological Test, Blood chemical Test, Urinalysis Vital&#xD;
           signs: blood pressure, pulse rate ③ Adverse events and Adverse drug reaction ④12-lead&#xD;
           ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary endpoint ▪ The change of erectile function (EF) domain score in the&#xD;
                international index of erectile function (IIEF)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary endpoint ▪ The change of success rate in sexual encounter profile (SEP)&#xD;
                questionnaire 2, questionnaire 3, questionnaire 4 and questionnaire 5 ▪ The change&#xD;
                of score in IIEF questionnaire 3 and questionnaire 4, The change of score in other&#xD;
                domains of IIEF, GEAQ (Global efficacy assessment question), Normal erectile&#xD;
                function (IIEF EF domain score ≥ 26) rate Statistical methods&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Definition of Evaluation population Maximum efficacy evaluation population&#xD;
                     included the subjects who satisfied inclusion criteria, who took the&#xD;
                     investigational product at least once, who visited the hospital after taking&#xD;
                     the investigational product, and who got the result of efficacy evaluation.&#xD;
                     Safety-Evaluation Population consisted of the subjects who made a visit after&#xD;
                     taking the investigational product once or more and who got follow-up safety&#xD;
                     results&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Initial Comparability Discrete variables were comparatively analyzed by&#xD;
                     χ2-test, Fisher's exact test, and Successive variables were comparatively&#xD;
                     analyzed by ANOVA test or Kruskal-Wallis test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Efficacy Evaluation The change of EF domain score in the IIEF: Analysis of&#xD;
                     covariance(ANCOVA), in which baseline was corrected, was performed to check&#xD;
                     whether there was a difference between the placebo group and the Avanafil&#xD;
                     groups in change of EF domain score.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     The change of score in other domains of IIEF: Analysis of covariance(ANCOVA),&#xD;
                     in which baseline was corrected, was performed to check whether there was a&#xD;
                     difference between the placebo group and the Avanafil groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     The change of score in IIEF questionnaire 3 and questionnaire 4: Analysis of&#xD;
                     covariance(ANCOVA), in which baseline was corrected, was performed to check&#xD;
                     whether there was a difference between the placebo group and the Avanafil&#xD;
                     groups in IIEF questionnaire 3, questionnaire 4 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     The change of success rate in SEP questionnaire 2, questionnaire 3,&#xD;
                     questionnaire 4 and questionnaire 5: Analysis of covariance(ANCOVA), in which&#xD;
                     baseline was corrected, was performed to check whether there was a difference&#xD;
                     between the placebo group and the Avanafil groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     GEAQ (Global Efficacy Assessment Question) : The difference of GEAQ between&#xD;
                     groups was analyzed by χ2-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     Normal erectile function(IIEF EF domain score ≥ 26) rate: The difference of&#xD;
                     Normal erectile function rate between groups was analyzed by χ2-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
                     The efficacy results were analyzed by Dunnett's or Bonferroni's multiple&#xD;
                     comparison test to check whether there was a significant difference between&#xD;
                     the placebo group and the Avanafil groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  4. Safety Evaluation Adverse Events and Adverse Drug Reaction: The difference&#xD;
                     between the placebo group and the Avanafil groups was compared by using&#xD;
                     χ2-test or Fisher's exact test. Adverse events reported in study subjects were&#xD;
                     presented by WHOART (World Health Organization Adverse Reaction Terminology)&#xD;
                     system organ class. The adverse drug reactions, related with the&#xD;
                     investigational product, were comparatively verified on the same method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed under significance level 5%, test power 80% and&#xD;
      two-side test.&#xD;
