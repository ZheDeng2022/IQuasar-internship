      The goal of antiretroviral therapy should be maintaining undetectable plasma viral load, only&#xD;
      present condition to prevent the progression of the disease, improve immune restoration and&#xD;
      prevent the emergence of viral resistance mutations. In addition to the individual benefit,&#xD;
      antiretroviral treatment reduces the transmission of HIV from an infected person to sexual&#xD;
      partners. There is to date no alternative strategy to antiretroviral treatment and&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy, even extended, does not allow viral eradication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to maintain antiretroviral therapy for life raises the long-term safety concerns of&#xD;
      it, even with the latest molecules. Also, one of the key issues in clinical research is&#xD;
      whether after reaching undetectable viral load, antiretroviral treatment can be reduced in&#xD;
      order to reduce exposure to molecules. Indeed, this treatment of &quot;maintenance&quot; could&#xD;
      potentially need a smaller antiviral potency. On the other hand, reduction of antiretroviral&#xD;
      treatment reduces costs, an important consideration in light of new global recommendations of&#xD;
      treatment for all patients with T-cells CD4 below 500 / mm3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alleviation of antiretroviral therapy is to either reduce the number of molecules by&#xD;
      making monotherapies or dual therapy, or to realize or intermittent treatment is to reduce&#xD;
      the doses of molecules such as randomized ENCORE -1 showing the equivalence of a dose of&#xD;
      Efavirenz 400mg instead of 600mg in naive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atalow study has the sense to lower the dose of Atazanavir / Ritonavir in combination with&#xD;
      two NRTI to reduce exposure to this molecule and its cost while maintaining an undetectable&#xD;
      viral load.&#xD;

      Protease inhibitors (PIs) are key treatments in the current therapeutic strategy. They have&#xD;
      major qualities such as their antiviral potency and high genetic barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, their long-term use is associated with gastrointestinal side effects, metabolic&#xD;
      disorders (lipid, carbohydrate, lipohypertrophy) and cardiovascular comorbidities, renal and&#xD;
      bone. The decrease in IP doses would reduce this predominantly concentration-dependent&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atazanavir (Reyataz) was the first protease inhibitor once daily approved in 2003 for the&#xD;
      treatment of HIV patients. Its favorable safety profile, ease of making and effectiveness&#xD;
      have made treatment widely used and recommended first line. Atazanavir is recommended in&#xD;
      Europe in naïve patient at the 300 mg dose once daily boosted with ritonavir 100 mg and in&#xD;
      the pretreated patient at the 300 mg boosted with 100mg ritonavir or a dose of 400 no boosted&#xD;
      mg in combination with two other antiretroviral drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After oral administration, atazanavir is rapidly absorbed with improved variable&#xD;
      bioavailability with food intake (40% increase in Cmin) and dependent on the gastric&#xD;
      potential hydrogen (pH). Atazanavir is highly bound to plasma proteins (86%) and is largely&#xD;
      metabolised by the isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) cytochrome P450. There is great variability in the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of atazanavir between patients due to inter-individual variability in the&#xD;
      expression and function of CYP3A4. Co-administration of ritonavir increased 11.9 times Cmin&#xD;
      and decreases the interindividual variability. The major effect of ritonavir is to decrease&#xD;
      hepatic clearance of atazanavir. Its half-life of elimination is 8.6 hours when administered&#xD;
      at 300 mg with 100 mg of ritonavir. 90% inhibitory concentration of atazanavir adjusted to&#xD;
      the plasma protein binding (PBA EC90) is 14ng / ml. At the standard dose of 300 mg taken with&#xD;
      100 mg ritonavir once daily, the mean trough concentration at steady state is according to&#xD;
      research from 526 ng / ml and 862 ng / ml in HIV patients. Residual therapeutic levels (Cmin)&#xD;
      must be greater than 150 ng / ml. The relationship between the residual plasma concentrations&#xD;
      and virologic response was demonstrated in the naive patient pharmacokinetic substudy BMS&#xD;
      089.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the inhibitor atazanavir is best tolerated on lipid map protease is responsible for&#xD;
      specific side effects such as hyperbilirubinemia and nephrolithiasis, concentration-dependent&#xD;
      side effects. Indeed, atazanavir is responsible for a reversible elevation of unconjugated&#xD;
      bilirubin, inhibiting glucuronide conjugation bilirubin by UGT1A1. This effect, not easily&#xD;
      concealed by the patient, is an important and annoying side effects that may interfere with&#xD;
      treatment adherence. This hyperbilirubinemia is concentration-dependent, with elevated&#xD;
      bilirubin most common grade 3-4, atazanavir C min is greater than 760 ng / ml (600 to 850 ng&#xD;
      / ml according to studies).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No boosted atazanavir may be used but with caution. Indeed, its use should be avoided in&#xD;
      patients with a history of failure or virological resistance mutations in a patient with poor&#xD;
      adherence and in patients taking other drugs that could interfere with atazanavir.&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic studies at a dose of 400 mg without ritonavir showed a concentration below&#xD;
      the expected minimum concentration of 150 mg / l in 60% of cases. In addition, the use of no&#xD;
      boosted atazanavir with tenofovir has been little studied and requires close monitoring&#xD;
      pharmacological given the interaction between these two molecules (decrease of approximately&#xD;
      25% of the concentration of atazanavir when without ritonavir in combination with tenofovir.&#xD;
      Finally, in the INDUMA study, there was no virologic rebounds in this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monotherapy atazanavir is not recommended in light of studies showing virological failures&#xD;
      under this strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of atazanavir / r 200/100 in healthy patient presented at CROI meeting in 2001&#xD;
      in Phase II studies showed a mean Cmin 378 ng / ml (SD = 286 EC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A retrospective cohort study in 14 Thai patients with virologic success in switched to&#xD;
      atazanavir / r 200/100 showed maintenance of a CV less than 50 copies / ml over a median&#xD;
      follow-up 68 weeks (range 12-165 weeks). Five of the patients had a dose of atazanavir Cmin&#xD;
      had greater than 150 ng / ml (mean Cmin = 572 ng / ml). The lipid profile was improved but&#xD;
      not significantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pharmacokinetic study of 22 Thai patients on atazanavir / r 300/100 in switched to&#xD;
      atazanavir / r 200/100 2 NRTIs showed minimum concentrations reduced by 48.6% remaining above&#xD;
      the minimum therapeutic concentration of 150 ng / ml (mean Cmin = 700 ng / ml EC = 470).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A case study conducted in 14 Italian patients (10 Caucasian and 4 of African origin) with&#xD;
      virologic suppression (CV below 50 copies / ml) with atazanavir / r 300/100 mg + 2 NRTI&#xD;
      showed a maintenance of viral efficacy after the switch to atazanavir / r 200/100 on a 1 year&#xD;
      average follow-up. Atazanavir C min was above Cmin for all except 2 patients (whose viral&#xD;
      load remained below 50 copies / ml), with a mean Cmin 713ng / ml. Bilirubin decreased after&#xD;
      the switch.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a pharmacokinetic simulation study was performed in a majority of Caucasian&#xD;
      patients for atazanavir / r doses at 300/50 mg, 200/50 mg and 200/100 mg. The lowest&#xD;
      concentrations of atazanavir after dose reduction 200/100 averaged 520 ng / ml (EC = 448) and&#xD;
      all remained above the recommended Cmin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, these four dose reduction studies of atazanavir / r 200/100 in&#xD;
      treatment-experienced patients with virologic average Cmin were between 520 and 713ng / ml,&#xD;
      well above the therapeutic Cmin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decrease in atazanavir dose showed a significant decrease of serum bilirubin 14.88μmol /&#xD;
      l after 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test is within the overall reflection optimization of antiretroviral therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the existing data of Pharmacology and few data Italian and Thai in switched&#xD;
      patients to atazanavir / r 200/100 mg, the ATALOW study hypothesizes that a lower dose of&#xD;
      atazanavir / r 200 / 100 mg is able to maintain an undetectable viral load in&#xD;
      treatment-experienced patients with virologic success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected benefits of the reduction in the dose of atazanavir / r 200/100 mg + would be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A better tolerance especially in terms of bilirubin&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A more robust strategy that using no boosted atazanavir with the possibility of using&#xD;
           tenofovir in combination NRTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The same simplicity taking once a day&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reduced costs (2,730 euros less per patient per year).&#xD;
