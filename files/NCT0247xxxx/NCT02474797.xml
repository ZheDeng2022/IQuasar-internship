      Diaphragmatic dysfunction is associated with sepsis severity and pejorative prognosis. Aim of&#xD;
      this study is to assess diaphragmatic function with the Diaphragmatic Thickening Fraction&#xD;
      (DTF) ultrasound measure in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, mechanically&#xD;
      ventilated or not, hospitalized in ICU in order to determinate diaphragmatic dysfunction&#xD;
      frequency, its prognosis value and its associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective pilot study in a 14-bed medical and surgical ICU including 50&#xD;
      consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. The expected duration of study is 18&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTF is measured each day as follow: the probe is placed in an intercostal space between mid&#xD;
      axillary line and anterior axillary line, 0.5cm to 2 centimeters below the costodiaphragmatic&#xD;
      sinus. DTF measure is performed in B-mode using the following formula: TF (%) =&#xD;
      [(end-inspiration thickness - end-expiration thickness)/(end-expiration thickness) x 100]. A&#xD;
      DTF &lt; 20% indicates a diaphragmatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect potential factors for which DTF Ultrasound Measure could have&#xD;
      a prognosis value (intubation, successful or failed weaning from mechanical ventilation),&#xD;
      potential risk factors (age, sex, tobacco, alcohol etc.) and potentials associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect measure of DTF allows identifying patient with severe sepsis or&#xD;
      septic shock with diaphragmatic dysfunction. It would also estimate diaphragmatic dysfunction&#xD;
      frequency with ultrasound measure and warranting its use routinely at the bedside. The&#xD;
      investigators expect that DTF helps to characterize degree of severity of septic patient and&#xD;
      can be a new index able to predict intubation in this population.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rational Severe sepsis and septic shock represent the first cause of death in ICU (42% to 60%&#xD;
      mortality rate). Sepsis is defined by alteration of cellular function, immune dysregulation,&#xD;
      coagulation and metabolism disorders, following the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome&#xD;
      (SIRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among different affected organs, skeletal muscle is highlighted. Proteolysis increasing,&#xD;
      proteosynthesis decreasing and mitochondrial dysfunction lead to an overall muscular cells&#xD;
      alteration (sarcolemma, sarcoplasmic reticulum and contractile proteins). These mechanisms&#xD;
      induce a reduction of skeletal muscle mass and skeletal muscle-specific force generation.&#xD;
      Diaphragm could be the first muscle affected during sepsis (1). Sepsis is the primary risk&#xD;
      factor for diaphragmatic dysfunction. Diaphragm could be considered as an organ altered by&#xD;
      sepsis (2). Diaphragmatic dysfunction is associated with sepsis severity and pejorative&#xD;
      prognosis. Its assessment becomes an important issue in order to evaluate the patient&#xD;
      severity status, to monitor diaphragm recovery and adjust treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One study evaluated diaphragmatic function with Magnetic Phrenic Nerve Stimulation in&#xD;
      mechanically ventilated patients (3) and one with Needle Electromyography of diaphragm in&#xD;
      patients with prolonged weaning from mechanical ventilation (4). But any study assessed&#xD;
      diaphragmatic function with ultrasound measure of Diaphragmatic Thickening Fraction in&#xD;
      patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, mechanically ventilated or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography is noninvasive, ionization free, feasible rapidly at the bedside and thus can&#xD;
      be regularly used in diaphragm assessment (5). The diaphragmatic thickening fraction (DTF) at&#xD;
      the zone of apposition (6) allows to assess thickening capacity of diaphragm during&#xD;
      inspiration so its contraction capacity. It is an accurate and reproducible outcome measure&#xD;
      for diaphragmatic dysfunction assessment. A DTF &lt; 20% indicates a diaphragmatic dysfunction&#xD;
      (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that acute diaphragmatic abnormalities are present in ICU septic patient and&#xD;
      it can be a prognosis factor of patient severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of this study is to assess diaphragmatic function with the DTF ultrasound measure in&#xD;
      patients with severe sepsis or septic shock, mechanically ventilated or not, hospitalized in&#xD;
      ICU in order to determinate diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency, its prognosis value and its&#xD;
      associated factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives Primary To estimate diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency with measure of Ultrasound&#xD;
      DTF in ICU septic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if DTF is a predictor of intubation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if DTF is a predictor of successful weaning from mechanical ventilation in&#xD;
           subgroup of mechanically ventilated patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To monitor changes of DTF during ICU hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine risk factors of diaphragmatic dysfunction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine associated factors of diaphragmatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Design This is a prospective study in a 14-bed medical and surgical ICU including 50&#xD;
      consecutive patients with severe sepsis or septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collections Demographic data, antecedents, severity score, organ dysfunction-related&#xD;
      variables, physiologic data, presence of sepsis, presence of mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      medications will be prospectively recorded on inclusion (ICU admission for severe&#xD;
      sepsis/septic shock or severe sepsis/septic shock occurring during ICU hospitalization).&#xD;
      Ultrasound DTF, severity score, organ dysfunction-related variables, physiologic data,&#xD;
      presence of septic shock, medications, presence of mechanical ventilation will be&#xD;
      prospectively recorded each days of ICU hospitalization. Duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      number of failed extubation, decision to perform tracheostomy, ICU and Hospital stay, ICU and&#xD;
      Hospital mortality will be also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Patients will be recruited in a 14-bed medical and surgical ICU when they present&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients or their relatives will provide written consent to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diaphragm thickening assessment All patients will be evaluated in a semi-recumbent position.&#xD;
      Ultrasound will be performed using an ultrasound system equipped with a 10 megahertz linear&#xD;
      probe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Measure of Diaphragmatic Thickening Fraction (DTF) will be performed by a trained&#xD;
      physiotherapist. Physiotherapist (A. LE NEINDRE) was trained during six months for this&#xD;
      measure by a well-trained Physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTF is measured each day as follow (7): the probe is placed in an intercostal space between&#xD;
      mid axillary line and anterior axillary line, 0.5cm to 2 centimeters below the&#xD;
      costodiaphragmatic sinus. With B-mode the diaphragm is observed like a structure made of&#xD;
      three distinct layers: a nonechogenic central layer bordered by two echogenic layers: pleural&#xD;
      line (internal layer) and peritoneum (external layer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be then instructed to perform breathing to total lung capacity and then to&#xD;
      exhale to residual volume, when it is possible (awake patient). Awakening status will be&#xD;
      recorded. Mechanically ventilated patients will be evaluated in Pressure Support (PS) mode&#xD;
      (during daily PS mode research for patients with Controlled Ventilation), with the lower PS&#xD;
      level tolerated. PS level will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTF measure is performed in B-mode using the following formula: TF (%) = [(end-inspiration&#xD;
      thickness - end-expiration thickness)/(end-expiration thickness) x 100]. Three consecutive&#xD;
      measures will be performed. Video files will be recorded and DTF will be estimated&#xD;
      independently by a second trained operator (Dr F. PHILIPPART), unaware of patient conditions.&#xD;
      The better value of these three measures will be retained. Diaphragmatic dysfunction is&#xD;
      defined like a DTF &lt; 20% (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of DTF reproducibility Twenty recordings (from twenty separate patients) will be&#xD;
      randomly selected from the study to assess analyzer reproducibility. The same sets of&#xD;
      recording will be analyzed twice by the same Ultrasound Performer (A. LE NEINDRE) to assess&#xD;
      intra-analyzer reproducibility and separately by two different Ultrasound Performers (A. LE&#xD;
      NEINDRE and F. PHILIPPART) to assess inter-analyzer reproducibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency is defined by proportion of patient&#xD;
      with DTF&lt;20%. It will be expressed as a percentage with 95% Confidence Interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis will be performed to assess DTF&#xD;
      ability to discriminate between patients who will be intubated and those who will be not. ROC&#xD;
      curve analysis will be also used to discriminate mechanically ventilated patients who will&#xD;
      fail to wean and those who will success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DTF will be analyzed as a continuous variable and univariate linear regression models will be&#xD;
      used to identify factors associated with higher or lower DTF values. Multivariate analysis&#xD;
      will be performed using a forward logistic regression process taking into account all&#xD;
      potential associated factors for diaphragm dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each potential risk factor for diaphragm dysfunction (DTF &lt; 20%) will be evaluated in a&#xD;
      univariate model (Student t or Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables depending on&#xD;
      distribution; chi-square test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables depending on&#xD;
      size), and multivariate analysis will be performed. For all comparisons, a P value less than&#xD;
      or equal to 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Diaphragmatic dysfunction on ICU and hospital mortalities, institution of&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, failed weaning form mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy rate will be&#xD;
      assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of Diaphragmatic dysfunction on ICU and hospital mortalities will be evaluated using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier survival function estimates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results We expect measure of DTF allows identifying patient with severe sepsis or&#xD;
      septic shock with diaphragmatic dysfunction. It would also estimate diaphragmatic dysfunction&#xD;
      frequency with ultrasound measure and warranting its use routinely at the bedside. We expect&#xD;
      that DTF helps to characterize degree of severity of septic patient and can be a new index&#xD;
      able to predict intubation in this population. As previous studies showed in other&#xD;
      populations, DTF could predict success of extubation in mechanically ventilated septic&#xD;
      population. It would be another tool to monitor evolution of organ failure. A second study&#xD;
      will be conduct in order to evaluate a new strategy to manage septic patient at risk of&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction (Inspiratory Muscle Training) and the use of DTF as a predictive&#xD;
      index of intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Organization of the project Number of Participants This is a pilot study aiming to establish&#xD;
      diaphragmatic dysfunction frequency, prognosis and associated factors in patients with severe&#xD;
      sepsis or septic shock. We wish a 18 months maximal duration of study. Considering the&#xD;
      recruiting capacity of our ICU and our previous studies for this population we will include&#xD;
      50 consecutive patients.&#xD;
