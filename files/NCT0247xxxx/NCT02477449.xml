      Phase 1 study to investigate safety of istaroxime in healthy chinese volunteers.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      32 subjects (F: M=1:1) were randomized in three dose groups (0.25-0.5-1.0ug/kg/min). 8&#xD;
      subjects in 0.25ug/kg/min group were administrated Istaroxime + 0.9% NS; 12 subjects in&#xD;
      0.5ug/kg/min or 1.0 ug/kg/min group randomly received Istaroxime placebo + 0.9% NS (2&#xD;
      subjects), 0.9% NS alone (2 subjects) and Istaroxime + 0.9% NS (8 subjects). All the subjects&#xD;
      were given infusion of study drugs for 24 hours, and then were observed for 48 hours in the&#xD;
      clinic. At least 1 week should be kept between two dose groups. Escalation to the higher dose&#xD;
      will occur after the lower dose group has been completed and no significant safety issues are&#xD;
      found.&#xD;
