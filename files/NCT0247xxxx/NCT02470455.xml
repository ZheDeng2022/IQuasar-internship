      Diabetes is a growing public health problem throughout the world, threatening global health&#xD;
      and economic prosperity. Currently, approximately 171 to 194 million people in the world have&#xD;
      diabetes, the majority of the cases being Type II. This number is expected to increase to&#xD;
      more than 330 million by the year 2025-a record doubling within a single generation. India&#xD;
      with 62.2 million diabetic patients is fast becoming the diabetes capital of the world with&#xD;
      possibility of the number of diabetic patients reaching the 80 million mark by 2030. Every&#xD;
      sixth diabetic in the world is an Indian. China with 43.2 million patients comes second,&#xD;
      followed by the US where 26.8 million people suffer from the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This spectacular increase in the frequency of Type II diabetes is being paralleled by a&#xD;
      similarly alarming increase in obesity, which is one of the major risk factors for Type II&#xD;
      diabetes. Because of the close linkage of these two conditions, Ziv and Shafrir have&#xD;
      suggested the term &quot;diabesity&quot; to describe this association. This dual epidemic which was&#xD;
      largely ignored by the public health community until recently has come as a great surprise&#xD;
      involving enormous economic burden as well as in terms of health. Disorders of glucose&#xD;
      metabolism are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) complications,&#xD;
      including coronary, peripheral and cerebral arterial disease, that account for the majority&#xD;
      of morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes mellitus (DM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type II diabetes is commonly associated with dyslipidaemia, which represents a synergistic&#xD;
      risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult&#xD;
      Treatment Panel III (ATP III) listed diabetes as a coronary heart disease (CHD) risk&#xD;
      equivalent for setting therapeutic goals for LDL cholesterol. A goal for LDL cholesterol of&#xD;
      &lt;100 mg/dl was recommended for patients with CHD and CHD risk equivalents. For the majority&#xD;
      of patients with diabetes, this LDL cholesterol goal would evoke the use of&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering drugs, particularly statins. Some Interventional studies emphasized that&#xD;
      statin treatment leads to a reduction in cardiovascular events independent of lipid reduction&#xD;
      with possible benefits for patients with Type II diabetes. Statins could also contribute to&#xD;
      diabetes prevention owing to lipid-lowering and so-called pleiotropic action. Statins improve&#xD;
      endothelial function, inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, and reduce oxidative stress&#xD;
      and inflammation. Thus, with recent FDA approved indications for statins being widened,&#xD;
      statins are currently amongst the most widely used drugs in patients with or without&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although statin therapy reduces cardiovascular risk, its relationship with the development of&#xD;
      diabetes is controversial. Retrospective analysis of the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention&#xD;
      Study (WOSCOPS) revealed that 5 years of treatment with pravastatin reduced diabetes&#xD;
      incidence by 30%. The authors suggested that although lowering of triglyceride levels could&#xD;
      influence diabetes incidence, other mechanisms such as anti-inflammatory action may be&#xD;
      involved. On the contrary, pravastatin did not decrease diabetes incidence in another trial&#xD;
      including glucose-intolerant humans, suggesting that early inception of statin therapy may be&#xD;
      required for effective diabetes prevention. Likewise, simvastatin did not affect diabetes&#xD;
      incidence in patients with atherosclerosis in the Heart Protection Study. In contrast,&#xD;
      atorvastatin marginally increased diabetes incidence in the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac&#xD;
      Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-LLA), which could be explained by statistical variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent review of 13 studies by Naveed Sattar, et al. published in The Lancet in 2010, on&#xD;
      statins and their side-effects including a total of more than 91,140 participants suggested&#xD;
      that use of statins is associated with increased risk of Type II diabetes by 9%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However researchers of this meta-analysis have stressed that this study does not prove that&#xD;
      statins directly raise the risk of Type II diabetes, but it raises the possibility of either&#xD;
      a direct or indirect link between statins and diabetes that merits further investigation.&#xD;
      Thus, exploring the role of statins in the initiation or progression of diabetes mellitus is&#xD;
      an exciting area for investigation.&#xD;
