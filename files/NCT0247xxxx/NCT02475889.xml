  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown that RFA induced systemic tumor antigen-specific T cell responses in human&#xD;
      carcinoma. However, there are insufficient studies on the immune modulation of tumor&#xD;
      microenviroment (TME) outside of the ablation zone. In order to study how RFA modifies TME in&#xD;
      human cancer patients, investigators performed a retrospective study of a unique cohort of&#xD;
      patients who suffered from synchronous CRCLM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is widely used as a local treatment for tumors such as small&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinomas, renal cancer and solitary colorectal cancer liver metastases&#xD;
      (CRCLM). RFA induces localized coagulation necrosis and leads to the release of large amounts&#xD;
      of cellular debris in situ, which can serve as a source of tumor antigens to elicit host&#xD;
      adaptive immune responses against tumors. Several studies on preclinical animal models have&#xD;
      shown that localized tumor ablation by RFA can induce systemic T-cell mediated antitumor&#xD;
      immunity. Antigen-specific T cell immune responses were also observed in patients with&#xD;
      hepatic tumors after RFA therapy. However, the RFA-induced immune responses are not&#xD;
      sufficient to prevent tumor recurrence. The underlying mechanisms remain obscure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), an important immune checkpoint molecule, is often&#xD;
      up-regulated on tumor cells and tumor associated myeloid cells. It impairs T cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune responses upon engagement with its cognate co-inhibitory receptor PD-1, which is&#xD;
      always highly expressed on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression can be induced by&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, especially type I interferon (IFN), as an important self-limiting&#xD;
      mechanism to prevent rampant autoimmunity. Recent studies show that PD-L1 expression on tumor&#xD;
      cells is associated with T cell infiltration, suggesting PD-L1 is actively involved in&#xD;
      suppressing antitumor immune responses in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Whether the&#xD;
      PD-L1/PD1 axis is involved in modulating the antitumor T cell immune responses induced by RFA&#xD;
      is unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this investigation was to study the RFA-induced immune responses in tumor&#xD;
      tissues from cancer patients.&#xD;

        A total of 391 consecutive patients with synchronous colorectal cancer liver metastases&#xD;
        were initially included in this study. Among of them, 38 patients who received initial&#xD;
        hepatic RFA followed by primary tumor resection were identified as RFA group, and the other&#xD;
        40 patients who received initial primary tumor resection were identified as Non-RFA group.&#xD;
