    <textblock>
      A clinical trial is planned to study the effects of cannabis on dystonia and spasticity in&#xD;
      children with neurological diseases. The clinical trial will include 40 children divided into&#xD;
      two groups: children with spasticity and dystonia due to cerebral palsy, and children with&#xD;
      spasticity and dystonia due to genetic neurodegenerative diseases. Each group will be&#xD;
      randomly divided into two arms and will receive Avidekel cannabis oil 6-to-1 ratio of CBD to&#xD;
      THC or enriched Avidekel cannabis oil 20-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC. During the study, various&#xD;
      variables will be collected including: medication intake, spasticity, dystonia score, pain&#xD;
      scale, restlessness scale, quality of life measures, safety tests, side effects, and an&#xD;
      addiction test. The investigators hypothesize that cannabis consumption will reduce dystonia&#xD;
      and spasticity in children with motor disability related to genetic neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases and cerebral palsy and as a result improve motor function, non-motor functions and&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of two cannabis oils containing the main&#xD;
      cannabinoid Δ9 -THC and CBD ratio of 1 to 6 and 1 to 20 (respectively), on spastic movement&#xD;
      disorder and dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 children will be enrolled in this study and will be divided into 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children with spasticity and dystonia due to cerebral palsy&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Children with spasticity and dystonia due to genetic neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each group will be randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Active comparator: 6-to-1 ratio of CBD to THC oil II. Active comparator: 20-to-1 ratio of&#xD;
      CBD to THC oil&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study the following variables will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Consumption of drugs \ medication intake&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Spasticity grade measured using the Modified Ashworth Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dystonia grade measured using the Barry Albright Dystonia Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's subjective report about the severity of his/her spasticity and/or dystonia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Restlessness scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life measures: function, sleep, mood , appetite , weight&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety tests: liver function, renal function, blood tests (complete blood chemistry),&#xD;
           blood pressure, pulse, ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Addiction test&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficiency - examining the effect of cannabis on dystonia and spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Examining the most effective cannabinoid ratio for the relief of dystonia and&#xD;
           spasticity. (Δ9 -THC and CBD ratio of 1 to 6 or 1 to 20, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Examining the effect of cannabis on quality of life measures (such as medication intake,&#xD;
           mood, appetite, sleep).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Safety: examination of side effects and unwanted effects of cannabis and its&#xD;
           limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that cannabis consumption will reduce&#xD;
      dystonia and spasticity symptoms in children with motor disability related to genetic&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases and cerebral palsy and as a result improves motor function,&#xD;
      non-motor function and quality of life.&#xD;
