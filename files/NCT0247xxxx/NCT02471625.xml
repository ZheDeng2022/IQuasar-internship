    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether data made by the ClearView System&#xD;
      can be used to detect whether someone has a traumatic brain injury and how severe the injury&#xD;
      is.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of death and disability in the U.S. The&#xD;
      severity of a TBI may range from &quot;mild&quot; (i.e. a brief change in mental status or&#xD;
      consciousness) to &quot;severe&quot; (i.e. an extended period of unconsciousness or memory loss after&#xD;
      the injury). However, most TBI's that occur each year are mild and are commonly called&#xD;
      concussions. Unfortunately, TBI terminology does not adequately describe the injury or&#xD;
      impairment, its treatment, or the resulting outcomes. Due to the complexity of the human&#xD;
      brain, each person's physiology can result in different patterns of impairment and secondary&#xD;
      conditions, requiring different treatment or rehabilitation. The intent of EPIC ClearView™&#xD;
      TBI Feasibility (EPIC-011) is to collect data to further develop the ClearView™ Response&#xD;
      Scale to measure electrophysiology associated with TBI&#xD;

    <description>The EPIC ClearView software produces a Response Scale report that summaries the electrophysiological measurements associated with organ systems. The autonomic numbers indicate how the person's stress response is affecting different body systems and the physical numbers reflect physiological function. These measurements will then be compared to TBI diagnosis, based on one or two possible scans</description>
